<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="201">A: Well the routine obviously was we go to school every day. </sentence><sentence id="202">Until the age of 10, we went to the Jewish school, Jewish elementary school, where we learned both the secular subjects and the basic parts of the Jewish service, including the translation of the five books of Moses and things like that. </sentence><sentence id="203">So w-we had a systematic education in learning classical Hebrew. </sentence><sentence id="204">Then, at the age of 10, since our parents were well enough to do to -- they could send us to high school, we shifted over to the high school. </sentence><sentence id="205">Now, th -- the routine at home was that we'd all be in school until about one o'clock and then came home and had the -- the main meal of the day. </sentence><sentence id="206">In the afternoon we were supposed to do our homework. </sentence><sentence id="207">Had some sort of other activities, we were essentially free. </sentence><sentence id="208">And the -- the -- yeah, the up -- of c-course it's -- is a -- home was essentially Orthodox. </sentence><sentence id="209">Not -- we wouldn't call this strictly Orthodox, call it like the modern Orthodox in the United States now here. </sentence><sentence id="210">And Friday evenings we would go to the service. </sentence><sentence id="211">After the service there would be a very festive meal. </sentence><sentence id="212">My -- my father would be home most of the time on s -- on Friday -- on the weekends. </sentence><sentence id="213">Saturday morning we would go to synagogue again. </sentence><sentence id="214">The synagogue would finish at about half past 10, 11 o'clock. </sentence><sentence id="215">We then would go home and have a very festive breakfast, and after that we were obligated to go and visit our grandmother, my father's mother, who was living in town. </sentence><sentence id="216">And at that time she was beginning to be about 75 - 80 years old. </sentence><sentence id="217">And we had to visit her every Saturday. </sentence><sentence id="218">And after that we'd go back to synagogue for the afternoon service, a -- which was at about one o'clock, and about two o'clock was the main meal, and in the evening at the end of the -- of the holiday, or Saturday, we would again go to synagogue and participated what's called the Havdalah service. </sentence><sentence id="219">So, it was a -- a life that revol-revolved largely around the Jewish religion. </sentence><sentence id="220">On Sunday we had to go to Sunday school, which was strictly devoted to Hebrew and Jewish history. </sentence><sentence id="221">The Jewish elementary school was a one room school with eight grades in it. </sentence><sentence id="222">Of course, we who -- whose parents were well off and could afford to send us to the high school only stayed in it for four years. </sentence><sentence id="223">But there were people -- Jewish kids in the school who -- whose parents could not afford to send them to high school, and who did all the eight grades in the -- in the one room school, this was a one room school. </sentence><sentence id="224">Which was very interesting because it -- it almost was like self education. </sentence><sentence id="225">There was only one teacher, and h-he would attend to all -- to everybody, set tasks for everybody. </sentence><sentence id="226">But when he taught history, or when he taught something to somebody else, of course you could always listen in. </sentence><sentence id="227">And I think [indecipherable] that was very, very good for our development. </sentence><sentence id="228">That's in my -- in my days, the name of that first teacher we had, his name was Gunsberg, and he became an outstanding person in the [indecipherable] s-service, or [indecipherable] organization in Israel, when he finally em- emigrated to Israel, some time before World War Two. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="259">Q: When you started the high school, tell me what age you were when you started the high school, and were your friends at the high school only Jewish, or did you have also non-Jewish friends? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="261">A: We started high school at the age of te -- 10. </sentence><sentence id="262">Before the Hitler period, we mixed fairly freely. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="263">Not hundred percent te -- hundred percent freely, but fairly freely with everybody. </sentence><sentence id="264">And there was not much of a distinction made between Jews and -- and non-Jews, and you could communicate very easily with everybody else. </sentence><sentence id="265">In my case, of course, this only lasted for one year. </sentence><sentence id="266">And then in 1933, when I was 11 years old, Hitler came to power. </sentence><sentence id="267">But in the case of my older brother, this state of affairs had much -- lasted much longer. </sentence><sentence id="268">My cousin -- my oldest cousin, who was of -- the oldest amongst all of us who was at that time, he must have been already about 16 or 17, he had gone through that whole school, and of course had been totally integrated into the class in which he was. </sentence><sentence id="269">So th-tha -- there wa -- there was not much -- there was not much distinction made, but there -- there -- there was -- always was a certain amount of anti-Semitism. </sentence><sentence id="270">And the really wealthy families in town, non-Jewish wealthy families did not mix with Jews, basically. </sentence><sentence id="271">So there were certain -- </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="272">Q: Did you remember feeling anti-Semitism in school before -- before Hitler came to power? </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="273">A: Oh yes, yes, oh yes. </sentence><sentence id="274">First of all, it was already 1932, the Nazi movement was already very active, and certain -- let's say parents of certain -- of children have -- were already very active Nazis. </sentence><sentence id="275">And they already came out with some objections to Jews. </sentence><sentence id="276">It didn't -- it wasn't very serious, and we didn't take it very serious, and we also had -- always had already answers to everything. </sentence><sentence id="277">We always fought back. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="284">Q: What would you say? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="286">A: Well, some of the [indecipherable] I remember somebody say to him -- said to me, you Goddamn Jew, you have a bend in your nose, you know, Jewish nose? </sentence><sentence id="287">And I said better -- I said it's much better than having a bird in your brain like you do. </sentence><sentence id="288">I said -- that's the German expression for -- for being a nut, is to have, you know -- so -- but it -- it more or less stopped there. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="292">Q: Did you ever feel, you know, physically harassed, or -- </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="293">A: Well now, are you talking about f -- before Hitler, or after Hitler? </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="294">Q: First before. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="296">A: Before Hitler, I don't -- I don't think -- I personally had no encounters of physical harassment. </sentence><sentence id="297">Maybe it was just lucky, but I -- I don't think it was very common to have physical harassment before Hitler. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="300">Q: Would you say -- can you tell me how large the overall town was, how many people lived there, and was it -- would you say it was pretty good relations in general between the Jewish community and non-Jews? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="302">A: The town had 8,000 in habitants, and as I said before, there were about 25 Jewish families in it. </sentence><sentence id="303">The relationships were, I think, pretty good. </sentence><sentence id="304">There were, of course, very Jewish businesses, and there were certain people who were anti-Semitic, who were just avoided. </sentence><sentence id="305">You just didn't con-contact them. </sentence><sentence id="306">Of course, the -- the point of our town with 8,000 inhabitants is that everybody knows everybody. </sentence><sentence id="307">You couldn't hide. </sentence><sentence id="308">But by and large, I think it was a pretty peaceful life. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="316">Q: Now before we get to the time when Hitler comes to power, can you give me just a very brief snapshot, the personalities of your family members; your mom, your -- your father, and your siblings. </sentence><sentence id="317">Just give me a sense of, you know, who they -- who they are, and -- and their personalities. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="330">A: My mother, of course, had a hard job educating three sons, and no daughter. </sentence><sentence id="331">And she was -- could be quite volatile at times, and put on quite some scenes when we wouldn't go along with what she preached. </sentence><sentence id="332">And w-we could at times form a united front against her, and she would complain like hell to my father, who w-would get very upset about it, when he heard about it. </sentence><sentence id="333">But -- and I don't want to underestimate the fact that, of course, my mother was in the afternoon in -- in my father's business, and we were somewhat educated by the maids we had in the house, too. </sentence><sentence id="334">We had two maids, as I said before, and we had other se-servants, and that had some sort -- quite a bit of influence on us, too. </sentence><sentence id="335">Which I suppose is the usual experience of people who have grown up in -- in we-wealthy homes where there were servants. </sentence><sentence id="336">My older brother was -- he was very much the intellectual. </sentence><sentence id="337">He we -- he -- he was what you called a bookworm. </sentence><sentence id="338">And he -- he loved reading, and it came -- came -- c-came in very handy later on. </sentence><sentence id="339">I can go into the fine details afterwards. </sentence><sentence id="340">And my younger brother, he was outstandingly good looking. </sentence><sentence id="341">So -- and my mother always said that I'm -- I was her only s -- d-daughter. </sentence><sentence id="342">I had to learn all the practical skills. </sentence><sentence id="343">I had to do all the stuff in the kitchen, helping and so on, so forth. </sentence><sentence id="344">My -- my older brother was shielded from that -- he was quite awkward, too, that's because he was so bookish. </sentence><sentence id="345">My younger brother, of course, was spoiled like hell because he was so good looking, and so I had to have all the practical skills to -- to help everybody. </sentence><sentence id="346">So those -- those were the personalities, and they somewhat remained that way all our lives, too. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="367">A: Well, of course it wasn't a -- it was not unexpected. </sentence><sentence id="368">There had been so many elections, and every election Germany was going further and further to the right. </sentence><sentence id="369">More and more people were voting for Hitler, or voting for the right wing parties, some of which were eventually merged into the Nazi party. </sentence><sentence id="370">Another thing, another point I have to point out why all this was not so unexpected. </sentence><sentence id="371">When we visited my grandparents in Falksen near Hannover, they lived in -- ina town that was largely Protestant. </sentence><sentence id="372">And that town was very radically in with the Nazi before Hitler. </sentence><sentence id="373">So already in -- before Hitler, before 1933, when we went visiting there, there were a lot of kids who didn't play with us because we were Jews. </sentence><sentence id="374">And they were already converted. </sentence><sentence id="375">So it's a -- a -- th-they -- this is where the indic -- these were the indications of things changing. </sentence><sentence id="376">This a -- well, I never forget the day Hitler came to power. </sentence><sentence id="377">We were having lunch, and we were listening to the radio, which was on because we listened to the one o'clock news. </sentence><sentence id="378">And the newscast came out, and then suddenly the announcer said, "And here is a little message, which has just fallen on my desk, the president of Germany, Hindenburg, has appointed Adolf Hitler as the chancellor of -- as the next chancellor of the German state." </sentence><sentence id="379">And I remember my mother was very, very shocked to hear this, and somehow we took it and said -- said well, that wa -- this was just one of the things we had to face. </sentence><sentence id="380">The full implication of it, well I suppose we didn't ful -- fully realize -- at the time the kids didn't, but my mother obviously did. </sentence><sentence id="381">My father was not home. </sentence><sentence id="382">I can't remember whether he came home that night. </sentence><sentence id="383">But soon -- he certainly came home very soon after. </sentence><sentence id="384">Now -- things changed in school now very -- I would say very rapidly. </sentence><sentence id="385">There -- some of the cra - - o -- some of our classmates were keen to join the Hitler youth. </sentence><sentence id="386">There was no Hitler youth in our town, and every time they had a demonstration, they had to call out the high school, which included us, for all their -- their demonstration, and whatever they were celebrating at the time. </sentence><sentence id="387">Eventually my father got us out of there, we didn't have to attend those blasted ca -- wh-what -- what do they call it? </sentence><sentence id="388">It's called in German [indecipherable]. </sentence><sentence id="389">Had the torchlight parades and all that sort of things. </sentence><sentence id="390">We didn't have to go -- go along with that any more, but in the beginning we did, because the school just said everybody come tonight, there" ll be a torchlight parade to celebrate this, that, and the other. </sentence><sentence id="391">And so we had to go. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="418">Q: Now did you always feel and know that you were against this, even though you had to be there? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="420">A: Oh yeah, definitely, we had absolutely no identity cris -- crisis. </sentence><sentence id="421">That, I think is the advantage of having grown up as a -- as an Orthodox Jew. </sentence><sentence id="422">My father's father had come from Holland to marry my -- marry my grandmother. </sentence><sentence id="423">And he had grown up with the Sephardic Jews in Holland, though he was not Sephardic himself. </sentence><sentence id="424">In fact they were from the part of Holland that borders on Germany. </sentence><sentence id="425">And -- but he -- he was -- he was very much aware of the Sephardic experience. </sentence><sentence id="426">And every time the word Spain was used, he spit. </sentence><sentence id="427">I didn't know him personally any more. </sentence><sentence id="428">He -- he died in 1917. </sentence><sentence id="429">He had a hernia [indecipherable] there was misop -- mis-operation, unfortunately. </sentence><sentence id="430">And -- but h -- so we were very, very much aware of the fact that expulsion, flight, and all that sort of things was part of the Jewish tradition. </sentence><sentence id="431">And there were two Jewish families living in town, who had come from either Poland or Russia, and who had been exposed to this whole business of pogroms, and -- and ma -- Jewish persecution in the east. </sentence><sentence id="432">So again, everybody was Orthodox, so just was part again -- was accepted as being part and parcel of one's history. </sentence><sentence id="433">We had absolutely no identity crisis when all this came. </sentence><sentence id="434">People find that hard to believe, particularly 1 -- of course, later on in life, I came across a lot of Jews, who f -- German Jews, who were not brought up Orthodox, who had all sorts of clashes, including the -- the people who -- when someone was in the army, and people [indecipherable] working professionally, and who had -- who -- who were -- whose -- had terrific identity crisis of -- of -- wh-when hi -- Hitler came to power, and when they were excluded from the social life which they had practiced up to that time. </sentence><sentence id="435">But as I said -- of course, the other point was we couldn't socialize that well with other pe - - with non-Jews, even before Hitler, because we were kosher, and we couldn't eat in their homes. </sentence><sentence id="436">And so it was -- it would be very rare if any of them would come to our homes, and eat with us. </sentence><sentence id="437">As one of my schoolmates told me back in -- in the 1988 -- 1992, when I went back to -- to the ha -- we first went back to our hometown, this -- we -- homes were not that comfortable in those days, and we all were friends because we played on the street. </sentence><sentence id="438">So the -- the intimacy that one now can experience in being in each other's home, we had -- we did not have that in any case. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="459">Q: So did you start to experience more restrictions at school? </sentence><sentence id="460">And also who -- tell me a little bit about the composition of -- of the student body at school. </sentence><sentence id="461">I think you s-said in your memoirs mostly Catholic, but tell me a little bit about that. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="465">A: Yeah. </sentence><sentence id="466">The -- of course the town was largely Catholic, and most of our classmates before Hitler belon -- belonged to a Catholic youth movement. </sentence><sentence id="467">That was the standard thing to do, for everybody to belong to the Catholic youth movement. </sentence><sentence id="468">That of course we -- we were already automatically excluded. </sentence><sentence id="469">We did not, at that time, have a Jewish youth movement to which we belonged, but we did later on. </sentence><sentence id="470">Now, all these -- of course, now the pressure became very strong on all these members of the Catholic youth movement to change over to the Hitler youth, and most of them did, eventually. </sentence><sentence id="471">It took a little while for everybody to go along that line, but this is - - this is where they went, eventually. </sentence><sentence id="472">And our attitude to them was you are wrong and we are right. </sentence><sentence id="473">Well, it's a -- things came to a head on the first of April, 1933. </sentence><sentence id="474">Now, this was only what, three months after Hitler came to power? </sentence><sentence id="475">He come to power on the 13" of January, 1933. </sentence><sentence id="476">The -- they started this boycott movement against Jewish businesses. </sentence><sentence id="477">And it was a Saturday, and there were storm troopers in front of every Jewish business to make sure that people wouldn't buy at -- in Jewish shops. </sentence><sentence id="478">And w-we of course had to go to school on Saturday, we didn't write, we didn't ca-carry our satchel because we were Orthodox, but we had to go to school and listen to the school classes. </sentence><sentence id="479">And while we were in school, the -- one of the teachers -- of the most trusted teachers, [indecipherable] was trusted most, came and called us out, and he said -- he said to us, I remember there were four Jewish boys in my grade, "Look, you know what's happening to you. </sentence><sentence id="480">I think it'd be safer for you to go home now." </sentence><sentence id="481">So, when we went home, and well, you know, this -- this was the dramatic, the most dramatic change you can imagine. </sentence><sentence id="482">Course our parents were -- I won't say shocked, but they were stunned. </sentence><sentence id="483">And my father wasn't going to take it. </sentence><sentence id="484">So he immediately [indecipherable] the Shabbat was out, he got on the telephone to the headmaster of the school, and he says, "Hey, what's happening? </sentence><sentence id="485">I'm not going to send my children back to the school if you can't guarantee their safety." </sentence><sentence id="486">I am convinced that that headmaster then had to contact all the necessary party lines. </sentence><sentence id="487">I don't think there was a Gestapo in this town yet, at that time. </sentence><sentence id="488">I was very much aware of the Gestapo when it finally came, because of course, they -- they -- later on, at the outbreak of World War Two, they took over our house as Gestapo headquarters. </sentence><sentence id="489">But I'm sure he -- he couldn't give my father a direct answer, he had to square this away with all the authorities. </sentence><sentence id="490">Anyhow, by Monday morning he told my father that all the Jewish students could come back to the high school, and they could guarantee their -- our safety. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="533">Q: Okay, if you want to continue telling me recollections of -- of this early period when the Nazis came. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="535">A: So that was April first, and the next lightning bolt struck on May first. </sentence><sentence id="536">Of course May first is always celebrated in -- in Europe by all labor unions and people who have anything to do with labor, you know, which the Nazis thought they were -- were too. </sentence><sentence id="537">This was a big celebration. </sentence><sentence id="538">And of course there again, we had to have a -- a parade, and again, since there was no Hitler youth, so we -- we ha-had to collec -- come together again. </sentence><sentence id="539">There wasn't a big demonstration, but we suddenly -- one of the teachers came out with a swastika emblem, which showed that he'd been - - been a member of the Nazi party for quite awhile. </sentence><sentence id="540">I don't know whether it was true. </sentence><sentence id="541">There's a long history attached to this character. </sentence><sentence id="542">He was a dis -- teacher of mathematics, bio -- and particularly of biology, and he eventually was charged with teaching the signs of a racist, a subject -- new subject, which the -- the Nazis had thought out. </sentence><sentence id="543">Anyhow, on May first it turned out, he -- he came out with a swastika emblem on his coat, which showed that he had been a long time member of the Nazi party. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="553">Q: And you -- you witnessed this yourself, this was -- </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="554">A: Yes, yes, yes. </sentence><sentence id="555">I have a long history with this man, who of course now, by now he's dead. </sentence><sentence id="556">But he was an invalid. </sentence><sentence id="557">I can't remember from what any more, but he -- he -- he walked av -- one of </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="562"> his legs wasn't functioning properly, so he was never called into the war, he stayed in the town through the whole war period, and as I said, I had quite a history with this character. </sentence><sentence id="563">Anyhow, now m-my older brother, who decided that we should not communicate with our classmates any more. </sentence><sentence id="564">We -- we shouldn't wait. </sentence><sentence id="565">He was -- my older brother was the sort of leader of the Jewish kids. </sentence><sentence id="566">My cousin, who as I said, who was about at that time was 16 - 17 years old. </sentence><sentence id="567">When he died last year he -- in New York. </sentence><sentence id="568">He was -- he -- he wasn't in school any more, anyhow, so my older brother became the leader of the Jewish children, and he decided that we're not going to wait until we're excluded, we're going to separate ourselves. </sentence><sentence id="569">So from that time on was -- we did not communicate with our schoolmates any more in -- in the -- in the a -- in the periods between lessons. </sentence><sentence id="570">Well -- we -- communication was absolutely at a -- at a minimum. </sentence><sentence id="571">You know, without any degree of intimacy between them and us. </sentence><sentence id="572">So, and this how I went to school for five years. </sentence><sentence id="573">My older brother, who left in 1935, who -- which was three years later, and went to, at that time, Palestine, Israel. </sentence><sentence id="574">And so he was out, and so other Jewish children were taken out of school and sent abroad, or didn't continue high school. </sentence><sentence id="575">Emigrated and gone [indecipherable]. </sentence><sentence id="576">So eventually, by the time -- by the time I left, there -- there were only very few Jews -- Jewish children left in the school, in the high school. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="592">Q: Did you feel -- what about the Nuremberg laws? </sentence><sentence id="593">Did you and your family feel repercussions also? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="596">A: Yeah, the Nuremberg laws as far as we were concerned meant that we couldn't have any non- Jewish maids any more. </sentence><sentence id="597">We then managed to get some maids whose nationality -- we-were Dutch by nationality, you know, it's in a -- in a fr-frontier area like that wasn't that difficult to find. </sentence><sentence id="598">But that was the na -- the major effect it had -- had on us. </sentence><sentence id="599">I am not aware of any other of these, you know, manifestation of the Nuremberg laws. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="604">Q: What about your father's business? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="606">A: My father reduced his business considerably, and he started -- he -- he concentrated all his efforts on getting cash out of Germany. </sentence><sentence id="607">And he set up a new business which sold vacuum cleaners, and irons, and you know, for -- for pressing clothing, things of that nature, because he saw a chance to do business of that nature, to get a lot of his money out of Germany, which of course, was illegal. </sentence><sentence id="608">There were schemes of that nature. </sentence><sentence id="609">I know my uncles had had schemes of that nature. </sentence><sentence id="610">My father's brothers who were -- all of them were doing very well financially. </sentence><sentence id="611">And - - and including my father's best friend, who became my father-in-law later on, he too had a scheme of this nature, and this is how people who had money managed to get some of their possessions out of the country, some of their cash out of the country. </sentence><sentence id="612">It's -- it's a complicated way of doing it. </sentence><sentence id="613">Might be interesting to investigate it some time, but I think it goes too far to talk about it in great detail here. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="622">Q: Do you -- do you know at least where, in general, he was sending the money? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="624">A: Yeah, to -- largely to Holland. </sentence><sentence id="625">And he -- he went to Holland very frequently. </sentence><sentence id="626">He had a cousin in Winterswijk who cooperated with him. </sentence><sentence id="627">And I don't know all the details about it -- it -- but there -- there always was some money available for us. </sentence><sentence id="628">He bought a house in -- in Israel in the early stage, when he -- he went on a trip to Israel, I think in -- first time in 1936, or 1937, and you know my -- of course my older brother was there, and he obviously had to pay for the school, my brother went to Ben Shemen together with all the -- a lot of the famous leaders of -- o-of -- a lot of the men who became the famous leaders later on in Israel. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="639">Q: Tell me what were -- what were the conversations like within your family, and at home? </sentence><sentence id="640">What were you talking about now? </sentence><sentence id="641">Your father's business was changing, the changes at school. </sentence><sentence id="642">What - - what kind of conversations at home? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="647">A: Interesting question. </sentence><sentence id="648">Was a -- what were we -- what were we talking about? </sentence><sentence id="649">Well, I don't think the subjects changed that dr-drastically. </sentence><sentence id="650">My parents were still very much interested in literature, talking about s-sub -- subjects of culture. </sentence><sentence id="651">And they -- they did occasionally discuss what we should and should not do, and what we should and should not say in public. </sentence><sentence id="652">And -- and if you had to be cautious and all that. </sentence><sentence id="653">At a very early stage of 1933, of course they came and -- the police and the storm troopers came into our house, and they went through my father's library, but they weren't -- weren't enough educated to even find the books that -- that were of dubious background. </sentence><sentence id="654">So my mother, too, had no -- absolutely no fear of these people. </sentence><sentence id="655">So I call them a bunch of drunkards who -- who belong to a club of dr-dr-drunkards, meaning the storm troopers. </sentence><sentence id="656">And I'm sure they -- my parents are not afraid of them and nothing close to -- very radically happened. </sentence><sentence id="657">But my father was in the -- interesting point, my father was in the town council. </sentence><sentence id="658">He had advocated that the high school for girls, which only had 50 students in it, should be combined with the high school of boys. </sentence><sentence id="659">Now, of course, in a Catholic town that was out of the question. </sentence><sentence id="660">My father had always based this on the huge expense the 50 student school was for the town to support, and they said there should -- there should be a combination of that. </sentence><sentence id="661">Well would you believe that within two months after the Nazis came to power, they combined the two schools? </sentence><sentence id="662">My father was away, I think in Hannover at the time, and my mother -- I remember my mother telling him on the telephone that this has happened, but of course she didn't say it direct because the telephones were probably listened to. </sentence><sentence id="663">But she said -- she used some Jewish expression to -- to make him aware of that this was -- was happening. </sentence><sentence id="664">Finally his scheme was being translated into reality. </sentence><sentence id="665">So from one day to the other we had girls in the class. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="686">Q: Now, was your -- was your life a-aside from not interacting with non-Jewish students at school, were there other things about your daily life that really changed, or was it largely the same as -- as before? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="688">A: It was largely the same as before, except that [indecipherable] we cou -- we couldn't show our faces any more at sports events, you know? </sentence><sentence id="689">You know, these sort of sports events that are organized, what shall we say, by kids themselves. </sentence><sentence id="690">There was a certain amount of exclusion there, and that it got worse. </sentence><sentence id="691">But there were -- there were classes to teach aircraft design in the afternoon, which I participated in and I'm sure we were allowed to participate in. </sentence><sentence id="692">So it's -- i-it didn't change too drastically, except now, the other thing was of course that now we had a different teacher, who was very, very keen to -- to st -- to teach much about -- we had a different teacher -- teacher of the Jewish elementary school, and he was very, very keen that we should go into much -- to greater depths in -- in Hebrew. </sentence><sentence id="693">And eventually we went to Hebrew classes. </sentence><sentence id="694">Now, I'm talking about modern Hebrew speaking classes, every -- every day, except Friday. </sentence><sentence id="695">Every afternoon we had Hebrew classes. </sentence><sentence id="696">So that -- that was a radical change. </sentence><sentence id="697">And of course it did us a lot of good, and -- because go -- got us much into greater depths into Hebrew. </sentence><sentence id="698">This teacher, who also later on was -- became the headmaster of the Mizrachi high school in Tel Aviv, he started the -- also the [indecipherable] movement to which we then belonged, and so then it was sort of a little bit of a organization which was -- through which we met other Jewish kids from other towns occasionally, and so we were -- became the members of the Mizrachi. </sentence><sentence id="699">Now it's a national religious party, but it wasn't as radical as that in those days. </sentence><sentence id="700">The youth movement, and we were part of that. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="716">A: Yes, yes, yes, it was a Zionist -- Zionist group. </sentence><sentence id="717">That must have started round about 1934 or so, because my older brother was still in town when we started it, and he became one of the motivators of it. </sentence><sentence id="718">And as I said before, he left in 35, I think, to go to Israel. </sentence><sentence id="719">So that -- that was another connection which we had -- End of Tape One, Side B    Beginning Tape Two, Side A </sentence></p></dialogue>

" </sentence><sentence id="799">33 to thir -- yeah, "35. </sentence><sentence id="800">By the time I was Bar Mitzvahed in 1935, w -- we had a really huge Bar Mitzvah, with all the trimmings on it, and of course people coming to our town, they had to be fed three times on as -- Saturday, you know? </sentence><sentence id="801">On Friday nights, on Saturday morning, and s -- then somehow again something -- something again in the afternoon. </sentence><sentence id="802">We were expected to do the whole Torah reading for that day, of sh -- was no -- no difficulty to me at all. </sentence><sentence id="803">And we were expected to do the whole reading from the prophets, the Haftorah readings for the day. </sentence><sentence id="804">Again, no -- no -- no particular -- wa -- and we were expected to make a speech. </sentence><sentence id="805">And I made a f -- apparently made a speech which upset my parents very much, because I -- politically it was unwise. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="824">Q: Why is that? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="826">A: Well, yeah, I think I started off by saying we are being accused of -- of such and such, and such and such things now, and I'll teach you that this is totally against our laws, and that we couldn't be like this. </sentence><sentence id="827">And so it's a so -- so anyhow -- </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="828">Q: So your -- your speech actually had to do with the political climate and the times? </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="829">A: Yes, yes. </sentence><sentence id="830">But you know, the speech was made at home, not in the synagogue. </sentence><sentence id="831">And the servants of course that were around, were non-Jews, who served the meals, so -- I don't think that my parents had e -- invited any non-Jews -- non-Jewish friends to any of these occasions. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="835">Q: What were your favorite Jewish holidays growing up? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="837">A: Oh, I would say Pesach, Passover. </sentence><sentence id="838">Best food. </sentence><sentence id="839">You know, cause of my mother, being such a fabulous cook, all these things were -- were -- were on a -- on a scale that wer -- was gour -- real gourmet eating. </sentence><sentence id="840">I mean, even the -- you know, that we -- we of course did not eat meat on the nine days before Tisha B'Av. </sentence><sentence id="841">But it was wonderful, the stuff my mother cooked was just out of this world. </sentence><sentence id="842">No meat in it, and this being summer, you know, you have all the fruits you want. </sentence><sentence id="843">And she made the most fantastic fruit soups, and vegetable soups tha -- vegetable dishes, anything you could think of. </sentence><sentence id="844">And this way it was no hardship at all. </sentence><sentence id="845">The only hardship was that we also couldn't go swimming in those -- in those nine days. </sentence><sentence id="846">And in the summer, you know? </sentence><sentence id="847">So we were waiting for Tisha B" Av to be gon -- be gone so we could go back to the s -- to the swim baths, you know, go swimming. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="859">Q: That reminds me of something you wrote in your memoirs about the pool in -- in the community. </sentence><sentence id="860">Can you tell me about that during this time period? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="863">A: Yeah, actually it's a -- the -- the -- the pool was not forbidden to us, except for certain times. </sentence><sentence id="864">They had to, you know, there was sort of a mixture between Catholic and Nazi. </sentence><sentence id="865">They had periods [indecipherable] was women only, and -- where women were allowed. </sentence><sentence id="866">Those periods we did not -- we were not allowed to go into the swimming pool, the town swimming pool. </sentence><sentence id="867">But then they also had periods when the -- the pool was open to men only, and those periods -- in those periods we could still sneak in and take a swim. </sentence><sentence id="868">So we had to be carefully attuned to what could and what could not be done. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="875">Q: Was there any rule at all that said that Jews could not swim in that pool? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="877">A: Yeah, not -- not -- not -- not complete exclusion. </sentence><sentence id="878">The exclusion was only for the periods when women were allowed, or mixed swimming was allowed. </sentence><sentence id="879">So we managed to ge -- to gets -- to sneak in still. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="883">Q: Were there any other places in town where you weren't actually allowed? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="885">A: They -- the -- the -- you know, there was only one movie house in town, and that put up a sign fairly soon saying we don't want any Jews, Juden [indecipherable]. </sentence><sentence id="886">And when that sign went up, my parents would not allow us to go in any more because this is -- you know, that -- that was that. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="889">Q: So it's not like you tried, you just decided not to go? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="891">A: We decided that -- not to go, yeah. </sentence><sentence id="892">I think if you could have sneaked in, nobody would have objected very much. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="895">Q: And what about any recollections of Nazis in -- in your town, did you ever have any encounters yourself? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="897">A: Oh yeah. </sentence><sentence id="898">Violent, too. </sentence><sentence id="899">I mean, it started to get dangerous to -- to walk in the -- i -- you know, in the very beautiful woods around that town. </sentence><sentence id="900">You know, on Saturday afternoon we would go for a walk, and sha -- would want to play, and there were certain guys who -- who it was dangerous to meet. </sentence><sentence id="901">And they were beating us up and God knows what. </sentence><sentence id="902">That's -- we had to be very, very careful. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="909">Q: Did this actually happen to you, or mostly to others? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="911">A: Yeah, yes, yes, yes. </sentence><sentence id="912">Once a guy hit me in the face with a burning rubber -- rubber what do you call it, a rubber stick, and I, you know, I had an injury from it for quite awhile. </sentence><sentence id="913">And there was another, you know, usually it was just beating up, or stones being thrown, and things of that nature. </sentence><sentence id="914">You just had -- had to be very, very careful. </sentence><sentence id="915">And you just -- nothing you could do. </sentence><sentence id="916">You had to recognize that there was superior force on the other side. </sentence><sentence id="917">You don't stand and fight superior force. </sentence><sentence id="918">You just have to flee from it, go into an area where gro -- you have enough grown-ups who would interfere with what these kids were doing. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="927">Q: So now tell me about what -- what happened -- what leads up to you going to England. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="929">A: Actually, my parents wanted to get me into a Jewish high school in Berlin in 1938. </sentence><sentence id="930">On -- on one of the many trips to this farm, that training farm which my uncle and aunt -- aunt were in charge of, I had to -- come to know two of these schools. </sentence><sentence id="931">They had to -- they had come to visit the farm, and I was there. </sentence><sentence id="932">I got very, very friendly with some of the teachers, and some of the kids. </sentence><sentence id="933">And as a matter of fact I went to one of the schools, and well, for a day or two in Berlin, and listened in, and from -- and then my parents said in 1938, that I should leave the school in our hometown and go to one of those schools. </sentence><sentence id="934">And it was decided that since all these schools are very far advanced in teaching English, I will need enough English to ca -- catch up with the other me-members of the school. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="941">Q: What languages did you know already at this point? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="943">A: We had been -- we had, apart from Hebrew, of course, which we did not learn in public school, our education was Latin. </sentence><sentence id="944">We -- we -- ever since we were 10 years old, every day we learned -- had at least one or two hours of Latin. </sentence><sentence id="945">Latin was the foundation of our -- of our knowledge. </sentence><sentence id="946">Now, I learned some English, I learned some French, but certainly not -- not to a very high degree. </sentence><sentence id="947">Anyhow, my parents wanted to send me to England for the summer, and -- to learn English, and then I -- I would come back to -- to -- to Germany. </sentence><sentence id="948">But while I was in England, my parents wrote saying that they have talked with other people, and they've come to the conclusion that it's not wise for me to go back to Germany. </sentence><sentence id="949">And they said what would you do if we were tell you, you just stay where you are. </sentence><sentence id="950">So -- </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="951">Q: And what did you feel about that? </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="952">A: Wonderful. </sentence><sentence id="953">I was free. </sentence><sentence id="954">I had -- I had made friends, again thr -- through my relatives with other f-family where the gentleman was very active in the Jewish agency, Adler Rudell. </sentence><sentence id="955">And I went to them, and I told them that -- what my parents had written, and -- and what should I do? </sentence><sentence id="956">And we decided that the thing to do was, since my means were limited, was to go to an intensive tutorial college, and try and do metric, you know, high school cer -- equivalent to a high school certificate, in that fashion. </sentence><sentence id="957">And I -- I loved the idea to do this. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="965">Q: Now tell me when is this, how old are you, and what kind of major experience is this for you at this time, because you're pretty young. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="967">A: Yeah. </sentence><sentence id="968">This was 1938, so I was 16 years old, and -- I liked the idea of trying to make it in about four or five months, to try and get -- get a equivalent of a high school certificate, and then go and start working. </sentence><sentence id="969">Since I knew exactly what I wanted to do, I would get myself a job, and I would go on and learning in -- in evening classes. </sentence><sentence id="970">I didn't have any doubts as to what to do, and I like -- as I said, I like the idea to be on my own. </sentence><sentence id="971">Now my parents did come over occasionally, my father or my mother, or both of them, during all this time when I first came to England, and -- until the outbreak of the war. </sentence><sentence id="972">They -- on and off there, they were in England. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="979">Q: Was it easy for you to leave, and also for them to travel like that? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="981">A: It was very easy for me to leave, because we all had been living so close to the frontier, we all had passes to cross the frontier. </sentence><sentence id="982">It took a long while to get a passport wh-which could take me past the frontier areas of Holland. </sentence><sentence id="983">But we -- we -- we all passports at the time. </sentence><sentence id="984">One more thing, already at that age, I had learned to drive the car. </sentence><sentence id="985">My father wanted me to do that in case we suddenly had to get out in the middle of the night. </sentence><sentence id="986">So by the age of 16, and of course t-totally illegal, I knew how to drive a car already. </sentence><sentence id="987">And I -- I left home on a Friday afternoon, Friday morning, I crossed the frontier, went to my c -- my father took me to his cousin, I stayed there for the weekend, and on Sunday I traveled on to Hoek van Holland, took the night boat over to England, and arrangements had been made by my parents for me to live temporarily with a family, a very nice family in -- in London. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="996">Q: So when you were preparing to leave, were you thinking a lot about the escalating events in Germany? </sentence><sentence id="997">Is this what you and your parents talked about a lot? </sentence><sentence id="998">Is this also -- was this on your mind a great deal? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1002">A: Yes, yes, in my mi -- we came to the con -- conclusion that things were really getting worse and worse, and that it wasn't worthwhile to take the risk of sticking around. </sentence><sentence id="1003">So -- and since I was out of the country anyhow, my parents felt that I should stay out, because as I said before, my older brother had been in -- in -- in Israel since 1935, so it wa -- it wasn't such a big sh -- idea for me to get out, too. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1006">Q: But your parents and your younger brother did stay in your hometown? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1008">A: Yes. </sentence><sentence id="1009">My father somehow just couldn't make -- give himself the push to cut off everything. </sentence><sentence id="1010">He saw more and more chances to get at least some of his money out, and he was going to stick it out to the -- to the end and get the maximum amount, you know, of course that probably was the wrong decision to make. </sentence><sentence id="1011">My younger brother also stayed at home. </sentence><sentence id="1012">My parents were rather reluctant to let him go because he was not independent yet, and so he stayed until after Kristallnacht. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1018">Q: So tell me about what you knew while you were now in London, what you knew about events, things going on like Kristallnacht. </sentence><sentence id="1019">What -- what did you hear, and what did you know about what was happening back in Germany? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1022">A: Well, it's a -- you know, this became wu -- practically headline news in the British papers, when this Kristallnacht happened, and some of the papers tried to say that this was spontaneous, you know, and other papers, like the new scr -- new [indecipherable] liberal paper, they said no, </sentence></p><p><sentence id="1023"> this is organized. </sentence><sentence id="1024">I discussed -- discussed it with my friends, the Adler Rudell, and he said, "No, this was organized by the state, there was nothing spontaneous about that." </sentence><sentence id="1025">This was an assertion of power, a first sign, and if you had no doubts about it, where all this was going to -- to -- to lead. </sentence><sentence id="1026">The fact that so many people had been put into prison, some in concentration camp, and so on, so forth, I mean I don't think that anybody, at least I didn't have any doubts this was the beginning of an absolute disaster. </sentence><sentence id="1027">So -- </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1028">Q: Were you worried about your family, your parents, and your brother? </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1029">A: No, I don't think I was worried about my parents because I knew that they could always get out when they wanted to get out, and this is what they intended to do. </sentence><sentence id="1030">And -- and that they had enough means to -- to -- to get out when they wanted to do. </sentence><sentence id="1031">So from -- personally we didn't -- I didn't feel this was a -- was to -- go -- going to be so critical. </sentence><sentence id="1032">But you know, the [indecipherable] the stateless Jews [indecipherable] family in our town, people who had come from Poland, and never -- never become citizens, and you know, they were picked up, and shipped away, and put at the border of Poland and -- and -- and Germany. </sentence><sentence id="1033">That time we were very much aware of what was happening to them. </sentence><sentence id="1034">You should -- you know, the Poles didn't want to let them in, and the Germans wouldn't have them. </sentence><sentence id="1035">And, you know, these were families whom we knew.[indecipherable] 35 families in a town, of course you know everybody. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1044">Q: Did you have a feeling once you're in London that you may never return to your hometown, or what was your sense at that time? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1046">A: Absolutely. </sentence><sentence id="1047">Already when I left Germany I knew I would never -- never return. </sentence><sentence id="1048">And I was -- I -- I was convinced that this German experiment would last for ages and ages and we would never be allowed to return. </sentence><sentence id="1049">I never mentioned that this was all going to be over and done with in -- in what was it? " </sentence><sentence id="1050">38? </sentence><sentence id="1051">Fa -- "45? </sentence><sentence id="1052">That's seven years, right? </sentence><sentence id="1053">We got back to Germany in deg45. </sentence><sentence id="1054">It's incredible. </sentence><sentence id="1055">It's incredible, except that it didn't seem so incredible after Munich, you know. </sentence><sentence id="1056">After Munich we knew that war was coming, and -- and that Hitler would go too far. </sentence><sentence id="1057">So -- but befo -- but when I left, I thought I will never see the place again. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1071">Q: How did that make you feel, had -- did you feel an attachment to Germany? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1073">A: Yes, I -- I did, you know. </sentence><sentence id="1074">I -- after all, we had traveled a lot in Germany, we had been in various children's camps, things of that nature, and I -- I -- I loved the beautiful landscapes, the beautiful woods and all. [ </sentence><sentence id="1075">indecipherable] very much trave -- traveled along the Rhine. </sentence><sentence id="1076">Was a beautiful area, by -- into -- by train, and so we were very much aware of what the place looked like, and definitely had -- definitely had a certain attachment to it. </sentence><sentence id="1077">Felt very bad about never being able to see it again. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1083">Q: So tell me a little bit about your life in -- in London, and are you following the news very carefully? </sentence><sentence id="1084">Is this something that you really were, you know, closely following, about these developments? </sentence><sentence id="1085">Just tell me about this phase of your life before the war actually starts. </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1086">Q: Well, first off, as I said, when I came to London, I was living with a wonderful family, with the Jacobs, who were the [indecipherable] Mr. Jacobs, he'd been an officer in a Jewish brigade in World War One, and of course, knowing a lot about Zionist history, all this makes a little sense to me. </sentence><sentence id="1087">His wife was from a Jewish family that had settled originally in -- in Scotland, she spoke quite a good ger -- German, and sh-she was [indecipherable] woman, very hard working. </sentence><sentence id="1088">They had one daughter, about my age, and also living with them was a nephew who was an orphan, and who went to business every day. </sentence><sentence id="1089">And also a distant relative, a girl from -- a Polish Jewish girl apparently from very well-to-do parents. </sentence><sentence id="1090">She spent every afternoon in the movies. </sentence><sentence id="1091">She was a total movie addict, this girl. </sentence><sentence id="1092">So -- so it was a big household, and actually we only ate together on -- again, on Friday nights, and Saturday lunch time. </sentence><sentence id="1093">The -- the house was located right be -- </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="1102"> within one or two blocks of the [indecipherable] synagogue, which was a big synagogue, and that's where Mr. Jacobs belonged. </sentence><sentence id="1103">And -- and I concentrated on learning English, very much helped by Mrs. Jacobs, who had no hesitation to correct me, telling me what to do. </sentence><sentence id="1104">And ever since I love reading newspapers, and the Jacobs, since they were liberals, you know, with a [indecipherable], course the newspaper was a news chronicle, and I u-used to translate newspaper articles and then learn them by heart, and this is how I si -- taught myself English, to a large extent, very much helped, as I said, by Mrs. Jacobs, as I was there. </sentence><sentence id="1105">Was a wonderful time I had there. </sentence><sentence id="1106">Was a little bit expensive, and so I couldn't stay there any length of time, but while it lasted it was -- was very nice. </sentence><sentence id="1107">End of Tape Two, Side A Beginning Tape Two, Side B </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1114">Q: This is a continuation of a United States Holocaust Memorial Museum interview with Manfred Gans. </sentence><sentence id="1115">This is tape number two, side B. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1118">A: Well, one incident that actually I think is worthwhile recording is one day Mr. Jacobs went to the library, and he said, "Do you want anything from the library?" </sentence><sentence id="1119">And I said "Yes, get me "Mein Kampf," Hitler's "Mein Kampf" in German." </sentence><sentence id="1120">Of course, while I was in Germany, I would never do them the honor of reading this, but I felt I had to read it, and I'm very, very grateful that I did read it at the time when I -- whe -- because it made it so clear, totally clear as to what was going to happen, from reading that book. </sentence><sentence id="1121">And this -- all this -- the propaganda methods, the way to achieve their aim. </sentence><sentence id="1122">This business of expanding Germany into the eastern [indecipherable] and sh -- chasing all Slavic nations behind the euro -- and all this was all -- the all -- all set out there, you know? </sentence><sentence id="1123">It -- i-it was shus -- it was oka -- I don't know why I did it, but I did read "Mein Kampf" in German while I was there. </sentence><sentence id="1124">Then occasionally we went to the movies, Mr. Jacobs took me to the movies, which was, of course, in English. </sentence><sentence id="1125">And that -- that was a good experience too. </sentence><sentence id="1126">And generally ha-have a wonderful time. </sentence><sentence id="1127">Eventually, when my parents say cha -- that I should stay, I realized I couldn't stay with the Jacobs because it was far too expensive, and I had to go and look for cheaper accommodation. </sentence><sentence id="1128">An -- but -- but of course, by that time my English had improved a lot, too. </sentence><sentence id="1129">I had made up my mind to go to the tutorial college in Euston -- it -- is it Euston? </sentence><sentence id="1130">It is near -- I know it's near Bushhaus in -- it's -- it's Euston, which is spelled E-u-s-t-o- n. And so I made the arrangements to find a new home, or new digs with se -- with those factors in mind of having to go to -- to the tutorial college every day, a-and obviously I still wanted to be near a synagogue and all that, and I had to live kosher. </sentence><sentence id="1131">So that's -- determined where I settled. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1147">Q: What were the signs of -- of the war now -- now encroaching, coming? </sentence></p></dialogue>

Manchester?" </sentence><sentence id="1221">I said, yes, I'll go. </sentence><sentence id="1222">I thought it was very important that we -- we refugees would not all congregate in London, and so -- so I -- together with a few other people, a few days later, I went to Manchester, and again, there was a organized German Jewish aid committee, first liv -- first lived in a -- in -- what do you call -- would you call it, I don't know. </sentence><sentence id="1223">Some sort of communal house, which again it was, you know, had to be kosher, and -- and it was very nicely organized, and all that, and

them, eventually, I got a -- a job which -- which I liked very much. </sentence><sentence id="1226">In fact, this was the first non-Jewish offer which the committee had had for jobs. </sentence><sentence id="1227">And I wanted to go into machinery repair, and it turns out that this, we -- this part of this -- this plant was not -- the repair shop was not unionized, so I could go -- go -- go into that, and fit myself into that. </sentence><sentence id="1228">And it turned out to be an extremely good experience. </sentence><sentence id="1229">It's an interesting story, you can tell it in great details. </sentence><sentence id="1230">Again, I had to make it clear that I wouldn't work on Saturday, I wouldn't work on Friday afternoons, or would go home early on Friday afternoons. </sentence><sentence id="1231">But they -- they didn't mind at all, they said, "Look, if you don't work, you don't get paid. </sentence><sentence id="1232">If you clock in and you clock out, and that's it." </sentence><sentence id="1233">Initially the German Jewish aid committee subsidized my -- my salary a little bit, and after I found -- I had started working in this job, they told me in the home where we were, that I should go to a certain place, to a certain address where I would be able to make arrangements to finding a place -- permanent place to live, a lodging to -- to live. </sentence><sentence id="1234">I went to this place, I had hardly changed from my work clothes, and I went to the right address, and to my great surprise I was in -- at a beautiful estate, very rich, obviously very rich people. </sentence><sentence id="1235">I didn't know what it was all about, but I was hope [indecipherable] the right address. </sentence><sentence id="1236">It turned out that my friend Mr. Jacobs had made arrangements for this very well-to-do family to go and be introduced to me. </sentence><sentence id="1237">These were the Steinats. </sentence><sentence id="1238">They were, you know, the Laskeys, the famous Laskeys were the richest family in Manchester, Jewish family in Manchester. </sentence><sentence id="1239">And the Steinats were the second richest families. </sentence><sentence id="1240">And they were -- s-started my relationship with that -- that family. </sentence><sentence id="1241">The brother of Mrs. Steinats had also been an officer in the Jewish brigade in World War One, and that -- so the connection between Mrs. Jacobs and the Steinats. </sentence><sentence id="1242">So you see it's just all -- all a question of

Steinats made arrangements for me to be billeted, to -- to -- to rent a room from a lady who had been the second driver of Mr.Steinats father. </sentence><sentence id="1245">Mr. Steinats hated her like the guts. </sentence><sentence id="1246">He didn't like her at all. </sentence><sentence id="1247">But it came in handy for me to -- to live there, and I lived there with another German Jewish man, who was two years older than I, and -- and there was a very old man also living there as a lodger. </sentence><sentence id="1248">Now, this lady rented rooms, and she provided meals. </sentence><sentence id="1249">It was pretty primitive, but all right, I -- I didn't [indecipherable] I d -- the -- the job which I had accepted, w-w-was technically very good, but it again, the circumstances of -- of cleanliness, and toilet facilities were just d-disgusting. </sentence><sentence id="1250">But I th - - I thought this is part of living like this, and I was living on the -- during the week I was living in the poverty of a working class atmosphere, and on weekends I was going to the Steinats for practically all my meals, and living in a very, very high class atmosphere. </sentence><sentence id="1251">Undoubtedly the Steinats were richer even than my father was. </sentence><sentence id="1252">And I -- I thought it was greater -- a great experience.

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1296">Q: Sure. [ </sentence><sentence id="1297">tape break] So where were you when the war began? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1300">A: Well, just let me tell you about one more item that was also very significant in my life. </sentence><sentence id="1301">It -- first of all, as you may remember or may know, I think it was in February, 1939, Hitler marched and took over the rest of Czechoslovakia. </sentence><sentence id="1302">Of course, everybody thought the war was going to break out immediately then, but I -- I was sure it wouldn't. </sentence><sentence id="1303">Because now the attitude of France and England changed, and they started sending their foreign ministers to Moscow to try and get a gr-great alliance with the Russians going. </sentence><sentence id="1304">And of course that was their big hope, that they eventually would pull that off, and pull it off together. </sentence><sentence id="1305">And -- and all the workers in -- in the </sentence></p><p><sentence id="1306"> factory where I worked said we"|l be in war -- at war in a week or so, and I say, no you won't be. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="1307">They going to try this, and they're going to be -- do their best effort to -- to pull a -- make alli -- a major alliance with the Russians. </sentence><sentence id="1308">And this is very much what happened. </sentence><sentence id="1309">So nothing much happened politically, every -- except that everybody was sure that eventually there would be a war. </sentence><sentence id="1310">But the -- these two elephants were not in -- on the way yet. </sentence><sentence id="1311">Then on Shavuot, 1939, I was at the Steinats again, and so I mentions that I had just -- had bu -- gotten a chief rabbi from Manchester, Dr. Altman, who was, not to me, but to other people, a well known rabbi from Berlin. </sentence><sentence id="1312">Quite young, he was in middle 30's, or -- at the time, and sa -- for the [indecipherable] after the synagogue ceremony, th -- the Steinats had invited Dr. Altman and his wife, together with a few other very prominent people of the Jewish community. </sentence><sentence id="1313">The day was glorious, the weather was glorious, the food was incredible. </sentence><sentence id="1314">Of course it had to be non-meat, being Shavuot, and this is where I came to know Dr. Altman, who later on became the head of the -- head of the Institute of Advanced Jewish Studies at Brandeis University. </sentence><sentence id="1315">And he -- we became friends right there and then, and he is being -- he being -- he was my mentor, from whom I learned an awful lot, until the time he died in, I don't know, some times in the 80's. </sentence><sentence id="1316">He was professor at Harvard, same time professor at Jerusalem University. </sentence><sentence id="1317">And but that's -- basically he was a fantastic thinker, with tremendous ideas, and I attended a lot of lectures which he gave, mostly in Manchester, and then later on here, in this country. </sentence><sentence id="1318">And he set me on a path of -- of studies, and views that have sur -- very much influenced my life and gave me a much deeper understanding of Judaism than I could have possibly gotten in any other way. </sentence><sentence id="1319">So that was sometime on May, 1930 -- deg39. </sentence><sentence id="1320">And then, actually on -- so then, in beginning of September, 1939, it suddenly transpired that Germany had made a pact with the Soviet Union, or the Soviet Union had made a pact with Germany that they were going to divide up Poland between the two of them. </sentence><sentence id="1321">I don't </sentence></p><p><sentence id="1322"> know whether we were a hundred percent aware of it, that they were going to divide up Poland at that time, but you know, that's what it amounted -- amounted to. </sentence><sentence id="1323">And now the road was clear for Hitler to march into Poland, and -- which he did on September first, 1939. </sentence><sentence id="1324">England declared war on the following Sunday, this was -- September first was a Friday, and England declared war on a -- on a Sunday night. </sentence><sentence id="1325">And I happened to be at the Steinats at that time, listen -- listened to the speech which Chamberlain made, over the radio, which he pointed out that I ca -- I -- I wish I had the -- the exact text of this. </sentence><sentence id="1326">I've asked people to look it up, I think I want to look it up, it's very worthwhile. </sentence><sentence id="1327">He said these [indecipherable] evil things we'll be fighting against, bad faith, something something, and oppression, but I can't remember exactly any more. </sentence><sentence id="1328">And against these, I'm sure the right will prevail. </sentence><sentence id="1329">So -- </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1330">Q: Is it [inaudible] </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1331">A: That's this here. </sentence><sentence id="1332">So the -- the first thing -- the first thing we experienced at the time, was that we all had to register, we German Jews, and we were, in a typical British fashion, put before a tribunal, which [indecipherable] each case individually, and people were classified into a categ -- German -- you know, we were off -- t-to the British we were all German. </sentence><sentence id="1333">There were -- category A went straight into interment camp, category B could go on living under certain circumstances, and category C were totally free, and being treated like British people. </sentence><sentence id="1334">Of course with my connections to the Steinats and all that, I had no difficulty in being assigned to c-category C. So i-it didn't affect me in the beginning, at all. </sentence><sentence id="1335">The -- there now was a -- a c-call-up. </sentence><sentence id="1336">Conscription was enacted, people were called to the services, and obviously the country was getting on a war fut -- footing slowly. </sentence><sentence id="1337">This was the period which we call the phony war because nothing happened. </sentence><sentence id="1338">There was a British expeditionary force sent into France but not into Belgium. </sentence><sentence id="1339">And th- they were very -- an-and the western front was extremely inactive, nothing happened there at all. </sentence><sentence id="1340">Hitler was occupied in the east, conquered Poland, and this was a -- and apparently things were very quiet, but everybody realized this was a quiet before -- before the storm. </sentence><sentence id="1341">I continued to work in the same place I was, and in January ni -- 1940, I managed to pass the high school certificate, which I had continued preparing -- prepared in pravin -- largely in private class, private pa -- private tuition, and not -- not even going to any classes at all. </sentence><sentence id="1342">I had a pr -- civil pri -- different private teachers. </sentence><sentence id="1343">I -- I had a very heavy German bicycle, which -- with which I run around all over the place, at all times of the days and nights. </sentence><sentence id="1344">And somehow this way I -- I managed to -- to -- to survive. </sentence><sentence id="1345">In -- now, you know, jobs became freely available. </sentence><sentence id="1346">There was a shortage of workers everywhere, and after awhile I decided I wanted to go and do something closer to what I -- my long term aim was, and I got myself a job in a factory that manufactured agricultural machinery. </sentence><sentence id="1347">They -- actual -- in actual fact, the actu -- the experience was -- I felt was not very good, and the agricultural machinery was very crude compared with what I had been doing up to that time, and I didn't think I was learning too much from getting -- being exposed to this machinery, and I have -- wuf -- had more or less made up my mind to give all this up, and go into a different direction, for to -- to go into machine tools, which were th -- at the height of -- of what has -- one has to know as a mechanical engineer. </sentence><sentence id="1348">But then of course, came the invasion of - - first of Norway and Denmark, and after that the invasion of the lowlands, and the attack on the western front, and now everything changed. </sentence><sentence id="1349">Obviously with the -- the use of secret sympathizers, Nazi sympathizers that suddenly rose up in Holland and in Belgium, in -- in less -- to a lesser extent in Denmark, but to a larger extent in Norway, now the British public became a -- very, very concerned about people like ourselves. </sentence><sentence id="1350">The first affected -- End of Tape Two, Side B    Beginning Tape Three, Side A </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1476">A: Well, maybe I did, but I -- you know, I -- I -- I felt a sympathy, with all the things you'd read about the -- the Quisling regimes, and the traitors that had been in Fr-France -- in -- in Holland, or Norway and Belgium, I -- somehow I -- I -- I sympathized with the British, that they had to do this in order to make sure -- they couldn't j-justify -- before their own people they couldn't justify having us run around free in their country. </sentence><sentence id="1477">So it -- it was more -- it was definitely done more for morale and propaganda than for actually being afraid that things might -- sas -- there might be spies amongst ourselves, and so on, so forth. </sentence><sentence id="1478">So I -- I was willing to accept this affect, that this w-was a necessary move that the government had to make. </sentence><sentence id="1479">And then in -- I think it was beginning of December 1940, it was my turn to -- to leave, and we -- I joined the Pioneer Corps, but actually what was happening was we were -- we were ju -- went by boat and train from the Isle of Mann, first to Liverpool, and then to Ilfracombe, which is corn -- Cornwallis, or -- you know, it's just -- just south -- in the far southwest of England. </sentence><sentence id="1480">That was the headquarters for the Pioneer Corps, the -- Pioneer co -- the alien man -- Pioneer Corps. </sentence><sentence id="1481">The other members of the Pioneer Corps were British s- soldiers, who had -- actually were very -- had come i -- were not -- not completely trusted because of legal difficulties, or were people who had -- were not fit at all. </sentence><sentence id="1482">So we had these German Austrian companies of the Pioneer Corps, that were made up of very f -

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1587">A: Yes. </sentence><sentence id="1588">Now -- I were -- things were loosening up. </sentence><sentence id="1589">They allow -- we were allowed to -- we were getting weps -- we were now subject to weapons training, and felt more -- by this time, I think we were in Edinburgh. </sentence><sentence id="1590">As a matter of fact, I -- we were working in a anti-aircraft unit that was the first mixed sex -- sex mixed anti-aircraft unit in the -- in -- in Great Britain. </sentence><sentence id="1591">And it was a very, very interesting experience, too. </sentence><sentence id="1592">Also some very lovely girls there, no doubt. </sentence><sentence id="1593">And later on we went to -- to Glasgow, and we worked -- we started working building an ammunition dump for -- let me see, can't remember exact date any more. </sentence><sentence id="1594">I think by this time -- can't remember the date, six -- ha-have -- have to think this out, but I have a feeling that we were building this ammunition dump for the Americans. </sentence><sentence id="1595">So that must have been after Pearl Harbor then. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1606">Q: And when did you get this rare opportunity that then came your way? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1608">A: Well, as I said, I -- I volunt -- volunteered for everything, and I think it was the end of 1942, I think. </sentence><sentence id="1609">By that time I had made my name in the -- in the unit. </sentence><sentence id="1610">See, you know, th-these -- these Pioneer Corps units were full of people who were -- who knew how to boast, and push themselves forward very much. </sentence><sentence id="1611">They were all experts at everything, you know. </sentence><sentence id="1612">And I -- I, of course, I never participated very much in -- in -- in sports that were open to many people, things like that. </sentence><sentence id="1613">Well, one day I remember we had a -- they were -- they had a fo -- a race, a su -- sort of like a sports day, and the -- you know, running a 400 meter, you know, this is actually one round on -- and that was the major event there. </sentence><sentence id="1614">And of course there were all these guys there who had been such champions in all their Maccabee clubs, and God knows, all over the place. </sentence><sentence id="1615">Well, I did the run, and I won it so easily. </sentence><sentence id="1616">And now I had made my name, you know. </sentence><sentence id="1617">I -- I -- I hadn't realized myself how -- how -- how f -- much better I was at sports than all these people who were so -- boasting continuously about their powers, you know? </sentence><sentence id="1618">A-And I knew when w-we were near Glasgow at the time, and we were billeted on pr -- in private homes -- you know, we were not eating there, but were -- just slept there. </sentence><sentence id="1619">Had a -- had a -- when -- I remember when I went home, I knew this was going to be the change of my life. </sentence><sentence id="1620">And so it went. </sentence><sentence id="1621">When eventually the call came for people to go to something very, very special, I was one of the first who was s-selected to -- but there being -- after this event, we started a -- we competed in many, many different sports events, and I was always very much the center of everything of the team that was sent by our unit, to all these sports event -- events, and I've -- I've -- I was running on -- on -- on a cloud, you know? </sentence><sentence id="1622">So I think it was at the end of 1942 that I was -- went to London, and I was    interviewed by a man who had the uniform of a captain, and who obviously knew an awful lot, and knew what he wanted, and that turned out to be eventually the skipper, you know, he's -- he's all on the pictures there. </sentence><sentence id="1623">I -- I s-should have gone through these pictures before with you. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1645">Q: We can look at them. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1647">A: And also then, we were interviewed by somebody from MI-five, who was supposed to make sure all on your background, and -- very knowledgeable people, very, very knowledgeable. </sentence><sentence id="1648">You know this [indecipherable] combination of the CIA and the FBI. </sentence><sentence id="1649">And I was absolutely sure that I had been accepted. </sentence><sentence id="1650">I had no doubts about it whatsoever. </sentence><sentence id="1651">And then, a few weeks later, or two weeks later, the [indecipherable] called to the [indecipherable] told me, and maybe three or four others to go to the Pioneer Corps center in -- in Yorkshire. </sentence><sentence id="1652">I think it was in Yorkshire, horrible place. </sentence><sentence id="1653">And there -- from there we were taken on a train by night, and the next morning we arrived in Abu Dhabi, which was the training pl-place for [indecipherable] commando. </sentence><sentence id="1654">And there we changed our names, changed our identities. </sentence><sentence id="1655">Within two hours, we all -- we had a false history, a false name, and that was it. </sentence><sentence id="1656">And that was the beginning of the -- being in the commandoes. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1667">Q: What was your false name and your background, your identity you were given? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1669">A: My name was Fred Gray. </sentence><sentence id="1670">I spelled it a-y. And we were all s-supposed to say that we were British by -- by nationality, but that our fathers, our parents had been assigned to such and such a -- m-my case it was, of course, Holland, since I spoke some Dutch, it was easy to do, had been assigned to -- to -- had -- had lived in -- in other countries. </sentence><sentence id="1671">And so that's the reason why we had grown up in -- abroad, but we were British by nationality. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1675">Q: What was the main qualifying factor for being part of this troop? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1677">A: That you spoke German without an accent. </sentence><sentence id="1678">This was extremely important. </sentence><sentence id="1679">We didn't realize it at that time, how important this would [indecipherable] be. </sentence><sentence id="1680">I only can ta -- give you one statistic. </sentence><sentence id="1681">I must have caused the surrender of about 10,000 Germans [indecipherable] without a fight. </sentence><sentence id="1682">I didn't -- I didn't -- we didn't realize it at the time. </sentence><sentence id="1683">We were supposed to do long distance patrols, we were supposed to do interrogation on -- on the battlefield, which we did, and which were very important. </sentence><sentence id="1684">No doubt these were very important, because you know, we could interrogate the prisoners right there and then on the battlefield. </sentence><sentence id="1685">And we had been trained for that. </sentence><sentence id="1686">I had been to the intelligence school in Cambridge, in -- in England. </sentence><sentence id="1687">And so -- and that -- that was extremely important, no doubt about it. </sentence><sentence id="1688">But the ability to walk into a German position and persuade people to surrender without fighting, proved more important than anything else. </sentence><sentence id="1689">A-Anything else we learned. </sentence><sentence id="1690">After all, we learned everything. </sentence><sentence id="1691">Mountaineering, parachute jumping. </sentence><sentence id="1692">Anythi -- we'd done any -- everything there was to be done. </sentence><sentence id="1693">But it -- the -- the ability to walk into a ger -- walk into a German position and talk to them as if you were one of them, this was the main contribution, as it turned out to be, for the war for us. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1711">Q: They would see you, of course, in your uniform, and you would appear to be, you know, a British, you know, soldier, or -- you know, but -- but you're saying the fact that you spoke without an accent was also more convincing to them, somehow, to get them to surrender? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1713">A: Yeah, ju -- obviously there had to be some sort of infiltration and some fights before that, which you may have read about in the stories in which I wrote about [indecipherable] when we did this repeatedly, or in France. </sentence><sentence id="1714">You -- there had to be some sort of infiltration before that, but once you were in that position, you -- then we were very, very persuasive. </sentence><sentence id="1715">Don't threaten them with a gun, just tell them quick how many --    End of Tape Three, Side A Beginning Tape Three, Side B </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1720">Q: This is a continuation of a United States Holocaust Memorial Museum interview with Manfred Gans. </sentence><sentence id="1721">This is tape number three, side B. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1724">A: Again, they said that was not necessarily what was planned for us, but this was what turned out to be our greatest asset. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1726">Q: Who was in this troop, the numbers of people, and what was their background? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1728">A: There were 87 people in the troop, and they were all, I think this -- with the exception of one or two, they were all German or Austrian Jews, meaning Jews by the t -- by Hitler's definition. </sentence><sentence id="1729">A lot of them by wh-what we call Halachak definitions are not Jewish, because they had a -- a Jewish father, and a non-Jewish mother. </sentence><sentence id="1730">Quite a number of those, quite a number. </sentence><sentence id="1731">Of course you know a couple like that had to leave Germany very early, otherwise life was impossible for them, and a lot of them did leave very early. </sentence><sentence id="1732">So by what we used to call Halachak Jewish law, Jewish [indecipherable] maybe 75 percent of us were Jewish. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1738">Q: And was this -- do you think this was an important qualification that -- that they were looking for, that the British actually chose Jews? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1740">A: No, they didn't choose Jews, no. </sentence><sentence id="1741">Those -- Montgomery -- I'm sorry, Lord Mountbatten. </sentence><sentence id="1742">Lord Mountbatten, who was in charge of combat operation, who was -- you know, he's -- is the uncle of, you know, Prince Philip, the husband of the queen, he da -- his -- I think his parents had gone through some sort of experience in World War One, and he was in combat -- in charge of combined operation, which consisted of the units of the army, largely commanders, Air Force, and Navy. </sentence><sentence id="1743">And he came up with the idea that he had to have German speakers somewhere, and that he needed really good German speakers, so he -- he sold that idea to Churchill, and Churchill was very enthused about it, and Churchill said that the troops should be called X- troops. </sentence><sentence id="1744">But of course that name had to be dropped, it was too suspicious. </sentence><sentence id="1745">And then, you know, we became a [indecipherable] of the inter-allied commando. </sentence><sentence id="1746">That's how we were -- were -- how we were known. </sentence><sentence id="1747">Was a commando which had units, Belgian units, French units, Polish unit -- units, Norwegian unit, and well, that's about it. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1757">Q: So previously I never knew about this troop, do y -- and I'm wondering if -- if it seems like it's been -- not only at the time, I guess it was kept secret, and -- but has it been sort of a well kept secret even -- even now? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1759">A: Well, it's just -- not kept secret, but you know, we all went our different ways. </sentence><sentence id="1760">The -- the skipper, the head of the troop got injured in France, you know, on a long term patrol, and he was taken prisoner, and he was -- did not return until after the war. </sentence><sentence id="1761">He wrote a very nice assessment of the troop back in 1946 or so. </sentence><sentence id="1762">And -- you know, we were all, after the war we were all -- we -- we didn't particular think that we had done such great things. </sentence><sentence id="1763">We were -- we were involved in our own careers, had to make a living. </sentence><sentence id="1764">Potential wives, girlfriends, were not interested in what we had done during the war. </sentence><sentence id="1765">What they wanted was to get married and make sure that we had enough money to -- to have children and all that. </sentence><sentence id="1766">And particularly this was the attitude of -- of the parents of all our potential wives and girlfriends. </sentence><sentence id="1767">So the whole idea was not really -- we da -- we -- we didn't care to -- we didn't have any reunions until maybe the 40" anniversary of D- Day, and wh-what was that? </sentence><sentence id="1768">That would have been in 1984, right? </sentence><sentence id="1769">Yes. </sentence><sentence id="1770">I -- I think that the first one was 1984. </sentence><sentence id="1771">And of course it's the -- Peter Maas's book that really brought all this out into the open, better than anything else. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1785">Q: Did you realize at the time how unusual this was, that you were, you know, Jewish, and able to train to fight and obviously eventually go to an area where, you know, Jews were so persecuted? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1787">A: Yes, we -- I was very much aware of it. </sentence><sentence id="1788">| was very much aware, and so were my friends, that this was something totally unique. </sentence><sentence id="1789">My -- my closest friends were very, very supportive of all this, and they realized what were -- what had happened. </sentence><sentence id="1790">But it -- but it remained a unique experience. </sentence><sentence id="1791">We -- and, you know, my experience of course was very -- almost very different from everybody else's experience. </sentence><sentence id="1792">First of all, I refused to go to the officer's training school. </sentence><sentence id="1793">I didn't want to miss the war. </sentence><sentence id="1794">My -- my closest friends in the [indecipherable] troop went in to officer training school for four months just before D-Day, and of course they missed most of the war. </sentence><sentence id="1795">I absolute refused to go. </sentence><sentence id="1796">I wer -- and then there came an order from the British army command that people were not to be promoted to officers in their field without going to officer's training school. </sentence><sentence id="1797">Well, I didn't care two hoots about it, but it so happens that of course I was attached to a Marine unit. </sentence><sentence id="1798">And the Marines didn't have to take any notice of all these army uni- units. </sentence><sentence id="1799">I was with the Marine commando, and one day they colonel said, "Tell me who you really are. </sentence><sentence id="1800">I -- | want to make -- I want to put you in for be-becoming an officer." </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1801">Q: So speaking of your other identity, what was that like to assume a different identity?

</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1844">A: Yeah, and this, you know, this is -- this is why I was willing to accept -- accept whatever it meant, or whatever I had to do, because -- including giving up being an Orthodox Jew, when the time came to be at the commandoes. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1846">Q: Now, while you were in the commando, did you still, in your own personal and private way, was religion important to you as -- as you went through those war time experiences? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1848">A: It's a -- ina sort of general way, yes. </sentence><sentence id="1849">But you know, there was too many other things we had to concentrate on to -- to even start thinking about all this. </sentence><sentence id="1850">I -- I -- to me the Jewish religion is a set of ideas which I practice, and it's -- I -- I'm not that comfortable in praying because the prayers to me are -- have a great depth, but they are an idiom that we cannot relate to. </sentence><sentence id="1851">And just as you find in a lot of ultra Orthodox Jews, they rather sit down and study the Talmud than go and do -- do prayers. </sentence><sentence id="1852">And -- and you know, this is -- so you had a guidance there, and -- when it was absolutely needed, but that wasn't very often. </sentence><sentence id="1853">And I -- when I was in difficult situations, I did not -- not pray. </sentence><sentence id="1854">I remember that one [indecipherable] one -- you may have read this story I written about Pontlivek, when I suddenly found myself in this German artillery fire, very much exposed, and I just -- I -- you know, Is -- I sort of said, get me out of this. </sentence><sentence id="1855">Bus -- was addressing wa -- I was obviously addressing a higher authority, like God or so. </sentence><sentence id="1856">And -- but it -- it required moments of that nature to make -- to make me -- to make me even think about -- about religion. </sentence><sentence id="1857">Normally the concentration had to be all on techniques. </sentence><sentence id="1858">Going through a minefield, doing this and that and the other. </sentence><sentence id="1859">Always a technique we had [indecipherable] out. </sentence><sentence id="1860">You had to concentrate. </sentence><sentence id="1861">There was no time to -- to think of anything else. </sentence><sentence id="1862">And that's [indecipherable] made it all possible. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1879">Q: So tell me about D-Day. </sentence><sentence id="1880">You -- is this the first time that you -- you entered -- </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1881">A: Yes. </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1882">Q: -- into actual war time fighting? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1884">A: Yes, it -- yes. </sentence><sentence id="1885">We had -- we had been -- we had tried to do certain raids on France before D- Day, by parachute, and certain missions were planted, or didn't come off, some of them, bec -- because we always -- when you were -- when a -- when a force like that went out by parachute, they had to go out with the massive bombers that attacked the American and British bombers that attacked [indecipherable] Germany at the time. </sentence><sentence id="1886">So you had to blend in, and then you drop -- you drop out and do certain things. </sentence><sentence id="1887">Well, none of these things came off, partially because of bad weather, partially because the information was obtained from different means and so on, so forth. </sentence><sentence id="1888">So, though we had been prepared for certain raids, and some of us had been on certain raids, I personally had not been in any actual fight until D-Day. </sentence><sentence id="1889">We were sequestered -- oh, let me go back a little bit. </sentence><sentence id="1890">The -- our troop, the German speaking inter-allied commando troop was split up just before D-Day, when there were four or five of us attached to every invading commando troop. </sentence><sentence id="1891">I was assigned together with a fellow by the name of Morris Latimer, whose -- and the Sergeant Major of the troop, O'Neill, and a fellow by the name of Tommy sw-Swenton. </sentence><sentence id="1892">These are all these cover names of course. </sentence><sentence id="1893">Morris Latimer, for instance, was Morris Levi from the Sudetenland before he joined that troop. </sentence><sentence id="1894">So we were assigned to 41 [indecipherable] Marine commando. </sentence><sentence id="1895">And we were held in camps for I think two or three weeks while we were being briefed about the landing. </sentence><sentence id="1896">And w -- we couldn't communicate with anybody outside because those -- they were -- didn't tell us where we would land. </sentence><sentence id="1897">We knew -- we had -- we saw maps, for which people who really knew France well could have guessed where this was. </sentence><sentence id="1898">But I'm -- we personally, we didn't know where it was going to be. </sentence><sentence id="1899">We didn't know we were going to land in Normandy. </sentence><sentence id="1900">So we were in these camps for about two or three weeks, and then one evening, total darkness, we were -- we embarked into little boats, infantry landing boats, which had -- each boat had maybe something like 80 people. </sentence><sentence id="1901">And the -- all flotilla set out without light, without any intercommunication, in a pitch dark night. </sentence><sentence id="1902">And as far as I know there were no -- no accidents. </sentence><sentence id="1903">We sailed past the Isle of Wight in total darkness, couldn't see anything at all. </sentence><sentence id="1904">And -- and that was it. </sentence><sentence id="1905">The sea was not too rough, it was acceptable, and we -- as we approached, as we came closer to the coast in the morning, well, it must have been about six or seven o'clock in the morning by the time we landed. </sentence><sentence id="1906">But before that we could start to see the massive bombardment of the coast, and the shooting back of -- of the -- of the German guns back to us. </sentence><sentence id="1907">And one of us always sat on the steps, so that s -- way you could look out and sort of gave a running commentary on what was happening, what he was seeing, and soon -- of course pretty soon the German [indecipherable] guns started -- the shells started falling nearer to us. </sentence><sentence id="1908">Lucky tha -- luckily we were not hit. </sentence><sentence id="1909">And now, before all this, while we were in the camps, Montgomery, the a -- the British commander had come around, and he had said, "Look, every time there's a landing, everybody sticks to the beach because they want to be protected by the Navy. </sentence><sentence id="1910">Get off the beaches. </sentence><sentence id="1911">You can -- don't," -- and that struck me as being very, very significant. </sentence><sentence id="1912">The really tr-trust that the British have in their Navy, that I could see that the soldiers wouldn't get away from the beach. </sentence><sentence id="1913">And I was absolutely set I was not going to let this happen to me. </sentence><sentence id="1914">So, when -- when the -- the -- the -- our boat approached the -- the coast -- and of course as I said, we now were under direct fire -- as soon as I could, I run down the gangway, and I got -- got down -- was on the beach, and lo and behold, I saw about 25 German soldiers who had been taken prisoner by the engineer's unit that has preceded us, who were supposed to blow up the obstacles, the anti- tank obstacles that were on the beach. </sentence><sentence id="1915">And so I run over to those Germans, and I say to them, "Where's the pass through the minefields?" </sentence><sentence id="1916">Well, you know, at that time -- a few days later I didn't have any fear of mines any more, but at that time I still was very much aware. </sentence><sentence id="1917">And lo and behold, when I didn't threaten them, and, you know, about being -- talking their own language, the first thing that occurred to me is these guys look exactly like us German Jews. </sentence><sentence id="1918">Different uniform and they could be on our side. </sentence><sentence id="1919">And lo and behold they told me. </sentence><sentence id="1920">I didn't threaten them, I had the tommy gun down. </sentence><sentence id="1921">I just said, in a very calm way, "Where's the pass through the mine fields?" </sentence><sentence id="1922">And they pointed it out to me. </sentence><sentence id="1923">And so I gathered as many people as I could, and I'd gotten through the -- gotten off the beach, and gotten into Lyon sur Mer without a single casualty. </sentence><sentence id="1924">So the -- the -- the -- that -- that was, that part of it, that was off, and actually we lost 50 percent of the unit. </sentence><sentence id="1925">Out of 450 people we lost 50 percent on that day. </sentence><sentence id="1926">Later on, when we made the landing in Washoe, in -- which was much more heavily defended than the Normandy beaches, much more heavily defended, we lost, out of 450 people, we lost 11 people in the landing. </sentence><sentence id="1927">But by that time we were so experienced that nobody could come equal to us. </sentence><sentence id="1928">And everybody did the same as I did, get off the boat, get over the beaches, forget about it and get out. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1977">Q: So this was the -- the end of D-Day for you? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1979">A: No, not at all. </sentence><sentence id="1980">This was the beginning of D-Day. </sentence><sentence id="1981">Now, they -- we n -- we knew where the German strong points were, and we were at the other end of the village. </sentence><sentence id="1982">Luckily, the pass through the mine field was at one end of Lyon sur Mer, and the German strong point was in the other. </sentence><sentence id="1983">I had no doubt where we were. </sentence><sentence id="1984">You know, we had studied the maps sufficiently. </sentence><sentence id="1985">I knew we were at the other end, we had nothing to be afraid of, not until we would get to the strong point. </sentence><sentence id="1986">Obviously the Germans are go -- going to be in their strong points. </sentence><sentence id="1987">Why should they be out on the road, in the French villages? </sentence><sentence id="1988">The French who have murdered them, you know? </sentence><sentence id="1989">So, the first thing, I gather up a few guys, we started making our way along the road that was le -- going towards the German strong point. </sentence><sentence id="1990">But, you know, you -- you cannot be out in the streets, I -- and -- when it -- when it comes to -- when there's so much artillery fire and mortar fire. </sentence><sentence id="1991">It's -- the splinters will carry. </sentence><sentence id="1992">So you have to go from one door to the other, dive in and dive out. </sentence><sentence id="1993">And of course the population was on our side. </sentence><sentence id="1994">They willingly opened the doors for us. </sentence><sentence id="1995">So I says you know, you couldn't do this in Germany. </sentence><sentence id="1996">We knew that we would never be able to do this type of street fighting in Germany, and we didn't intend to do it, and the British high command saw to it -- had come to the same conclusion. </sentence><sentence id="1997">So we were diving from one house into the other. </sentence><sentence id="1998">In some houses actually there were people who had been quite badly injured, with all the bombardment by one side or the other. </sentence><sentence id="1999">In fact as -- as we got out, you know, to the road first, there were some British soldiers who had obviously been killed by being out on the street when the -- when a shell exploded. </sentence><sentence id="2000">You know, y-you cannot stay out under these conditions. </sentence><sentence id="2001">So we worked our way -- a few of us worked our way towards the strong point. </sentence><sentence id="2002">When we got into this position where we thought we were about in the view of the strong point, we knew there was an anti-tank gun pointing at us down the road, we got off the street, we got into [indecipherable] abandoned houses, which was quite obviously that we were now very close to the strong point. </sentence><sentence id="2003">And I went upstairs and tried to look out and look into the strong point, but some German sniper must have seen me there, and he fired at me, but thank God he missed. </sentence><sentence id="2004">So I rushed downstairs again. </sentence><sentence id="2005">I think I -- so I went down into the house, and we were sort of milling around, deciding what to do next, when we heard a loud bang on the house next door. </sentence><sentence id="2006">And ta -- so -- obviously some missile was going from our side into the strong point. </sentence><sentence id="2007">So we really didn't know what the hell this was. </sentence><sentence id="2008">We were absolutely sure that apart from our -- our people there could be nobody there. </sentence><sentence id="2009">So we went there, and we found an Arab, who had the typical look of what the -- how the Germans portrayed the Jews, you know, black hair, crooked nose and all that. </sentence><sentence id="2010">And he had a 19 [indecipherable] war front loader rifle, which he somehow had gotten hold of, and he was firing this into the German strong point. </sentence><sentence id="2011">So -- because nobody spoke French, ik -- yeah, my own French was very deficient in those days, I now speak French much better [indecipherable] transfer two years in the meantime. </sentence><sentence id="2012">But we persuaded him that he should join us, which he gladly did. </sentence><sentence id="2013">And he was with us for -- until the winter of 1944 -- "45. </sentence><sentence id="2014">So, after that, the colonel of the unit wanted me to go with him and look at all the different positions which the different troops of 41 commandos had now taken up around the German strong point. </sentence><sentence id="2015">And I went with him. </sentence><sentence id="2016">And he was one of those guys who wouldn't take no notice of any German fire. </sentence><sentence id="2017">He was running around with a briefcase. </sentence><sentence id="2018">His name, I think, was Colonel Grey, but he spelled it with e-y, and not a-y like I did. </sentence><sentence id="2019">And he -- he wouldn't throw himself down and her -- heard an artillery shell come over, and we heard a mortar come, and -- and [indecipherable] but I wasn't going to do this, so I dodged the way I'd learned to dodge it, and as a matter of fact the next day the colonel was severely injured, he was out of the war. </sentence><sentence id="2020">So, so much for somebody taking such incredible risks, were totally unjustified. </sentence><sentence id="2021">But then we had -- I -- a troop of South African armored vehicles came up and came into the village from the beach, and the colonel persuaded them to make a straight attack along the main road to -- on -- on to the German strong point. </sentence><sentence id="2022">Which was crazy. </sentence><sentence id="2023">The way we did this later on, we used armored vehicles, and even tanks, only as mobile guns. </sentence><sentence id="2024">We had them -- h-hid them somewhere in the field, and had them shoot and lay down covering fire while we went in. </sentence><sentence id="2025">Anyhow, this attack totally failed. </sentence><sentence id="2026">I didn't participate in it because I knew it would -- would be practically suicide to do that. </sentence><sentence id="2027">But there was one of the troops of 41 [indecipherable] commando, Y troop, and they lost about half the troop of what they still had, in trying to do this attack, because as we knew well from our -- from the maps we had been given before D-Day, there was a German [indecipherable] tank pointing right down the road. </sentence><sentence id="2028">There was no chance that an armored car could get by that. </sentence><sentence id="2029">So we hadn't -- we hadn't -- we had not succeeded in taking the strong point on that day. </sentence><sentence id="2030">By now it was getting late. </sentence><sentence id="2031">We were in a -- on a farm outside Lyon somewhere, and I also was getting extremely hungry, and I -- I found myself of -- a ditch that had a sort of stone lining on both sides, which I took cover, and start -- started to prepare some of the food which we had, it was -- I hadn't eaten all day long. </sentence><sentence id="2032">I don't think we had eaten during the night either. </sentence><sentence id="2033">There was cocoa. </sentence><sentence id="2034">There was -- I mean, there were drinks available, but I -- I didn't take strong drinks because they slow down your reaction too much. </sentence><sentence id="2035">And jus -- just at that time, the -- there was a magnificent sight of massive numbers of allied gliders, British gliders come -- being pulled by airplanes coming over, to land on the other side of Lyon canal, and they were sort of -- you know, you could see them being detached, going on their own, and coming down. </sentence><sentence

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2155">A: I can say that important information that had strategic significance, I ca -- don't think I ever -- ever was in that position. </sentence><sentence id="2156">My idea was get as many of them to surrender as you can -- can get. </sentence><sentence id="2157">Find some high ranking officer who will go with you and make everybody surrender. </sentence><sentence id="2158">This -- this has worked out to be ex -- excellent strategy, and this worked ma-many, many times. </sentence><sentence id="2159">Now, I must say that I know of others who j -- of -- from [indecipherable] commando, who had tried this and did not succeed in -- and -- and -- and who got killed in one of these attempts, and I almost was in a similar situation, too. </sentence><sentence id="2160">Well, the -- after we -- we -- after this D-Day experience, we had a rather unique experience besieging two underground German radar stations. </sentence><sentence id="2161">They had been left behind in the allied advance, and they were fully manned, and they were hev -- very, very heavily fortified, incredibly heavily fortified. </sentence><sentence id="2162">And it was just decided that it was not worthwhile to make an attack -- a direct attack on them. </sentence><sentence id="2163">So we were positioned around them, near -- near    them, and we were just as -- supposed to keep them on their toes, make believe that they were about to be attacked. </sentence><sentence id="2164">The -- the tra -- the trouble was that the allies were building -- had planned to build an air -- airp -- airport, an air [indecipherable] abou -- only about maybe a mile away from these radar stations. </sentence><sentence id="2165">And that plan had to go ahead, you know, there were fields there that were suitable for landing aircrafts on it, and this had to go ahead. </sentence><sentence id="2166">And they couldn't take any notice of the fact that these ger -- these underground fortifications were still there. </sentence><sentence id="2167">So our task was to make them believe that they were just about to be attacked. </sentence><sentence id="2168">And -- which we -- which we successfully managed to do for about a week or so. </sentence><sentence id="2169">There were a lot of adventures that we had, where we did things that were totally wrong, that you would never have done a month or two later when we had much more experience. </sentence><sentence id="2170">But luckily most of the time we were -- we got away with it. </sentence><sentence id="2171">Eventually enough equipment was saved for us -- spared for us that we could do a daylight attack on it, and -- and it was successful. </sentence><sentence id="2172">Again, I managed to get these guys out, to surrender. </sentence><sentence id="2173">So you had -- we took 450 people prisoner on -- on that day, and we marched them down to the beach, to the -- t-to -- to the prisoner camps of which there were there, but we shipped out. </sentence><sentence id="2174">That was an interesting experience which I've written up in great detail. </sentence><sentence id="2175">If you want to read, you can read it. </sentence><sentence id="2176">After that experience, we went to the -- what we might call the eastern front of the Normandy beach head, which was on -- we -- we were in the part that was hev -- very heavily fortified, which was still the extension of what the Germans call the Atlantic wall. </sentence><sentence id="2177">And, of course this -- I call it the Hedgerow war, because the -- we were always going along or through some hedgerows to get to our -- to find the German alliance, so [indecipherable], a-and th-this was a -- a -- oh, of course you got a -- a tiring sort of a -- of a experience, but we managed to keep the Germans on their toes with lots of patrols, and usually I had to go out on every damn patrol there was, because by na -- by now the troops, the Marines would hardly ever go out unless I -- I or -- mo -- Morris La -- or I was present, Morris Latimer had been injured on the radar stations and he had went back to -- to England. </sentence><sentence id="2178">The Sergeant Major O" Neill was still with me, swent -- Tommy Swentin had gone home on deeplus two or three, he said he was shell- shocked. </sentence><sentence id="2179">And O'Neill was still there, but he was largely with the officers, so I hardly ever saw them -- saw him. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2207">Q: Now let me ask you, the Germans you encountered along the way, did any of them question you and th -- and even, you know, wonder if you're Jewish, and -- did you -- that ever come up, was that ever a problem? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2209">A: No, no, no. </sentence><sentence id="2210">As a matter of fact, that was the un -- unbelievable attitude. </sentence><sentence id="2211">If somebody spoke to them in fluent German, they thought that well, you know, we are -- we have -- of such high culture, of course other people speak our language. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2215">Q: So they wouldn't even guess that you were originally German? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2217">A: No, no, not at all. </sentence><sentence id="2218">Not at all. </sentence><sentence id="2219">Nobody even dreamt of it. </sentence><sentence id="2220">It was -- it was unbelievable. </sentence><sentence id="2221">And that I think is a -- a -- you know, of course ga -- cultured pe-people speak German, naturally, right?And I'm sure you speak German, too. </sentence><sentence id="2222">If you don't, you're not cultured. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2230">Q: [indecipherable] </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2231">A: Yeah. </sentence><sentence id="2232">So -- yeah, and from -- from that -- so we got on the -- on the northeastern part of the -- of the -- of the Normandy beach head. </sentence><sentence id="2233">From there we shifted over to something absolutely terrible, the southeastern part, the southeastern corner of the beach head. </sentence><sentence id="2234">Again, this was the -- the only thing that was lucky about it is there ha-had been a British guards battalion there before us, they had dug some way with trenches. </sentence><sentence id="2235">We were now something like, maybe maximum 200 - 300 yards away from the German lines. </sentence><sentence id="2236">And the bombardment was day and night, mortars, artillery. </sentence><sentence id="2237">Artillery is all right because you know it goes off and you can hear it coming and you </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="2245"> know what to do, throw yourself into a ditch. </sentence><sentence id="2246">But the mortar fires were -- could be very surprising, you know. </sentence><sentence id="2247">We -- we -- we le -- it was o -- it was a lot like being in World War One, it was trench warfare practically. </sentence><sentence id="2248">But at night again, we went out on patrol, shot up patrols, we got shot up on -- on patrol and things like that until one day -- of course we were very much aware of the fact of what was happening on the other fronts. </sentence><sentence id="2249">The fact that the Americans were breaking through and going south, that they were going west into Brittany, and that they were swinging around as the British -- had been a terrible mass |-losses of germ -- of two and a half German divisions in one night with that -- were poised for counterattack on -- on the British advance, th - - the Germans had not -- thought that they could keep this counterattack of two and a half German divisions secret, but they -- but of course it was all seen from the air, with the ability that the British Air Force had to -- to look at all German movements, and so it came in with a very heavy -- before the -- the Germans could even start to move, came in with a very, very heavy thousand bombers attack. </sentence><sentence id="2250">And most of these two and a half -- the people of the two and a half divisions -- SS divisions, they -- they died through lack of ox -- oxygen, or lack of -- or ho -- of hi -- excessively high pressure that they ex-experienced being out in the open, being ready for counterattack. </sentence><sentence id="2251">That was -- then -- that was a -- none of these divisions appeared again for the rest of the war. </sentence><sentence id="2252">They were SS divisions. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2261">Q: What was the most frightening episode that you experienced? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2263">A: I think that, you know, sus-sustained frightening, was the position we were in in Pontlivek, because we were a cross place, the Germans are at one side in a railway -- in a railway station and we were on the other side, and we were be -- behind walls at [indecipherable] but we knew the walls were -- would not stand -- would not stand a anti-tank gun shot, and we knew that the Germans usually left -- with their rear guards they usually left an anti-tank gun. </sentence><sentence id="2264">And that would have gone right through us. </sentence><sentence id="2265">But v-very soon -- th-this was realized that we were in too exposed a position, and we were told to get -- get out of this position and just -- because also, the Germans had left devices in -- in all the bedrooms of the houses, which w -- suddenly all the -- all the houses around us went on fire, and -- you know, this was a sustained, longer experience. </sentence><sentence id="2266">But we managed to get out of this, and get out and then we did what we did -- always did, we defeated ma -- we made 10 night attacks in 10 days in that -- that -- during that time. </sentence><sentence id="2267">So we were taken out of Pontlivek, was decided what we'll do is we -- we'll go around on the night attacks, and we sa -- we go past them, and don't do a frontal assault anywhere. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2274">Q: So, were you at some point starting to imagine that the war might be coming to an end? </sentence><sentence id="2275">When did you start to get a feeling that -- you know, that -- that this might actually be close to the end of the war? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2278">A: Not until very, very much later. </sentence><sentence id="2279">I -- even when I -- the first time I got back into my own hometown in Borken, which was Easter Saturday, the town had been taken on the Thursday, Thursday, that Thursday before Easter. </sentence><sentence id="2280">I knew about it, and you know, by that time I -- I was an officer, I could move around as I wanted to. </sentence><sentence id="2281">Everybody supported me, and I went into Borken, and we -- even at that time we realized that things were not over. </sentence><sentence id="2282">And you know, actually there were quite a number of people from sweep of troop -- tank commandoes, who were killed before Hannover. </sentence><sentence id="2283">You know, this is hundred miles away, this is almost on the -- on the line with -- where the two armies, the Russian and the -- a-and the ar -- western forces met. </sentence><sentence id="2284">Even there, there was still resistance. </sentence><sentence id="2285">It -- it was just unbelievable. </sentence><sentence id="2286">We knew this fa -- and they were fanatics, these people. </sentence><sentence id="2287">And the closer it was getting home to them, the c-ca -- th-the worse it got, and we had absolutely no illusion about it, that -- that there was still some heavy fighting ahead of us at all times. </sentence><sentence id="2288">We had -- we si -- it so happens that they -- they -- you know, we were on the Dutch -- Dutch front, it never lit up. </sentence><sentence id="2289">We -- we never personally were involved. </sentence><sentence id="2290">But at any moment we could have been told get over to this and this and this position, and that would have been -- and there would have been real fanatical resistance. </sentence><sentence id="2291">There was a very good friend of mine, a German writer, who wrote a -- a book called, "Five Minutes Before Midnight," where he describes how there's last minute resistance in this area, all the time, and of course he says this -- this led to the destruction of all these towns in -- in our home district, because there were always some fanatics who said they could hold out, and you had -- you had to -- had to take care of it. </sentence><sentence id="2292">Quite apart from the fact that we just knew if there was going to be an invasion of Japan, we were going to be in it. </sentence><sentence id="2293">This unit had been in the invasion of Sicily, had been in the inva -- invasion of Italy, had -- we had been in Normandy. </sentence><sentence id="2294">We had done the invasion of Washoe. </sentence><sentence id="2295">There -- no way was there going to be an invasion of Japan without us. </sentence><sentence id="2296">So, the war was not over. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2317">Q: And you were -- were you able to, you know, have enough strength throughout? </sentence><sentence id="2318">Was this -- you know, did you get used to living with just always having a certain amount of fear, or did that fear go away after awhile? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2321">A: No, w-we [indecipherable] particularly after we -- we felt very much experienced, battle experienced, superior to the -- to the Germans. </sentence><sentence id="2322">Better -- we were better equipped, we knew how to move better. </sentence><sentence id="2323">A lot of their strength had gone out by too fanatical resistance. </sentence><sentence id="2324">The fear -- the fear was not a real condition any more. </sentence><sentence id="2325">Ve -- very, very confident what we could do, particularly after the -- during and after the Washoe invasion. </sentence><sentence id="2326">It was a -- was a terrific morale booster for us that everything had gone so smoothly against incredible fortifications. </sentence><sentence id="2327">So -- so -- </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2328">Q: Where were you at the end of the war? </sentence><sentence id="2329">Where had you gotten to at that point? </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2330">A: We were still in the south of Holland, in -- you know, the -- that part of Holland never surrendered. </sentence><sentence id="2331">Th-the Germans never surrendered at all until I don't know wh -- well after -- even after we left. </sentence><sentence id="2332">So, you know, I had heard through people who had been -- go-gotten to Switzerland in this exchange of Eichmann's, of Jews against trucks, that my parents were in Theresienstadt, so I was set to go there at the earliest possible moment. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2891">Q: This is a continuation of a United States Holocaust Memorial Museum interview with Manfred Gans. </sentence><sentence id="2892">This is tape number five, side A. So I think we were just finishing up talking about when you were interrogating Germans, and I was wondering if you had any other feelings or encounters with not the -- those who had been high S:S. officials, but sort of more the ordinary Germans, and if there were any kind of different feelings you had, or did you kind of hold them responsible in the same way? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2895">A: I wa -- while I was -- the short time I was an -- actually a military [indecipherable], I -- of course I met a lot of ordinary Germans, and it -- I didn't have any prejudice against them. </sentence><sentence id="2896">I was willing to judge people on the basis of who they -- what they were, and who they were. </sentence><sentence id="2897">It was the -- I -- we were go -- gotten quite friendly, I mean not friendly from the point of view of fraternization, but ma -- with s -- with some of the Germans who were obviously had been -- not been [indecipherable] Nazis, and who were constructive. </sentence><sentence id="2898">We had to work for them. </sentence><sentence id="2899">Certainly in military government we did. </sentence><sentence id="2900">Then, of course, they made the rule, very wisely, that no extra -- extra Jew, or extra [indecipherable] could be in military government. </sentence><sentence id="2901">It would be a very good idea if the United States had the same rule for Iraq now. </sentence><sentence id="2902">It -- it -- it just is -- became -- was a bit of a shock that we had to leave military government, one day to the other, but I think it was an extremely wise decision. </sentence><sentence id="2903">They wanted to show the military how -- the British authorities and American authorities wanted to show -- no, I think it's only the British who did this, they wanted to show that they had confidence in the political leaders who were coming up wer -- like Adenauer and Schumacher, who were now coming up in Germany, and that they would not be sidetracked by anybody who had been -- who had left the country and who had not gone through the same experience as these political leaders had gone through. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2913">Q: So when were you discharged, and how old were you? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2915">A: I was discharged in August, in ni -- 1946. </sentence><sentence id="2916">At that time I was 24 years old, and wa -- in -- from one day to the other I changed my name back, I didn't -- didn't [indecipherable] to Manfred Gans from Fred Gray, and I was discharged on a Saturday night, and on Sunday morning I started studying for my entrance examination for the university, which I -- you know I had of course been back in England once or twice on -- on leave, and I tried to make arrangements for getting into university. </sentence><sentence id="2917">Now I wanted to go for chemical engineering because I -- there was a government grant for se -- ex-servicemen, and now all these things that I had thought were not possible before the war, were now possible. </sentence><sentence id="2918">The results of getting these -- what we -- you c-call in this country, G.I. grants. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2923">Q: And by now where's the rest of your family? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2925">A: Well, you know, my parents, of course died in the meantime. </sentence><sentence id="2926">They -- they -- my -- my parents went to -- c-came to Israel in 19 -- they were here fif -- that must have been [inaudible] I don't know, 1950 something. </sentence><sentence id="2927">I ca -- and you know they lived in Israel until they died. </sentence><sentence id="2928">My father died wa -- he was 95, so -- yeah, in ni -- 1980 he died. </sentence><sentence id="2929">So they lived a -- a very full life in Israel. </sentence><sentence id="2930">Very full, very good life. </sentence><sentence id="2931">Course they -- you know, th-they had pensions, and -- and the restitution from Germany, my father fought like blazes for all those things, and he knew how to do it. </sentence><sentence id="2932">So they had a pretty good life. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2943">A: My -- ma -- my older brother, of course, was in Israel all the time. </sentence><sentence id="2944">My younger brother went to Israel in 1952, I think. </sentence><sentence id="2945">Yeah, "51 -- it must have been 1952, yes. </sentence><sentence id="2946">Yeah, I think my parents went to Israel in 1953 or *54. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2951">Q: And when did you emigrate to the United States? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2953">A: I came here for the first time in 1948. </sentence><sentence id="2954">I got married, and I went back to England, and came to United States for good in 1950. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2957">Q: So I just have a couple overall questions and then we're done, I think. </sentence><sentence id="2958">When did you decide to write your memoirs about your experiences, and how long did that take you, and was that a difficult process or -- or not. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2961">A: Well it -- you know, par -- part of it I had written before. </sentence><sentence id="2962">I had written it for my niece in Israel, the one who drew your -- your attention to my story. </sentence><sentence id="2963">When she was doing -- she was going in for a master degree, and she felt that all she had to do was to translate my -- my holo -- my tere -- Terezin story, that will be enough. </sentence><sentence id="2964">But the authorities didn't let her get away with that, so she had to pose a large number of questions to me, and I answered those. </sentence><sentence id="2965">And a lot of it came out as such at that time. </sentence><sentence id="2966">I -- you know, it [indecipherable] about -- must have been in 2002 or so [inaudible], about 2002 sometime, I started to write, sitting down and writing things up on the computer. </sentence><sentence id="2967">And it's been -- it's been growing ever since. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2975">Q: Has it been hard to do, to write about these things? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2977">A: Oh yeah, yes. </sentence><sentence id="2978">It's ver -- ver -- th -- the main -- as I said, the main -- main hardship is not recounting all the experience, but realizing what terrible risks we took. </sentence><sentence id="2979">We were so inexperienced in the -- in the fighting stage, in the beginning. </sentence><sentence id="2980">We learned pretty fast, I suppose, but we -- we did things that were crazy, that -- that we would never have done if we had been more experienced. </sentence><sentence id="2981">That -- that part of it gave me nightmares, re-realizing how -- what -- what wrong steps we took. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2987">Q: Although it seems amazing to me that you have such detailed and vivid recall. </sentence><sentence id="2988">Have you always had that memory all along of -- of all these incidents? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2991">A: Well, I -- I don't -- don't think so, but I mean, these were very special experiences I have written up, and th-they -- you know, I recall them. </sentence><sentence id="2992">If I was to recall all the experience I've had in my professional life, I don't think it would be quite that experience, but I've had a very, very adventurous career in my professional life, too, and maybe if I sit down -- would -- would have sat down a year or two ago, and shud -- conjured up some of those experience again, it would have been -- would -- they would have come back. </sentence><sentence id="2993">But you know, you start concentrating, and as you know, of course, these were very unique experiences. </sentence><sentence id="2994">And so the -- Peter Maas's book has been quite an ex -- quite a motivation for it. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2999">Q: Are there certain sounds or smells that take you back to that time period? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3001">A: Mm, I don't know. </sentence><sentence id="3002">I -- I -- personally I don't have a very good smell -- sense of smell any more. </sentence><sentence id="3003">No, I don't -- I don't think that there -- that any of that nature would -- would take me back. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3007">Q: And when did you write about your journey to -- to find your parents? </sentence><sentence id="3008">That was at a different time, right? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3011">A: To find my parents? </sentence><sentence id="3012">When I wrote up the story? </sentence><sentence id="3013">The night I came back from the trip. </sentence><sentence id="3014">I wrote this whole story in one night. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3019">Q: And why -- why did you feel so motivated to do it right away? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3021">A: Because I wanted to inform all my friends of what I had -- what I had done. </sentence><sentence id="3022">I didn't think that was a historical document. </sentence><sentence id="3023">Luckily, the guy who typed it up, who was in -- with my -- who had also been in the unit already on D-Day, he said this is a historical document, I want to keep a copy of it. </sentence><sentence id="3024">So I wrote it up, and it took him about four or five days before he finished the typing of it all. </sentence><sentence id="3025">And I don't know that I've given you one of the originals. </sentence><sentence id="3026">I -- I can ge -- probably get a copy of one of the originals, the way it was originally typed up. </sentence><sentence id="3027">It's -- one of them is in Terezin,    my cousin deposited it in Terezin on one of their trips, the or -- original type, what this guy did. </sentence><sentence id="3028">Of course, has mistakes in it. </sentence><sentence id="3029">This one you have in there is -- which was done on a computer by my secretary is -- is more correct. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3040">Q: And finally, do you feel that there have been things in your life, decisions, or the way that you've approached things in your life that come directly from, you know, the experiences, what you went through during the war, what also, in general, the Holocaust, you know, that experience? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3042">A: Yeah, yeah, it's hard for -- it's hard for non-technical people to realize that, but the fact of the matter is that I've had a few -- if -- if -- as I've done, if you put a large chemical plant on line, with a new process, new, untried equipment, and all that sort of thing, the -- the experience is more telling than almost anything I'd done in the war. </sentence><sentence id="3043">As I said in one of the comparison, on the night of the fifth or sixth of June 1944, we landed in fra -- landed in Normandy, 1944, in the night of the fifth and sixth of June 1957, I put a high pressure, or elevated pressure chlorination plant on line in -- in southern France, and I sweated more blood in 1957 than I did in 1944. </sentence><sentence id="3044">But it's very hard for non-technical people to realize what is involved in the invention, development, design and start-up -- a commercialization start-up of a chemical process. </sentence><sentence id="3045">That -- that's one -- on aspect of it. </sentence><sentence id="3046">So there have been very -- a lot of very interesting experiences. </sentence><sentence id="3047">The highlight of my professional career, I suppose, was my giving a lecture in the University of Hanoi in 1986, to a totally hostile -- hostile audience, trying to persuade them to give up doing basic research, when they should do applied research, and you know, as I -- as I said, they were totally hostile, not willing to listen. </sentence><sentence id="3048">I -- as I said, in one state I was in the University of Hanoi lecturing 13 years before Mr. Clinton did so, and the atmosphere was still very different then. </sentence><sentence id="3049">But -- </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3058">Q: I -- Is -- I think I read somewhere that you -- you've also been back to Germany and have spoken to students there. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3060">A: Yes, regularly. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3062">Q: And what's -- what's that been like for you? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3064">A: Regularly. </sentence><sentence id="3065">Oh that's a very interesting experience, very worthwhile. </sentence><sentence id="3066">In 1988, on the anniversary -- or was it the -- the 50" anniversary of Kristallnacht, they invited us back from my hometown, and we, the Jews, or a lot of us came back. </sentence><sentence id="3067">My two brothers came from Israel with their wives. </sentence><sentence id="3068">Everybody could bring one companion, my wife came along. </sentence><sentence id="3069">And we -- I made a condition for coming back, we made that we were going to be allowed to lecture in the schools. </sentence><sentence id="3070">And the people were so enthused about what we did, that they kept on inviting us again and again. </sentence><sentence id="3071">I've been there almost every second year, my younger brother, while he was alive, he s -- he died in the meantime, he went there back every year to lecture, and it was a very worthwhile experience. </sentence><sentence id="3072">I insisted on not only lecturing on my war experience, and the Holocaust and all that, but also on Judaism, and the basic concepts of Judaism, which went down extremely well. </sentence><sentence id="3073">It's a great privilege to do that. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3084">Q: And students you found were receptive? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3086">A: Oh very. </sentence><sentence id="3087">Extremely receptive. </sentence><sentence id="3088">They -- well, of course it depended a little bit as to who the teacher was. </sentence><sentence id="3089">If there was a teacher that had prepared them for this, they were very much more [indecipherable] than if it was just somebody who let us cu-cut in. </sentence><sentence id="3090">But this was a very worthwhile experience. </sentence><sentence id="3091">And as I said, they paid for it. </sentence><sentence id="3092">They gave us all expenses. </sentence><sentence id="3093">I've written up a lot about these experiences. </sentence><sentence id="3094">Unfortunately I have not [indecipherable] but when the BBC thought of making a film about my life, they wanted to incorporate this into their -- into that film. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="3095">And no -- and just -- and th-they -- they, in fact they asked me, think you can get us some non -- </sentence></p><p><sentence id="3096"> ex-Nazis, who have not -- non -- what do -- ho-how do you call it, non-regenerated? </sentence><sentence id="3097">The wa -- y- you know? </sentence><sentence id="3098">I said I can, yes I can. </sentence><sentence id="3099">I know we -- we can produce it. </sentence><sentence id="3100">It's still there. </sentence><sentence id="3101">So -- </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3102">Q: Did you enjoy going back to Germany? </sentence><sentence id="3103">Was there a part of you that enjoyed going back? </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3104">A: I did, I enjoyed it very much, after the first experience. </sentence><sentence id="3105">My wife in the -- the first time -- she only went along once, she was very apprehensive about it, very apprehensive. </sentence><sentence id="3106">She somewhat frightened, but maybe she was already coming down with the sickness at the time. </sentence><sentence id="3107">So -- </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3108">Q: And your -- in the house where you grew up, tell me just about the different stages it went through during the course of the war. </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3109">A: Well, when my parents left it became Gestapo headquarters. </sentence><sentence id="3110">And they even had a torture chamber in our wine cellar. </sentence><sentence id="3111">And then it was taken over by the mili -- British military government as the headquarters for the district. </sentence><sentence id="3112">This was when I came back there, only two days after -- after the town has been liberated, the advance people were just mo -- moving in. </sentence><sentence id="3113">It stayed that way for awhile, and after that they sold it, or they -- it was handed over to the German police. </sentence><sentence id="3114">It became police headquarters in the town for a little while, not very long. </sentence><sentence id="3115">And then it went back into private possession. </sentence><sentence id="3116">At the moment it's largely -- there are four lawyers in it, I think it's [indecipherable] their offices in there. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3133">Q: I know you have a lot of experiences. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3135">A: I want to tell you one other little story that's very interesting. </sentence><sentence id="3136">You know, when I was in -- preparing these, we were in the zenolager, with high ranking Nazis who had to investigate the attempt on Hitler's life, inter -- interviewing some of these generals, you know? </sentence><sentence id="3137">And I was asking them exactly what they went through in order to get into a conference with Hitler. </sentence><sentence id="3138">These guys were hardly searched at all. </sentence><sentence id="3139">It -- unbelievable, you know? </sentence><sentence id="3140">I -- so I took all this down, and didn't say anything, didn't say anything [indecipherable]. </sentence><sentence id="3141">And I said -- said to one of those guys. </sentence><sentence id="3142">"You goddamn idiots. </sentence><sentence id="3143">You were not willing to take the risks which we on the -- soldiers on the field had to take. </sentence><sentence id="3144">It would have been so easy of you to -- for you to take out a pistol and shoot this guy, and pilt -- ge -- get rid of him, and get rid of the war, and all that sort of thing. </sentence><sentence id="3145">And if you -- you -- after all, you had free access to him." </sentence><sentence id="3146">So the guy said, "But captain, in view of Field Marshall Sbaten, the spine becomes rubber." </sentence><sentence id="3147">I -- I [indecipherable] understand. </sentence><sentence id="3148">That's all -- all they wanted to be, get a field Marshall, become a field Marshall. </sentence></p></dialogue>
