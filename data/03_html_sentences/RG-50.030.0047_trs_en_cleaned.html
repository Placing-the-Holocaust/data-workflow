said, "Listen. </sentence><sentence id="1120">We have to do this." </sentence><sentence id="1121">So she was looking, and she find on the hill is like a side street on the border of the town. </sentence><sentence id="1122">The name of Tatarska (ph) Street. </sentence><sentence id="1123">And this was like a nice small cottage. </sentence><sentence id="1124">And I came with her once there

id="1136">And there was like a ladder from the hole. </sentence><sentence id="1137">There was a hole between attic. </sentence><sentence id="1138">So I was thinking, "Later." </sentence><sentence id="1139">But for first thing, I said, "Instead of sit in the open attic, maybe we will be there." </sentence><sentence id="1140">But then came the father of, the father of the girl, and, and came another, my friend. </sentence><sentence id="1141">So was a little more people. </sentence><sentence id="1142">And I...I don't know what to do. </sentence><sentence id="1143">I said, "Now we have to go upstairs because we cannot be in the hole." </sentence><sentence id="1144">So we are, we are sitting in the open attic. </sentence><sentence id="1145">And then I told to my wife, "Look, maybe we will find an old wood, something that we can call and make a first row similar to this round wood." </sentence><sentence id="1146">This would be nothing new. </sentence><sentence id="1147">And I said,

</sentence><sentence id="1150">And they brought her this, and she said she like to have this for wintertime for, for fire. </sentence><sentence id="1151">So they left this. </sentence><sentence id="1152">And she brought this little by little inside. </sentence><sentence id="1153">The neighbors was asking, "What?" </sentence><sentence id="1154">She said, "No, for I like to cut this and cut

cut it by little and we make numbers that everything will fit. </sentence><sentence id="1158">Then we have to nail this. </sentence><sentence id="1159">There will be noise. </sentence><sentence id="1160">So I advised my wife  2 make washing, laundry -- everything. </sentence><sentence id="1161">And ask them if they have ropes and nails, that you will put them in attic, you will hang them and they will dry. </sentence><sentence id="1162">The, the, you know, the washed laundry. </sentence><sentence id="1163">So that. </sentence><sentence id="1164">So they did, and this time, instead of putting nails and put, you know, the ropes, we know they, they were fast. </sentence><sentence id="1165">Then we put a little also outside, and if you put everything there, there will be not now, they will be exact like is dirt and, and from the spiders. </sentence><sentence id="1166">The -- took from our place they put another place. </sentence><sentence id="1167">Was look exactly like old thing. </sentence><sentence id="1168">And this the, the attic was shut in maybe like two yards. </sentence><sentence id="1169">I make sure of it. </sentence><sentence id="1170">And I make, make the roof was going on an angle, so I make a small door, so that I can every time open, watch and close right away if somebody will come. </sentence><sentence id="1171">And I was this what I have my curved spine. </sentence><sentence id="1172">And that's because almost two weeks I was laying like this, because I was watching always if somebody not come. </sentence><sentence id="1173">And it's hard to know.
