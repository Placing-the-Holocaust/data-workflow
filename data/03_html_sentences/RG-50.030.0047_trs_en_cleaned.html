</sentence><sentence id="1112">So she was looking, and she find on the hill is like a side street on the border of the town. </sentence><sentence id="1113">The name of Tatarska (ph) Street.

was a little more people. </sentence><sentence id="1133">And I...I don't know what to do. </sentence><sentence id="1134">I said, "Now we have to go upstairs because we cannot be in the hole." </sentence><sentence id="1135">So we are, we are sitting in the open attic. </sentence><sentence id="1136">And then I told to my wife, "Look, maybe we will find an old wood, something that we can call and make a first row similar to this round wood." </sentence><sentence id="1137">This would be nothing new. </sentence><sentence id="1138">And I said, "We will make a false wall, do something."
