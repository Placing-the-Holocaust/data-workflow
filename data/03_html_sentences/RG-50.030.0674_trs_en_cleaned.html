<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="304">Q: Okay. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="306">A: I do not -- I know he also tried to leave in 1938. </sentence><sentence id="307">Again, it was an American visa, and the unfortunate thing was that he had a choice of leaving from Genoa or Bremen -- </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="308">Q: Okay </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="309">A: -- and he picked Bremen, and the Germans wouldn't give us transit visas. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="372">A: Okay. </sentence><sentence id="373">In 1938, I mentioned my father had customers from Germany, from Italy, from Hungary, Austria, who have heard of the quality and the, the design styling that he was known for; and this woman came up from Berlin, and she came to my father's jewelry salon to buy some jewelry, and she bought nice amount, and she came back every year to buy more jewelry. </sentence><sentence id="374">And in 1940 -- I'm not sure if it was "40 or "41, he brought up a little charm bracelet that she owned, and she asked my father to clean it up and bring it back into ? </sentence><sentence id="375">varible? </sentence><sentence id="376">shape. </sentence><sentence id="377">And my father, when working on the bracelet, he noticed that there was a tiny Star of David hidden among the, close to a hundred different tiny charms; and when she came back, my father put the bracelet down on the counter, and in a way that the Star of David was showing, telling her that he noticed that she had the Star of David; and she bought more jewelry, and she told my father that if things in the future will get really, really rough, and you would like to take your family to Palestine, I'll give you a name and a phone number whom to call, and you can tell him, if you come to that, who sent you. </sentence><sentence id="378">My father thanked her, put the paper away in his safe and more or less forgot about it. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="386">Q: Do you remember what her name was? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="388">A: No, Ido not. </sentence><sentence id="389">I know one thing that -- well, I'm giving away the punch line, but her husband was also executed in Nuremberg. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="396">Q: Okay. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="398">A: So then I think that progressed, and the 1944 march, the Germans entered Hungary and occupied it, and life has changed totally. </sentence><sentence id="399">And my father was also conscripted for forced labor, and he was -- I mean, they surmised that he'd, they'd be taken to the Russian front; and, of course, my mother and him had acquired warm winter clothing, and he had a pair of waterproof boots made for himself to go; and he told the shoemaker because in those days everything was custom made, there was no off-the-rack stuff, and that he doesn't want any hobnails on those boots. </sentence></p></dialogue>
