<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="11">Q: When were you born? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="13">A: I was born in mid 1935, so I am just about 55 years old now, and that made me 6 years old in 1941 when the Germans came in. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="15">Q: Before the Germans came in, what do you remember of your very early years and I guess when the Russians came in? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="17">A: Okay. </sentence><sentence id="18">I remember a pretty happy sort of carefree childhood. </sentence><sentence id="19">Although it turned out we were not rich. </sentence><sentence id="20">In fact we were quite poor for a certain reason that happened earlier which is germane to this story. </sentence><sentence id="21">But Popberezha is a beautiful scenic area. </sentence><sentence id="22">It's a resort town. </sentence><sentence id="23">People came there for vacations. </sentence><sentence id="24">It's well known as a vacation spot. </sentence><sentence id="25">I remember people talking about...oh, this famous person came and that person came and so on and so forth. </sentence><sentence id="26">So it's a beautiful area on two rivers. </sentence><sentence id="27">With bridges across the town or city as we call it. </sentence><sentence id="28">It's a small town. </sentence><sentence id="29">Roughly half Jewish and half mostly Polish people. </sentence><sentence id="30">Maybe 5,000 people altogether, about 2,000 Jews in the area. </sentence><sentence id="31">And there was a small place. </sentence><sentence id="32">It was a very safe place. </sentence><sentence id="33">The Jewish area was sort of by itself but not any significant amount of anti-Semitism. </sentence><sentence id="34">The Jews and the Poles got along reasonably well together which is unusual. </sentence><sentence id="35">And I remember it as a happy place and an enjoyable place with games and playing and running by the river and all kinds of adventures or misadventures. </sentence><sentence id="36">Stuff like that. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="57">Q: Tell me about your parents. </sentence><sentence id="58">What did your father do? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="61">A: Okay. </sentence><sentence id="62">My father was in business similar to his father in dealing with buying grain from farmers and reselling it, so he was a grain merchant he would call it. </sentence><sentence id="63">A total of seven brothers and sisters that he had, so I am dealing here on his side an extended family. </sentence><sentence id="64">They were all married. </sentence><sentence id="65">He was one of the youngest in the family so we're dealing with an extended family about 50 odd people. </sentence><sentence id="66">And my mother's family, she had a sister there. </sentence><sentence id="67">That's all because they were quasi-recent immigrants having been displaced during World This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="68">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="69"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection War | and they came to this area after that but my father's family had lived there for many, many years so my mother's family was more scattered and the rest of her family was in different places. </sentence><sentence id="70">In fact, one sister was in another place called Soly, which helped us out later. </sentence><sentence id="71">But my father's family comes from an old Misnagid [non-chassidik] family .The whole area was Misnagid because of the Wilner Gaon and so forth. </sentence><sentence id="72">And my grandfather, Alav haShalom [may he rest in peace] was a very very staunch you might say stern type individual, but a very honorable person who believed in doing everything by the book if I can say it that way. </sentence><sentence id="73">Well known individual who paid for it in a certain way, but the Nazis when they came in they usually picked on somebody who they considered the leader of the community. </sentence><sentence id="74">I don't know why they picked on my grandfather because he was not the Rav [rabbi] but we have eye witness accounts that he was the one picked on. </sentence><sentence id="75">They beat him. </sentence><sentence id="76">They ripped his beard out, and they blinded him before they shot him. </sentence><sentence id="77">So that was not a good way to end your life at the age of 81. </sentence><sentence id="78">But he also was a grain merchant, but when I knew him he was very, very, very poor because something happened 20 years prior to that that made him poor. </sentence><sentence id="79">And that's an important story I have to tell you because that's what saved our life. </sentence><sentence id="80">It happened that he used to buy and sell grain from the local farmers. </sentence><sentence id="81">Local farmers in that area were very poor. </sentence><sentence id="82">They were sharecroppers because the primary ownership of land in this feudal society in Poland was from the large landowners a form of nobility. </sentence><sentence id="83">However, there was one farmer who for some strange means had acquired his own land and acquired a little bit of a farm and he was considered rich by those standards. </sentence><sentence id="84">And my grandfather used to do a lot of business with this man. </sentence><sentence id="85">One day it seems 15 years before the war or something like that, Grandfather decided that the way to...to really go was to become not only a merchant but a miller because the real money to be made was in turning the grain into flour. </sentence><sentence id="86">There were three mills in our town, all water-operated mills on the rivers. </sentence><sentence id="87">When one mill became available, he decide to buy it. </sentence><sentence id="88">And so he bought this mill and he spent everything he had...everything he could borrow to buy this mill and he had no money to buy grain. </sentence><sentence id="89">So he went to this particular farmer with whom he had dealt many times before and he made an agreement that he would buy the grain on credit. </sentence><sentence id="90">I don't know what the deal was, how much extra he paid him, but the farmer trusted him and he sold him the grain on credit. </sentence><sentence id="91">And the grain came in and it was put into the mill. </sentence><sentence id="92">It was all filled up and then according to the story apparently it was arson but nobody proved anything because the idea was the other two millers were jealous because they were afraid that he would become too much of a competitor. </sentence><sentence id="93">The mill caught fire and it was on the Sabbath. </sentence><sentence id="94">And it was on the river and people could have put it out. </sentence><sentence id="95">They started to put it out, but my grandfather came out and he said, "There is nobody in there. </sentence><sentence id="96">No lives are involved. </sentence><sentence id="97">You will not put it out. </sentence><sentence id="98">It's Sabbath." </sentence><sentence id="99">And he forbade them to put out this fire and the mill burned to the ground and all the grain with it. </sentence><sentence id="100">So he was bankrupt and he owed this farmer for all the grain. </sentence><sentence id="101">Now the farmer could have probably taken him to court or something, but I don't know what he could have done. </sentence><sentence id="102">In any event, my grandfather then walked about 20 miles or whatever the distance was to the farmer's house, the farm and he told the farmer that he would pay him back everything no matter how long it took. </sentence><sentence id="103">And it took something like 10, 15 years. </sentence><sentence id="104">Everything he had, everything This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="105">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="106"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection he could get, and there were some...there was a son in the United States who sent money home. </sentence><sentence id="107">Everything the family went to this farmer to pay back for the grain. </sentence><sentence id="108">That's why the family was poor. </sentence><sentence id="109">Now, the critical issue is that after the Germans came in we escaped. </sentence><sentence id="110">Many Jews escaped. </sentence><sentence id="111">Those who had no money they usually did not survive because they couldn't pay anybody and people were not that altruistic because it was very, very dangerous. </sentence><sentence id="112">Those who had money they did not survive either because eventually they came in contact with somebody who killed them for their money because it was very easy to kill a Jew. </sentence><sentence id="113">There were no penalties whatsoever. </sentence><sentence id="114">So anybody who wanted to kill a Jew and take their money, they just did it. </sentence><sentence id="115">We had no money. </sentence><sentence id="116">Nobody would kill us for our money. </sentence><sentence id="117">But what we had is the honor of the family that spent 15 years paying off. </sentence><sentence id="118">And this farmer's sons hid my father with the belief that if we survived they would be rewarded, and they knew that he meant it. </sentence><sentence id="119">So through this mill that burned down and my grandfather spending 15 years paying this farmer and his sons knowing that my father was the son of this man, they were willing to take the chance. </sentence><sentence id="120">So in a way he was paid for letting this thing burn down because he said you do not do work on Sabbath. ( </sentence><sentence id="121">Long Pause) There's a reason for everything. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="202">Q: Tell us what you remember. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="204">A: I remember that extremely well. </sentence><sentence id="205">I was standing by the road and my mother was screaming at me to come inside and it was the most fascinating sight that I had ever seen. </sentence><sentence id="206">This is a little town with dirt roads, not even paved, you understand. </sentence><sentence id="207">When we say roads it was the place where carts went, wagons. </sentence><sentence id="208">And I had never seen more than one automobile per month before and here were these cars, tanks, armored carriers, whatever, going for hours and hours on end. </sentence><sentence id="209">Non-stop! </sentence><sentence id="210">And I just couldn't understand it. </sentence><sentence id="211">I didn't understand where these things came from. </sentence><sentence id="212">It was like magic, and it was just so fascinating to stand by the road and the dust and these things rumbling and making noises and so forth and finally she came and snatched me away because she thought it was dangerous. </sentence><sentence id="213">It wasn't dangerous. </sentence><sentence id="214">These people weren't doing anything. </sentence><sentence id="215">And they seemed to be going on for days. </sentence><sentence id="216">It wasn't. </sentence><sentence id="217">I am sure it was hours, but it seemed as if there were millions and millions of these tanks just non-stop continually going and going and going and going. </sentence><sentence id="218">And the Russians came and took over the place and russified it or whatever the right word is. </sentence><sentence id="219">They changed the administration. </sentence><sentence id="220">A lot of people were rounded up and sent to Siberia, the so-called wealthy and the landowners and the anti-communists and This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="221">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="222"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection whoever they feared. </sentence><sentence id="223">Our life didn't change much because we were not rich to start with, as I told you the story and so forth. </sentence><sentence id="224">And we had a house, but that didn't make us into landowners. </sentence><sentence id="225">And life went on as before, and no significant changes of any kind except there was a lot of tension, the fear. </sentence><sentence id="226">You could sense different behaviors. </sentence><sentence id="227">Of course, there were stories which I didn't understand at the time about the atrocities in Poland, in the German occupied part of Poland. </sentence><sentence id="228">There were refugees that were coming through telling horrifying stories that nobody believed. </sentence><sentence id="229">I mean it couldn't possibly be that bad, you know, and so forth. </sentence><sentence id="230">But on the whole, it continued to be peaceful and most of what I remember of the town...in fact, about what it looked like and...and it's beauty and so forth I think is more from that time than before "39 because I was very young, only 4 years old in "39. </sentence><sentence id="231">It's hard to remember precisely. </sentence><sentence id="232">There is one memory that I am certain is before "39 because I fell into something, almost got killed, but anyhow. </sentence><sentence id="233">It was a childhood accident. </sentence><sentence id="234">But otherwise, the Russians didn't do anything to us, but there were various changes in the atmosphere which was more of World War II than the Russians themselves. </sentence><sentence id="235">And then in 1941 in June very suddenly...it happened very quickly as I assume it happened everywhere. </sentence><sentence id="236">The Russians were there one day, and then they weren't there. </sentence><sentence id="237">There was hardly any fighting. </sentence><sentence id="238">There was no front. </sentence><sentence id="239">There was nothing. </sentence><sentence id="240">All of a sudden there were no Russians and there were Germans. </sentence><sentence id="241">And we knew they were there because right out from this town was a very large military camp, a big military base barracks where military were stationed. </sentence><sentence id="242">They lived there. </sentence><sentence id="243">They had barracks there. </sentence><sentence id="244">Right out side of Popberezha, about couple of kilometers. </sentence><sentence id="245">A very, very large camp and the soldiers used to come into town sometimes. </sentence><sentence id="246">All of a sudden before that there were Poles that were there. </sentence><sentence id="247">The Russians came in and the Russians took over that camp and made it into a Russian military camp. </sentence><sentence id="248">And all of a sudden, the Russians weren't there and the Germans were there. </sentence><sentence id="249">So the Russians interlude was sort of a beginning and an end and sort of no middle to me. </sentence><sentence id="250">Okay. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="300">Q: Tell me about the Germans and what happened. </sentence><sentence id="301">How did life change. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="304"> A Well, the Germans came and the Jews were...two basic orders. </sentence><sentence id="305">One was a location order and since the Jews tended to live in a certain area anyhow there wasn't really that much relocation. </sentence><sentence id="306">Some people had to move and it got a little bit more crowded, but it didn't crowd us all that much. </sentence><sentence id="307">They just adjusted the boundaries of the Jewish quarter because the Jews and the Poles did not intermingle all that much even though it was a combined Jewish-Polish town. </sentence><sentence id="308">The Jews lived in one area, and the Poles lived in another area. </sentence><sentence id="309">And so the few Jews who lived outside of this area were forced to come in and find places with friends, relatives, whoever it may be, and it got a little bit more crowded. </sentence><sentence id="310">The other thing, of course, was that there were curfews and you could not leave this quarter. </sentence><sentence id="311">There were boundaries but no real fences, no barbed wire, no real guards to speak of. </sentence><sentence id="312">You had to be there, and the This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="313">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="314"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection penalty was harsh. </sentence><sentence id="315">If you were found outside it, you were shot. </sentence><sentence id="316">And they did do a lot of shooting of people. </sentence><sentence id="317">Terror killings. </sentence><sentence id="318">They came in and just took little groups here and there. </sentence><sentence id="319">And no rhyme or reason. </sentence><sentence id="320">Presumably they were leaders or whatever, but many people that were killed, they were not leaders. </sentence><sentence id="321">I don't understand what the rationale was. </sentence><sentence id="322">Maybe just to generate enough fear that people would obey orders and not argue about it. </sentence><sentence id="323">And people had to wear the yellow star. </sentence><sentence id="324">You had to wear two stars, one front and one back. </sentence><sentence id="325">And if you were caught without a star, the penalty was death. </sentence><sentence id="326">So you had to wear the star to be identified fully as a Jew. </sentence><sentence id="327">And you were not permitted to go outside the Jewish quarter. </sentence><sentence id="328">Life became more difficult in terms of food and making a living because all the relationships and business things, and whatever the case may be...those could not exist anymore. </sentence><sentence id="329">So people lived off of accumulations and savings or whatever. </sentence><sentence id="330">But that was of no consequence because we're dealing with only 3 months and I am sure the people had enough capital or whatever to live for 3 months. </sentence><sentence id="331">So there was no real transition to Jew(ish) ghetto situation. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="362">Q: How did you feel the change as a kid? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="364">A: The change was a different life style. </sentence><sentence id="365">It's a tension, and it was very clear...the kids understood it very well. </sentence><sentence id="366">There were no arguments about the curfews and not being able to go to certain places that you used to go and so forth. </sentence><sentence id="367">It was very clear that this was serious. </sentence><sentence id="368">This was real. </sentence><sentence id="369">This wasn't just parental whim...no, you can't go here because whatever the case may be. </sentence><sentence id="370">This was very clear that the kids almost...it's almost like a law of nature. </sentence><sentence id="371">At that age you understand that you don't jump off the roof because it is dangerous and it isn't just that your parent is afraid. </sentence><sentence id="372">You really don't jump off the roof because you may get hurt and you're old enough and smart enough to know that you don't want that to happen to you. </sentence><sentence id="373">It was almost that kind of a thing. </sentence><sentence id="374">It was not an issue of somebody telling you. </sentence><sentence id="375">You knew you did not do these things. </sentence><sentence id="376">It was almost as if it was a physical law. </sentence><sentence id="377">You didn't cross this barrier because something horrible would happen.sothere was no issue about dis...disobeying anybody or...or trying some childish tricks about these rules. </sentence><sentence id="378">You stayed where you were supposed to stay. </sentence><sentence id="379">You wore the yellow star like you were supposed to wear the yellow star. </sentence><sentence id="380">It was a very strange experience in terms of growing up. </sentence><sentence id="381">There was a jump of years. </sentence><sentence id="382">I would think that normally a child would not acquire that kind of mental outlook till later. </sentence><sentence id="383">And in my case I was 6, and it happened very fast and I don't know exactly how the adjustment was made, but I do recall that all of a sudden I had this outlook that this is normal. </sentence><sentence id="384">This is how you were supposed to do and it wasn't a matter of somebody telling me. </sentence><sentence id="385">I believed it. </sentence><sentence id="386">So there was some kind of mental adjustment. </sentence><sentence id="387">I had no idea how it was done. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="413">Q: You were an observant family I understand it...Jewishly observant family. </sentence><sentence id="414">Did that...did the curfew affect that? </sentence></p></dialogue>

" </sentence><sentence id="433">Wissenschaft" Jewish knowledge institute, the Jewish Knowledge Institute or whatever the proper translation would be. </sentence><sentence id="434">And it was a modern type movement dealing with current events as opposed to historical Judaism, and dealing with the Yiddish language as a force and the Yiddish literature as a force. </sentence><sentence id="435">And many of these people were totally unobservant in the sense of holding to the Mitzvoth because they believed (not) in the Torah. </sentence><sentence id="436">But that was a way of life and it would be very fine for these people not to follow through. </sentence><sentence id="437">So they were traditional in the sense of this is how a Jew lived whereas those who were observant were this is how a Jew lived and this is how a Jew must live. </sentence><sentence id="438">It's a very fine distinction in that case. </sentence><sentence id="439">Today, of course, the distinctions are much greater. </sentence><sentence id="440">So I don't think there was any impact in terms of the behavior of the town because that's how Jews lived. </sentence><sentence id="441">And all of the stuff was internal anyway. </sentence><sentence id="442">It isn't as if you went across the street to a Polish friend and had a ham sandwich. </sentence><sentence id="443">So if you are talking about kosher food it was all Jewishly created in any event and the fact that the Germans were around us that didn't change anything. </sentence><sentence id="444">At least I don't recall it. </sentence><sentence id="445">I mean this is a very poor perspective from a 6 year old, but that's how I recall it. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="472">Q: How did things change? </sentence><sentence id="473">When did things change? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="476">A: Well, things changed a couple of months after the Germans came really....significantly in that places started disappearing. </sentence><sentence id="477">I don't know how else to say it. </sentence><sentence id="478">All of a sudden a certain place wasn't there. </sentence><sentence id="479">There were no Jews there. </sentence><sentence id="480">It as if it was pulled off the map and shipped off to Mars or something. </sentence><sentence id="481">Somebody would come in, "I escaped. </sentence><sentence id="482">All the rest are gone."

whatever and just lived all over the place. </sentence><sentence id="587">It happened that one of the local police functionaries was friendly with a certain Jews because of some prior favors that they had done to each other. </sentence><sentence id="588">And he knew that these people came in and they were organizing various things. </sentence><sentence id="589">He didn't know precisely why but it was quite obvious. </sentence><sentence id="590">And so he came to his Jewish friend and he said, "Something is going to happen. </sentence><sentence id="591">You have hours before the place will be surrounded and nobody will be able to get out." </sentence><sentence id="592">This man sent out the alarm. </sentence><sentence id="593">Most people (a) didn't believe it and (b) had no idea what to do anyhow. </sentence><sentence id="594">They weren't going to leave children. </sentence><sentence id="595">They weren't going to leave parents, and they had no place to go and they said, "If 1 am going to die, I might as well die right here." </sentence><sentence id="596">Many people such as my father believed it more or less but they wouldn't go because in prior times there had been false alarms and there was a great deal of looting and people were afraid of losing their few possessions because really you were not going to have a chance to work or do anything useful to gain more possessions. </sentence><sentence id="597">But there was some work I should say. </sentence><sentence id="598">The Germans put the Jews to work in slave labor and it was very hard work. </sentence><sentence id="599">In fact, my father worked at slave labor and he fell down. </sentence><sentence id="600">It This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="601">It

ribs and...and that was the situation. </sentence><sentence id="605">But anyhow my father decided to send my mother, brother and myself out. </sentence><sentence id="606">We...we agreed where they would go and he said he knew the area very well. </sentence><sentence id="607">He was a strong man. </sentence><sentence id="608">He was a very, very strong physically, my father in spite of his broken rib, and he felt confident that he could get out no matter what they did because he knew the area extremely well and he would be able to hide and sneak through. </sentence><sentence id="609">He said, "I am going to stay home and if there's looting I'll stop them. </sentence><sentence id="610">If something is happening I'll come meet you there next day." </sentence><sentence id="611">So we packed up some food. </sentence><sentence id="612">It was the Sabbath food, some chicken I remember and a few other things in a bundle, dressed up as peasant woman and took off the yellow stars and we walked right out of town. </sentence><sentence id="613">Nobody stopped us. </sentence><sentence id="614">There were no guards. </sentence><sentence id="615">There was no nothing. </sentence><sentence id="616">The problem was we had to walk right by the military barracks. </sentence><sentence id="617">And that scared us because we were sure that these people would do something. </sentence><sentence id="618">But they didn't. </sentence><sentence id="619">They had nothing to do with it. </sentence><sentence id="620">Those were ordinary soldiers. </sentence><sentence id="621">The Einsatzgruppen group were the SS, and the soldiers were soldiers, and we were just peasants walking by. </sentence><sentence id="622">We walked right by the barracks a couple of miles out of town where there's a little road to the side where all these Germans...the soldiers were staying, and we saw them coming and going and we just kept walking. </sentence><sentence id="623">And it was nothing. </sentence><sentence id="624">And so we kept walking. </sentence><sentence id="625">And we had a couple of hours walk to get out of town to a certain farm of a woman that our family knew, had done some business with her. </sentence><sentence id="626">Fine lady presumably. </sentence><sentence id="627">She was a widow, had a teenage son. </sentence><sentence id="628">I would guess 15, 16 years old. </sentence><sentence id="629">And we came there and she was at home and mother told her something is happening and we need to hide. </sentence><sentence id="630">The woman was very fearful. </sentence><sentence id="631">She didn't want us there, but she couldn't turn us away. </sentence><sentence id="632">So she said, "Okay. </sentence><sentence id="633">I won't let you in the house. </sentence><sentence id="634">I am afraid. </sentence><sentence id="635">Go stay in the barn." </sentence><sentence id="636">There was a barn, and there was hay in the barn, and we crawled up in the loft and the hay, and the barn walls were not wood. </sentence><sentence id="637">They were kind of straw and we could see through the chinks in the matted straw. </sentence><sentence id="638">And during the night we started hearing shooting. </sentence><sentence id="639">So it was bad. </sentence><sentence id="640">It was clear that something was really going on. </sentence><sentence id="641">It was a lot of shooting. </sentence><sentence id="642">And father was supposed to come during the night if something would happen. </sentence><sentence id="643">He didn't come. </sentence><sentence id="644">And so we were sure that he couldn't get out. </sentence><sentence id="645">That was the end of him. </sentence><sentence id="646">In the morning we didn't know what to do. </sentence><sentence id="647">But before we could do something, a Lithuanian local auxiliary came to the house and he wanted to know if any Jews were in the area and the woman, "I haven't...I don't know anything about Jews. </sentence><sentence id="648">No Jews in my house. </sentence><sentence id="649">If you want, come in and look." </sentence><sentence id="650">And he says, "There are other areas. </sentence><sentence id="651">What about your barn? </sentence><sentence id="652">Jews have sneaked into the barn." </sentence><sentence id="653">She said, "Silly, what would Jews be doing ina barn?" " </sentence><sentence id="654">Listen, you have been working very hard," she says, "it's been a horrible day. </sentence><sentence id="655">They're working all night chasing these terrible Jews. </sentence><sentence id="656">Come in and have something to eat and you can chase some more Jews." </sentence><sentence id="657">He says, "Okay," so they went into the house. </sentence><sentence id="658">And she gave him breakfast. </sentence><sentence id="659">I don't know what. </sentence><sentence id="660">He was eating breakfast and her teenage son came into the barn and we heard this and this was very close so we could hear them talking. </sentence><sentence id="661">We saw him with a gun, a bolt action rifle. </sentence><sentence id="662">I remember it. </sentence><sentence id="663">You had to pull the bolt, an old type rifle. </sentence><sentence id="664">And the son came in and he said, "I'm going to get you across the river. </sentence><sentence id="665">Come quickly." </sentence><sentence id="666">Now Popberezha is on two rivers as I said. </sentence><sentence id="667">One is a major river This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="668">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="669"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection called the Lyna [this river is far west from Vilnius!] </sentence><sentence id="670">which you will find in all the big maps I think. </sentence><sentence id="671">It was the Lyna that was going over there or it could have been the other one. </sentence><sentence id="672">I can't swear to it. </sentence><sentence id="673">Anyhow he came with a boat. </sentence><sentence id="674">We got into the boat and he was rowing us across the river and we were about two-thirds across and for whatever reason this person saw us through the window. </sentence><sentence id="675">He got up, he stretched or whatever. </sentence><sentence id="676">He saw us through the window. </sentence><sentence id="677">He dropped his where the .......2?

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1261">Q: Tell me a little more about life in the attic and how the farmer helped you particularly. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1263">A: Yes. </sentence><sentence id="1264">Yeah. </sentence><sentence id="1265">I don't know how the deal came about, but my parents...my father used to go out and work sometime on the farm. </sentence><sentence id="1266">If somebody saw him, they could get away with it. </sentence><sentence id="1267">His hair had turned completely grey. </sentence><sentence id="1268">1 mean completely grey, prematurely grey. </sentence><sentence id="1269">And so rather than use his regular name which himself was not necessarily a Jewish name his name was Wolf and in Polish it's Ulfa so it could be maybe not a Jew, but it's sort of Jewish. </sentence><sentence id="1270">So they started calling him Stary. </sentence><sentence id="1271">Stary in Polish means the old one because of his grey hair. </sentence><sentence id="1272">And so he acquired the nickname Stary and on that basis nobody would know who he is. " </sentence><sentence id="1273">Who's that?" " </sentence><sentence id="1274">Oh, that's Stary. </sentence><sentence id="1275">He came to help us." </sentence><sentence id="1276">Or something. </sentence><sentence id="1277">And so he could go out during the day. </sentence><sentence id="1278">My mother could go out sometimes. </sentence><sentence id="1279">Her Polish was quite decent. </sentence><sentence id="1280">My brother's Polish was not wonderful, but not too bad because he had gone to school prior. </sentence><sentence id="1281">I didn't know any Polish. </sentence><sentence id="1282">I could only speak Yiddish, and I never went to local school. </sentence><sentence id="1283">My Polish was just words that I picked up, you know. </sentence><sentence id="1284">You live in a town you pick up Polish, but it's not as if you live in the United States, where you live here you speak English from birth no matter what your ethnic heritage. </sentence><sentence id="1285">Over there if you were Jewish you spoke Yiddish. </sentence><sentence id="1286">Who spoke Polish unless you went to school or when you got older. </sentence><sentence id="1287">So my Polish was just awful. </sentence><sentence id="1288">I don't know any Polish to this day. </sentence><sentence id="1289">I know Russian because this...this one and a half years was really Russian...Russian school so This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="1290">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="1291"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection 4 I... have some decent knowledge of Russian. </sentence><sentence id="1292">My Polish is just useless. </sentence><sentence id="1293">My brother's Polish was not that terrible. </sentence><sentence id="1294">He could go out. </sentence><sentence id="1295">I could not go out. </sentence><sentence id="1296">It was dangerous. </sentence><sentence id="1297">If somebody saw me and said something to me, as soon as I opened my mouth there was no question I was not a Pole. </sentence><sentence id="1298">I was a Jew. </sentence><sentence id="1299">And I couldn't pretend to be Lithuanian either because the accent was just wrong. </sentence><sentence id="1300">So they made a deal or agreed or whatever, one night the farmer came and he said, "We're going for a walk." </sentence><sentence id="1301">So wonderful. " </sentence><sentence id="1302">Come on, We're going for a walk." </sentence><sentence id="1303">And so we went for a walk. </sentence><sentence id="1304">And it was wonderful. </sentence><sentence id="1305">Just him and me. </sentence><sentence id="1306">Nobody else. </sentence><sentence id="1307">Still who knows who would see us? </sentence><sentence id="1308">It was very dangerous. </sentence><sentence id="1309">There were rewards for Jews. </sentence><sentence id="1310">The reward was salt. </sentence><sentence id="1311">I hadn't seen that written any place. </sentence><sentence id="1312">The reward was salt. </sentence><sentence id="1313">I don't remember how many kilograms of salt. </sentence><sentence id="1314">Salt was a great commodity. </sentence><sentence id="1315">Very hard to get. </sentence><sentence id="1316">Very precious. </sentence><sentence id="1317">People wanted salt more than sugar. </sentence><sentence id="1318">And if you handed in some Jews you got salt. </sentence><sentence id="1319">People looked for the reward and there were nasty people who would do it for the reward. </sentence><sentence id="1320">They would do it out of spite. </sentence><sentence id="1321">While we were hiding there, there was a family hiding in the woods and one day, some so-called great patriotic partisans who were fighting for the country...Poles in this case...found them. </sentence><sentence id="1322">They took them out. </sentence><sentence id="1323">They shot them...saw it through the roof a little bit. </sentence><sentence id="1324">And they came into the house. </sentence><sentence id="1325">They asked for some to drink, and they told the farmer, "Go bury those people." </sentence><sentence id="1326">And they were sitting there talking in the house talking next door to the barn where we were and then they left. </sentence><sentence id="1327">And they were Poles, Army Krajowa from London. </sentence><sentence id="1328">There were other partisans, mostly Russians. </sentence><sentence id="1329">One day my father was caught by them and he was sure they were going to kill him. </sentence><sentence id="1330">And then they looked him over and they decided he was a Jew. </sentence><sentence id="1331">They didn't know who he was because he stumbled on them. </sentence><sentence id="1332">He stumbled on their camp going through the woods. </sentence><sentence id="1333">And then they looked him over and they decided that he's a Jew. </sentence><sentence id="1334">They didn't know who he was because he stumbled on their camp going through the woods. </sentence><sentence id="1335">And they said to him, "Don't worry. </sentence><sentence id="1336">We're not going to hurt you. </sentence><sentence id="1337">We're just like you." </sentence><sentence id="1338">In Russian "Vi tozje takoje" which means we are also like that. </sentence><sentence id="1339">Those are the exact words they said because Father repeated it, so I'm repeating you what he said. </sentence><sentence id="1340">And in fact they said, "Do you have any food?" </sentence><sentence id="1341">He says "No." " </sentence><sentence id="1342">Come here." </sentence><sentence id="1343">They had shot an animal. </sentence><sentence id="1344">Don't know where. </sentence><sentence id="1345">Maybe...probably a farmer's animal, and they gave him a quarter of beef to take with him. </sentence><sentence id="1346">They sent him on his way. </sentence><sentence id="1347">Didn't hurt him. </sentence><sentence id="1348">They were prisoners of war. </sentence><sentence id="1349">The Russian prisoners of war were treated abominantly by the Germans. </sentence><sentence id="1350">There was a prisoner of war camp not far from Soly and obviously the Jews were all eventually, they say eliminated and Soly was sent off to Ponari near Vilna and the prisoner of war camps were not eliminated, but none of them survived. </sentence><sentence id="1351">The living conditions in the ghetto were a hundred times better than the prisoners of war. </sentence><sentence id="1352">The Jews used to give them food if they could. </sentence><sentence id="1353">They were starved to death and worked to death, those Russian prisoners of war. </sentence><sentence id="1354">And when they escaped their hatred for the Germans was something unimaginable. </sentence><sentence id="1355">They would very glad die as long as they could take some with them. </sentence><sentence id="1356">And many of them became very sympathetic to the Jews, especially if they came from a camp like the one I described where the Jews in the ghetto tried to help. </sentence><sentence id="1357">So even though the Russians were not that well known for their love of Jews, the Russian escaped prisoners of war were not that bad as far as the Jews were concerned.

id="1361">We learned later that this band was wiped out. </sentence><sentence id="1362">They got into a fire fight with somebody, and they were all killed apparently. </sentence><sentence id="1363">Don't know. </sentence><sentence id="1364">But anyhow, so we lived in this little place and about once a week or so, from then on, we was determined we go for a walk for a hour or so at night always, look at the stars, talk a little bit. </sentence><sentence id="1365">Was not a very imaginative conversation because my Polish was not that great. </sentence><sentence id="1366">They were wonderful people because one day there was a big scare that somebody had seen us there too. </sentence><sentence id="1367">And we didn't know what to do. </sentence><sentence id="1368">So we decided...they decided...this was a tremendous chance. </sentence><sentence id="1369">I can't understand how these people decided to do this. </sentence><sentence id="1370">It was totally insane. </sentence><sentence id="1371">We would just integrate with the family because if they found us in this place clearly we were strangers. </sentence><sentence id="1372">And I remember he put me in bed with his daughter. </sentence><sentence id="1373">And it was at night because somebody was supposed to come searching and we crawled into bed together as if we were, you know, living together because I was young enough. </sentence><sentence id="1374">She was a little kid, but I think younger than me, so it was considered alright under those conditions because the family was very crowded. </sentence><sentence id="1375">And the only thing I remember is the giant bed bugs. </sentence><sentence id="1376">They were about this big. ( </sentence><sentence id="1377">Laughter) Huge red things, which we did not have in the barn. </sentence><sentence id="1378">In that respect the barn was better. </sentence><sentence id="1379">We had rats or mice and they were not good things to have. </sentence><sentence id="1380">They were scary at night. </sentence><sentence id="1381">But these bed bugs bit and they were big. </sentence><sentence id="1382">They made hugh holes in your flesh, and, of course, there were lice and other things. </sentence><sentence id="1383">We suffered from dysentery and lice and all kinds of intestinal parasites. </sentence><sentence id="1384">And there was no...very, very bad sanitary conditions and the local people suffered from the same thing. </sentence><sentence id="1385">It wasn't just us. </sentence><sentence id="1386">It was local conditions were that way. </sentence><sentence id="1387">So that made a big difference, the...the walks at night. </sentence><sentence id="1388">And then eventually the Russian Army came in and we moved right with them. </sentence><sentence id="1389">We didn't stay. </sentence><sentence id="1390">Nobody stayed. </sentence><sentence id="1391">Anybody who survived didn't stay. </sentence><sentence id="1392">We ended up as refugees just moving from place to place. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1936">A: Yes. </sentence><sentence id="1937">Something that has nothing to do with my own experiences but there is very little talk of German re-unification right now. </sentence><sentence id="1938">And I don't think I have a unique perspective but I will tell you something that bothered me greatly. </sentence><sentence id="1939">And it is not that unification is coming, because it has to come. </sentence><sentence id="1940">I would prefer that it be 20 years from now. </sentence><sentence id="1941">The generation that did these things is not around any more, and I have nothing against the new generation. </sentence><sentence id="1942">I don't believe in collective guilt or anything like that. </sentence><sentence id="1943">It bothers me greatly that the loss of memory. </sentence><sentence id="1944">That's why I am so happy to be here. </sentence><sentence id="1945">I was watching a news cast two months ago, 6 weeks ago. </sentence><sentence id="1946">There was this huge rally. </sentence><sentence id="1947">Chancellor Kohl was giving a rally. </sentence><sentence id="1948">Okay. </sentence><sentence id="1949">Lots of signs. " </sentence><sentence id="1950">Ein Deutschland, ein Volk", various things like that. </sentence><sentence id="1951">Legitimate. </sentence><sentence id="1952">And people were saying how horrible it was. </sentence><sentence id="1953">That they couldn't be unified and so forth. </sentence><sentence id="1954">It happened the same day our local newspaper had pictures of the same rally. </sentence><sentence id="1955">And the same day I was reading Newsweek. </sentence><sentence id="1956">It had pictures of the same exact rally. </sentence><sentence id="1957">Very strange coincidence. </sentence><sentence id="1958">And everything was fine. </sentence><sentence id="1959">I was a little upset about this big rally because I am worried about reunification. </sentence><sentence id="1960">That's immaterial. </sentence><sentence id="1961">Then I saw the name of where this rally is held, and I was sick. </sentence><sentence id="1962">And the thing that I still think about is that I have not heard a single commentary or mention of it any place. </sentence><sentence id="1963">The rally was held in Erfurt. </sentence><sentence id="1964">Now people should know that Toppensohn who built the crematorium of Auschwitz was from Erfurt and if you don't know the history actually, that Toppensohn had the same problem that all contractors have with Government, that it didn't work right in the first place. </sentence><sentence id="1965">And they protect themselves. </sentence><sentence id="1966">You know it's only a science. </sentence><sentence id="1967">You don't understand it. </sentence><sentence id="1968">You know the mechanics of hugh piles of human flesh and the convection currents. </sentence><sentence id="1969">You don't understand. </sentence><sentence id="1970">But you know you run some experiments and we promise you, we will fix it, and production will be pretty close to 10,000 a day, and you know great German engineering, they fixed it. </sentence><sentence id="1971">And when the Hungarians were brought in, and they had this big emergency. </sentence><sentence id="1972">They were able to run production at 20,000 This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="1973">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="1974"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection 0 a day. </sentence><sentence id="1975">Why is it that nobody would say, you know we are having this great rally in Erfurt, and we will reunify because things are different now. </sentence><sentence id="1976">And we know that we will not permit another Toppensohn to come into this world. </sentence><sentence id="1977">That would be a great rally.. Not a single commentary that I have seen in all the news media mentioned the existence of Toppenson but the revisionist historians say those were chimneys they were baking bread. </sentence><sentence id="1978">That bothers me greatly. </sentence><sentence id="1979">It really upsets me. </sentence><sentence id="1980">So even though I was not in Auschwitz and I cannot have any recollection of it, when I saw those pictures all of a sudden all the banners and everything changed and it wasn't people, it was just chimneys and stuff. </sentence><sentence id="1981">Because it was Erfurt. </sentence><sentence id="1982">And I have no idea if Toppensohn or his son or his son's son are around any more. </sentence><sentence id="1983">I really don't care. </sentence><sentence id="1984">That has nothing to do with it. </sentence><sentence id="1985">But there is a saying about knowing some relationships and somehow, those have disappeared. </sentence><sentence id="1986">I don't understand why. </sentence><sentence id="1987">Surely people want a little bit more history than that. </sentence><sentence id="1988">I am not a great historians. </sentence><sentence id="1989">I know that Erfurt is Toppensohn, that is my comment. </sentence></p></dialogue>
