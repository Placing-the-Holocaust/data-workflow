<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="9">Q: Thank you so much for -- for speaking with us today and look really forward to hearing about your story. </sentence><sentence id="10">Ifits okay, let's start out with a few details: Your name, your parents" name, date of birth, siblings, any other kind of -- and where you were bom. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="13">A: Manfred Lindenbaum, in -- bom in Unna, Germany, which is the Rural -- the Rural Valley. </sentence><sentence id="14">Itwas probably one of the most nice little towns you could think of: People got along. </sentence><sentence id="15">There was no discrimination against Jews. </sentence><sentence id="16">I knew that from my earliest memories and I know it from what my brother and sister told me because they had so many Christian friends when I was very, very young. </sentence><sentence id="17">I was bom in "32 after Hitler was elected in a free, democratic election. </sentence><sentence id="18">And my earliest memories are fairly warm of Christian friends for our family and -- I didn't go to school but my brother and sister did. </sentence><sentence id="19">The change was so rapid it was unbelievable. </sentence><sentence id="20">My father's name was Otto Lindenbaum and he had a small clothing store. </sentence><sentence id="21">We lived above it. </sentence><sentence id="22">And my mother's name was Freda Lindenbaum. </sentence><sentence id="23">And I don'thave very vivid memories    of them, which I'll talk about a little bit later. </sentence><sentence id="24">My sister, Ruth, who I think about every day, she was older than me and she was murdered in Auschwitz and she's -- she's always with me. </sentence><sentence id="25">She was probably one of the most popular girls in Unna and I found that out later from what people told me in Unna when I visited. </sentence><sentence id="26">And she always had -- was surrounded by fiends. </sentence><sentence id="27">And -- and then I remember we had to put a J in the clothing store. </sentence><sentence id="28">We were not well off but we were comfortable. </sentence><sentence id="29">We had a small apartment above it. </sentence><sentence id="30">AndI didn't mention my brother, Ziegfred, who was two-and-a-half years older than me, when -- after the J went in the store, our friends, my sister's friends slowly started to disappear until there was none of them and my brother would come home on a daily basis beaten up. </sentence><sentence id="31">He would get dragged through the thorn bushes. </sentence><sentence id="32">And I remember my mother going to the school and the teacher saying there's nothing he could do but there was a lot he could have done, but he didn't. </sentence><sentence id="33">The most amazing thing when I think back is that nobody in Unna really stood up and said, "What's going on here." </sentence><sentence id="34">All this culture and all -- and all this lack of prejudice disappeared in such a short period of time, which is one of the reasons I talk to schools because I used to think it could only happen in Germany and now I don't believe that anymore. </sentence><sentence id="35">I think it could happen anywhere. </sentence><sentence id="36">One of the headlines in the newspaper which is really haunting was that Unna is endless Judenfei. </sentence><sentence id="37">That means that Unna is finally free of Jews. </sentence><sentence id="38">And that was in celebration of the truck that pulled up to the old age home where they took the people out in their -- the Jews out in their wheelchairs and their gumeys and put them on the truck and from thence to their death. </sentence><sentence id="39">And this cultured people had looked at the headline and I'm sure that there were many who felt disgust but nobody said anything. </sentence><sentence id="40">So the thing with Unna is that I went back there about 20 years ago. </sentence><sentence id="41">My brother, who lived a fantastic life, had - and had all kinds of achievements, as he was dying said two things, "Don't you ever moun me because look at where I started from and look at how my life was," and he said, "but in my hometown they're saying that our sister is alive. </sentence><sentence id="42">They even say she has a child." </sentence><sentence id="43">And he says, "Maybe you want to go back and just give a quick check." </sentence><sentence id="44">So I did go back. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="78">Q: Really? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="80">A: And I put her picture in the paper and I met with 20 of her classmates and they all said what -- how many --she was the most popular girl around and -- but the truth was that they had all tumed against her. </sentence><sentence id="81">And I spent six days interviewing people and checking and there was -- it was all nonsense. </sentence><sentence id="82">And I fast forward 20 years and I told the story to my friend Fred Spiegel, who is a survivor who lived in a town very close -- very close to me, and he got angry and he went to my hometown and he had them investigate, and the reason was because they had a memorial like the dankstein (ph) and my grandfather's name was not on it or my sister's name was not on it and I -- I felt upset about it but I felt upset about it enough that I never wanted to go back to my hometown and not to do anything about it. </sentence><sentence id="83">He did go back to my hometown and he made them investigate and they found out that she had died with my parents in Auschwitz. </sentence><sentence id="84">She had died; she was murdered there, and they put hername on. </sentence><sentence id="85">And about a year ago with my eight grandchildren and my -- my children and their spouses, we went back there. </sentence><sentence id="86">It was very heartwarming. </sentence><sentence id="87">It was -- it kind of put -- helped put things to rest in my mind because Ruth is always with me, she always will be, especially if] do anything good. </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="88">Q: Ofcourse. </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="89">A: She's there-- </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="90">Q: Ofcourse. </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="91">A: -- encouraging me. </sentence><sentence id="92">But to me what was really rewarding was to see the pain that the people in Unna that I met, the minister from the church there which has 2,000 members was in tears and I told him, "You were notalive. </sentence><sentence id="93">How -- why are you -- why are you feeling the pain?" </sentence><sentence id="94">He said, "I wasn't alive, my church was, and my church did nothing." </sentence><sentence id="95">And I got that kind ofa feeling and I think that we need -- we need to leam this lesson that while we are not responsible for the sins of our fathers, we are responsible for making the world - - by accepting what they did, that it doesn't happen, as atrocities around the world can continue. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="154">Q: Right. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="156">A: And there was -- we didn't have money and we didn't really have the opportunity to leave. </sentence><sentence id="157">There was no place to leave to. </sentence><sentence id="158">The world was closed off anyway and -- my parents would have left. </sentence><sentence id="159">There were -- there were others who believed -- who had this memory ofa short time before that there was no -- really no prejudice and just couldn't believe what was happening, and, you know, who stayed too long. </sentence><sentence id="160">Butmy parents, it wasn't an option. </sentence><sentence id="161">There were some of our relatives, I found out later, who had money and who went out on tourist visas, but then they were running because they weren't allowed to stay anyplace too long. </sentence><sentence id="162">In 1938 Ihave this memory of the clicking of boots and it was a Nazi official, policeman, I don't know what he was, coming into the store and telling my father: You have to immediately report to the police station with a small suitcase and you can bring ten marks with you, or some --I don't remember that exact thing, but I remember the small suitcase. </sentence><sentence id="163">And my father had us pack and we went over to our one remaining Christian fiiend and I guess my father talked to him and decide -- decided that we had to leave. </sentence><sentence id="164">The -- there was no cars. </sentence><sentence id="165">We -- there was no place to go. </sentence><sentence id="166">There was no money. </sentence><sentence id="167">And if you went down to the railway station or to get a bus, you couldn't run away. </sentence><sentence id="168">So we ended up at the police station together. </sentence><sentence id="169">Across Germany was 25,000 ofus. </sentence><sentence id="170">They called us Ostjuden, which means Eastem Jews. </sentence><sentence id="171">We---we were bom in Germany. </sentence><sentence id="172">My parents had come there as children to Germany and we didn't speak anything except German. </sentence><sentence id="173">We were Germans but they called us Eastem Jews. </sentence><sentence id="174">It was Thursday. </sentence><sentence id="175">It's a weird thing to remember. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="196">Q: Itis. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="198">A: I can't quite remember the month. </sentence><sentence id="199">It was before Kristallnacht and this is the incident that triggered Kaistallnacht. </sentence><sentence id="200">It was a follow-up. </sentence><sentence id="201">And the reason I remember Thursday is my grandfather lived with us and he was blind and he had never traveled on the Sabbath and they held us until Friday night so that we should have to travel on the Sabbath. </sentence><sentence id="202">I think back, this small, miserable-mindedness of these people that this is what they have on their mind, Let's see if we can inflict. </sentence><sentence id="203">So, anyway, we're on the train and I have a beautiful memory of my grandfather starting the Friday night prayers, Lekha Dodi. </sentence><sentence id="204">That's a memory that I was --I was about six, so the memory is very -- that memory is very vivid, more than anything else. </sentence><sentence id="205">And we - we arrived at a town, border town by the name of Bentschen and we got off the train and there was a lot ofus. </sentence><sentence id="206">I know that -- I now know that the number was 25,000. </sentence><sentence id="207">I don't think there were 25,000 there the minute that we were. </sentence><sentence id="208">And surrounded by German soldiers, we were marched towards the border. </sentence><sentence id="209">I think it was like a 5- mile walk. </sentence><sentence id="210">And at the border the -- the Polish guards denied us entry and they had guns and there was chaos, some people were lying on the ground, and we ended up on the other side of the border and we were in Poland. </sentence><sentence id="211">And we saw horses and carts coming towards us and it was the Polish farmers who came to help us. </sentence><sentence id="212">Actually, it wasn't to help us but to help themselves; they took our luggage and took off with it. </sentence><sentence id="213">And we continued on to a town called Zbaszyn and -- Z-B-A-Z-N, something like that. </sentence><sentence id="214">And in Zbaszyn there was a small Jewish community. </sentence><sentence id="215">The -- the Polish people were very unhappy that we were there but there was really nothing they could do. </sentence><sentence id="216">Anda couple of hundred ofus ended up in a place called the mill. </sentence><sentence id="217">It was an abandoned five-story building which I guess was used as a mill and it was owned by a Jewish person and we ended up on the fifth floor and to my knowledge we didn't have any facilities of any kind up there. </sentence><sentence id="218">We Just had avery crowded room. </sentence><sentence id="219">And some of the people were able to buy straw the first day and -- but -- and food was areal problem unless you had money. </sentence><sentence id="220">But within 48 hours Jewish organizations from Warsaw came and so for the next nine months or so for me it wasn't a terrible thing. </sentence><sentence id="221">As far as facilities, electricity, heat or things, a kid doesn't accept reality the way itis. </sentence><sentence id="222">And I had my family, we were all together, and I had acouple of friends. </sentence><sentence id="223">And some of the people with money managed to move out of the mill. </sentence><sentence id="224">We -- we didnt. </sentence><sentence id="225">And then around about August of 1939 the German army was amassed on the border and the Jewish -- we had actually in Zbaszyn had organized a real city so that everything --- the refugees had worked together to make sure that everybody had -- we didn't have much to eat but -- but we were okay. </sentence><sentence id="226">There wasn't enough clothes. </sentence><sentence id="227">And the reason I know that, I - much later recently got letters that my mother had sent out begging for a jacket that she sent to relatives in Palestine. </sentence><sentence id="228">Obviously, they wouldn't have been able to get it to her anyway, but she was begging for anything for herself or for the kids because we really didn't have anything. </sentence><sentence id="229">But when the -- the organizations made -- were making plans to get us onto a train to go to Grodno on the Russian border and ---. </sentence><sentence id="230">So amidst all this chaos at the railway station -- this is a very vivid memory for me because amidst the chaos somebody said that ifanybody signed up for the Kindertransport, there's a chance that it might happen. </sentence><sentence id="231">And the --- my mother immediately took me, my brother and my sister and shoved it over to this total stranger and my mother and father got on a train to go there, and I'm sure they had no idea what was going to happen to them or to us but they made -- they obviously made a very brave and right decision. </sentence><sentence id="232">I didn't appreciate it. </sentence><sentence id="233">The - my -- my friend was --I don't want to mention his name. </sentence><sentence id="234">My friend was there with us and he was nine years old and he got hysterical and started crying and his mother was on her way to the train and she ran back and hugged him and kissed him and took him with her to Grodno and they both were murdered in Auschwitz on arrival. </sentence><sentence id="235">I found that out later. </sentence><sentence id="236">And I--I geta little bit emotional when I think about what I felt like then. </sentence></p></dialogue>
