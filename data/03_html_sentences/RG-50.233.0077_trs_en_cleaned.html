<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="29">Q: Do you want to tell me how? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="31">A: Well, that -- first of all, I have to tell you that we were -- my father and mother were Polish origin. </sentence><sentence id="32">In 1941, when the Germans were not occupying Hungary yet, they came out -- they give the order to the Hungarians to deport all the non-Hungarian citizens. </sentence><sentence id="33">My father in spite of that, that he was as a Hungarian officer in the Hungarian army and he had the Iron Cross and all that things, when the order came out to deport -- you know there was a time in Hungary and when all the non-Hungarian were deported from Hungary and from Budapest. </sentence><sentence id="34">Unfortunately, we were among them and unfortunately we were among them the very first thing when that deportation started, when we didn't know yet what's going on. </sentence><sentence id="35">They came to our house and they said, pack your bag, we will take you to your own country. </sentence><sentence id="36">You will work there and you will survive after the war. </sentence><sentence id="37">That was in June, 1941. </sentence><sentence id="38">They came to our house and they said well pack your bag and go. </sentence><sentence id="39">How do you pack your bag when you live there a lifetime? </sentence><sentence id="40">So we cried and my mother cried and I cried and my fiance was there. </sentence><sentence id="41">So the guy, he was new on the job and he had a certain human caring and sympathy to us said, you know what, I will take your father so I'm sure you stay here. </sentence><sentence id="42">You have one day to pack your bag and do whatever you want. </sentence><sentence id="43">That's what he did. </sentence><sentence id="44">In that one day, I had a choice and some people, some relatives told me, you are young, go and hide before they take you. </sentence><sentence id="45">But my father wrote a letter that the family has to stay together. </sentence><sentence id="46">Please come and whatever will be, we will survive it together. </sentence><sentence id="47">So we packed our bag and we went outside. </sentence><sentence id="48">We lived in a house, four floors. </sentence><sentence id="49">All the tenants were looking and saying goodbye to us. </sentence><sentence id="50">Some of them cheering, some of them jeering. </sentence><sentence id="51">That's how we were deported to Poland at that time. </sentence><sentence id="52">I say deported to Poland which is again easy to say but how we were and what happened and how we went there and how we walked or whatever happened. </sentence><sentence id="53">In between a lot of Hungarian, so-called Polish-Hungarian origin got killed in Kamieniec Padolski. </sentence><sentence id="54">That was a famous town where they -- you heard about Kamieniec Podolski. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="79">Q: Oh, yes. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="81">A: So then most of them who got killed there 40,000, they were all Hungarian origin. </sentence><sentence id="82">But knowing my parents knew Polish, they all hired a private buggy and we had relatives in Kolomjya. </sentence><sentence id="83">We stayed -- we hid back from the transport because we knew that the transport is going to Kamieniec Padolski. </sentence><sentence id="84">A lot of other people escaped too but we went with that buggy to Kolomyja and that's where we stayed in Kolomjya, that was that time, yes, more or less normal life because the ghetto was not easy. </sentence><sentence id="85">But of course, after a year being in the ghetto and losing people -- it was over 20,000 people in Kolomyja -- by the time I escaped as a smuggler, there was only a couple of hundred left. </sentence><sentence id="86">That's when it was that I said goodbye to my parents and of   course, I never saw them again. </sentence><sentence id="87">I started on the road going back to Hungary which was a bad road to talk about a lot. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="96">Q: Do you ever talk to anyone about the ghetto though, before ---? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="98">A: The ghetto, we lived, it was a whole year. </sentence><sentence id="99">Before the ghetto, we lived in Kolomyja yet. </sentence><sentence id="100">When the ghetto came, of course, like everybody else, we had to move in the ghetto. </sentence><sentence id="101">We also had the -- they said on the tape that three, four families lived in the ghetto. </sentence><sentence id="102">Well, where we went, it was rather five, six families living in the ghetto. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="108">Q: In one room place? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="110">A: In a one room place, right. </sentence><sentence id="111">Then, of course, some of them got killed during the time, so it got less and less. </sentence><sentence id="112">That's when I decided after a year being in Kolomyja and about half a year in the ghetto, it's time to go </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="116">Q: Was there anything while you were there that struck you and made a -- that stands out in your mind? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="118">A: Every day struck me because I was a young person who was rather careful living and all suddenly you are tossed in this situation. </sentence><sentence id="119">We went to work in the morning because my father being a military person and the Germans also gave him a job as a supervisor. </sentence><sentence id="120">The other Jews didn't like him because he was a supervisor. </sentence><sentence id="121">They didn't like nobody who supervised over other Jews. </sentence><sentence id="122">So we worked there for a time. </sentence><sentence id="123">As a matter of fact, I worked in a kitchen preparing dinner for German officers. </sentence><sentence id="124">My job was -- with three other girls -- peeling potatoes. </sentence><sentence id="125">At that time, hunger was already a big aspect of ghetto life because you know that people just died of hunger. </sentence><sentence id="126">So what we did, we got permission for the peels to take home. </sentence><sentence id="127">We had the peels for whatever meals we made. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="138">Q: You cooked them? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="140">A: We cooked the peels, right. </sentence><sentence id="141">But in order to have something on the peels, we peeled the potatoes in the kitchen thick. </sentence><sentence id="142">Then we went home and we peeled the pieces. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="146">Q: Oh, I see. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="148">A: We made it so that the peels were thick but then the Germans came to it and they said that whoever will peel like that thick, will have a punishment. </sentence><sentence id="149">So we couldn't do that. </sentence><sentence id="150">From then on, we had to eat the peels and not peel the peels. </sentence><sentence id="151">The other one what I remember from the ghetto, when we went out to work. </sentence><sentence id="152">Through work, we got to know some other workers. </sentence><sentence id="153">This was German families who moved into Jewish houses. </sentence><sentence id="154">They renovated and redecorated a little; we worked on it, to keep it clean until their wife and children came. </sentence><sentence id="155">We saw the mementoes of a life, you know Jewish life, sometimes we came into a house where we saw the pots and pans yet as they carried them out. </sentence><sentence id="156">We just had to close our eyes and see what happened there. </sentence><sentence id="157">We had to clean up and make it ready for the German officers. </sentence><sentence id="158">I was working there once washing the floors with a pail, you know a big pail of water. </sentence><sentence id="159">Because you're asking me to tell you memories from the ghetto. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="172">Q: Yes, yes. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="174">A: So the German --. </sentence><sentence id="175">Until that time, you know, I knew that I was in danger and everything but I didn't have any personal contact with any physical punishment. </sentence><sentence id="176">Cleaning the floor and almost finished it, he came in and he took the pail and he kicked the pail and he said this is not clean enough, clean it again. </sentence><sentence id="177">So that was my first encounter with a German officer. </sentence><sentence id="178">As it happened to be, the German officer's wife came back. </sentence><sentence id="179">She acted rather humanely to the Jewish girls. </sentence><sentence id="180">It happened to be that, I don't know whether I should mention it, but everything -- but she had some tendencies for liking girls. </sentence><sentence id="181">The question was whether to use this situation to your advantage or not to use it to your advantage. </sentence><sentence id="182">But sometimes, it came to a point, you told me an incident before about bread. </sentence><sentence id="183">Sometimes you came to a point when the only thing on your mind was, you are twenty years old and somewhere along in the sky when you looked up, there is a life yet for people. </sentence><sentence id="184">Let's do whatever is possible but let's survive. </sentence><sentence id="185">It happens to be that that woman helped me a lot to get easier job, to get more food until her husband came to the picture. </sentence><sentence id="186">Then I lost my job. </sentence><sentence id="187">Then we had to go to a factory where he worked, some kind of, if I remember correctly, I think something with an ironwork or something. </sentence><sentence id="188">The first day when I went there, we were rather abused that time there. </sentence><sentence id="189">Then I decided that this is a good place maybe to run away or something or make connections and that's what I heard the first time, that there is somewhere a small that it is possible to --. </sentence><sentence id="190">I stayed in that factory and I worked there. </sentence><sentence id="191">We went out to ghetto, back to the ghetto and the ghetto was always less and less and less. </sentence><sentence id="192">My parents were always less and less independent and more and more relied on me. </sentence><sentence id="193">The roles reversed between parents and children. </sentence><sentence id="194">Not children because it was only me. </sentence><sentence id="195">It was me who directed them what to do and how -- like for instance, when I had to go to work, this mother, the Germans looked up and mother got old very suddenly in the ghetto. </sentence><sentence id="196">It happened -- it coincided with her menopause too so that was really a hard thing because she acted sometimes very strange. </sentence><sentence id="197">I was very much afraid -- everything fell on her and she just couldn't digest the tragedy what fell on her. </sentence><sentence id="198">I sometimes was the one who had to lead her and say it will be good. </sentence><sentence id="199">I remember I pinched her cheeks sometimes so she would survive so maybe made a little bit her hair so that the Germans won't say you are too old to work. </sentence><sentence id="200">This was a couple of memories from the ghetto. </sentence><sentence id="201">Then, of course there was also memories. </sentence><sentence id="202">I met a young man who worked in a soup kitchen. </sentence><sentence id="203">You know when you are twenty years old, no matter what the situation you are thrust into, you always have a little bit romantic state in you. </sentence><sentence id="204">Because that keeps you alive. </sentence><sentence id="205">I met a young man who was very kind to me and he gave me always thick soups and things like that. </sentence><sentence id="206">I sometimes met him but he had somebody else, I had somebody else but it developed some kind of rapport between us. </sentence><sentence id="207">I remembered him long after that. </sentence><sentence id="208">That was, of course my present husband. </sentence><sentence id="209">But I didn't know at that time yet. </sentence><sentence id="210">But when it came to the time that the ghetto got from 20,000 to a couple of hundred, I said that's it. </sentence><sentence id="211">I discussed it with my mother the last day. </sentence><sentence id="212">The last night when I knew that I'm leaving in the morning --. </sentence><sentence id="213">You know we rather stayed away from kissing or touching or something because you changed. </sentence><sentence id="214">In order to survive you have to lose your -- certain feelings disappear from you. </sentence><sentence id="215">But that was the last night and mother just touched me so because she had her own thoughts and I had my own thoughts. </sentence><sentence id="216">The only thing what I remember that I just wanted to -- that nobody should touch me and nobody should kiss me. </sentence><sentence id="217">Just to push it away because one more touch and one more kiss, I'm not going to leave. </sentence><sentence id="218">That was the reason. </sentence><sentence id="219">I never explained it to her but I hope she understood it because one more touch and one more kiss, I'm not going to leave. </sentence><sentence id="220">That was the reason. </sentence><sentence id="221">I never explained it to her but I hope she understood it. </sentence><sentence id="222">Because when she wanted to touch me, I just like -- I pushed it away. </sentence><sentence id="223">I did it in order that I should be able to leave. </sentence><sentence id="224">The next -- before I left my father gave me that talisman which I carry with me. </sentence><sentence id="225">I never, never leave it. </sentence><sentence id="226">Wherever I go, that talisman goes with me. </sentence><sentence id="227">Somehow, I don't -- I'm not superstitious otherwise, but I truly believed that talisman saved me from a lot of situations. </sentence><sentence id="228">When the time    will be that I have to go, then I have to decide which of my children will have it. </sentence><sentence id="229">That was the ghetto and I went away. </sentence><sentence id="230">I went back to Budapest where that time even so that Hitler was far and advancing all over; it was still not the ghetto. </sentence><sentence id="231">Only a couple of months later ---. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="290">Q: What year was this? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="292">A: I was there a whole year in the ghetto. </sentence><sentence id="293">From 1941 to 1942. </sentence><sentence id="294">I have tell you one incident there because that is an -- I try not to go into little details but --. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="298">Q: No, it's okay. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="300">A: But this detail was so remarkable that I have to mention it. </sentence><sentence id="301">After about 25 or 26 days -- the 20" day they caught us. </sentence><sentence id="302">I think -- did I mention it or didn't I mention it? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="306">Q: No. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="308">A: We were -- oh, I told you that before. </sentence><sentence id="309">We were walking at night to reach Hungary from Poland. </sentence><sentence id="310">I mean it was a long road but I cannot go into every aspect of it. </sentence><sentence id="311">But in any case, we were walking at night and sleeping at daytime. </sentence><sentence id="312">That was just about the last day before we saw already, the Hungarian border when somebody probably who noticed us, told it to the German guards. </sentence><sentence id="313">They came up this -- we were ten of us who were escaping from the ghetto -- they came up, the German guards and they shot everybody on sight. </sentence><sentence id="314">I ran away that time and it was laying there a big tree eaten up from the moss. </sentence><sentence id="315">You know, hollow inside. </sentence><sentence id="316">There is a lot of fate was in my life what I have to strongly believe that there must be something, somebody, somewhere who prepared that tree for me there, where I went in that tree, in that hollow tree. </sentence><sentence id="317">Was laying and I was laying; I was in the tree. </sentence><sentence id="318">I just heard the shooting and the crying and saying no, no; until everything got quiet. </sentence><sentence id="319">I walked out from the tree and what I saw only dead people. </sentence><sentence id="320">I started to walk because I think that time; from that day on I was not quite right. </sentence><sentence id="321">I think I was singing or something. </sentence><sentence id="322">I said, I'm going back to mamma and how wonderful it is. </sentence><sentence id="323">I stumbled, by accident, over the smuggler who was also escaping, but not only that he was getting -- he was getting shot and escaping and I found him but everybody had a little knapsack, you know, little knapsack where we had things. </sentence><sentence id="324">He, in a big hurry, instead of taking his knapsack, took my knapsack, took my knapsack and I am the one who survived. </sentence><sentence id="325">So this little incident what I sometimes wonder how that worked out. </sentence><sentence id="326">So I found him but he was injured and he said he cannot do nothing. </sentence><sentence id="327">He gave me his pocketknife and in his tie, he was --. </sentence><sentence id="328">The trouble as they shot, they shot at my back and it went into his tie, near the genital areas. </sentence><sentence id="329">He gave me that little knife and he said that I have to take that bullet out which I did. </sentence><sentence id="330">He was there for the night and then he said, write me that letter that you are here so that I can get my money. </sentence><sentence id="331">I won't get too much in any case because from the ten of you, you are the only one survived. </sentence><sentence id="332">So that's what the paper what I showed you that I wrote him and that was from the woods. </sentence><sentence id="333">This was the Hungarian woods in Korosmezo. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="360">Q: Could you spell that? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="362">A: Korosmezo. </sentence><sentence id="363">Here I write it down. </sentence><sentence id="364">Kirsh -- this is a border town. </sentence><sentence id="365">Korosmezo. </sentence><sentence id="366">This is a border town. </sentence><sentence id="367">From there, when I am in Korosmezo, I am already in Hungary. </sentence><sentence id="368">So he said that, he covered me over with leaves and he said I don't feel good. </sentence><sentence id="369">So he left me with my knapsack what I had a little sweater on. </sentence><sentence id="370">It was cold in the woods already. </sentence><sentence id="371">He said -- he gave me an onion, by the way, which was very good. </sentence><sentence id="372">He went away and he said he will come for me. </sentence><sentence id="373">He   will whistle a certain way so I know because that was, even so it was in the woods, but people could still go there. </sentence><sentence id="374">He said when you hear that whistle, then tell that this is you. </sentence><sentence id="375">So he went away and he left me there four and a half -- four days and one night. </sentence><sentence id="376">I was in the woods by myself so I was really -- can you imagine that, a twenty- year old girl in the woods, you know, rain or not rain or anything. </sentence><sentence id="377">There was one incident that something moved, I probably moved and the peasant came there who was taking lambs to eat, to raise or whatever you call it. </sentence><sentence id="378">He heard and he comes straight -- he came straight where I am. </sentence><sentence id="379">I was just huddling there covered with certain leaves there and I heard the steps closer and closer. </sentence><sentence id="380">The only thing what he did, he peed and peed on me. </sentence><sentence id="381">I was just standing there and that was one of the incidents. </sentence><sentence id="382">Then people asked me what did you eat for four days? </sentence><sentence id="383">You have to eat for four days, which is not necessarily so. </sentence><sentence id="384">But I had that one onion and then blueberries grew that time in the --. </sentence><sentence id="385">When I felt safe enough in the night. </sentence><sentence id="386">I went around me and I ate some blueberries. </sentence><sentence id="387">But the fourth night, I dreamed about my fiance in Hungary at that time. </sentence><sentence id="388">It was a beautiful wedding and everything. </sentence><sentence id="389">When I got up and I was in the situation, you know, whatever I was in there; I looked up, I said this is sh . </sentence><sentence id="390">Ican't. </sentence><sentence id="391">There was a limit what I could endure. </sentence><sentence id="392">And I said, I just don't care anymore, nothing, when I heard the whistle. </sentence><sentence id="393">So little coincidences and he did come. </sentence><sentence id="394">I told him where were you? </sentence><sentence id="395">I couldn't talk so good to him because he didn't talk Hungarian and I didn't talk so good Polish. </sentence><sentence id="396">But he said, he was sick. </sentence><sentence id="397">I mean, I believe it, I'm not such a good surgeon. </sentence><sentence id="398">He came for me the fifth day and he took me to a place where I had to walk up on the top. </sentence><sentence id="399">Because I was -- even so I was in Hungary -- I think my husband explained it. </sentence><sentence id="400">When they catch you there, then they immediately send you back to Germany. </sentence><sentence id="401">So everybody was afraid to give -- to hide you. </sentence><sentence id="402">So I was up there in the -- in some kind of an attic waiting for further instruction to go deeper into Hungary. </sentence><sentence id="403">The deeper you got into Hungary, the safer you were that the Germans -- that they won't give you over to the Germans. </sentence><sentence id="404">This was in 1942. </sentence><sentence id="405">As I was walking down the steps because he told me to come down now we are ready, we have a car and we will go to the next town which is Mag . </sentence><sentence id="406">As I walked down, I saw a figure in the bottom of the steps and I didn't recognize quite and he probably didn't recognize me. </sentence><sentence id="407">But when I wrote that letter, you know, what I gave; my fiance, he himself came all the way to the border town, to bring the car and that was him standing downstairs. </sentence><sentence id="408">I don't go into the feelings and sentimental aspects with you. </sentence><sentence id="409">I leave that to your imagination..

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="891">A: This is 1945, January 18. </sentence><sentence id="892">So my war lasted from 1941 to 1945. </sentence><sentence id="893">So I was 4 4 years younger wherever. </sentence><sentence id="894">When the first Russians came in and mind you, I was still with Catholic papers there. </sentence><sentence id="895">When the first Russians came in somehow, you know, in any case that day's already with the bombardment, is catching these parents and everything. </sentence><sentence id="896">I am quite sure that I was mentally really not right and understandably so. </sentence><sentence id="897">I was really, really on the end of my line. </sentence><sentence id="898">I couldn't take too much more anymore. </sentence><sentence id="899">When I saw the first Russian, I just -- I said there is other people around. </sentence><sentence id="900">Wherever we were living in the shelter, that was in the basement, of course. </sentence><sentence id="901">Half of it was bombed and everything. </sentence><sentence id="902">I wanted to run to that Russian and kiss him from top to toe. </sentence><sentence id="903">I'm free, I'm free -- you know, the movies. </sentence><sentence id="904">They were holding me back. </sentence><sentence id="905">They said don't you know what the Russians are doing? </sentence><sentence id="906">They did a lot of raping, you know that. </sentence><sentence id="907">They didn't care whether they rape 18 year old or 88 years old, they didn't care. </sentence><sentence id="908">But the difference it was, that the first fighting group who fights for a city is always the elite of the military. </sentence><sentence id="909">They do not do any raping. </sentence><sentence id="910">They are not the ones who does it. </sentence><sentence id="911">The occupying troops are the ones who does it. </sentence><sentence id="912">When all kind when it was free, free robbery, free raping, free --. </sentence><sentence id="913">You could do anything. </sentence><sentence id="914">But the first elite group didn't do too much raping. </sentence><sentence id="915">But I wanted to go out and then the girl next to me, she said, what are you so happy about? </sentence><sentence id="916">To see the Russians, what you know, she started because she didn't really know who I am. </sentence><sentence id="917">She just knew how my name is just Komaria. </sentence><sentence id="918">He was holding me back and I didn't go. </sentence><sentence id="919">But the second day, because then they came more and more Russians in the basement looking for men, you know, who was hiding also. </sentence><sentence id="920">That young man who stood beside me and he said, he told, that was, you know up on the floor it was a department store. </sentence><sentence id="921">They had in the department store, they had honey left. </sentence><sentence id="922">Food was a big thing that time. </sentence><sentence id="923">He comes to me and he says before yet, the Russians came, you know what; there's big, big container of honey there. </sentence><sentence id="924">We will go up there and I will give you a lot of honey. </sentence><sentence id="925">Honey was gold at that time. </sentence><sentence id="926">That was already after that incident with the Germans so I said now I don't need him any more. </sentence><sentence id="927">He said, you know what, I will give you the honey, I saved your life but --- he knew already that the Russians are in the corner but when it comes to it, will   you save mine? </sentence><sentence id="928">How can I save you?, </sentence><sentence id="929">I said. </sentence><sentence id="930">You know how you can save it. </sentence><sentence id="931">So he knew who I was. </sentence><sentence id="932">Because he wouldn't ask me that question then whether I can save your life or not. </sentence><sentence id="933">When the Russians came in, when they were already looking for Hungarian soldiers, or non- Jews, you know, he came to me and he said, help me to get out of here. </sentence><sentence id="934">I helped you, you help me. </sentence><sentence id="935">And I did help him to escape. </sentence><sentence id="936">Whether I did it right or wrong, but I did it and he did escape. </sentence><sentence id="937">I don't know what happened to him. </sentence><sentence id="938">Well, in any case, then the Russians came in and then of course, it started. </sentence><sentence id="939">I don't know whether you know about the aspects of how the Russians behaved. </sentence><sentence id="940">It was soup kitchens again and it was again standing in the line. </sentence><sentence id="941">It was all the ruins and I had nobody. </sentence><sentence id="942">I just walked on the streets, you know. </sentence><sentence id="943">Sawing people coming out of the ghetto. </sentence><sentence id="944">Everybody says, oh Yaneka, ; &gt; , and I went there and I had nobody. </sentence><sentence id="945">Because everybody died. </sentence><sentence id="946">I said well, I will look for my aunt. </sentence><sentence id="947">You know that aunt who didn't believe me? </sentence><sentence id="948">They were in the ghetto and they were the rich aunts in the family because they had a house in Hungary. </sentence><sentence id="949">That was like having a house in New York at that time. </sentence><sentence id="950">They had some six, seven rooms. </sentence><sentence id="951">That was an awful lot of room in Hungary. </sentence><sentence id="952">Here, you know people who works can have four rooms too, it's nothing. </sentence><sentence id="953">In any case, they did survive and I did go to them. </sentence><sentence id="954">It's nothing. </sentence><sentence id="955">In any case, they did survive and I did go to them. </sentence><sentence id="956">It was a big beautiful reunion. </sentence><sentence id="957">Of course they took away their house, they took away their apartment and they gave them the room where the maid used to live. </sentence><sentence id="958">There, where the maid used to live, there I was living for them, for a while until they got another room attached to it. </sentence><sentence id="959">They took back their old room, not the house, just a room, because the Russians of course wouldn't give them back the house. </sentence><sentence id="960">What was life, you will ask me after the bombardment?After the Russians came in? </sentence><sentence id="961">it was a tough life. </sentence><sentence id="962">It was first of all, the first days were -- the first week rather after the war. </sentence><sentence id="963">It was also interesting -- you know we lived on the fourth floor when we didn't go to the shelter. </sentence><sentence id="964">After the so-called fighting, I went up on the fourth floor and looked out the window because I was more or less like free then. </sentence><sentence id="965">Because after five years, you felt that Mommy I survived! </sentence><sentence id="966">I was rather careless that time. </sentence><sentence id="967">I went and I looked out the window because I wanted to see what is a war. </sentence><sentence id="968">You see this is not a war like here. </sentence><sentence id="969">They drop an atomic bomb and everybody's boom! </sentence><sentence id="970">Finished. </sentence><sentence id="971">There they are fighting corner to corner. </sentence><sentence id="972">I went up on the window and I looked down and I saw this one is Germans and this one is Russians, they're shooting. </sentence><sentence id="973">I look out of the window so they shot up. </sentence><sentence id="974">They almost shot my head off. </sentence><sentence id="975">So I got -- well because I didn't know better. </sentence><sentence id="976">So I went back to there until things subsided. </sentence><sentence id="977">At that time, houses were closed yet and Russians were standing all over. </sentence><sentence id="978">Slowly, slowly life got back to it. </sentence><sentence id="979">Everything, you couldn't buy nothing. </sentence><sentence id="980">As I said, I was secretary for a lawyer. </sentence><sentence id="981">I had to make something, money didn't mean anything. </sentence><sentence id="982">I had nothing anymore to sell. </sentence><sentence id="983">The only thing it is to work and get food for it. </sentence><sentence id="984">The lawyer where I worked, whom I worked before once, he took me back. </sentence><sentence id="985">Some people came to him, advise us and they gave him eggs and bread or pork fat or whatever they gave him, he gave me part of it as payment to the secretary. </sentence><sentence id="986">Until things didn't get back to more or less, I couldn't call it normal because it was far from normal. </sentence><sentence id="987">I met one day a friend of our father and mother who did survive. </sentence><sentence id="988">Her family didn't survive but her house, her room was bombed. </sentence><sentence id="989">She lived in a small room and her living room got a full hit from the bomb and it had a hole in the middle. </sentence><sentence id="990">So I lived in the little room but in that house. </sentence><sentence id="991">She was very attached to me because I was young and I walked -- you see the Budapest has many, many beautiful bridges which were all bombed, all the bridges. </sentence><sentence id="992">People went through the Danube back to Buda to get potatoes, flowers or--. </sentence><sentence id="993">Sometimes I brought it back so she was attached to me because she knew that being young, I will bring something else. </sentence><sentence id="994">By the way, that time, there was another incident what maybe I will tell you, certain main, main aspects of it. </sentence><sentence id="995">It was a couple of days after the -- after things settled down -- there was a so-called free, free looting. </sentence><sentence id="996">People went with big bags in this big department stores and whatever they found they put it in the bag and they took it home. </sentence><sentence id="997">It was free loot. </sentence><sentence id="998">The Russians stood there and told you so take    it, take it. </sentence><sentence id="999">If you went out empty handed, they send you back to take something. </sentence><sentence id="1000">So I'm living there in that house where above it was a department store. </sentence><sentence id="1001">In this department store, I thought I will go looting too. </sentence><sentence id="1002">Why not, the other people go, but I didn't. </sentence><sentence id="1003">I didn't prepare myself with the proper thing. </sentence><sentence id="1004">I didn't have a bag, I didn't have a knife, I didn't have the scissors so I was not quite made for this looting business. </sentence><sentence id="1005">There was big giant men there carting materials and everything. </sentence><sentence id="1006">I was just there. </sentence><sentence id="1007">If they make me , I was some 85 or 90 pounds, if they gave me a push, I would just fall down. </sentence><sentence id="1008">They said if you want to live, you better go away. </sentence><sentence id="1009">I want to loot so I went down where the food was. </sentence><sentence id="1010">There in the food, people went also and took the silverware and whatever it is. </sentence><sentence id="1011">Finally, one guy lifted me up and put me on a bag of flour. </sentence><sentence id="1012">He said you stay here if you want to be alive. </sentence><sentence id="1013">Because they were strong people and I was just a -- the wind could blow me away that time. </sentence><sentence id="1014">I was still there, people took everything and I stood there with -- on the bag of flour until everything was looted out. </sentence><sentence id="1015">I stood there with the bag of flour. </sentence><sentence id="1016">Of course,, I couldn't take the bag of flour and that was full with pickles and jams and everything. </sentence><sentence id="1017">On me, but I still was sitting on a bag of flour. </sentence><sentence id="1018">What did I do? </sentence><sentence id="1019">I had one and only dress and I took the flour and I put it in my -- here like this, in there. </sentence><sentence id="1020">I went all the way walked that way to my landlady and I said, here we have flour, we make bread from it. </sentence><sentence id="1021">Which we took out the glass and we did make bread from it. </sentence><sentence id="1022">But after a while, it was got to -- I lived that time, I went away from my aunt and I lived in a friend's of mine, the same friend who was together with me in the camp. </sentence><sentence id="1023">I went to that house and I lived. </sentence><sentence id="1024">You know there was, they call it, belated reaction. </sentence><sentence id="1025">When you know you survived, when you know well, five years went away, you survived alone but you survived. </sentence><sentence id="1026">Then after that when you know that it comes, that psychological for what? </sentence><sentence id="1027">And for whom? </sentence><sentence id="1028">And for why? </sentence><sentence id="1029">That was on fourth floor where I lived that time. </sentence><sentence id="1030">It was in December. </sentence><sentence id="1031">I was just alone, just --. </sentence><sentence id="1032">I said, I --I came to the point that I needed help which I personally didn't get -- psychological help. </sentence><sentence id="1033">So I opened the window and I went to the windowsill. </sentence><sentence id="1034">I thought, well, many people did that by the way, I was not the only one. </sentence><sentence id="1035">I said well, let's finish it up. </sentence><sentence id="1036">My landlady, who was a very nice lady, she came into the room and she says Elizabeth, you must be crazy. </sentence><sentence id="1037">You are opening the window and the whole heat what I put up here, it goes away. </sentence><sentence id="1038">I mean I don't heat here that you open here the windows. </sentence><sentence id="1039">I am standing on the window ledge jumping. </sentence><sentence id="1040">I got very mad and I went then. </sentence><sentence id="1041">I got so mad that I went to her and I start to hit her. </sentence><sentence id="1042">I hit her and I hit her and she kneeled down beside me and she said, oh, Elizabeth don't do that, don't do that. </sentence><sentence id="1043">She did that and she said that just to bring me back from the ledge. </sentence><sentence id="1044">Was a nice lady. </sentence><sentence id="1045">After that, I said well, okay, let's start living. </sentence><sentence id="1046">I went to the soup kitchen and I asked for a job in the soup kitchen. </sentence><sentence id="1047">In there, there are so many incidents, so many incidents happened there during the war, after the war, during the bombing, in the ghetto. </sentence><sentence id="1048">It is interesting but as I told it to Henry, you cannot go into every aspect. </sentence></p></dialogue>
