<body><dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="1"> WILLIAM DENSON August 25, 1994 </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3">Q:Morning. </sentence><sentence id="4">Could you tell us your name and where you were born and when you were born? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="7">A:My name is William Dowdell Denson. </sentence><sentence id="8">I was born the 31st day of May, nineteen hundred and thirteen in Birmingham, Alabama. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="11">Q:And can you tell us a bit about your education? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="13">A: Well, I was actually educated in the public schools of Birmingham. </sentence><sentence id="14">In nineteen hundred and thirty when I was 17 years of age, I was appointed to the United States military academy at West Point, New York. </sentence><sentence id="15">I entered there in July of that year, and I graduated from there in June of nineteen hundred and thirty-four. </sentence><sentence id="16">I resigned my commission in the United States Army and was accepted as a student at Harvard Law School, which I attended from September of 1934 until graduating in June of 1937. </sentence><sentence id="17">That is the basis of my undoing. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="23">Q:And how come you got interested in the law? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="25">A: Well, I guess that was kind of natural. </sentence><sentence id="26">My great-grandfather on my mother's side was a member of Congress in eighteen hundred and fifty-five and continued there until Alabama succeeded from the Union. </sentence><sentence id="27">At that time he became a colonel in command of the 37th Infantry Regiment of Alabama and participated in the siege of Vicksburg. </sentence><sentence id="28">He was a lawyer and enjoyed the law apparently very much. </sentence><sentence id="29">On my -- his son, rather, would go back -- take the maternal side first. </sentence><sentence id="30">My great-grandfather that I just described had a son by the name of James Rendar (ph) Dowdell. </sentence><sentence id="31">He also was a lawyer. </sentence><sentence id="32">And, in fact, he was a chief justice of the supreme court of Alabama which is the highest judicial court of that state. </sentence><sentence id="33">And my father, I'm skipping now to my pappy's side of the house, and he, of course, was a lawyer. </sentence><sentence id="34">And his father was a congressman and the United States attorney for the northern district of Alabama. </sentence><sentence id="35">So I sort of come by the law in a natural fashion. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="48">Q:And going to West Point? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="50">A: went to West Point in -- </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="52">Q:Why? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="54">A:Excuse me? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="56">Q:Why? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="58">A:I went to West Point back after I graduated both from Harvard and from the military academy. </sentence><sentence id="59">I went back to West Point to teach law there in January of nineteen hundred and forty-two and taught law there until January of nineteen hundred and forty-five, at which time I was ordered to join the headquarters of the United States Army, 3rd United States Army. </sentence><sentence id="60">And I was a member of the judge advocate's section of that army. </sentence><sentence id="61">And I joined them in February of 1945. </sentence><sentence id="62">Now, my duties in the judge advocate's section in the Headquarters 3rd Army was to have charge of the administration of military justice, which was familiar to me because of my teaching also of military justice at West Point from "42 until "45. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="68">Q:Can we go back just a little bit? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="70">A:Yes. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="72">Q:When you were at Harvard, the Nazis had taken over in Germany. </sentence><sentence id="73">And when you were at Harvard in 1935 the Nuremberg Laws had been passed. </sentence><sentence id="74">Was there any discussion at Harvard about what was going on in Nazi Germany that you can remember? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="78">A:No, sir. </sentence><sentence id="79">At that time, and because curriculum was kind of rough and tough for a country boy like me, I didn't concern myself with much more than trying to study the cases that had been assigned. </sentence><sentence id="80">And there wasn't much discussion either from the professors, nor among the students as to the situation in Germany at that time. </sentence><sentence id="81">And nothing -- I knew nothing of the Nuremberg Laws other than the fact that there were indeed Nuremberg Laws that had been passed. </sentence><sentence id="82">And as such, they were discriminatory highly, and something that hardly anybody could be proud of. </sentence><sentence id="83">But there was never any teaching at Harvard about the Nuremberg Laws at that time. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="90">Q:When did you first become aware of oppression in Germany? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="92">A:To be honest with you, the first that I really recall was Kristallnacht. </sentence><sentence id="93">That was in November of nineteen hundred and thirty-eight, if I'm not mistaken. </sentence><sentence id="94">At that time the pogroms had started. </sentence><sentence id="95">And actually they started even before then. </sentence><sentence id="96">But that was the event that produced a notoriety in that I think the whole world knew about it from that time or from that time on. </sentence><sentence id="97">And it was rather a shock to me, because I had a number of very dear friends who were Jewish that I had grown up with in grammar school, high school and in West Point and at Harvard. </sentence><sentence id="98">So it was -- it came as quite a shock to me that that sort of thing was then taking place. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="106">Q:Did you know anything about the ship to St. Louis that had been coming from Europe to Cuba and was not let -- people were not let into Cuba and then they weren't let in the United States? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="108">A:No. </sentence><sentence id="109">I never heard that until I became more involved with this matter. </sentence><sentence id="110">War crimes and indiscriminations that had occurred. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="114">Q:So that until you became involved in the war crimes trials, your knowledge of what was going on was really quite small then? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="116">A:lt was negligible. </sentence><sentence id="117">And I knew even less about communism. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="120">Q:So tell me, did you want this job in the judge advocate's office? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="122">A:I would say this, that probably I recognized it as a professional challenge and one that I would certainly like to entertain. </sentence><sentence id="123">And I considered myself fortunate to have received the designation in that capacity. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="126">Q:But you didn't know what you were getting into? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="128">A: certainly did not. </sentence><sentence id="129">I would do it again, though. </sentence><sentence id="130">Even now that I know it. </sentence><sentence id="131">But I think that I started to say I wouldn't change anything, but I'm sure that upon reflection I might have changed a lot of things. </sentence><sentence id="132">But I couldn't tell you right now what I would have changed. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="138">Q:When did you first become immersed in the kind of material you would be confronting, the kind of evidence you'd be confronting? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="140">A:Well, in Headquarters 3rd Army we had a war crimes team that went along with the combat troops. </sentence><sentence id="141">And that was true in all of the combat units. </sentence><sentence id="142">The war crimes investigating teams were groups of individuals, lawyers, investigators, and supporting personnel, that investigated atrocities as the combat troops uncovered them. </sentence><sentence id="143">And some of those things drifted into the Headquarters of 3rd Army. </sentence><sentence id="144">And our judge advocate -- I mean a staff judge advocate at that time was a colonel by the name of Colonel Charles E. Cheever (ph). </sentence><sentence id="145">And he had an assistant by the name of Josephs that was handling the war crimes aspects at that time. </sentence><sentence id="146">They were later handled by a classmate of mine, as I said, Colonel O'Connell. </sentence><sentence id="147">But in the conversations, the existence of some of these atrocities did become the subject of our conversations. </sentence><sentence id="148">So it was, I would say, before, slightly before, not much before May 7th of 1945. </sentence><sentence id="149">And, of course, May 7th was the day when hostilities ceased. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="160">Q:So you learned something before you went to Germany? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="162">A:No, no, no, no. </sentence><sentence id="163">May 7th of 1945. </sentence><sentence id="164">I was in Germany at that time. </sentence><sentence id="165">I went over to Germany, I went to Headquarters 3rd Army in February of 1945. </sentence><sentence id="166">But actually I don't remember very much war crimes activity until we were stationed in Munich at the rear echelon of Headquarters 3rd Amny was stationed in Munich. </sentence><sentence id="167">And I think it was there when I really first learned anything about t he war crimes proceedings that were being uncovered and the events that took place thereafter. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="175">Q:Can you tell us some of your first impressions as you began to look at this evidence for the first time? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="177">A:Well, the first time that I ever had a chance to look at the evidence actually was, I think, in the beginning or middle of August of nineteen hundred and forty-five. </sentence><sentence id="178">And those were some of the reports and findings that the war crimes investigating teams had made to the judge advocate's section in Headquarters 3rd Army. </sentence><sentence id="179">Patton was the commanding general at that time. </sentence><sentence id="180">And the teams that would be actually at Dachau was just 17 kilometers west of Munich. </sentence><sentence id="181">And at that time we were conscious of what was -- had gone along at Dachau. </sentence><sentence id="182">I didn't actually visit the camp until I think some time in July of 1945. </sentence><sentence id="183">Our headquarters were in the-- what they call the house of in Munich. </sentence><sentence id="184">And 17 kilometers didn't particularly interest me at that time at all. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="193">Q:What was the nature of the evidence that you were looking at when you -- </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="195">A:At that time? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="197">Q:From the war crimes team? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="199">A:From the war crimes team were reports that were sent in by the investigators and interrogators. </sentence><sentence id="200">And to look at them and to read them was not to comprehend them. </sentence><sentence id="201">Not that they were written in incomprehensive language. </sentence><sentence id="202">But the events that they described were incredible. </sentence><sentence id="203">And at first there was sort of attitude that this -- some of these people had too many Schnapps when they were writing the reports. </sentence><sentence id="204">But that of course is in jest. </sentence><sentence id="205">Never was any such feeling toward the investigators at all. </sentence><sentence id="206">But the events that they described were so incredible that you couldn't help but have a feeling of that, the presence of being depicting events and reciting events in the reports that were so far out from the normal course of events that it was just incredible. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="215">Q:There were a number of lawyers with you? </sentence><sentence id="216">About 30 lawyers? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="219">A:In the -- </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="221">Q:That were working with you. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="223">A:At that time we had quite a number of lawyers in the judge advocate's section. </sentence><sentence id="224">And in the war crimes teams there were actually quite -- I don't recall at this particular moment how many lawyers there were. </sentence><sentence id="225">But investigators, interrogators and lawyers were 40-, 50-odd individuals. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="229">Q:Did you talk about this evidence that was coming in? </sentence><sentence id="230">Were most people equally as incredulous as you were? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="233">A:Well, I'm sure that they were. </sentence><sentence id="234">I don't think there's much doubt about the fact that anybody that came in contact with them, with the evidence, of course, they saw it. </sentence><sentence id="235">It was a credible matter to them. </sentence><sentence id="236">But from the secondhand on, it was an incredible matter. </sentence><sentence id="237">And the biggest problem that I had after I was designated to prosecute these case, the biggest problem that I had was believing or getting testimony that could be believed. </sentence><sentence id="238">Because of it's nature. </sentence><sentence id="239">Not that it wasn't true; it was true. </sentence><sentence id="240">But the events that were depicted were so horrible, were so sadistic, were so monstrous, that they were incredible. </sentence><sentence id="241">That's the only way to describe it. </sentence><sentence id="242">And I was a skeptic. </sentence><sentence id="243">I didn't believe it at that time. </sentence><sentence id="244">I didn't start believing it until I really started digging into with the concept and with the authority that I was going to prosecute the Dachau concentration camp case. </sentence><sentence id="245">At that time when I started talking to witnesses, and I heard events there that were so out of line, that they were incredible. </sentence><sentence id="246">I could give you an event that perhaps might depict it. </sentence><sentence id="247">In all of these camps there was place in the camp called the arrest bunker. </sentence><sentence id="248">And in the arrest bunker there was some cells which were called the standing cells. </sentence><sentence id="249">They were instruments of torture in reality because they were so small and so constructed that it was almost impossible for -- almost impossible--it was impossible for a prisoner who had been committed to one of these cells to either lie down or to sit. </sentence><sentence id="250">He had to stand in order to be within the confines of the cell. </sentence><sentence id="251">And these $.S. men who were in charge of the arrest bunker would put prisoners in there for punishment. </sentence><sentence id="252">They received no food, no water, and no chance to sit down or lie down, or change their position for three to five days. </sentence><sentence id="253">And sometimes longer if they lived that long. </sentence><sentence id="254">Then at the end of the period of time, they'd take them out. </sentence><sentence id="255">And if they were still alive, they would sit them down to a table. </sentence><sentence id="256">And on that table would be a vessel with two or more liters of water in it. </sentence><sentence id="257">Well, the poor emaciated prisoner starved by thirst and absolutely out of his mind took the liters of water and guzzled it down immediately. </sentence><sentence id="258">That caused the stomach of this emaciated prisoner to protrude out. </sentence><sentence id="259">When that happened, the S.S. man who was there would drive his fist into that stomach. </sentence><sentence id="260">Or if he couldn't sit, throw him down on the ground and then stomp that protruding stomach with his heel, rupturing the walls of the stomach, and the prisoner died of an agonizing death. </sentence><sentence id="261">Now,    looking at you, you don't look like you believe it either, but it happened. </sentence><sentence id="262">It was one of the things that happened. </sentence><sentence id="263">And it happened not only in Dachau, which was the case I was concerned with at that time, but in Mauthausen, Flossenbiirg and Buchenwald. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="297">Q:Let's stop now. </sentence><sentence id="298">We have to change the tape. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="301"> TAPE #2 </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="303">Q:Bill, You gave us an example of what would make you be skeptical. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="305">A:Yes. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="307">Q:What caused you not to become skeptical? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="309">A:Well, being skeptical we looked around and we finally got a hold of other witnesses and interrogated them and found out that some of them had witnessed this same event that I just described to you. </sentence><sentence id="310">And I interrogated those witnesses very, very closely and very, very carefully to find out as many details as each of them could recall. </sentence><sentence id="311">And low and behold the details that these other witnesses gave me dove-tailed very closely with the incident that I just recited to you. </sentence><sentence id="312">And because they dove-tailed so closely and because of this corroboration, and I knew that these witnesses had not had a chance to get together and make up the story among themselves, that that event had to have happened. </sentence><sentence id="313">It had to have happened because two people couldn't have imagined the same type of misconduct. </sentence><sentence id="314">It was so far out, it was so atrocious, so heinous, that the normal individual just couldn't imagine that sort of event taking place. </sentence><sentence id="315">Nevertheless, when somebody from Poland gave me that type of story, another witness from France the same thing, another from Belgium, I began to believe. </sentence><sentence id="316">And finally I got to the point where I could believe most anything because it all did happen. </sentence><sentence id="317">That was the thing that made a believer out of me. </sentence><sentence id="318">But it pointed up a problem that I was confronted with. </sentence><sentence id="319">What court now is going to hear these witnesses for the first time with such a horrible event. </sentence><sentence id="320">Who's going to believe that? </sentence><sentence id="321">You didn't. </sentence><sentence id="322">And it's only natural that the members of the court wouldn't believe it. </sentence><sentence id="323">So what we had to do was to sort of condition the court in this sense that I first introduced evidence of events that you would expect to have occurred in a penal environment. </sentence><sentence id="324">Slapping around. </sentence><sentence id="325">Little more force; knocking around. </sentence><sentence id="326">Down to beatings. </sentence><sentence id="327">In that various degrees. </sentence><sentence id="328">And in that way it conditioned the court for the bizarre events that I just described to you. </sentence><sentence id="329">And that was a problem that we recognized and was a major problem that served as the subject of our conversations as counsel. </sentence><sentence id="330">And when I say our conversations as counsel, I had assistants that were trained lawyers, wonderful men. </sentence><sentence id="331">And we would get together after each session and discuss among ourselves to what extent we thought we had conditioned the court so that we could bring on testimony of these bizarre events that took place. </sentence><sentence id="332">And it seemed to work. </sentence><sentence id="333">The court in all cases except one found the accused guilty of committing war crimes. </sentence><sentence id="334">And, well, the nature of the sentences that they imposed, they must have believed. </sentence><sentence id="335">We almost hit the jackpot in the Mauthausen case. </sentence><sentence id="336">In that case we had 61 accused in the dock that we were trying. </sentence><sentence id="337">And of that 61, all of them were found guilty. </sentence><sentence id="338">58 of them were sentenced to be hanged and three of them were sentenced to life imprisonment. </sentence><sentence id="339">So that was almost the jackpot. </sentence><sentence id="340">If they had all been sentenced to be hanged, that would have been the jackpot. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="374">Q:Were you looking for the death sentence in most of the cases that you were trying? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="376">A:Well, let me tell you this: Looking for it is one way to put it. </sentence><sentence id="377">In the commission of a war crime, the maximum punishment is death by hanging. </sentence><sentence id="378">And depending on the circumstances, any lesser punishment as the circumstances may dictate in the mind of the court. </sentence><sentence id="379">So all of them, all of them were subject to having had the death sentence imposed upon them after having been found guilty. </sentence><sentence id="380">So that to say were you looking for it, there was some that were more guilty than others. </sentence><sentence id="381">And that was the second problem that we had; that of comparative sentences. </sentence><sentence id="382">When you try a number of people at one time -- and you may wonder why we tried so many at one time. </sentence><sentence id="383">We had the 61 there in Mauthausen, we had 40 in Dachau, 45 in Flossenburg, and 31 in Buchenwald. </sentence><sentence id="384">We had to have representatives out of every phase of operation of the camp, otherwise it would be only part of a picture that we were trying to establish by evidence. </sentence><sentence id="385">And it was important that we established the criminality of the operation of each one of these camps in every one of its phases. </sentence><sentence id="386">Because the charge that we were making was that each of those individuals that sat in that dock as an accused either aided, abetted, participated in the common design of subjecting these individuals to beatings, killings, tortures, starvation and death. </sentence><sentence id="387">So it was important to have representatives out of each phase of operation. </sentence><sentence id="388">And in that way the court could make a finding that it was a criminal operation in its entirety. </sentence><sentence id="389">We had some 3,500 accused that had been denounced in the war crimes case at Dachau. </sentence><sentence id="390">And we couldn't try individually each one of these on a case on the basis that we tried the parent case. </sentence><sentence id="391">Those were the cases that I tried, the parent case. </sentence><sentence id="392">You couldn't spend that much time trying each one of these individuals; 3,500. </sentence><sentence id="393">We'd still be trying them. </sentence><sentence id="394">So it was perfectly lawful to have the camp condemned as a criminal operation in its entirety. </sentence><sentence id="395">Then cast the burden upon these 3,500 individuals in groups of one, two, up to as many as might be essential to paint a picture. </sentence><sentence id="396">And let them explain away having established that they were there at the camp, at each one of these four camps, any one of them. </sentence><sentence id="397">And in that way you can't say that they were presumed to be guilty. </sentence><sentence id="398">But the burden of proof was shifted a little bit to the extent that these individuals had to come forward. </sentence><sentence id="399">And they did. </sentence><sentence id="400">Some of them come forward and say, "You got the wrong person by the wrong name. </sentence><sentence id="401">My name is Schwartz and this other man's name was Schwartzenegger you're talking    about." </sentence><sentence id="402">And another one of the defenses was that "I was there for such a short period of time, I didn't know that this was a criminal operation." </sentence><sentence id="403">And even another defense was, "I was ordered to do it." </sentence><sentence id="404">Well, that was no defense at all for the simple reason that for -- superior orders is the name that they give this defense. </sentence><sentence id="405">For that to be a defense, the order itself that was disobeyed, if it was disobeyed you could be shot. </sentence><sentence id="406">That's what superior orders is a shorthand of saying it. </sentence><sentence id="407">These individuals would come in there, none of them ever put on any evidence to show that anybody was ever shot for disobeying an order given them in the concentration camp. </sentence><sentence id="408">The S.S. men I'm talking about or the Kapos that worked for the S.S. -- and remind me to tell you about the Kapos, too. </sentence><sentence id="409">But the superior order defense was predicated upon the order being a lawful order. </sentence><sentence id="410">Well, the operation of the concentration camps were illegal under German law. </sentence><sentence id="411">German law still had statutes against murder. </sentence><sentence id="412">They had statutes against assault and battery. </sentence><sentence id="413">They were crimes. </sentence><sentence id="414">And they had individuals in the penitentiaries and in the camps for committing crimes. </sentence><sentence id="415">So that what was taking place in Dachau, Mauthausen, Flossenbiirg and Buchenwald were crimes under German law. </sentence><sentence id="416">So that the law was -- the order that was given to beat a man over here, or to hang another man over here by his wrists, those were against German law. </sentence><sentence id="417">And since this defense of superior orders didn't prevail, that was out the window. </sentence><sentence id="418">And on that basis we were able to take the findings of the parent trials, those four cases that I've just described, and introduce those in evidence and then let the accused put on any evidence in mitigation that they may have at their command. </sentence><sentence id="419">And I would like to point out at this time that any time any accused was brought to trial, he was furnished with counsel by the United States government; that is American counsel. </sentence><sentence id="420">And he could have German counsel of his own choosing. </sentence><sentence id="421">In other words, we gave these accused in these cases all the rights that a citizen would have had he been tried for a crime in the United States district courts or the federal courts of this country. </sentence><sentence id="422">So we gave these accused that protection that our own citizens would have received. </sentence><sentence id="423">So that it's very    difficult to understand the complaint that some people have with these trials saying it's nothing but victors" justice. </sentence><sentence id="424">That isn't true. </sentence><sentence id="425">That isn't true at all. </sentence><sentence id="426">They had a fair trial just as our citizen would have had. </sentence><sentence id="427">Now, I may be straying all over the lot here from what we started out with. </sentence><sentence id="428">I wanted to explain to you the fact that the defense of superior orders had no place in these trials at all. </sentence><sentence id="429">And prior to that I think I wanted to point out to you that there were circumstances in these cases which required a great number of accused in order to establish the criminality, criminality of these camps. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="487">Q:Each camp had to be proven as -- </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="489">A:A criminal operation in its entirety. </sentence><sentence id="490">That is correct. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="493">Q:In order that you could then try all these thousands of other people? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="495">A:That is correct. </sentence><sentence id="496">That's right. </sentence><sentence id="497">Otherwise you would have to establish the same thing for each one of these individuals. </sentence><sentence id="498">And with 3,500 individual cases, that just wasn't a feasible proposition. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="503">Q:I'm going to ask you something about the witnesses and the accused. </sentence><sentence id="504">But I wanted to go back a little bit to the court itself. </sentence><sentence id="505">Who made up the judges? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="509">A:The court was called a Military Government Court. </sentence><sentence id="510">Now, the Military Government Court was one aspect in which the United States government participated in the war crimes program in Europe. </sentence><sentence id="511">First you had the I.M.T., the International Military Tribunal at Nuremberg. </sentence><sentence id="512">That was no part of what we were doing at Dachau. </sentence><sentence id="513">Then you had the subsequent proceedings in Nuremberg. </sentence><sentence id="514">And that was tried -- those were tribunals that were appointed by the Allied Control Council but were not international in nature but were all U.S. citizens that were involved. </sentence><sentence id="515">And the third was a Military Government Courts which were courts that were appointed by the military. </sentence><sentence id="516">Now, the first Dachau court was appointed by General Lucien Truscott, who was the commanding general of 3rd U.S. Army. </sentence><sentence id="517">And that was done under the aegis of the staff judge advocate for the European Theater of the United States Forces. </sentence><sentence id="518">USTEF, we called it. </sentence><sentence id="519">And these individuals that were appointed to the court were senior field grade officers with the rank of full colonel. </sentence><sentence id="520">And they were composed of anywhere from seven to nine officers. </sentence><sentence id="521">And they were presided over by a general officer, usually a brigadier general or a major general, as the case may be. </sentence><sentence id="522">And these were men of stature in their profession. </sentence><sentence id="523">And they acted as fact-finders as well as applying the law. </sentence><sentence id="524">Now, the law was neing given them by what was known as the law member on the court. </sentence><sentence id="525">He was usually a lawyer who had had extensive experience and was learned in the law. </sentence><sentence id="526">And these courts functioned under the aegis -- the Military Government Courts that I had anything to do with, were under the aegis of Headquarters 3rd U.S. Army. </sentence><sentence id="527">The 7th Army started to have a war crimes program and finally was decided that all the facilities that were necessary were present down in Dachau, Germany which was the site of the concentration camp Dachau. </sentence><sentence id="528">And the war crimes program of 7th Army was folded over into what they called the War Crimes Group, whose headquarters was at Dachau. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="552"> TAPE #3 </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="554">Q:So let's get back to the judges. </sentence><sentence id="555">You were explaining who they were. </sentence><sentence id="556">There was one lawyer in this group, the rest of them weren't lawyers? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="560">A:Yeah, yeah. </sentence><sentence id="561">All right. </sentence><sentence id="562">We'll start with -- </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="566">Q:You can answer the question. </sentence><sentence id="567">We're okay. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="570">A:Okay. </sentence><sentence id="571">The personnel of this Military Government Courts, as I said, consisted of seven to nine individuals. </sentence><sentence id="572">One of whom was a law member. </sentence><sentence id="573">The balance of these individuals were career professional officers. </sentence><sentence id="574">They had usually had anywhere from 25 to 30 years of experience as being in the armed services of the United States. </sentence><sentence id="575">Were all, as I said, selected as men of stature and high moral character. </sentence><sentence id="576">And they were selected by Headquarters 3rd Army as the appointing authority. </sentence><sentence id="577">And were taken also, I might add, with the consensus of the headquarters of USTEF. </sentence><sentence id="578">That is European forces of the United States in Europe. </sentence><sentence id="579">And they were men who took their duties very seriously. </sentence><sentence id="580">They had all served as members of court marshals in the course of their careers as regular army officers. </sentence><sentence id="581">But the law that was given to them was given to them by the law member of that court, and there wasn't but one of those. </sentence><sentence id="582">The law member was the individual who advised the rest of the court as to the admissibility of evidence, for example. </sentence><sentence id="583">You couldn't have nine judges sitting up there and the question being asked down here and one member says -- when the other side objects, one man says, one judge says sustained and the other one says overruled. </sentence><sentence id="584">So that was solely within the province of the law member. </sentence><sentence id="585">But the law that was applicable was international law. </sentence><sentence id="586">And they were charged with what was known as war crimes. </sentence><sentence id="587">And a war crime that these people were charged with were violation of the laws and usages of war. </sentence><sentence id="588">Now, they -- that term, violation of the laws and usages of war, embodies the conventions that this country and Germany had entered into. </sentence><sentence id="589">And they, of course, were signatories to the Hague Convention of nineteen hundred and seven, and the Geneva Convention of nineteen hundred and twenty-nine. </sentence><sentence id="590">And I might point out at this time that the war crime that we are talking about, violation of the laws and usages of war, included not only these conventions that I've just mentioned, but also they included the course of conduct of combatants in the past. </sentence><sentence id="591">There were a lot of customs and usages that had existed that were all embodied in the term laws and usages of war. </sentence><sentence id="592">You know, the conventions were taking place solely for the purpose of really making more civilized the practicing of war. </sentence><sentence id="593">And the Hague concerned itself with non combatants, and the Geneva Convention concerned itself with the conduct of combatants toward prisoners of war. </sentence><sentence id="594">And those were the two particulars that we had in each one of these charges that we had for these camps. </sentence><sentence id="595">That they violated the laws and usages of war in that pursuant to a common design to operate these camps to kill, to beat, to starve, these were the offenses that they were charged with. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="623">Q:The charge or the indictment of the crimes against humanity was not applicable? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="625">A:No, sir, it was not. </sentence><sentence id="626">These -- these violations that I prosecuted these accused for were just as much a part of their law as their statutes in Germany. </sentence><sentence id="627">So there was no retroactive effect of what we were doing here at Dachau at all. </sentence><sentence id="628">There were no new crimes that were established at Dachau. </sentence><sentence id="629">We tried them for what had been on the books for years and years. </sentence><sentence id="630">Nobody could get in there and say that this is ex post facto in what was carried on by the military government courts in Dachau. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="637">Q:Do you think that was a problem in the other cases? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="639">A:I don't think there's any doubt about it. </sentence><sentence id="640">There was some people that wouldn't have even dared touch them because of the feeling that they were ex post facto. </sentence><sentence id="641">Waging aggressive warfare. </sentence><sentence id="642">Every warfare is aggressive. </sentence><sentence id="643">The means by which you carry it out, that's something else again. </sentence><sentence id="644">But crimes against humanity, that's as broad as the world is big. </sentence><sentence id="645">But we had nothing indefinite about what we did at Dachau. </sentence><sentence id="646">I've been in a lot of arguments on this, so I don't want to get started. </sentence><sentence id="647">We could be here -- </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="657">Q:I'm curious, because there were three indictments that were possible in these war crimes trials. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="659">A:Yes. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="661">Q:Crimes against peace, crimes against humanity and war crimes. </sentence><sentence id="662">Crimes against humanity was the least used? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="665">A:That's right. </sentence><sentence id="666">Because it was least known. </sentence><sentence id="667">It was the least recognized. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="671">Q:And you agree to that? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="673">A:] agree with that, sure. </sentence><sentence id="674">I really do. </sentence><sentence id="675">There'll come a day I'm sure as we become more civilized and conduct our wars in more civilized ways, where you got to let authority expand. </sentence><sentence id="676">And that takes in crimes against humanity. </sentence><sentence id="677">Because humanity, when you start defining it, is rather broad. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="683">Q:Whose idea was it to have these parent trials essentially? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="685">A:Well, I think that was born of necessity more than anything else. </sentence><sentence id="686">You can't say that that was product of any one man's brain. </sentence><sentence id="687">The law chancellor of England participated in putting together the proper procedures so that -- it was not an individual contribution of any one man. </sentence><sentence id="688">But it grew and has been growing and will always grow. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="693">Q:When you talked about the fact that the legal system that was used or the procedures that were used would be those used for American citizens, you're really, I think, talking about military? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="695">A: am -- I am indeed, except the constitutional rights. </sentence><sentence id="696">In other words, the constitutional rights that are guaranteed to every one of our citizens when he's confronted with being accused of a crime were afforded to these people. </sentence><sentence id="697">They had the right to counsel. </sentence><sentence id="698">They had the right to have witnesses. </sentence><sentence id="699">In Buchenwald we had a man by the name of Dr. Evan Katzenelenbogen who had some friends in France that he wanted -- in Paris that he wanted brought over to the trial at Dachau. </sentence><sentence id="700">We brought them over, but he didn't know that they had gotten here. </sentence><sentence id="701">And he got up and told the court that he had made this request and never been fulfilled at all, in one respect. </sentence><sentence id="702">And in another, that the witnesses were dead. </sentence><sentence id="703">That he is sorry to learn that the witnesses were dead. </sentence><sentence id="704">And we had them sitting out in the witness room. </sentence><sentence id="705">They were not dead at all. </sentence><sentence id="706">They were arrived. </sentence><sentence id="707">They came in and testified. </sentence><sentence id="708">Not too much for Dr. Katzenelenbogen. </sentence><sentence id="709">But they said what he wanted them to say, but they also said what also occurred in Buchenwald. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="725">Q:You said that American attorneys could also be used by the accused? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="727">A:Absolutely. </sentence><sentence id="728">They were. </sentence><sentence id="729">And they had not only American counsel, but also a German counsel as well. </sentence><sentence id="730">And when I told you that my status changed from being a colonel in the army to a civilian, I was what was known as a War Department civilian. </sentence><sentence id="731">And there were quite a number of Americans that were over there serving as defense counsel. </sentence><sentence id="732">And they had access to those as well and some of them also served as prosecutors. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="739">Q:Could the Americans decide whether they wanted to be a prosecutor or whether they wanted to be a defense attorney? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="741">A:Well, I think basically they could. </sentence><sentence id="742">But more -- it was more determined when the courts were organized, and when they went -- when the courts were organized, the individuals that were named in as prosecutors or as defense counsel, they were selected from this pool of lawyers. </sentence><sentence id="743">And when they got in that pool, some of them preferred to be defense counsel, some of them preferred to be prosecutors. </sentence><sentence id="744">And I think that those facts were made known and were considered by the appointing authority. </sentence><sentence id="745">But the final say was the appointing authority which was General Truscott and later on General McNamey" and General Clay". " </sentence><sentence id="746">Joseph T.

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="765">Q:Did Jewish lawyers have a particular -- were they given particular dispensation not to have to defend if they didn't want to? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="767">A:Oh, no. </sentence><sentence id="768">No, no. </sentence><sentence id="769">We had Jewish lawyers that acted both as prosecution and as defense. </sentence><sentence id="770">One of my counsel assistants in Dachau was very able young lawyer by the name of Paul Gooth (ph).Paul had been born in Vienna. </sentence><sentence id="771">And Paul was educated at Oxford and took his law at Columbia and was a very able lawyer. </sentence><sentence id="772">And a very young man at that time. </sentence><sentence id="773">And he was tremendous help to us in the preparation of the Dachau case and the Mauthausen case. </sentence><sentence id="774">He was superb, actually. </sentence><sentence id="775">And I point him out because of the fact that he was Jewish. </sentence><sentence id="776">But he did take on the prosecutorial role. </sentence><sentence id="777">And his contributions were invaluable, really. </sentence><sentence id="778">And I had another one by the name of Berkowitz from Philadelphia; Camden/Philadelphia area. </sentence><sentence id="779">He was in the Flossenbiirg case. </sentence><sentence id="780">He started out with Colonel Shaw, and Colonel Shaw became ill and I replaced Colonel Shaw. </sentence><sentence id="781">Mr. Berkowitz was a superb lawyer. </sentence><sentence id="782">And he did more to keep co-counsel straight in the trial of Flossenbiirg than anybody else there. </sentence><sentence id="783">And he did that by making us all remember that we owed a responsibility to these accused. </sentence><sentence id="784">And the responsibility we owed was to give them a fair trial. </sentence><sentence id="785">And that brings to mind the fact that when we were first called altogether in the Dachau case, which was the first one of these parent cases, the commanding general at that time was Lucien Truscott. </sentence><sentence id="786">And he called us all together and said he wanted us to be fair, but he wanted each one of us to be able to look back upon what we had done in the future and be proud of it. </sentence><sentence id="787">So that we should conduct ourselves in that way. </sentence><sentence id="788">And fairness was the first requirement. </sentence><sentence id="789">And with that as a send off, I thought it was pretty good. </sentence><sentence id="790">And that became a part of Mr. Berkowitz. </sentence><sentence id="791">And Mr. Berkowitz also was -- made contributions in procedure and knowledge of substantive law that we all appreciated. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="819">Q:When you're sitting in the courtroom -- let's begin to talk about Dachau. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="821">A:Yes. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="823">Q:Tell me what -- this is your first set of trials. </sentence><sentence id="824">The first time you are confronting this information, confronting accused within this kind of a situation. </sentence><sentence id="825">What is this like? </sentence><sentence id="826">What happened during this trial? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="831">A:Well, let me say this: At the time I started to try Dachau, I had tried literally hundreds of jury cases and bench trials. </sentence><sentence id="832">So the fact that this was a tribunal and I was appearing before them where the fact-finders were in the majority like normally be in a jury, and the judge was a law member, it wasn't anything that was unusual. </sentence><sentence id="833">But the feeling that I had at that time was that I wanted to establish a record that would depict a true picture of what went on. </sentence><sentence id="834">And that these individuals accused over there, while they were essential cogs in the machine that the picture was of, the operation of the camp, that it was essential that each one of them be given an opportunity to do whatever he thought was within his power to acquit himself and any of his confederates, if you please. </sentence><sentence id="835">And I use that term confederates advisedly. </sentence><sentence id="836">But actually I had no qualms of conscience about wanting to hang any one of them. </sentence><sentence id="837">Because I had actually convinced myself to the point that I was perfectly willing to put the noose around the neck of each one of them with my own hand and spring the trap with my own hand. </sentence><sentence id="838">I was that convinced of their guilt. </sentence><sentence id="839">And so in mass, it was a mass of guilty individuals that should be put away. </sentence><sentence id="840">And that's the way I felt about it. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="852">Q:Okay. </sentence><sentence id="853">We're going to take a break now with another tape. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="856">A:All right. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="858">Q:Let's stop the tape now. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="860"> TAPE #4 </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="862">Q:Bill, could you describe the atmosphere at the Dachau trials and what that was like for you? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="864">A:Well, let me say this: That the courtroom had been one of the buildings in which operations in support of the war had taken place. </sentence><sentence id="865">True it is, they were making shoes and uniforms for the Wehrmacht. </sentence><sentence id="866">And they had the necessary machinery in there for sewing and mending and that sort of thing. </sentence><sentence id="867">Well, when they decided to have these trials down in Dachau, they ripped out all the insides of this building that I just described so that there was one large room. </sentence><sentence id="868">And it was so large that it was the size of the whole building, which could have been 200-250 feet long and maybe a hundred feet wide. </sentence><sentence id="869">And they made offices for the prosecution and offices for the defendants. </sentence><sentence id="870">And one end of the -- accused in one end of the building, another end of the building was the courtroom. </sentence><sentence id="871">And at the far end was a dais that was raised about two feet off of the ground. </sentence><sentence id="872">So you had to take really two steps to get up to where you could stand. </sentence><sentence id="873">And there was a bench, you called it. </sentence><sentence id="874">What we call -- lawyers call bench. </sentence><sentence id="875">The judges" bench. </sentence><sentence id="876">It was his desk actually. </sentence><sentence id="877">It was a table that went practically the length of the room. </sentence><sentence id="878">And under which revolving chairs were placed. </sentence><sentence id="879">And it would seat up on the dais approximately as many as 12 to 13 people. </sentence><sentence id="880">So it was adequate. </sentence><sentence id="881">And being elevated, it was high enough to command respect. </sentence><sentence id="882">That's the whole idea of having the judge on the bench. </sentence><sentence id="883">And it was a dignified place. </sentence><sentence id="884">American flag was back on the wall which was behind the members of the court who were seated in front of it. </sentence><sentence id="885">And then in front of them there was the witness stand. </sentence><sentence id="886">And the witness stand was a single chair sort of like I'm sitting in here now. </sentence><sentence id="887">And that was placed in the middle. </sentence><sentence id="888">And about maybe 15 feet from where the members of the court sat, the accused sat either on the left- or the right-hand side of the court as the court wanted. </sentence><sentence id="889">The accused had nothing to say. </sentence><sentence id="890">They occupied seats which were like seats in a theater that didn't have the upholstery. </sentence><sentence id="891">They were seats -- seat of the seat folded up. </sentence><sentence id="892">And they sat on -- the accused in Dachau sat on the court's left in that case. </sentence><sentence id="893">In Mauthausen they started out on the left and moved over to the right. </sentence><sentence id="894">I never asked who moved them, but I went in the court one day and it was that way, so that was it. </sentence><sentence id="895">And the accused each had their own separate seat. </sentence><sentence id="896">And in front of the bank of accused that was seated there were the counsel table for the accused. </sentence><sentence id="897">And there the lawyers and their assistants sat and took their notes and had their interpreters seated there with them. </sentence><sentence id="898">And getting back to the interpreters, the language barriers, they were not overcome there like they were at Nuremberg. </sentence><sentence id="899">We had no instantaneous translation. </sentence><sentence id="900">We had -- the trials were conducted in English and in German basically. </sentence><sentence id="901">So we had an English and German interpreter. </sentence><sentence id="902">Then if a witness, we will, say for example was Polish who spoke a little English and spoke no German, we would have an English-Polish, German-Polish interpreter. </sentence><sentence id="903">So that the order rather went this way: I as the prosecutor would ask the question in English. </sentence><sentence id="904">That was then translated by the English-German interpreter into German. </sentence><sentence id="905">Then the Polish-English interpreter would ask the question to the witness. </sentence><sentence id="906">Now, if the witness understood any of these languages, he could get sort of a fix on it. </sentence><sentence id="907">But we kept the language of the witness as the controlling language to this extent that he would then have less time for his reply. </sentence><sentence id="908">In other words, the interpreter who spoke Polish and German would translate after my English-German interpreter had spoken, translated into Polish. </sentence><sentence id="909">Then the witness would answer in Polish, and it would come back the same track. </sentence><sentence id="910">So it was sometimes kind of confusing. </sentence><sentence id="911">But the court had the official -- these interpreters that I just described to you were all known as official interpreters. </sentence><sentence id="912">Then as a prosecutor I had my own interpreter and so did the defense counsel. </sentence><sentence id="913">So there was a bank of people. </sentence><sentence id="914">We were never without people. </sentence><sentence id="915">We always had enough accused for an audience at all    times. </sentence><sentence id="916">But the rest of the seating in that covered enough rows there to seat approximately 250 to 300 attendees. </sentence><sentence id="917">And as I said, when we started out we had standing room only at sentencing. </sentence><sentence id="918">And when Nuremberg was not sitting, when Nuremberg finished there activities and our clients came back and visited us. </sentence><sentence id="919">And the attendees were basically in that only the families of the accused were there but also there were representatives of the different nationals that were involved. </sentence><sentence id="920">We had no Russian observers. </sentence><sentence id="921">We had no Polish observers, except the London Poles. </sentence><sentence id="922">The London Poles sent observers, and they were religious about attending all the trials. </sentence><sentence id="923">When Nuremberg finished, then the court reporters all -- the newspaper reporters all came back and flocked in. </sentence><sentence id="924">And at that time they had been broadcasting these proceedings over the Munich radio station. </sentence><sentence id="925">And I must say, after they started broadcasting, business did pick up. </sentence><sentence id="926">We had a lot more attendees that wanted to see what they were hearing. </sentence><sentence id="927">Because some of it was still incredible to most of them, I'm sure. </sentence><sentence id="928">But when they saw the witnesses and heard them testify, they began to believe also. </sentence><sentence id="929">And the attitude, although I must say it was hard to determine, there never was any raucousness or any boisterous conduct of any kind. </sentence><sentence id="930">It was always carried out on a dignified plane. </sentence><sentence id="931">But sometimes there would be laughter at some activities that had occurred. </sentence><sentence id="932">And when some of the interpreters got fouled up, everybody was amused at that. </sentence><sentence id="933">But there was very little amusement other than that. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1006">Q:Did you ever talk to the citizens of Munich? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1008">A: Well, in the early cases there was fraternization ban which gradually was relaxed, if you please. </sentence><sentence id="1009">And I talked to some of them. </sentence><sentence id="1010">And some of them I talked to didn't believe it. </sentence><sentence id="1011">Some of them I talked to thought that this was just a put-up job, and we were just trying to really administer victors" justice. </sentence><sentence id="1012">But the broadcast did a lot to allay that. </sentence><sentence id="1013">Because that brought them out. </sentence><sentence id="1014">And then they could see, they could hear with their own ears and see with their own eyes what was transpiring there. </sentence><sentence id="1015">And they could understand the German, which I couldn't. </sentence><sentence id="1016">I listened to it enough. </sentence><sentence id="1017">I learned "Gaschlopen"" "Gestorben" and things like that. </sentence><sentence id="1018">But I could speak very little German. </sentence><sentence id="1019">I could tell when somebody was talking about me and that was about it. </sentence><sentence id="1020">But when these people, particularly from Flossenbiirg and in Buchenwald, we had standing room only in those trials practically every day. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1035">Q:Those were in the same courtroom? </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1219">A:Yes. </sentence><sentence id="1220">Well, we got our leads from the war crimes investigating teams. </sentence><sentence id="1221">And recognizing we had to have witnesses that were credible and we had to have witnesses that were knowledgeable. </sentence><sentence id="1222">Those were the two things that were fundamental: Credibility and knowledgeability. </sentence><sentence id="1223">And we would take the information that we got from the war crimes teams and use that as springboards. </sentence><sentence id="1224">And interrogating witnesses, we would go from one witness to another depending upon what sort of impression he would make on the court. </sentence><sentence id="1225">We evaluated that. </sentence><sentence id="1226">And he may have known of an event that had occurred that others who would have more credibility than he had. </sentence><sentence id="1227">So we would look around for that. </sentence><sentence id="1228">And in this search we -- I was allocated a DC-3 in which to collect the witnesses from all over Europe. </sentence><sentence id="1229">Of course, as you know, the inmates of these four concentration camps came from practically every spot in Europe. </sentence><sentence id="1230">And so those were the sites of the witnesses. </sentence><sentence id="1231">Because most of them that had homes to go home to went home. </sentence><sentence id="1232">A lot of them remained in the D.P. camps; displaced persons camps. </sentence><sentence id="1233">That was a fertile source for acquiring witnesses, also. </sentence><sentence id="1234">But we would get these witnesses in, and they would tell us these stories. </sentence><sentence id="1235">And we would make an evaluation as to their credibility and their knowledgeability. </sentence><sentence id="1236">Best ones we kept. </sentence><sentence id="1237">Of course, we couldn't run on forever. </sentence><sentence id="1238">But we tried to get the best because we would listen to one and he would tell us about somebody else that knew the same thing. </sentence><sentence id="1239">And we would try to track him down. </sentence><sentence id="1240">And I'm -- I've got to tell you about a man that assisted us greatly in Vienna. </sentence><sentence id="1241">His name was Kohl, K-o-h-l. Mr. Kohl was a devout communist. </sentence><sentence id="1242">I'm sure he was a communist when he was in the camp and probably was a communist, because of that he was put into the camp. </sentence><sentence id="1243">But he had a mouth full of gold teeth. </sentence><sentence id="1244">And the Germans had an affinity for gold wherever it was; and particularly for those prisoners who had gold teeth. </sentence><sentence id="1245">So that many a man lost his life because he had gold teeth in his mouth. </sentence><sentence id="1246">Well, when I met Mr. Kohl in the process of trying to get witnesses from Vienna for the Mauthausen trial, he opened his mouth and laughed and there was this expanse of gold teeth. </sentence><sentence id="1247">Just like a sunburst. </sentence><sentence id="1248">I said, "Mr. Kohl, how in heaven's name did you survive Mauthausen from nineteen hundred and thirty-eight when you were incarcerated there until the liberation in nineteen hundred and forty-five in April?" </sentence><sentence id="1249">And he says, "Colonel, I never smiled. </sentence><sentence id="1250">And when J ate, I never chewed with my mouth open." </sentence><sentence id="1251">And he survived. </sentence><sentence id="1252">So I'm sure that's what he did to survive. </sentence><sentence id="1253">Because when he did smile, as I said, it was daybreak, and it was lovely. </sentence><sentence id="1254">But getting witnesses out of Vienna was very hard. </sentence><sentence id="1255">They had a staff judge advocate over in 7th Army there at Vienna that was opposed to our taking witnesses out of Vienna because Vienna was in the Russian zone. </sentence><sentence id="1256">The only part of Vienna that we had access to was the principal part of the city, and Tulin (ph) Air Force Base. </sentence><sentence id="1257">And that was -- otherwise you had to go through the Russian zone from Augsburg to get down to Vienna. </sentence><sentence id="1258">Well, the staff judge advocate there under General Mark Clark said, "You can't take these witness out of here. </sentence><sentence id="1259">The Russians will claim that you're kidnapping them and taking them out of the Russian Zone." </sentence><sentence id="1260">And I asked to see General Clark, and I went in and I spoke to him. </sentence><sentence id="1261">And he was a very cooperative individual. </sentence><sentence id="1262">He said, "Colonel, you don't have to take them all out at one time, do you?" </sentence><sentence id="1263">And I said, "No, sir." </sentence><sentence id="1264">And he said, "Will five at the most do?" </sentence><sentence id="1265">And "Yes, sir," I said, "We can shuttle them back and forth from now on." </sentence><sentence id="1266">We only had about 30 that we had to get out so it wasn't too bad. </sentence><sentence id="1267">But we had that type of reticence that was really keeping us from preparing Mauthausen. </sentence><sentence id="1268">Because Mauthausen was located on the Enns River near Linz, Austria. </sentence><sentence id="1269">And most of those individuals who were the occupants of Mauthausen were Austrians. </sentence><sentence id="1270">And they had come from around Vienna. </sentence><sentence id="1271">As a matter of fact,    they had the Chancellor of Austria, Kurt von Schuschnigg"was a prisoner in Flossenbiirg and in Mauthausen. </sentence><sentence id="1272">So it was terribly important to us to establish a liaison that we could work with to get these witnesses out. </sentence><sentence id="1273">And Mister Kohl was the man that did it with his gold teeth. </sentence><sentence id="1274">He had a card index there of addresses of the people, I'm sure all of them were communists. </sentence><sentence id="1275">But Lord bless them. </sentence><sentence id="1276">At that time, and I must confess, at that time I didn't know a communist from a Nazi, or anybody else. </sentence><sentence id="1277">They were all individuals to me at that time. </sentence><sentence id="1278">And they were trying to assist me in discharging my duties. </sentence><sentence id="1279">So I was very happy to have Mr. Kohl come in and testify and exhibit his gold teeth at the trial. </sentence><sentence id="1280">Although I must say, it shook his credibility a little bit. </sentence><sentence id="1281">But when he pressed his lips over his teeth, it made quite an impression on the court. </sentence><sentence id="1282">And they were human beings, the courts were. </sentence><sentence id="1283">They had a reason to believe that Mr.Kohl was telling the truth and that he did keep his mouth shut. </sentence><sentence id="1284">And it was something that was terribly impressive to me that an individual could control his muscles to the extent that -- I guess when your life is involved, you can do many things. </sentence><sentence id="1285">And Kohl did it. </sentence><sentence id="1286">Well, I guess I was wandering here about the witnesses that we had, and the problems that we had. </sentence><sentence id="1287">I guess Vienna posed the most serious problem because most of the witnesses that knew the most were from that area around Linz and Vienna. </sentence><sentence id="1288">Now, we did get a lot of witnesses out of the D.P. camps. </sentence><sentence id="1289">Because those are the people that had no homes to go back to. </sentence><sentence id="1290">They had been bombed out. </sentence><sentence id="1291">Or their families had all been destroyed in the concentration camps. </sentence><sentence id="1292">They had no place to go. </sentence><sentence id="1293">So they were in these camps. </sentence><sentence id="1294">And we took those people. </sentence><sentence id="1295">And those that could make the best impression so far as credibility and knowledgeability were the ones that we used to make our cases. " </sentence><sentence id="1296">Kurt von Schuschnigg was Chancellor of Austria from 1934, when he succeeded the murdered Engelbert Dollfuss, to 1938. </sentence><sentence id="1297">In March 1938, he was forced from office by the terms of Anschluss with Germany. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1380">Q:Can I ask you to describe what credibility and knowledgeability meant? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1382">A:Yes. </sentence><sentence id="1383">Credibility involves many things. </sentence><sentence id="1384">The way that you sit in your chair on the witness stand, your demeanor on the witness stand. </sentence><sentence id="1385">How you express yourself. </sentence><sentence id="1386">Even though it may be in a foreign language, the facial expressions that you utilize when you're expressing yourself. </sentence><sentence id="1387">All these things go to the matter of being able to enable the fact-finders to tell where the truth lies. </sentence><sentence id="1388">If you get an individual that's going to be close-mouthed and going to tell you only those facts that advance his interest, you can tell it. </sentence><sentence id="1389">It comes out. </sentence><sentence id="1390">And that's the reason why credibility is a matter for the fact-finder and never a consideration for the appellate authority, or in our case, the appointing and confirming authorities. </sentence><sentence id="1391">Oh, I could tell you a lot about that if you want to talk about Ilse Koch sometime. </sentence><sentence id="1392">But credibility is terribly important. </sentence><sentence id="1393">And it was important because we had bizarre things that we had to get the court to believe. </sentence><sentence id="1394">And if you had had a closed-mouthed individual there talking about, describing event that I previously described to you, nobody is going to believe it. </sentence><sentence id="1395">But if he got up there and said it with the feeling that it was terrible for him to even have to talk about it again, to recall it, it's bound to make an impression so far as a fact-finder is concerned. </sentence><sentence id="1396">That's what I mean about credibility. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1412">Q:Did you have people who were reluctant to be witnesses because they were frightened or they didn't want to reveal again what-- </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1414">A:Well, the only reluctance I think they had was recalling again the experiences that they had endured. </sentence><sentence id="1415">I don't think anybody was afraid to testify. </sentence><sentence id="1416">I don't think there was any coercion of any kind of character, either pro or con in that area. </sentence><sentence id="1417">But I think that to recall some of the experiences that they had endured, it was terribly hard. </sentence><sentence id="1418">I had one man testify by the name of Arthur Haulot. </sentence><sentence id="1419">He was the minister from Belgium. </sentence><sentence id="1420">Not a preaching minister, but a minister of state from Belgium. </sentence><sentence id="1421">And he had been snatched away from Brussels and put into a concentration camp". </sentence><sentence id="1422">And he was a learned individual. </sentence><sentence id="1423">Dignified man. </sentence><sentence id="1424">And one night while he was in the concentration camp, I think it was in Dachau that he was incarcerated in, he was so hungry he couldn't sleep. </sentence><sentence id="1425">And that had occurred not once but many times. </sentence><sentence id="1426">But this time it was terribly painful for him. </sentence><sentence id="1427">And he remembered a crust of bread that his fellow prisoner had tucked under his arm to safeguard and eat it at some time. </sentence><sentence id="1428">And he found himself easing - stealing, if you please - that piece of bread from his fellow prisoner. </sentence><sentence id="1429">And he took it back to his bunk. </sentence><sentence id="1430">And then he started to cry. </sentence><sentence id="1431">To think that he had sunk so low due to the treatment that he had been receiving there at Dachau, that he would steal from his fellow prisoner, who probably needed it just as badly, if not worse than he did. </sentence><sentence id="1432">Well, needless to say, that crust of bread found its way back to his fellow prisoner. </sentence><sentence id="1433">Well, when Brother Halleau delivered himself of that testimony on the stand, you could have heard a pin drop in that courtroom. </sentence><sentence id="1434">Everybody was quiet. </sentence><sentence id="1435">And they were moved by it. </sentence><sentence id="1436">I was moved by it. </sentence><sentence id="1437">And I think all the judges were moved by it. </sentence><sentence id="1438">But that was the type of witness that are few and far between. </sentence><sentence id="1439">But I say few and far between. </sentence><sentence id="1440">Few is the wrong word. </sentence><sentence id="1441">There were multitudes of them. </sentence><sentence id="1442">But not all of them did we have access to. </sentence><sentence id="1443">So they were jewels when we found witnesses like that. </sentence><sentence id="1444">Another one was the name of Yoe-Thomas He was in Buchenwald. </sentence><sentence id="1445">A very interesting individual. </sentence><sentence id="1446">And he has since written a book entitled The White Rabbit, which you might get and read. </sentence><sentence id="1447">It was his experiences in Buchenwald. </sentence><sentence id="1448">And how his life was saved by a male nurse that I prosecuted when I tried Buchenwald. </sentence><sentence id="1449">The male nurse's name was Dietzsh. </sentence><sentence id="1450">But to make a long story real short here: Dietzsh ran the typhus ward in &gt; Arthur Haulot was a Member of Parliament from Belgium imprisoned in the Dachau Concentration Camp. </sentence><sentence id="1451">He served as a Vice-President of the International Prisoners" Committee of Dachau. </sentence><sentence id="1452">Buchenwald where they were trying to develop a specific typhus like they were trying to develop one for malaria down at Dachau. </sentence><sentence id="1453">And the guinea pigs were the prisoners, and they were dying right and left. </sentence><sentence id="1454">And Yoe-Thomas had served as a liaison between Churchill and DeGaulle. </sentence><sentence id="1455">And he was in the underground. </sentence><sentence id="1456">And he couldn't spend two successive nights in Paris in the same place. </sentence><sentence id="1457">The Gestapo were close after him. </sentence><sentence id="1458">They finally caught him and they boxed him up and sent him off to Buchenwald. </sentence><sentence id="1459">Broke all his fingers. </sentence><sentence id="1460">Pulled his fingernails out. </sentence><sentence id="1461">Everything you can think of to torture him. </sentence><sentence id="1462">He wouldn't talk. </sentence><sentence id="1463">And he was sent there with some 20-odd other Britons and Frenchmen. </sentence><sentence id="1464">They had been collected by the Gestapo as being part of the French underground. </sentence><sentence id="1465">And they were destined to be executed. </sentence><sentence id="1466">So Thomas was a wing commander in the air force of the British. </sentence><sentence id="1467">He was an organizer himself. </sentence><sentence id="1468">And he went to work right away to try to protect his comrades that had been sent to Mauthausen. </sentence><sentence id="1469">Not Mauthausen, but Buchenwald. </sentence><sentence id="1470">And they were beginning to get down to where the 20 had gotten down to possibly a half a dozen or more. </sentence><sentence id="1471">And something drastic had to be done. </sentence><sentence id="1472">And he talked to Dietzsh who was a prisoner, this male nurse. </sentence><sentence id="1473">And made a deal with Dietzsh to try to get some of these remaining individuals into this sick block they had there with typhus being treated, and protect them that way. </sentence><sentence id="1474">And they were changing identities. </sentence><sentence id="1475">Well, one of the prisoners whose identity had matched one of these six men was changed and was just about to die. </sentence><sentence id="1476">And he died, and he was able to swap identity and became a prisoner. </sentence><sentence id="1477">Well, it finally got down to poor Yoe-Thomas. </sentence><sentence id="1478">And they found out that Yoe-Thomas was in there, and they said, "Well, bring him out. </sentence><sentence id="1479">We're going to get rid of him." </sentence><sentence id="1480">And the way they had hanged the other, they didn't hang them by breaking the neck. </sentence><sentence id="1481">They strangled them to death. </sentence><sentence id="1482">The meat hooks that you see in a market with the slab of meat on it, those were in the crematory at Buchenwald. </sentence><sentence id="1483">And they would take one of these prisoners and hang him up by the neck until he strangled to death. </sentence><sentence id="1484">And that was the thing that Yoe-Thomas had to look forward to. </sentence><sentence id="1485">Well, Dietch told the $.S. man who came there to bring Thomas out. " </sentence><sentence id="1486">Sure. </sentence><sentence id="1487">He's got typhus. </sentence><sentence id="1488">You    can have him. </sentence><sentence id="1489">He's got a fever of about 103. </sentence><sentence id="1490">That if you can take him out, he's yours. </sentence><sentence id="1491">But you may get typhus if you go in there and get him." </sentence><sentence id="1492">He said -- and Dietzsh says, "Why don't I just stick him with a syringe and execute him here? </sentence><sentence id="1493">And you can go back and tell the commandant that he's dead and you saw him and he's dead." </sentence><sentence id="1494">And that's what they did. </sentence><sentence id="1495">And Yoe Thomas later was buried. </sentence><sentence id="1496">He was taken out as a corpse. </sentence><sentence id="1497">And as soon as he got out of sight, he got alive again and got out of the camp and escaped, and was picked up by the Russians and they sent him back to the Germans on the exchange of prisoner. </sentence><sentence id="1498">But he lived to tell the tale and wrote a book. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1593">A:Yes, I would like to do that. </sentence><sentence id="1594">Because Arthur Dietzsh had been persecuted by the Weimar Republic and was persecuted again by Hitler. </sentence><sentence id="1595">So he had spent most of his life in confinement of one form or another. </sentence><sentence id="1596">And at Buchenwald he became the male nurse because he was a man of education that he had educated himself actually. </sentence><sentence id="1597">And as a male nurse he was an assistant to a Sturmbahnfiihrer, I think they call him. </sentence><sentence id="1598">A Major Ding-Schuler, who was Kraut that had some artistic qualities about him. </sentence><sentence id="1599">And he was a doctor. </sentence><sentence id="1600">He had M.D. And had specialized in diseases and immunization. </sentence><sentence id="1601">And they put Ding-Schuler in charge of this block which they had set aside as a hospital block for the purpose of developing some sort of immunization against typhus. </sentence><sentence id="1602">Typhus was the plague that was raging all the concentration camps. </sentence><sentence id="1603">I think it started up in Russia, and Treblinka actually is I think where they had the first cases of typhus, and Auschwitz. </sentence><sentence id="1604">And as those people spread down south, was sent. </sentence><sentence id="1605">But when the advances forced them out of the camps, they spread it to the German concentration camps that were located in Germany and in Austria. </sentence><sentence id="1606">So it was terribly important to get some sort of specific for typhus. </sentence><sentence id="1607">And that was Ding-Schuler's job. </sentence><sentence id="1608">And he selected this male nurse as Arthur Dietzsh as his assistant. </sentence><sentence id="1609">And he educated Dietzsh, who already was educated in other matters. </sentence><sentence id="1610">But he became a very confidante -- much of a confidante of Ding- Schuler's. </sentence><sentence id="1611">And they talked about what was going on in the world. </sentence><sentence id="1612">And how Germany was losing the war. </sentence><sentence id="1613">And they each recognized at that time, and this was back in January, February and March of 1945, handwriting was pretty much on the wall. </sentence><sentence id="1614">And Arthur Dietzsh having access to Ding- Schuler, and Yoe-Thomas got himself in the typhus block and got access to Ding-Schuler and convinced Ding-Schuler to go along with his scheme. </sentence><sentence id="1615">And that included Arthur Dietzsh as the male nurse. </sentence><sentence id="1616">Because Arthur Dietzsh was a hands-on person in the block. </sentence><sentence id="1617">And they conceived this plan of taking some of these poor guinea pig prisoners who had been infected with typhus when they were dying, switching their identity with Yoe-Thomas and his friends, those five British-French friends that remained out of the group that came there originally. </sentence><sentence id="1618">And one by one they were able to get rid of them. </sentence><sentence id="1619">They finally got down to Yoe- Thomas, and his twin hadn't died yet. </sentence><sentence id="1620">So it was getting close. </sentence><sentence id="1621">And they were asking to have Yoe-Thomas brought to the crematory for execution. </sentence><sentence id="1622">As a matter of fact, they sent an Unterscharffiihrer, I think was tech sergeant or something, down to the hospital to escort Yoe-Thomas down to the crematory. </sentence><sentence id="1623">And Ding-Schuler said, "Look, typhus is a pretty contagious disease. </sentence><sentence id="1624">If you want to go in here and pick him out of this bed, he's yours. </sentence><sentence id="1625">Be my guest." </sentence><sentence id="1626">And the Unterscharffiihrer said he had a wife and some kids at home and he would like to avoid that if he could. </sentence><sentence id="1627">And he said -- I mean Dietzsh said, "All right. </sentence><sentence id="1628">I'll kill him. </sentence><sentence id="1629">I'll inject him with the syringe and you can take him out." </sentence><sentence id="1630">Well, they finally had a man who was his double. </sentence><sentence id="1631">He died. </sentence><sentence id="1632">And this is according to Dietzsh, believe it or not, but he died. </sentence><sentence id="1633">And Dietzsh went to this corpse, injected it with hydrogen peroxide of all things. </sentence><sentence id="1634">That gets into the heart and creates an embolism, and death is pretty certain. </sentence><sentence id="1635">And speedy. </sentence><sentence id="1636">And that's what they did. </sentence><sentence id="1637">So they said, "Now you can tell them that he's dead. </sentence><sentence id="1638">And if you want to, you can take the body back." </sentence><sentence id="1639">And they said, "No. </sentence><sentence id="1640">You just assure me that he's dead. </sentence><sentence id="1641">Let me take a look." </sentence><sentence id="1642">He took a look and he didn't know Yoe-Thomas from Adam's house cat. </sentence><sentence id="1643">But he went back and reported he was dead. </sentence><sentence id="1644">Well, that saved Yoe-Thomas" life. </sentence><sentence id="1645">And Thomas wrote out on a slip of paper, "To Whom It May Concern, that this man, Labaro (ph), Arthur Dietzsh has saved my life. </sentence><sentence id="1646">And any consideration that you can give him when he's brought to trial --" because Yoe- Thomas had told him every one of you going to be brought to trial. </sentence><sentence id="1647">All of them. </sentence><sentence id="1648">That's how he had his entree to Ding- Schuler. </sentence><sentence id="1649">And he gave him this slip of paper. </sentence><sentence id="1650">And Arthur Dietzsh saved his life. </sentence><sentence id="1651">But he didn't save it for long in that sense. </sentence><sentence id="1652">He went out the    back door as a corpse, was turned over to the Russians who picked him up on an exchange of prisoners. </sentence><sentence id="1653">And he was then sent back to the Germans on this exchange by the Russians. </sentence><sentence id="1654">He escaped a second time but not from Buchenwald. </sentence><sentence id="1655">However, the one thing I want to say about Dietzsh, when he did this, he did it because I think in his heart and soul he knew that this is a man that deserves saving. </sentence><sentence id="1656">They had had a lot of conversations together, Dietzsh and Yoe- Thomas. </sentence><sentence id="1657">And Ding-Schuler and Yoe-Thomas. </sentence><sentence id="1658">So that he had the cooperation -- Dietzsh had the cooperation of his boss. </sentence><sentence id="1659">And Yoe-Thomas was the boss of both Schuler and Arthur Dietzsh. </sentence><sentence id="1660">The court that tried Dietzsh gave him ten years. </sentence><sentence id="1661">And I think the reviewing authority cut it down to time that he had spent in confinement. </sentence><sentence id="1662">Ding-Schuler took his own life when Buchenwald fell. </sentence><sentence id="1663">Ding-Schuler committed suicide. </sentence><sentence id="1664">So I think that Ding-Schuler is a little different from the ilk that ran the concentration camps. </sentence><sentence id="1665">He was able to be persuaded by Yoe- Thomas. </sentence><sentence id="1666">Now, that didn't happen very frequently. </sentence><sentence id="1667">Because there were a lot of others that had tried substantially the same approach that were not successful. </sentence><sentence id="1668">In Buchenwald we had some other interesting characters one of whom was Ilse Koch, who was the wife of a former commandant. </sentence><sentence id="1669">She was not the wife of a commandant that was there when the camp failed. </sentence><sentence id="1670">Pista (ph) was the man on trial. </sentence><sentence id="1671">And Pista couldn't stand Ilse Koch because she still was the commandeur, according to her, of Buchenwald. </sentence><sentence id="1672">And they were somewhat at odds. </sentence><sentence id="1673">Well, Ilse Koch had a fancy for light shades. </sentence><sentence id="1674">I didn't try her for that. </sentence><sentence id="1675">I tried her for aiding and abetting the operation of the Buchenwald concentration camp. </sentence><sentence id="1676">She, during the time of her husband, when he was commandant, used to report prisoners because they ogled her. </sentence><sentence id="1677">I think that's the way you pronounce it when you make big eyes at tight-fitting clothes on a very voluptuous body. </sentence><sentence id="1678">And whenever prisoners ogled Ilse, she took down their numbers. </sentence><sentence id="1679">They were reported and they were whipped. </sentence><sentence id="1680">And they were whipped in a way which was absolutely inhuman. </sentence><sentence id="1681">They were spread across a desk with hands out in front of them and legs down. </sentence><sentence id="1682">And they had to count in German each blow that was administered. </sentence><sentence id="1683">And when they were directed to    receive 25 blows, they had to count them out loud. </sentence><sentence id="1684">And they had to count each blow in German. </sentence><sentence id="1685">Well, some of those Poles couldn't speak German. </sentence><sentence id="1686">And some of the Frenchmen couldn't speak German. </sentence><sentence id="1687">And many times those beatings led to death. </sentence><sentence id="1688">So she did have her share of participation in the operation of that camp and in furthering the operation of the camp to the extent that there was this common design to subject these prisoners to that type of punishment and that type of misconduct of starvation. </sentence><sentence id="1689">All that sort of thing were things that were charged in the charge sheet. </sentence><sentence id="1690">So she was guilty of aiding and abetting the operation of that camp. </sentence><sentence id="1691">Once she had been found guilty, she was given a life sentence. </sentence><sentence id="1692">And the only reason why I later found out from a member of the court that they didn't hang her was that she was carrying a child. </sentence><sentence id="1693">She was four months pregnant at the time she was sentenced. </sentence><sentence id="1694">Well, when the reviewing authority cut her sentence down from life imprisonment to four years, they gave as an excuse that there was insufficient credible evidence to justify a sentence of that severity. </sentence><sentence id="1695">Well, remember, credibility is for the fact-finder, not for the man who is reviewing the case. </sentence><sentence id="1696">Because the man who sees that witness testify and observes the demeanor on the stand, he knows where the truth is coming from. </sentence><sentence id="1697">Not the man who has the written page in front of him of the record of the trial that the original court had made. </sentence><sentence id="1698">Well, that produced a flurry when they reduced the sentence. </sentence><sentence id="1699">I objected to it. </sentence><sentence id="1700">And I objected to it on the ground that I had tried four of these cases -- three at that time; that was the fourth case. </sentence><sentence id="1701">And I thought I knew how to try a concentration camp case. </sentence><sentence id="1702">Well, when they said there was insufficient credible evidence, that they were telling me I didn't know what was credible and what wasn't. </sentence><sentence id="1703">So I wrote a letter pointing out these things. </sentence><sentence id="1704">And the Congress of the United States took over after that. </sentence><sentence id="1705">The committee in the Senate headed by Homer Ferguson held hearings from September of "48 until Christmas. </sentence><sentence id="1706">And they decided that I was right; that there was sufficient credible evidence. </sentence><sentence id="1707">But since the reviewing authority had said no, four years is all, there's nothing we can do about it. </sentence><sentence id="1708">Well, the things that they did do about it, they turned    them over to the German people who tried her for offenses against Germans. </sentence><sentence id="1709">I had not tried her for offenses against Germans. </sentence><sentence id="1710">And they tried her and she was given another life sentence and committed suicide in prison. </sentence><sentence id="1711">Buchenwald was full of interesting people. </sentence><sentence id="1712">The accused I'm talking about. </sentence><sentence id="1713">I'm sure there were a lot more interesting people who were also prisoners like Yoe-Thomas and others. </sentence><sentence id="1714">One that I tried was a doctor by the name of Evan Katzenelenbogen. </sentence><sentence id="1715">He was a doctor in the small camp. </sentence><sentence id="1716">And he sold his services to the prisoners for anything that he can get out of them. </sentence><sentence id="1717">And on occasions he would snatch prisoners out from the upper bunk. </sentence><sentence id="1718">And they lived in these bunks, and in a bunk there were five men to a bunk that was to accommodate one and at most two. </sentence><sentence id="1719">Well, this one time he was in; and this had not happened not just one time but many times. </sentence><sentence id="1720">He would snatch a man off of the top bunk down to the floor, which was about six feet below. </sentence><sentence id="1721">And very frequently the prisoner would die as a result of skull fracture. </sentence><sentence id="1722">That, plus the fact that he was selling his services to the people that he was supposed to protect and take care of, moved us to include him as one of the accused. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1861">Q:What do you mean by selling his services? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1863">A:He wouldn't treat them unless they gave him part of the Red Cross packages that they had gotten a hold of. </sentence><sentence id="1864">That's where he sold his services. </sentence><sentence id="1865">And to me that was a heinous offense in itself. </sentence><sentence id="1866">Well, we put him on trial. </sentence><sentence id="1867">He had originally been an American citizen. </sentence><sentence id="1868">He married the daughter of one of the judges of the Supreme Judicial Court of Massachusetts. </sentence><sentence id="1869">They had a child who fell out of a window and died, and Katzenelenbogen went back to Germany. </sentence><sentence id="1870">Katzenelenbogen was really a psychoanalyst and a devout student of Freud. </sentence><sentence id="1871">And did his job well. </sentence><sentence id="1872">Maybe we should continue just a little bit on this a little later. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1896">Q:You want to continue talking about Katzenelenbogen? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1898">A:Katzenelenbogen was a psychoanalyst. </sentence><sentence id="1899">And he played his trade to the last inch in defense of his own self. </sentence><sentence id="1900">That court absolutely detested him because of the evidence that had been amassed against him. </sentence><sentence id="1901">And it was very little that he did to defend himself other than still claim American citizenship. </sentence><sentence id="1902">Because he had come to this country when he was about 20 or 21 years of age, and was still in school. </sentence><sentence id="1903">And had taken citizenship papers and married a daughter of one of the justices on the Supreme Judicial Court of Massachusetts. </sentence><sentence id="1904">They had a child, and the child fell out of an apartment window in New York and was killed. </sentence><sentence id="1905">And that broke up the family. </sentence><sentence id="1906">He went back to Germany and to -- actually it wasn't Germany. </sentence><sentence id="1907">It was that section of the Austrian-Hungarian Empire that was in there between Germany and Czechoslovakia. </sentence><sentence id="1908">Actually went back to Marienbad and opened a clinic there. </sentence><sentence id="1909">And the Gestapo got interested in him as an informer. </sentence><sentence id="1910">And he was an informer. </sentence><sentence id="1911">And finally he ended up in Buchenwald. </sentence><sentence id="1912">And they put him in the small camp as a doctor. </sentence><sentence id="1913">And I told you he was sort of a mean fella. </sentence><sentence id="1914">And he would sell his services rather than perform what he was supposed to do. </sentence><sentence id="1915">And he came on for trial having committed a war crime. </sentence><sentence id="1916">And he more or less made an ass out of himself before the court in his responses to the questions that were asked by his defense counsel. </sentence><sentence id="1917">And his defense counsel, I believe, at that time was a man by the name of Wolff (ph). </sentence><sentence id="1918">And Wolf did the best he could to keep Katzenelenbogen quiet. </sentence><sentence id="1919">Because the more he talked, the worse he got. </sentence><sentence id="1920">And when I had him on cross-examination, of course I did the best I could to let him tell us everything he knew. </sentence><sentence id="1921">And he knew a lot. </sentence><sentence id="1922">As a matter of fact, he said the evidence was such that he could have the then minister of justice in France sitting in his seat for the activities that that minister had performed in the small camp at Buchenwald. </sentence><sentence id="1923">Well, we let him talk. </sentence><sentence id="1924">And after it was over, the court first called him forward and announced that he had been found guilty. </sentence><sentence id="1925">Well, Katzenelenbogen was asked if he had anything to say why sentence should not be pronounced against him. </sentence><sentence id="1926">And he had this deep voice. </sentence><sentence id="1927">He could have been a basso profunda at the Met With no trouble at all. </sentence><sentence id="1928">He said, "Now that this honorable court has put the Mark of Cain upon my brow, I have but one wish. </sentence><sentence id="1929">And that is that this court impose upon me the most serious punishment within its power." </sentence><sentence id="1930">And he nodded like that. </sentence><sentence id="1931">And I thought to myself, Well, bless his heart. </sentence><sentence id="1932">I hope they accommodate him. </sentence><sentence id="1933">Well, there was a flurry behind on the bench. </sentence><sentence id="1934">And the president of the court said, "The court finds pursuant to your plea of not guilty that you are guilty. </sentence><sentence id="1935">And finding of you being guilty chooses to impose upon you a life imprisonment." </sentence><sentence id="1936">So the old scoundrel didn't get hanged at all. </sentence><sentence id="1937">He got off with his life. </sentence><sentence id="1938">And except for his age, he'd be alive today. </sentence><sentence id="1939">But he played it to the last inch. </sentence><sentence id="1940">That court, I found out, that, they didn't want to please him. </sentence><sentence id="1941">And he had asked for the death sentence, and rather than please him, they gave him life imprisonment instead. </sentence><sentence id="1942">So he was a doctor to the end. </sentence><sentence id="1943">I must say that I get back to reducing sentences. </sentence><sentence id="1944">Clemency is a proper thing to be exercised under proper conditions. </sentence><sentence id="1945">But there was no clemency that Ilse Koch was entitled to. </sentence><sentence id="1946">There was no clemency that Katzenelenbogen was entitled to, in my judgment. </sentence><sentence id="1947">But I didn't have the power to wield that authority. </sentence><sentence id="1948">And the fact that some of these sentences have been reduced, I go back to the feeling that I do not know all the facts and circumstances about their family relationships, whether or not they're the sole supports of families that then existed, who were probably without fault on their part. </sentence><sentence id="1949">So that there could be many considerations that could justify the reduction of sentences. </sentence><sentence id="1950">And in the main, I find no fault with the exercise of clemency when it's denominated clemency. </sentence><sentence id="1951">But I do object like a stuck pig to any time that they start reducing sentences on the grounds of insufficient credible evidence, for the simple reason that the whole operation was incredible in its entirety. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2007">Q:When you look at the entire set of trials that were, not just the ones you were participating in, where so many people had harsh sentences, whether it was death or life imprisonment that were severely reduced or they were let go, does that bother you? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2009">A:To let go, again, I don't know the circumstances of their letting go. </sentence><sentence id="2010">That's a function of the exercise of clemency. </sentence><sentence id="2011">It's to take into consideration those factors which were no part of my concern. </sentence><sentence id="2012">So that if I knew that a sentence had been reduced in exercise of clemency, I don't quarrel with it. </sentence><sentence id="2013">If it's exercised on the ground of insufficient credible evidence, I scream. </sentence><sentence id="2014">And I scream loud and long, because I know that's wrong. </sentence><sentence id="2015">And I know that's wrong because I know that these events that seem incredible to the person who reads about them happened. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2023">Q:Do you think there's a different political set of circumstances in 1945 versus 1948 when the trials are going on? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2025">A:l'm sure that there may very well have been, sure. </sentence><sentence id="2026">Germany was sickened to find denazified leaders. </sentence><sentence id="2027">While none of these individuals that I tried could hardly make that category, there was a sense of uncertainty in not knowing which way to go. </sentence><sentence id="2028">And I think this: I think the United States government did a magnificent job in its occupation. </sentence><sentence id="2029">I really do. </sentence><sentence id="2030">And I say they're entitled to all credit for that. </sentence><sentence id="2031">And I think while mistakes were made, to err is human, to forgive divine. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2039">Q:Tell me, were there security arrangements for you and the other lawyers during these trials that you know about? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2041">A:No. </sentence><sentence id="2042">We had guards there, sure. </sentence><sentence id="2043">But when you talk about security arrangements, I'll assume that you're talking about somebody that's going to follow me around and be sure that somebody is not going to take a shot at me when I'm out hunting or fishing, if I did in what little spare time I had. </sentence><sentence id="2044">But there wasn't anyone that tailed us to protect us. </sentence><sentence id="2045">No. </sentence><sentence id="2046">Nothing like that. </sentence><sentence id="2047">There was always a number of Polish guards that were there in that courtroom all the time. </sentence><sentence id="2048">You seen the white hats at Nuremberg. </sentence><sentence id="2049">Well, the Poles wore white hats at our trial, in Dachau. </sentence><sentence id="2050">And they were kept on a constant surveillance by the Polish guards that we had there, as well as American guards. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2063">A:Oh, my goodness. </sentence><sentence id="2064">At one time they recessed the court because they said I looked more like an exhibit out of the concentration camp than anybody I'd put on the stand. </sentence><sentence id="2065">The trousers that I wore I could fold over behind with no problem at all. </sentence><sentence id="2066">I was glad to lose that. </sentence><sentence id="2067">But the shirts that I was wearing at that time, somebody else could get in the neck with me. </sentence><sentence id="2068">And my clothes didn't fit. </sentence><sentence id="2069">I lost -- I got down to 117 pounds. </sentence><sentence id="2070">And I weighed normally about 155 to 165 pounds. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2079">Q:So what was your day like? </sentence><sentence id="2080">And what were you working; 12, 15 hours days? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2083">A: was working like that and sleeping less at night. </sentence><sentence id="2084">Because I was thinking -- I had nightmares. </sentence><sentence id="2085">I'll tell you. </sentence><sentence id="2086">These -- I was reliving some of these experiences myself. </sentence><sentence id="2087">What would I be doing under those circumstances? </sentence><sentence id="2088">How would I react to this? </sentence><sentence id="2089">It took a toll. </sentence><sentence id="2090">Well, after I finished Flossenbiirg, Flossenbiirg was the longest trial because I had been prepared in a way differently from the way I prepared cases being prepared by Colonel Shaw. </sentence><sentence id="2091">And at the end of January I was ready to go home. </sentence><sentence id="2092">This was January of "47. </sentence><sentence id="2093">And I went to bed and I stayed in bed for two weeks. </sentence><sentence id="2094">And I'd get up for meals and that was about it. </sentence><sentence id="2095">And the war crimes branch representatives came down from Wiesbaden and said they got another job that they'd like for me to do. </sentence><sentence id="2096">They'd give me my choice: That I could either prosecute Scorzeni (ph).Scorzeni was a man who kidnapped Mussolini and had previously kidnapped Admiral Horthy from Hungary. </sentence><sentence id="2097">And I said, "Shoot. </sentence><sentence id="2098">We shouldn't try him; I think we ought to hire him." </sentence><sentence id="2099">So I didn't. </sentence><sentence id="2100">They said, "Well, the other job is to prosecute Buchenwald." </sentence><sentence id="2101">And I thought, I could try that like falling off a log and nothing to it. </sentence><sentence id="2102">I had tried three cases, and that would be less strain on me. </sentence><sentence id="2103">But that lasted from April to the end of August of "47. </sentence><sentence id="2104">That's when I finished that case. </sentence><sentence id="2105">But that was an interesting case. </sentence><sentence id="2106">That had a lot of different things that were of interest. </sentence><sentence id="2107">Of course it could never be interesting to the people that were prisoners in it. </sentence><sentence id="2108">But it had different aspects. </sentence><sentence id="2109">In Buchenwald they had quite a number of projects going there in the surrounding areas, at the sub-camps, all of which were interesting. </sentence><sentence id="2110">And each one of these sub-camps were operated largely like the main camp. </sentence><sentence id="2111">And some of them were much worse the Kaufering and Landsberg camps as sub-camps of Dachau was so much worse than the main camp that they were not in the same ballpark at all. </sentence><sentence id="2112">Actually they had classifications. </sentence><sentence id="2113">Dachau was a Class 1 camp. </sentence><sentence id="2114">Mauthausen was a Class 3 camp. </sentence><sentence id="2115">That was an extermination camp. </sentence><sentence id="2116">Whenever prisoners got to the point where they couldn't work enough to earn their keep of black coffee and no cream, no sugar, no fats of any kind, and black bread down through the grams that they were being fed -- it sort of strains me to try to reconstruct these things. </sentence><sentence id="2117">I start thinking about what they had to eat. </sentence><sentence id="2118">Of course the camps claim that they were being fed -- the prisoners were being fed the same rations that the German populace were feeding. </sentence><sentence id="2119">That was correct as to the quantity in this sense, not the quality nor by calorie. </sentence><sentence id="2120">By calorie count it was nowhere near. </sentence><sentence id="2121">These men were working all    day long, not able to sleep at night, and being fed less than a thousand calories a day. </sentence><sentence id="2122">Well, the same thing was happening to me to a large extent. </sentence><sentence id="2123">And that's why I got so gaunt. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2168">Q:Were there breaks? </sentence><sentence id="2169">It sounds to me as if you were, for the most part, going trial to trial? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2172">A: Well, for the most part I had. </sentence><sentence id="2173">I went from trial to trial because I had to prepare the next trial. </sentence><sentence id="2174">After I finished -- I finished Dachau the 15th of December of "45. </sentence><sentence id="2175">I started almost immediately working on Mauthausen, when I could physically work. </sentence><sentence id="2176">But that took a lot out of me; Dachau did. </sentence><sentence id="2177">Because that was a new experience and one that I wasn't adjusted to. </sentence><sentence id="2178">As I tried these cases, I got more adjusted. </sentence><sentence id="2179">And I worked on Dachau along with my assistants. </sentence><sentence id="2180">And I had five very able men there to all do--Paul Gooth (ph) I kept on, and had four other lawyers there that were very able men. </sentence><sentence id="2181">And I can't remember now all their names, but I don't want to mention anyone without doing an injustice to the others. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2192">Q:When you got so sick and so gaunt and had all these nightmares, did you want to stop and not hear this anymore? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2194">A:I had to stop when we had the recess in Flossenbiirg, that was basically the reason why they stopped, because I couldn't go on. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2196">Q:Did other lawyers respond similarly? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2198">A:Oh, yes. </sentence><sentence id="2199">Sure. </sentence><sentence id="2200">I mean, they were affected the same way. </sentence><sentence id="2201">But it was a nervous strain. </sentence><sentence id="2202">It was basically my responsibility. </sentence><sentence id="2203">And it was one that I didn't welcome, but it was one that I had. </sentence><sentence id="2204">And I knew that I had to discharge it. </sentence><sentence id="2205">And I had to discharge it in a way that was expected it to be discharged. </sentence><sentence id="2206">And that's what I tried to do. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2216">Q:Earlier you said you wanted to talk about Kapos. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2218">A:Oh, Kapos. </sentence><sentence id="2219">Kapos were prisoners in the camp. </sentence><sentence id="2220">And they were -- had been the main criminals. </sentence><sentence id="2221">They were penitentiary individuals that had served their sentences there but were still considered by the Germans to be hazard politically. </sentence><sentence id="2222">So they put these poor German criminals into Dachau and made Kapos out of them. </sentence><sentence id="2223">Well, a lot of them -- these Kapos were also in there for rape, arson, murder, and violent crimes. </sentence><sentence id="2224">And a lot of them had that same mentality when they were put in the position of Kapo. </sentence><sentence id="2225">And a Kapo in the concentration camp was like a foreman of a work gang, with this important exception: they not only had to say what they told them to say and do what they were told to do, but if they didn't, he had the power of life and death over the people in his detail. </sentence><sentence id="2226">So they did what he said. </sentence><sentence id="2227">And for that reason, the Kapos, prisoners themselves, turned out to be meaner to the political prisoners and the others that were there. </sentence><sentence id="2228">And particularly the Jewish prisoners. </sentence><sentence id="2229">All the Kapos -- they put a Kapo by the name of Wolf in charge of the punishment detail in Mauthausen. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2242">Q:Let's hold it because I have to change the tape and we'll go back to him. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="2244"> TAPE #8 </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2246">Q:All right. </sentence><sentence id="2247">You were talking about Mr. Wolf. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2250">A:Mr. Wolf was a criminal prisoner. </sentence><sentence id="2251">And he was given charge of what was known as the punishment detail in Mauthausen. </sentence><sentence id="2252">Mauthausen had accompanying its environment there a stone quarry. </sentence><sentence id="2253">And the floor of that stone quarry was somewhere between two and 300 feet below the level of the ground. </sentence><sentence id="2254">And this man Wolf used to take the punishment company, which was composed primarily of Jews. </sentence><sentence id="2255">Because let me say this: There's absolutely no doubt about the fact that these camps - Dachau, Mauthausen, Flossenburg and Buchenwald - were all used as instruments for the purpose of exterminating the Jews. </sentence><sentence id="2256">And you can tell that, because the Jews received the harshest work assignments. </sentence><sentence id="2257">They received the smallest amount of food. </sentence><sentence id="2258">And all the dirty, hard work that had to be accomplished was given to the Jewish prisoners. </sentence><sentence id="2259">And whenever anybody had something mean that had to be done, and I mean mean, that one prisoner fighting another, they would get one Jew and put him to do that task. </sentence><sentence id="2260">And I'll say this: That there was absolutely no doubt that any Jew that was able to survive those camps, the Lord has blessed him more and more than anyone will ever know. </sentence><sentence id="2261">Because they were objects of extermination of the system that they had there. </sentence><sentence id="2262">Well, Wolf had this punishment company which was composed primarily of Jews. </sentence><sentence id="2263">And one of the things they had to do was to carry a stone which weighed approximately 25 kilos - that's about 55 pounds - from the bottom of the quarry up to the top at the end of the day. </sentence><sentence id="2264">And what else happened at end of the day, that Kapo selected one prisoner out of that group that received and had the opportunity to make the parachute jump without a parachute. </sentence><sentence id="2265">The other prisoners there would select the prisoner that had been picked out by Wolf, take his hands and his feet. </sentence><sentence id="2266">One for the money, two for the show, three to make merry, and over you go. </sentence><sentence id="2267">And they would throw him down and he would crash down to the bottom of the quarry. </sentence><sentence id="2268">It didn't happen every day. </sentence><sentence id="2269">It didn't happen every day, because there was more pressure put on these people because they didn't know which day it was going to happen. </sentence><sentence id="2270">But no one of them knew whether or not he was going to be the next person to go one for the money, two for the show. </sentence><sentence id="2271">And they also had trees around the rim of the quarry. </sentence><sentence id="2272">And they would use those trees as catapults, and put a prisoner on there, bend it down, release it then he would be tossed out down to his death in the bottom of the quarry. </sentence><sentence id="2273">Well, spots -- Wolf was the commanding officer of this camp. </sentence><sentence id="2274">Now -- I mean of this detail. </sentence><sentence id="2275">And he made that selection. </sentence><sentence id="2276">Now, how many he selected there, I don't recall. </sentence><sentence id="2277">Nobody will ever know because it didn't happen every day. </sentence><sentence id="2278">But it happened so frequently that there was always that sense of urgency when you woke up in the morning as a member of that punishment detail as to whether or not you were going to make the parachute jump. </sentence><sentence id="2279">So Wolf was an individual that I think if anybody exercised clemency on his behalf they should be shot in the head and bled in the of the foot. </sentence><sentence id="2280">Because he certainly wasn't entitled to it. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2313">Q:Did you prosecute a number of Kapos? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2315">A:Oh, yes. </sentence><sentence id="2316">We had the Kapos from the crematory. </sentence><sentence id="2317">We had capos that had various work details that would -- one of them used to kill at a detail that was to take prisoners to the hospital. </sentence><sentence id="2318">I mean, angels of mercy. </sentence><sentence id="2319">And he was the Kapo in charge of this detail. </sentence><sentence id="2320">And he would throttle them with his bare hands. </sentence><sentence id="2321">So that the Kapos were hated by the prisoners who wore the red triangles. </sentence><sentence id="2322">And the Kapos usually were what was known as the block eldest. </sentence><sentence id="2323">Prisoner who was the oldest prisoner in the block. </sentence><sentence id="2324">They always got the benefit at the time that they had been in the penitentiary. </sentence><sentence id="2325">So they were the oldest prisoner in the block. </sentence><sentence id="2326">Not old in years, in age, but the oldest prisoner wise. </sentence><sentence id="2327">And they were hated and they hated each other. </sentence><sentence id="2328">They were hate from the crown of their heads to the sole of their feet. </sentence><sentence id="2329">And we had the Kapo from the crematory. </sentence><sentence id="2330">We had this Arthur Dietzsh, who was not a Kapo in the -- he was a male nurse. </sentence><sentence id="2331">We put that moniker on him for a purpose. </sentence><sentence id="2332">We didn't want Dietzsh tainted with being a Kapo. </sentence><sentence id="2333">But he was a male Kapo actually. </sentence><sentence id="2334">But that was the consideration that we were terribly hopeful that the court would give to Dietzsh; that he was not just a Kapo, but he was a man who was a real man in his heart and soul. </sentence><sentence id="2335">There were few Kapos that had a heart. </sentence><sentence id="2336">Most of them had souls, but they were not entitled to them. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2360">Q:Well, after all of this, the trials that you were working on, did it change you in some way? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2362">A:Physically, yes. </sentence><sentence id="2363">Mentally maybe. </sentence><sentence id="2364">Spiritually I'm sure. </sentence><sentence id="2365">And if you ask me to define what happened in each one of the three I tell you I couldn't possibly do it. </sentence><sentence id="2366">Except the physical part. </sentence><sentence id="2367">I was a physical wreck when I finished. </sentence><sentence id="2368">But I got an understanding of people under peculiar circumstances and their reactions that I could never have learned about elsewhere. </sentence><sentence id="2369">And hopefully I never will have to learn about. </sentence><sentence id="2370">Man's inhumanity to man is something that had no bounds in the concentration camps. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2380">Q:Did it make you pessimistic? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2382">A:To some extent. </sentence><sentence id="2383">To some extent, yes. </sentence><sentence id="2384">I can look over my shoulder at things, see who's following me. </sentence><sentence id="2385">But I didn't do it then. </sentence><sentence id="2386">I wasn't looking over my shoulders at that time. </sentence><sentence id="2387">When you asked about security a moment ago, I shouldn't belittle the protection. </sentence><sentence id="2388">Because there in the camp there was a guard at the gate and there was a guard at every entrance to that camp. </sentence><sentence id="2389">And they -- that didn't stop anybody crawling over. </sentence><sentence id="2390">But we had protection. </sentence><sentence id="2391">And I shouldn't belittle that. </sentence><sentence id="2392">I'm sorry if I left that impression. </sentence><sentence id="2393">And I'm not going back on everything else I said, either. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2406">Q:What gives you the most pride in what you did? </sentence><sentence id="2407">Are you proud? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2410">A: Well, pride. </sentence><sentence id="2411">Pride goeth before destruction. </sentence><sentence id="2412">But now that we got that out of the way. </sentence><sentence id="2413">I took no pride in the fact that I had prosecuted 177 people in these trials. </sentence><sentence id="2414">And I took no pride in the fact that a lot of them were hanged and others received severe punishments of imprisonment. </sentence><sentence id="2415">The one thing that we got to remember is that these things came into being because there was a total disregard of human rights, and their protection. </sentence><sentence id="2416">As has been said, Dachau, Mauthausen, Flossenbiirg and Buchenwald were all dungeons of democracy and so was the Holocaust. </sentence><sentence id="2417">But the thing that I -- that really creates a sense of pride in my heart and feelings is when one of these true survivors of these camps in the Holocaust comes up to me and says, "We thank you for what you've done for us." </sentence><sentence id="2418">That I'm proud of. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2428">Q:Have you met any survivors who were connected with any one of these -- </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2430">A:Oh, yes. </sentence><sentence id="2431">I had a friend who was a witness for me in Mauthausen. </sentence><sentence id="2432">He's dead now. </sentence><sentence id="2433">But he was a wonderful man. </sentence><sentence id="2434">I hadn't seen him for years, and I ran into him in this very building where we're in now here in Mineola. </sentence><sentence id="2435">And I hadn't seen him. </sentence><sentence id="2436">And I was very fond of him and I used him extensively. </sentence><sentence id="2437">When I say extensively, because one who worked in the crematory really had a longevity of about three or four weeks. </sentence><sentence id="2438">Because the man in the crematory knew a lot. </sentence><sentence id="2439">And the Germans got rid of the people who knew a lot. </sentence><sentence id="2440">But Orenstein (ph) managed to stay in the crematory there at Mauthausen for a long time and made an excellent witness for me. </sentence><sentence id="2441">And I liked him very much as a man or human being. </sentence><sentence id="2442">And he came to this country after these trials and set up a business in Philadelphia and was extremely successful there. </sentence><sentence id="2443">He died there in last November, I think a year ago. </sentence><sentence id="2444">And I lost a dear friend. </sentence><sentence id="2445">Orenstein I'll always remember. </sentence></p></dialogue>
