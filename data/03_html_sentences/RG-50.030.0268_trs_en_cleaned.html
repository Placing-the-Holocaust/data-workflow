<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="5">A:My name is William Dowdell Denson. </sentence><sentence id="6">I was born the 31st day of May, nineteen hundred and thirteen in Birmingham, Alabama. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="9">Q:And can you tell us a bit about your education? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="11">A: Well, I was actually educated in the public schools of Birmingham. </sentence><sentence id="12">In nineteen hundred and thirty when I was 17 years of age, I was appointed to the United States military academy at West Point, New York. </sentence><sentence id="13">I entered there in July of that year, and I graduated from there in June of nineteen hundred and thirty-four. </sentence><sentence id="14">I resigned my commission in the United States Army and was accepted as a student at Harvard Law School, which I attended from September of 1934 until graduating in June of 1937. </sentence><sentence id="15">That is the basis of my undoing. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="21">Q:And how come you got interested in the law? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="23">A: Well, I guess that was kind of natural. </sentence><sentence id="24">My great-grandfather on my mother's side was a member of Congress in eighteen hundred and fifty-five and continued there until Alabama succeeded from the Union. </sentence><sentence id="25">At that time he became a colonel in command of the 37th Infantry Regiment of Alabama and participated in the siege of Vicksburg. </sentence><sentence id="26">He was a lawyer and enjoyed the law apparently very much. </sentence><sentence id="27">On my -- his son, rather, would go back -- take the maternal side first. </sentence><sentence id="28">My great-grandfather that I just described had a son by the name of James Rendar (ph) Dowdell. </sentence><sentence id="29">He also was a lawyer. </sentence><sentence id="30">And, in fact, he was a chief justice of the supreme court of Alabama which is the highest judicial court of that state. </sentence><sentence id="31">And my father, I'm skipping now to my pappy's side of the house, and he, of course, was a lawyer. </sentence><sentence id="32">And his father was a This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="33">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="34"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection congressman and the United States attorney for the northern district of Alabama. </sentence><sentence id="35">So I sort of come by the law in a natural fashion. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="51">Q:And going to West Point? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="53">A: went to West Point in -- </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="59">Q:Why? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="61">A:I went to West Point back after I graduated both from Harvard and from the military academy. </sentence><sentence id="62">I went back to West Point to teach law there in January of nineteen hundred and forty-two and taught law there until January of nineteen hundred and forty-five, at which time I was ordered to join the headquarters of the United States Army, 3rd United States Army. </sentence><sentence id="63">And I was a member of the judge advocate's section of that army. </sentence><sentence id="64">And I joined them in February of 1945. </sentence><sentence id="65">Now, my duties in the judge advocate's section in the Headquarters 3rd Army was to have charge of the administration of military justice, which was familiar to me because of my teaching also of military justice at West Point from "42 until "45. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="71">Q:Can we go back just a little bit? </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="78">Q:When you were at Harvard, the Nazis had taken over in Germany. </sentence><sentence id="79">And when you were at Harvard in 1935 the Nuremberg Laws had been passed. </sentence><sentence id="80">Was there any discussion at Harvard about what was going on in Nazi Germany that you can remember? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="84">A:No, sir. </sentence><sentence id="85">At that time, and because curriculum was kind of rough and tough for a country boy like me, I didn't concern myself with much more than trying to study the cases that had been assigned. </sentence><sentence id="86">And there wasn't much discussion either from the professors, nor among the students as to the situation in Germany at that time. </sentence><sentence id="87">And nothing -- I knew nothing of the Nuremberg Laws other than the fact that there were indeed Nuremberg Laws that had been passed. </sentence><sentence id="88">And as such, they were discriminatory highly, and something that hardly anybody could be proud of. </sentence><sentence id="89">But there was never any teaching at Harvard about the Nuremberg Laws at that time. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="96">Q:When did you first become aware of oppression in Germany? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="98">A:To be honest with you, the first that I really recall was Kristallnacht. </sentence><sentence id="99">That was in November of nineteen hundred and thirty-eight, if I'm not mistaken. </sentence><sentence id="100">At that time the pogroms had started. </sentence><sentence id="101">And actually they started even before then. </sentence><sentence id="102">But that was the event that produced a notoriety in that I think the whole world knew about it from that time or from that time on. </sentence><sentence id="103">And it was rather a shock to me, because I had a number of very dear friends who were Jewish that I had grown up with in grammar school, high school and in West Point and at Harvard. </sentence><sentence id="104">So it was -- it came as quite a shock to me that that sort of thing was then taking place. </sentence><sentence id="105">This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="106">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="107"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="118">Q:Did you know anything about the ship to St. Louis that had been coming from Europe to Cuba and was not let -- people were not let into Cuba and then they weren't let in the United States? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="120">A:No. </sentence><sentence id="121">I never heard that until I became more involved with this matter. </sentence><sentence id="122">War crimes and indiscriminations that had occurred. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="126">Q:So that until you became involved in the war crimes trials, your knowledge of what was going on was really quite small then? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="128">A:lt was negligible. </sentence><sentence id="129">And I knew even less about communism. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="132">Q:So tell me, did you want this job in the judge advocate's office? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="134">A:I would say this, that probably I recognized it as a professional challenge and one that I would certainly like to entertain. </sentence><sentence id="135">And I considered myself fortunate to have received the designation in that capacity. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="138">Q:But you didn't know what you were getting into? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="140"> This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="141">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="142"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="143">A: certainly did not. </sentence><sentence id="144">I would do it again, though. </sentence><sentence id="145">Even now that I know it. </sentence><sentence id="146">But I think that I started to say I wouldn't change anything, but I'm sure that upon reflection I might have changed a lot of things. </sentence><sentence id="147">But I couldn't tell you right now what I would have changed. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="153">Q:When did you first become immersed in the kind of material you would be confronting, the kind of evidence you'd be confronting? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="155">A:Well, in Headquarters 3rd Army we had a war crimes team that went along with the combat troops. </sentence><sentence id="156">And that was true in all of the combat units. </sentence><sentence id="157">The war crimes investigating teams were groups of individuals, lawyers, investigators, and supporting personnel, that investigated atrocities as the combat troops uncovered them. </sentence><sentence id="158">And some of those things drifted into the Headquarters of 3rd Army. </sentence><sentence id="159">And our judge advocate -- I mean a staff judge advocate at that time was a colonel by the name of Colonel Charles E. Cheever (ph). </sentence><sentence id="160">And he had an assistant by the name of Josephs that was handling the war crimes aspects at that time. </sentence><sentence id="161">They were later handled by a classmate of mine, as I said, Colonel O'Connell. </sentence><sentence id="162">But in the conversations, the existence of some of these atrocities did become the subject of our conversations. </sentence><sentence id="163">So it was, I would say, before, slightly before, not much before May 7th of 1945. </sentence><sentence id="164">And, of course, May 7th was the day when hostilities ceased. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="175">Q:So you learned something before you went to Germany? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="177">A:No, no, no, no. </sentence><sentence id="178">May 7th of 1945. </sentence><sentence id="179">I was in Germany at that time. </sentence><sentence id="180">I went over to Germany, I went to Headquarters 3rd Army in February of 1945. </sentence><sentence id="181">But actually I don't remember very much war crimes activity until we were stationed in Munich at the rear echelon of Headquarters 3rd Amny was stationed in Munich. </sentence><sentence id="182">And I think it was there when I really first learned anything This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="183">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="184"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection about t he war crimes proceedings that were being uncovered and the events that took place thereafter. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="195">Q:Can you tell us some of your first impressions as you began to look at this evidence for the first time? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="197">A:Well, the first time that I ever had a chance to look at the evidence actually was, I think, in the beginning or middle of August of nineteen hundred and forty-five. </sentence><sentence id="198">And those were some of the reports and findings that the war crimes investigating teams had made to the judge advocate's section in Headquarters 3rd Army. </sentence><sentence id="199">Patton was the commanding general at that time. </sentence><sentence id="200">And the teams that would be actually at Dachau was just 17 kilometers west of Munich. </sentence><sentence id="201">And at that time we were conscious of what was -- had gone along at Dachau. </sentence><sentence id="202">I didn't actually visit the camp until I think some time in July of 1945. </sentence><sentence id="203">Our headquarters were in the-- what they call the house of in Munich. </sentence><sentence id="204">And 17 kilometers didn't particularly interest me at that time at all. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="213">Q:What was the nature of the evidence that you were looking at when you -- </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="215">A:At that time? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="217">Q:From the war crimes team? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="219">A:From the war crimes team were reports that were sent in by the investigators and interrogators. </sentence><sentence id="220">And to look at them and to read them was not to comprehend them. </sentence><sentence id="221">Not that they were written in incomprehensive language. </sentence><sentence id="222">But the events that they described were incredible. </sentence><sentence id="223">This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="224">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="225"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection And at first there was sort of attitude that this -- some of these people had too many Schnapps when they were writing the reports. </sentence><sentence id="226">But that of course is in jest. </sentence><sentence id="227">Never was any such feeling toward the investigators at all. </sentence><sentence id="228">But the events that they described were so incredible that you couldn't help but have a feeling of that, the presence of being depicting events and reciting events in the reports that were so far out from the normal course of events that it was just incredible. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="240">Q:There were a number of lawyers with you? </sentence><sentence id="241">About 30 lawyers? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="244">A:In the -- </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="246">Q:That were working with you. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="248">A:At that time we had quite a number of lawyers in the judge advocate's section. </sentence><sentence id="249">And in the war crimes teams there were actually quite -- I don't recall at this particular moment how many lawyers there were. </sentence><sentence id="250">But investigators, interrogators and lawyers were 40-, 50-odd individuals. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="254">Q:Did you talk about this evidence that was coming in? </sentence><sentence id="255">Were most people equally as incredulous as you were? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="258">A:Well, I'm sure that they were. </sentence><sentence id="259">I don't think there's much doubt about the fact that anybody that came in contact with them, with the evidence, of course, they saw it. </sentence><sentence id="260">It was a credible matter This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="261">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="262"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection to them. </sentence><sentence id="263">But from the secondhand on, it was an incredible matter. </sentence><sentence id="264">And the biggest problem that I had after I was designated to prosecute these case, the biggest problem that I had was believing or getting testimony that could be believed. </sentence><sentence id="265">Because of it's nature. </sentence><sentence id="266">Not that it wasn't true; it was true. </sentence><sentence id="267">But the events that were depicted were so horrible, were so sadistic, were so monstrous, that they were incredible. </sentence><sentence id="268">That's the only way to describe it. </sentence><sentence id="269">And I was a skeptic. </sentence><sentence id="270">I didn't believe it at that time. </sentence><sentence id="271">I didn't start believing it until I really started digging into with the concept and with the authority that I was going to prosecute the Dachau concentration camp case. </sentence><sentence id="272">At that time when I started talking to witnesses, and I heard events there that were so out of line, that they were incredible. </sentence><sentence id="273">I could give you an event that perhaps might depict it. </sentence><sentence id="274">In all of these camps there was place in the camp called the arrest bunker. </sentence><sentence id="275">And in the arrest bunker there was some cells which were called the standing cells. </sentence><sentence id="276">They were instruments of torture in reality because they were so small and so constructed that it was almost impossible for -- almost impossible--it was impossible for a prisoner who had been committed to one of these cells to either lie down or to sit. </sentence><sentence id="277">He had to stand in order to be within the confines of the cell. </sentence><sentence id="278">And these $.S. men who were in charge of the arrest bunker would put prisoners in there for punishment. </sentence><sentence id="279">They received no food, no water, and no chance to sit down or lie down, or change their position for three to five days. </sentence><sentence id="280">And sometimes longer if they lived that long. </sentence><sentence id="281">Then at the end of the period of time, they'd take them out. </sentence><sentence id="282">And if they were still alive, they would sit them down to a table. </sentence><sentence id="283">And on that table would be a vessel with two or more liters of water in it. </sentence><sentence id="284">Well, the poor emaciated prisoner starved by thirst and absolutely out of his mind took the liters of water and guzzled it down immediately. </sentence><sentence id="285">That caused the stomach of this emaciated prisoner to protrude out. </sentence><sentence id="286">When that happened, the S.S. man who was there would drive his fist into that stomach. </sentence><sentence id="287">Or if he couldn't sit, throw him down on the ground and then stomp that protruding stomach with his heel, rupturing the walls of the stomach, and the prisoner died of an agonizing death. </sentence><sentence id="288">Now, This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="289">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="290"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection looking at you, you don't look like you believe it either, but it happened. </sentence><sentence id="291">It was one of the things that happened. </sentence><sentence id="292">And it happened not only in Dachau, which was the case I was concerned with at that time, but in Mauthausen, Flossenbiirg and Buchenwald. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="331">Q:Let's stop now. </sentence><sentence id="332">We have to change the tape. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="341">Q:Bill, You gave us an example of what would make you be skeptical. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="343">A:Yes. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="345">Q:What caused you not to become skeptical? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="347">A:Well, being skeptical we looked around and we finally got a hold of other witnesses and interrogated them and found out that some of them had witnessed this same event that I just described to you. </sentence><sentence id="348">And I interrogated those witnesses very, very closely and very, very carefully to find out as many details as each of them could recall. </sentence><sentence id="349">And low and behold the details that these other witnesses gave me dove-tailed very closely with the incident that I just recited to you. </sentence><sentence id="350">And because they dove-tailed so closely and because of this corroboration, and I knew that these witnesses had not had a chance to get together and make up the story among themselves, that that event had to have happened. </sentence><sentence id="351">It had to have happened because two people couldn't have imagined the same type of misconduct. </sentence><sentence id="352">It was so far out, it was so atrocious, so heinous, that the normal individual just couldn't imagine that sort of event taking place. </sentence><sentence id="353">Nevertheless, when somebody from Poland gave me that type of story, another witness from France the same thing, another from Belgium, I began to believe. </sentence><sentence id="354">And finally I got to the point where I could believe most anything because it all did happen. </sentence><sentence id="355">That was the thing that made a believer out of me. </sentence><sentence id="356">But it pointed up a problem that I was confronted with. </sentence><sentence id="357">What court now is going to hear these witnesses for the first time with such This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="358">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="359"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection 1 a horrible event. </sentence><sentence id="360">Who's going to believe that? </sentence><sentence id="361">You didn't. </sentence><sentence id="362">And it's only natural that the members of the court wouldn't believe it. </sentence><sentence id="363">So what we had to do was to sort of condition the court in this sense that I first introduced evidence of events that you would expect to have occurred in a penal environment. </sentence><sentence id="364">Slapping around. </sentence><sentence id="365">Little more force; knocking around. </sentence><sentence id="366">Down to beatings. </sentence><sentence id="367">In that various degrees. </sentence><sentence id="368">And in that way it conditioned the court for the bizarre events that I just described to you. </sentence><sentence id="369">And that was a problem that we recognized and was a major problem that served as the subject of our conversations as counsel. </sentence><sentence id="370">And when I say our conversations as counsel, I had assistants that were trained lawyers, wonderful men. </sentence><sentence id="371">And we would get together after each session and discuss among ourselves to what extent we thought we had conditioned the court so that we could bring on testimony of these bizarre events that took place. </sentence><sentence id="372">And it seemed to work. </sentence><sentence id="373">The court in all cases except one found the accused guilty of committing war crimes. </sentence><sentence id="374">And, well, the nature of the sentences that they imposed, they must have believed. </sentence><sentence id="375">We almost hit the jackpot in the Mauthausen case. </sentence><sentence id="376">In that case we had 61 accused in the dock that we were trying. </sentence><sentence id="377">And of that 61, all of them were found guilty. </sentence><sentence id="378">58 of them were sentenced to be hanged and three of them were sentenced to life imprisonment. </sentence><sentence id="379">So that was almost the jackpot. </sentence><sentence id="380">If they had all been sentenced to be hanged, that would have been the jackpot. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="417">Q:Were you looking for the death sentence in most of the cases that you were trying? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="419">A:Well, let me tell you this: Looking for it is one way to put it. </sentence><sentence id="420">In the commission of a war crime, the maximum punishment is death by hanging. </sentence><sentence id="421">And depending on the circumstances, any lesser punishment as the circumstances may dictate in the mind of the court. </sentence><sentence id="422">So all of them, This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="423">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="424"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection 2 all of them were subject to having had the death sentence imposed upon them after having been found guilty. </sentence><sentence id="425">So that to say were you looking for it, there was some that were more guilty than others. </sentence><sentence id="426">And that was the second problem that we had;

they made offices for the prosecution and offices for the defendants. </sentence><sentence id="973">And one end of the -- accused in one end of the building, another end of the building was the courtroom. </sentence><sentence id="974">And at the far end was a dais that was raised about two feet off of the ground. </sentence><sentence id="975">So you had to take really two steps to get up to

had nothing to say. </sentence><sentence id="995">They occupied seats which were like seats in a theater that didn't have the upholstery. </sentence><sentence id="996">They were seats -- seat of the seat folded up. </sentence><sentence id="997">And they sat on -- the accused in Dachau sat on the court's left in that case. </sentence><sentence id="998">In Mauthausen they started out on the left and moved over to the right. </sentence><sentence id="999">I never asked who moved them, but I went in the court one day and it was that way, so that was it. </sentence><sentence id="1000">And the accused each had their own separate seat. </sentence><sentence id="1001">And in front of the bank of accused that was seated there were the counsel table for the accused. </sentence><sentence id="1002">And there the lawyers and their assistants sat and took their notes and had their interpreters seated there with them. </sentence><sentence id="1003">And getting back to the interpreters, the language barriers, they were not overcome there like they were at Nuremberg. </sentence><sentence id="1004">We had no instantaneous translation. </sentence><sentence id="1005">We had -- the trials were conducted in English and in German basically. </sentence><sentence id="1006">So we had an English and German interpreter. </sentence><sentence id="1007">Then if a witness, we will, say for example was Polish who spoke a little English and spoke no German, we would have an English-Polish, German-Polish interpreter. </sentence><sentence id="1008">So that the order rather went this way: I as the prosecutor would ask the question in English. </sentence><sentence id="1009">That was then translated by the English-German interpreter into German. </sentence><sentence id="1010">Then the Polish-English interpreter would ask the question to the witness. </sentence><sentence id="1011">Now, if the witness understood any of these languages, he could get sort of a fix on it. </sentence><sentence id="1012">But we kept the language of the witness as the controlling language to this extent that he would then have less time for his reply. </sentence><sentence id="1013">In other words, the interpreter who spoke Polish and German would translate after my English-German interpreter had spoken, translated into Polish. </sentence><sentence id="1014">Then the witness would answer in Polish, and it would come back the same track. </sentence><sentence id="1015">So it was sometimes kind of confusing. </sentence><sentence id="1016">But the court had the official -- these interpreters that I just described to you were all known as official interpreters. </sentence><sentence id="1017">Then as a prosecutor I had my own interpreter and so did the defense counsel.

Nuremberg was not sitting, when Nuremberg finished there activities and our clients came back and visited us. </sentence><sentence id="1026">And the attendees were basically in that only the families

been broadcasting these proceedings over the Munich radio station. </sentence><sentence id="1032">And I must say, after they started broadcasting, business did pick up. </sentence><sentence

was any raucousness or any boisterous conduct of any kind. </sentence><sentence id="1037">It was always carried out on a dignified plane. </sentence><sentence id="1038">But sometimes there would be

this expanse of gold teeth. </sentence><sentence id="1383">Just like a sunburst. </sentence><sentence id="1384">I said, "Mr. Kohl, how in heaven's name did you survive Mauthausen from nineteen hundred and thirty-eight when you were incarcerated there until the liberation in nineteen hundred and forty-five in April?" </sentence><sentence id="1385">And he says, "Colonel, I never smiled.

survive. </sentence><sentence id="1389">Because when he did smile, as I said, it was daybreak, and it was lovely. </sentence><sentence id="1390">But getting witnesses out of Vienna was very hard. </sentence><sentence id="1391">They had a staff judge advocate over in 7th Army there at Vienna that was opposed to our taking witnesses out of Vienna because Vienna was in the Russian zone. </sentence><sentence id="1392">The only part of Vienna that we had access to was the principal part of the city, and Tulin (ph) Air Force Base. </sentence><sentence id="1393">And that was -- otherwise you had to go through the Russian zone from Augsburg to get down to Vienna. </sentence><sentence id="1394">Well, the staff judge advocate there under General Mark Clark said, "You can't take these witness out of here. </sentence><sentence id="1395">The Russians will claim that you're kidnapping them and taking them out of the Russian Zone." </sentence><sentence id="1396">And I asked to see

had that type of reticence that was really keeping us from preparing Mauthausen. </sentence><sentence id="1404">Because Mauthausen was located on the Enns River near Linz, Austria.

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1531">A:Yes. </sentence><sentence id="1532">Credibility involves many things. </sentence><sentence id="1533">The way that you sit in your chair on the witness stand, your demeanor on the witness stand. </sentence><sentence id="1534">How you express yourself. </sentence><sentence id="1535">Even though it may be in a foreign language, the facial expressions that you utilize when you're expressing yourself. </sentence><sentence id="1536">All these things go to the matter of being able to enable the fact-finders to tell where the truth lies. </sentence><sentence id="1537">If you get an individual that's going to be close-mouthed and going to tell you only those facts that advance his interest, you can tell it. </sentence><sentence id="1538">It comes out. </sentence><sentence id="1539">And that's the reason why credibility is a matter for the fact-finder and never a consideration for the appellate authority, or in our case, the appointing and confirming authorities. </sentence><sentence id="1540">Oh, I could tell you a lot about that if you want to talk about Ilse Koch sometime. </sentence><sentence id="1541">But credibility is terribly important. </sentence><sentence id="1542">And it was important because we had bizarre things that we had to get the court to believe. </sentence><sentence id="1543">And if you had had a closed-mouthed individual there talking about, describing event that I previously described to you, nobody is going to believe it. </sentence><sentence id="1544">But if he got up there and said it with the feeling that it was terrible for him to even have to talk about it again, to recall it, it's bound to make an impression so far as a fact-finder is concerned. </sentence><sentence id="1545">That's what I mean about credibility. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1757">Q:Continue the story about the male nurse Dietzsh who saved -- </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1759">A:Yes, I would like to do that. </sentence><sentence id="1760">Because Arthur Dietzsh had been persecuted by the Weimar Republic and was persecuted again by Hitler. </sentence><sentence id="1761">So he had spent most of his life in confinement of one form or another. </sentence><sentence id="1762">And at Buchenwald he became the male nurse because he was a man of education that he had educated himself actually. </sentence><sentence id="1763">And as a male nurse he was an assistant to a Sturmbahnfiihrer, I think they call him. </sentence><sentence id="1764">A Major Ding-Schuler, who was Kraut that had some artistic qualities about him. </sentence><sentence id="1765">And he was a doctor. </sentence><sentence id="1766">He had M.D. And had specialized in diseases and immunization. </sentence><sentence id="1767">And they put Ding-Schuler in charge of this block which they had set aside as a hospital block for the purpose of developing some sort of immunization against typhus. </sentence><sentence id="1768">Typhus was the plague that was raging all the concentration camps. </sentence><sentence id="1769">I think it started up in Russia, and Treblinka actually is I think where they had the first cases of typhus, and Auschwitz. </sentence><sentence id="1770">And as those people spread down south, was sent. </sentence><sentence id="1771">But when the advances forced them out of the camps, they spread it to the German concentration camps that were located in Germany and in Austria. </sentence><sentence id="1772">So it was terribly important to get some sort of specific for typhus. </sentence><sentence id="1773">And that was Ding-Schuler's job. </sentence><sentence id="1774">And he selected this male nurse as Arthur Dietzsh as his assistant. </sentence><sentence id="1775">And he educated Dietzsh, who already was educated in other matters. </sentence><sentence id="1776">But he became a very confidante -- much of a confidante of Ding- Schuler's. </sentence><sentence id="1777">And they talked about what was going on in the world. </sentence><sentence id="1778">And how Germany was losing the war. </sentence><sentence id="1779">And they each recognized at that time, and this was back in January, February and March of 1945, handwriting was pretty much on the wall. </sentence><sentence id="1780">And Arthur Dietzsh having access to Ding- Schuler, and Yoe-Thomas got himself in the typhus block and got access to Ding-Schuler and convinced Ding-Schuler to go along with his scheme.

</sentence><sentence id="1784">Because Arthur Dietzsh was a hands-on person in the block. </sentence><sentence id="1785">And they conceived this plan of taking some of these poor guinea pig prisoners who had been infected with typhus when they were dying, switching their identity with Yoe-Thomas and his friends, those five British-French friends that remained out of the group that came there originally. </sentence><sentence id="1786">And one by one they were able to get rid of them. </sentence><sentence id="1787">They finally got down to Yoe- Thomas, and his twin hadn't died yet. </sentence><sentence id="1788">So it was getting close. </sentence><sentence id="1789">And they were asking to have Yoe-Thomas brought to the crematory for execution. </sentence><sentence id="1790">As a matter of fact, they sent an Unterscharffiihrer, I think was tech sergeant or something, down to the hospital to escort Yoe-Thomas down to the crematory. </sentence><sentence id="1791">And Ding-Schuler said, "Look, typhus is a pretty contagious disease. </sentence><sentence id="1792">If you want to go in here and pick him out of this bed, he's yours. </sentence><sentence id="1793">Be my guest." </sentence><sentence id="1794">And the Unterscharffiihrer said he had a wife and some kids at home and he would like to avoid that if he could. </sentence><sentence id="1795">And he said -- I mean Dietzsh said, "All right. </sentence><sentence id="1796">I'll kill him. </sentence><sentence id="1797">I'll inject him with the syringe and you can take him out." </sentence><sentence id="1798">Well, they finally had a man who was his double. </sentence><sentence id="1799">He died. </sentence><sentence id="1800">And this is according to Dietzsh, believe it or not, but he died. </sentence><sentence id="1801">And Dietzsh went to this corpse, injected it with hydrogen peroxide of all things. </sentence><sentence id="1802">That gets into the heart and creates an embolism, and death is pretty certain. </sentence><sentence id="1803">And speedy. </sentence><sentence id="1804">And that's what they did. </sentence><sentence id="1805">So they said, "Now you can tell them that he's dead. </sentence><sentence id="1806">And if you want to, you can take the body back." </sentence><sentence id="1807">And they said, "No. </sentence><sentence id="1808">You just assure me that he's dead. </sentence><sentence id="1809">Let me take a look." </sentence><sentence id="1810">He took a look and he didn't know Yoe-Thomas from Adam's house cat. </sentence><sentence id="1811">But he went back and reported he was dead. </sentence><sentence id="1812">Well, that saved Yoe-Thomas" life. </sentence><sentence id="1813">And Thomas wrote out on a slip of paper, "To Whom It May Concern, that this man, Labaro (ph), Arthur Dietzsh has saved my life. </sentence><sentence id="1814">And any consideration that you can give him when he's brought to trial --" because Yoe- Thomas had told him every one of you going to be brought to trial. </sentence><sentence id="1815">All of them. </sentence><sentence id="1816">That's how he had his entree to Ding- Schuler. </sentence><sentence id="1817">And he gave him this slip of paper. </sentence><sentence id="1818">And Arthur Dietzsh saved his life. </sentence><sentence id="1819">But he didn't save it for long in that sense.

Russians who picked him up on an exchange of prisoners. </sentence><sentence id="1823">And he was then sent back to the Germans on this exchange by the Russians. </sentence><sentence id="1824">He escaped a second time but not from Buchenwald. </sentence><sentence id="1825">However, the one thing I want to say about Dietzsh, when he did this, he did it because I think in his heart and soul he knew that this is a man that deserves saving. </sentence><sentence id="1826">They had had a lot of conversations together, Dietzsh and Yoe- Thomas. </sentence><sentence id="1827">And Ding-Schuler and Yoe-Thomas. </sentence><sentence id="1828">So that he had the cooperation -- Dietzsh had the cooperation of his boss. </sentence><sentence id="1829">And Yoe-Thomas was the boss of both Schuler and Arthur Dietzsh. </sentence><sentence id="1830">The court that tried Dietzsh gave him ten years. </sentence><sentence id="1831">And I think the reviewing authority cut it down to time that he had spent in confinement. </sentence><sentence id="1832">Ding-Schuler took his own life when Buchenwald fell. </sentence><sentence id="1833">Ding-Schuler committed suicide. </sentence><sentence id="1834">So I think that Ding-Schuler is a little different from the ilk that ran the concentration camps. </sentence><sentence id="1835">He was able to be persuaded by Yoe- Thomas. </sentence><sentence id="1836">Now, that didn't happen very frequently. </sentence><sentence id="1837">Because there were a lot of others that had tried substantially the same approach that were not successful. </sentence><sentence id="1838">In Buchenwald we had some other interesting characters one of whom was Ilse Koch, who was the wife of a former commandant. </sentence><sentence id="1839">She was not the wife of a commandant that was there when the camp failed. </sentence><sentence id="1840">Pista (ph) was the man on trial. </sentence><sentence id="1841">And Pista couldn't stand Ilse Koch because she still was the commandeur, according to her, of Buchenwald. </sentence><sentence id="1842">And they were somewhat at odds. </sentence><sentence id="1843">Well, Ilse Koch had a fancy for light shades. </sentence><sentence id="1844">I didn't try her for that. </sentence><sentence id="1845">I tried her for aiding and abetting the operation of the Buchenwald concentration camp. </sentence><sentence id="1846">She, during the time of her husband, when he was commandant, used to report prisoners because they ogled her. </sentence><sentence id="1847">I think that's the way you pronounce it when you make big eyes at tight-fitting clothes on a very voluptuous body. </sentence><sentence id="1848">And whenever prisoners ogled Ilse, she took down their numbers. </sentence><sentence id="1849">They were reported and they were whipped. </sentence><sentence id="1850">And they were whipped in a way which was absolutely inhuman. </sentence><sentence id="1851">They were spread across a desk with

</sentence><sentence id="1859">And many times those beatings led to death. </sentence><sentence id="1860">So she did have her share of participation in the operation of that camp and in furthering the operation of the camp to the extent that there was this common design to subject these prisoners to that type of punishment and that type of misconduct of starvation. </sentence><sentence

</sentence><sentence id="1863">Once she had been found guilty, she was given a life sentence. </sentence><sentence id="1864">And the only reason why I later found out from a member of the court that they didn't hang her was that she was carrying a child. </sentence><sentence id="1865">She was four months pregnant at the time she was sentenced. </sentence><sentence id="1866">Well, when the reviewing authority cut her sentence down from life imprisonment to four years, they gave as an excuse that there was insufficient credible evidence to justify a sentence of that severity. </sentence><sentence id="1867">Well, remember, credibility is for the fact-finder, not for the man who is reviewing the case. </sentence><sentence id="1868">Because the man who sees that witness

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2087">A:Katzenelenbogen was a psychoanalyst. </sentence><sentence id="2088">And he played his trade to the last inch in defense of his own self. </sentence><sentence id="2089">That court absolutely detested him because of the evidence that had been amassed against him. </sentence><sentence id="2090">And it was very little that he did to defend himself other than still claim American citizenship. </sentence><sentence id="2091">Because he had come to this country when he was about 20 or 21 years of age, and was still in school. </sentence><sentence id="2092">And had taken citizenship papers and married a daughter of one of the justices on the Supreme Judicial Court of Massachusetts. </sentence><sentence id="2093">They had a child, and the child fell out of an apartment window in New York and was killed. </sentence><sentence id="2094">And that broke up the family. </sentence><sentence id="2095">He went back to Germany and to -- actually it wasn't Germany. </sentence><sentence id="2096">It was that section of the Austrian-Hungarian Empire that was in there between Germany and Czechoslovakia. </sentence><sentence id="2097">Actually went back to Marienbad and opened a clinic there. </sentence><sentence id="2098">And the Gestapo got interested in him as an informer. </sentence><sentence id="2099">And he was an informer. </sentence><sentence id="2100">And finally he ended up in Buchenwald. </sentence><sentence id="2101">And they put him in the small camp as a doctor. </sentence><sentence id="2102">And I told you he was sort of a mean fella. </sentence><sentence id="2103">And he would sell his services rather than perform what he was supposed to do. </sentence><sentence id="2104">And he came on for trial having committed a war crime. </sentence><sentence id="2105">And he more or less made an ass out of himself before the court in his responses to the questions that were asked by his defense counsel. </sentence><sentence id="2106">And his defense counsel, I believe, at that time was a man by the name of Wolff (ph). </sentence><sentence id="2107">And Wolf did the best he could to keep Katzenelenbogen quiet. </sentence><sentence id="2108">Because the more he talked, the worse he got. </sentence><sentence id="2109">And when I had him on cross-examination, of course I did the best I could to let him tell us everything he knew. </sentence><sentence id="2110">And he knew a lot. </sentence><sentence id="2111">As a matter of fact, he said the evidence was such that he could have the then minister of justice in France sitting in his seat for the activities that that minister had performed in the small camp at This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence

information about this collection 5 Buchenwald. </sentence><sentence id="2114">Well, we let him talk. </sentence><sentence id="2115">And after it was over, the court first called him forward and announced that he had been found guilty. </sentence><sentence id="2116">Well, Katzenelenbogen was asked if he had anything to say why sentence should not be pronounced against him. </sentence><sentence id="2117">And he had this deep voice. </sentence><sentence id="2118">He could have been a basso profunda at the Met With no trouble at all. </sentence><sentence id="2119">He said, "Now that this honorable court has put the Mark of Cain upon my brow, I have but one wish. </sentence><sentence id="2120">And that is that this court impose upon me the most serious punishment within its power." </sentence><sentence id="2121">And he nodded like that. </sentence><sentence id="2122">And I thought to myself, Well, bless his heart. </sentence><sentence id="2123">I hope they accommodate him. </sentence><sentence id="2124">Well, there was a flurry behind on the bench. </sentence><sentence id="2125">And the president of the court said, "The court finds pursuant to your plea of not guilty that you are guilty. </sentence><sentence id="2126">And finding of you being guilty chooses to impose upon you a life imprisonment." </sentence><sentence id="2127">So the old scoundrel didn't get hanged at all. </sentence><sentence id="2128">He got off with his life. </sentence><sentence id="2129">And except for his age, he'd be alive today. </sentence><sentence id="2130">But he played it to the last inch. </sentence><sentence id="2131">That court, I found out, that, they didn't want to please him. </sentence><sentence id="2132">And he had asked for the death sentence, and rather than please him, they gave him life imprisonment instead. </sentence><sentence id="2133">So he was a doctor to the end. </sentence><sentence id="2134">I must say that I get back to reducing sentences. </sentence><sentence id="2135">Clemency is a proper thing to be exercised under proper conditions. </sentence><sentence id="2136">But there was no clemency that Ilse Koch was entitled to. </sentence><sentence id="2137">There was no clemency that Katzenelenbogen was entitled to, in my judgment. </sentence><sentence id="2138">But I didn't have the power to wield that authority. </sentence><sentence id="2139">And the fact that some of these sentences have been reduced, I go back to the feeling that I do not know all the facts and circumstances about their family relationships, whether or not they're the sole supports of families that then existed, who were probably without fault on their part. </sentence><sentence id="2140">So that there could be many considerations that could justify the reduction of sentences. </sentence><sentence id="2141">And in the main, I find no fault with the exercise of clemency when it's denominated clemency. </sentence><sentence id="2142">But I do object like a stuck pig to any time that they start reducing sentences on the grounds of insufficient credible evidence, for the simple reason that the whole operation was incredible in its entirety. </sentence><sentence id="2143">This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="2144">It is not the primary source, and it has not been

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2208">Q:When you look at the entire set of trials that were, not just the ones you were participating in, where so many people had harsh sentences, whether it was death or life imprisonment that were severely reduced or they were let go, does that bother you? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2210">A:To let go, again, I don't know the circumstances of their letting go. </sentence><sentence id="2211">That's a function of the exercise of clemency. </sentence><sentence id="2212">It's to take into consideration those factors which were no part of my concern. </sentence><sentence id="2213">So that if I knew that a sentence had been reduced in exercise of clemency, I don't quarrel with it. </sentence><sentence id="2214">If it's exercised on the ground of insufficient credible evidence, I scream. </sentence><sentence id="2215">And I scream loud and long, because I know that's wrong. </sentence><sentence id="2216">And I know that's wrong because I know that these events that seem incredible to the person who reads about them happened. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2226">A:l'm sure that there may very well have been, sure. </sentence><sentence id="2227">Germany was sickened to find denazified leaders. </sentence><sentence id="2228">While none of these individuals that I tried could hardly make that category, there was a sense of uncertainty in not knowing which way to go. </sentence><sentence id="2229">And I think this: I think the United States government did a magnificent job in its occupation. </sentence><sentence id="2230">I really do. </sentence><sentence id="2231">And I say they're entitled to all credit for that. </sentence><sentence id="2232">And I think while mistakes were made, to err is human, to forgive divine. </sentence></p></dialogue>
