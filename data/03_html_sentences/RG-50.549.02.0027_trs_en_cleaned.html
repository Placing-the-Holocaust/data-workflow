monument, which was impossible during Soviet days. </sentence><sentence id="145">First of all, they didn't allow any monuments which specifically said Jews perished there. </sentence><sentence id="146">Soviet citizens, yes, but not Jews. </sentence><sentence id="147">So, i-in -- in -- and at that time, this -- this was a very dangerous place to be, because Ukrainian nationalists already

</sentence><sentence id="158">I got in touch with him, I found out there is in Israel a organization, it's called the House of Waleen. </sentence><sentence id="159">Waleen is the name of the province which has records of many. </sentence><sentence id="160">There's probably, in that part, hundreds of thousands of Jews perished. </sentence><sentence id="161">They didn't send them to -- to
