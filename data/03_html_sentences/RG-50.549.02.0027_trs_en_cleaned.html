<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="80">A: This was in that -- in a village called Povorsk, which we visited two years ago. </sentence><sentence id="81">I think my wife told you about a visit to -- the trip there. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="84">Q: She talked about the trip to Vilno, but didn't talk about your trip to Povorsk. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="86">A: Yeah, well, it started with Povorsk. </sentence><sentence id="87">A -- I -- I was not there when the tragedy happened. </sentence><sentence id="88">I was in the Soviet Union, working a coal mine. </sentence><sentence id="89">And I found out about -- I knew -- I -- I -- the Soviet -- I -- read the Soviet press, even though I worked for a slave labor camp, we had a cultural life. </sentence><sentence id="90">There were -- there was a library with papers and books which you could read. </sentence><sentence id="91">As a matter of fact, I ha -- even had the privilege of subscribing for -- to -- to the Pravda, one of the Soviet papers, for a short while, for a few months, because the librarian, who was also a internee like myself, had about half a dozen papers he could give, to give us a semblance of kind of freedom and culture. </sentence><sentence id="92">So, he gave me the privilege of sur-surpri -- which was dirt cheap, it was pennies. </sentence><sentence id="93">But, to me it had a big value besides reading it, I could read it in the library. </sentence><sentence id="94">But I could sell it afterward for the purpose of rolling cigarettes. </sentence><sentence id="95">I, myself, was smoking. </sentence><sentence id="96">And we used to have a kind of -- there was some commerce in the camp. </sentence><sentence id="97">Womens used to come out from USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0027 5 outside and had a little -- put like a -- a kiosk in the camp. </sentence><sentence id="98">And if you had money, you could buy things. </sentence><sentence id="99">They used to bring in milk, he used to bring in tobacco, which was sold by the glass. </sentence><sentence id="100">Actually, that was not even tobacco, it was tobacco

commerce -- intracamp commerce, and buy tobacco. </sentence><sentence id="102">But I had to buy a newspaper. </sentence><sentence id="103">A newspaper cost 10 rubles. </sentence><sentence id="104">So, when I had five newspapers or six newspapers a week, I could sell five of them and one use for my own needs and with others I used to get the 50 rubles and use it to buy the tobacco roots, see? </sentence><sentence id="105">So, while I had it, I was in very good shape, financially. </sentence><sentence id="106">I didn't have to sell my bread ration. </sentence><sentence id="107">So -- and in the press, there wasn't much about the Final Solution. </sentence><sentence id="108">The Soviet press didn't write much about it, they wrote about atrocities committed against the Soviet people, none that mentioned Jews. </sentence><sentence id="109">Of course the particular Jews [indecipherable] designed to be exterminated. </sentence><sentence id="110">But -- And they knew about it, of course, but they didn't -- I remember when the revolt broke out in the Warsaw ghetto, there was a little column, one column, but about four or five inches tall, about a revolt in the Warsaw ghetto, which was liquidated by -- the Warsaw ghetto was liquidated by the German -- the German occupiers. </sentence><sentence id="111">Not mentioning much about just one word to the Jews. </sentence><sentence id="112">The ghetto, of course, they had to mention the ghetto, because there's only one kind of a ghetto, a Jewish ghetto. </sentence><sentence id="113">So they mentioned it. </sentence><sentence id="114">So there wasn't much about it. </sentence><sentence id="115">But one day, when the forces -- the Soviet forces approached not far from where my town was located, I wrote a letter from camp to the -- somebody in the ci -- town council, asking if USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0027 6 there's any information about my family. </sentence><sentence id="116">It so happened that the town was not liberated yet. </sentence><sentence id="117">It was still -- there was still the -- the -- the front was there in the -- the next city. </sentence><sentence id="118">For quite awhile, places changed hands back and forth, but I -- another town close to it, was already liberated. </sentence><sentence id="119">And a friend of mine, who was a former partisan, where my brother was also a partisan of the sa -- the same place, the same time. </sentence><sentence id="120">He was already liberated and he was working in the post office. </sentence><sentence id="121">And when they saw my name -- my return address, with my name on it, he opened the letter and he sent it to my brother. </sentence><sentence id="122">He read it, sent to my brother and my brother answered it. </sentence><sentence id="123">And he -- he just wrote me that he is -- he knows that he -- he is -- he is alive, everything is -- all is well. </sentence><sentence id="124">He works now as -- doing -- as a guard in an NKVD, secret -- secret police farm. </sentence><sentence id="125">And he sent me -- he would sent me some money. </sentence><sentence id="126">Course, they used to speculate theirselves by [indecipherable] and he knew that I was in bad shape, so he send me some money. </sentence><sentence id="127">A few days later, I got a letter from one of my friend -- a former brother-in-law of mine, as a matter of fact, and then his brother, describing what happened and how it happened and who survived and did not survive. </sentence><sentence id="128">So I knew -- then I find out what happened. </sentence><sentence id="129">And I had in mind that my wi -- in 1945, after the war, the Poles and the Soviets conclude an agreement to let -- this ha -- by the way, this information is in the videotape, but I'm telling you so you understand what I am talking about -- had an agreement to let all of those who were former Polish citizens, til "39, coo -- provided they are Jews or Poles, not Ukrainians or Russians, could get out, back to Poland. </sentence><sentence id="130">And after a year, they find -- this is a long story, but doesn't make any sense, it repeats again. </sentence><sentence id="131">I left the Soviet Union, you know, and then came to Poland. </sentence><sentence id="132">But, I  ontectnetonancedjusietneey for ther biormatierabouttfisenecion USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0027 7 ha -- I thought I'Il be able to go by this town and see what -- you know, where the place was, at least, fo-found out what happened. </sentence><sentence id="133">But luckily, luckily, I could not stop there, because th-they routed me through a different way, through Belarus, through Minsk and - - but I always dreamed about coming back to Povorsk and putting up a monument, which was impossible during Soviet days. </sentence><sentence id="134">First of all, they didn't allow any monuments which specifically said Jews perished there. </sentence><sentence id="135">Soviet citizens, yes, but not Jews. </sentence><sentence id="136">So, i-in -- in -- and at that time, this -- this was a very dangerous place to be, because Ukrainian nationalists already harassed the Soviet army and killed the Jews, just like the Poles did after the war, yeah. </sentence><sentence id="137">So, is good that they did not go through. </sentence><sentence id="138">But I -- I -- It was a kind of - - became an obsession for me to come and put up a monument. </sentence><sentence id="139">Now, when you co -- then they st -- they started allowing already do -- before Gorbachov's time already, they start allowing put up with and even in Yiddish or in Hebrew, what happened -- descriptions on these monuments, and they allowed to have Jews. </sentence><sentence id="140">I don't know if you know about that pol -- a Soviet write up of the name of Viefter Schenko, who wrote a poem about, "There's no monument in Babier," which is Kiev -- probably heard about it. </sentence><sentence id="141">And he wrote he's ashamed being a Russian, that they did not allow to put up m-monuments in these places, so they did allow, finally they did allow. </sentence><sentence id="142">And then, in the beg -- middle of this decade, since "95, I think, Ukraine became independent and they allowed, already. </sentence><sentence id="143">And there was a fellow in our -- in -- in the -- in the province there, who, as a matter of fact, he's -- he -- he was the -- the -- the secretary of the Communist party in the -- in the -- yeah, he was half Jewish, too, but he didn't -- he said himself Ukrainian. </sentence><sentence id="144">And he  USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0027 8 started putting up this monument with government help, first Soviet and then the independent Ukraine. </sentence><sentence id="145">I got in touch with him, I found out there is in Israel a organization, it's called the House of Waleen. </sentence><sentence id="146">Waleen is the name of the province which has records of many. </sentence><sentence id="147">There's probably, in that part, hundreds of thousands of Jews perished. </sentence><sentence id="148">They didn't send them to -- to concentration camps, they killed them right then and there. </sentence><sentence id="149">In our town, it was exploded dump, oil dump that the Soviets built and they exploded it and then they used it for when they killed th-the German [indecipherable] they dump the Jews in there, you know. </sentence><sentence id="150">And this is the place -- so it was a military zone, belonged to the army. </sentence><sentence id="151">And you could not go into any place in army during Soviet days. </sentence><sentence id="152">They agreed they" Il let us put up the monument. </sentence><sentence id="153">We -- We -- We a-agreed on a price with -- how much it'll cost. </sentence><sentence id="154">But it came the day when they're supposed -- already the monument is ready and they decided nyet, they're not allowed to on the mili-military. </sentence><sentence id="155">So, I -- finally it was ready, we are ready to go in 19 -- in 19 -- this was what, 60, now is 90 -- 98 and 96.95, we had a date and I had a group, the -- a woman from the local -- well, W -- WMG -- GME, I think it is. </sentence><sentence id="156">That used to be WGAM. </sentence><sentence id="157">This is affiliate of
