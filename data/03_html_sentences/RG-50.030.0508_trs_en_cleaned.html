<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1164">Q: Uh-huh. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1166">A: And it was my job to, when we got requests from the government to bid on certain items, to break down the drawings and specifications and prepare a bill of materials, estimate the labor and then submit a bid to the government. </sentence><sentence id="1167">So that was primarily my job, and because I was pretty good in math and sciences, and [indecipherable] material and so forth, I was able to calculate and to price it out. </sentence><sentence id="1168">And we were at a -- very successful in that business. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1173">Q: And what were you actually doing for the government once you -- </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1174">A: Well, we were making various items for the government. </sentence><sentence id="1175">One of the first contracts -- I remember getting a big contract, was for helmet lines. </sentence><sentence id="1176">It was an aluminum frame covered with calfskin leather which would fit into the helmet. </sentence><sentence id="1177">I remember making sleeping bags. </sentence><sentence id="1178">That's a funny story, Phyllis always tells me about it -- reminds me about it. </sentence><sentence id="1179">I -- </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1180">Q: Well, you know something, let's -- let's go to the next tape, cause I have the feeling it's going to go on for a bit longer, so let's stop this tape. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1226">Q: What's a tow target, what is that? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1228">A: Tow targets, well, in order for the pilots to practice -- </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1229">Q: Uh-huh. </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1230">A: -- gunnery in a plane, they need a target -- </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1231">Q: Right. </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1232">A: -- to fire. </sentence><sentence id="1233">So there is one plane that has attached to it, a target -- </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1234">Q: I see. </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1235">A: -- which they towed behind the plane. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1241">Q: Yes, yes. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1243">A: And so that the other pilots or whatever, fighters, would aim their bullets into that particular target. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1245">Q: Right. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1247">A: And that when they fired the bullet in that target, it would leave a mark -- </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1248">Q: Right. </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1249">A: -- in the tow target, so they would know which pilot, or whatever, registered on the target -- </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1250">Q: Right, right. </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1251">A: -- and so forth. </sentence><sentence id="1252">So we made tow targets. </sentence><sentence id="1253">We made many things which the government needed at the time. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1261">A: We made it ourself. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1263">Q: Wow. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1265">A: We were our own contractors. </sentence><sentence id="1266">So we started with the raw material, and we sold the finished item, and we had, you know, government inspectors at -- on the premises -- </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1267">Q: Right. </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1268">A: -- at all times to make sure that we meet the government specifications. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1270">Q: Right. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1272">A: And that was another challenge because when you deal with the government, there is no right way, there is no wrong way, it's only the army way. </sentence><sentence id="1273">And when they tell you you -- you s -- sew it with 10 stitches per inch, it better be 10 stitches per inch. </sentence><sentence id="1274">Nine will not do, 11 will not do, it better be 10. </sentence><sentence id="1275">And so that you had to follow explicitly the government specifications. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1280">Q: Right. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1282">A: And that was a challenge. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1284">Q: I bet. </sentence><sentence id="1285">Now let me ask you something, cause it strikes me that you -- I don't know if you feel somewhat schizophrenic in the United States when you're 20 and 21, but when the war happens, and your family is over there, and you're here relatively safe, that must be really hard for you. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="1288">You're reading newspapers, you're hearing the news on the radio. </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1289">A: Well, you know, you hear the news and you never heard really of the atrocities which were committed. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1291">Q: Uh-huh. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1297">A: We knew there was a problems, we knew it was difficult, but we never imagined that there were concentration camps, we never imagined that there were gas chambers and whatever. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1299">Q: Right. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1413">A: Really, I don't think he would have been as happy in the United States as he was in Israel. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="1414">First of all, there was a big migration of Soviet Jews to Israel. </sentence><sentence id="1415">So a lot of his friends came -- </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1416">Q: Right. </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1417">A: -- to Israel. </sentence><sentence id="1418">It would have been a -- much more difficult for him and for his family to acclimate to a life in the United States. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1463">A: Well, actually he never really wanted to discuss his life in the ghetto, or his life in Dachau. </sentence><sentence id="1464">He did tell me about Dachau that when the Americans were nearing Dachau that the Germans decided to vacate the camp, and they decided to march them east. </sentence><sentence id="1465">And he tells me the story that while they were marching in the -- through the woods, and his feet, he -- were bleeding, he was exhausted, and he tells me that he couldn't take it any more and he and a friend of his decided to fall to the ground, and whatever it is, it is. </sentence><sentence id="1466">And he tells me the story about this German soldier that came across him and said to his friend, don't waste a bullet on him, he is dead. </sentence><sentence id="1467">And so they passed by and he then wi -- with his friend, ran to find food or shelter, or whatever. </sentence><sentence id="1468">And they came across a farm and when they knocked on the door, the Germans were frightened obviously and they said wa -- all we want is some food and -- and some water, whatever. </sentence><sentence id="1469">And the Germans said, we don't have any food, but the American army is across on that river, and if you cross that bridge, y-you'll find the American army and they will be able to help you. </sentence><sentence id="1470">And you better hurry up because the bridge is going to be blown up. </sentence><sentence id="1471">So with whatever strength he and his friend had, they ran across the river and no sooner did they get to the other side of the river, the bridge blew up. </sentence><sentence id="1472">But by that time they were on the side where the Americans were, and so they received food, shelter and so forth from the American army. </sentence></p></dialogue>
