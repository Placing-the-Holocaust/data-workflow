</sentence><sentence id="1066">To this town called Vila Formosa, which is also I remember it pretty clear because for two items. </sentence><sentence id="1067">I write about one of them. </sentence><sentence id="1068">One is that we didn't go to school there. </sentence><sentence id="1069">But we played a lot with each other. </sentence><sentence id="1070">And with a couple of other Luxembourg kids named Monique and Roger. </sentence><sentence id="1071">I still remember the names. </sentence><sentence id="1072">They were the children of very wealthy Luxembourg store owners who also had become refugees. </sentence><sentence id="1073">And so we met them there and we spent a lot of time palling around. </sentence><sentence id="1074">And I remember this town stored cork boards. </sentence><sentence id="1075">Portugal is a cork producer and they were 20 feet high and we would bounce around among them. </sentence><sentence id="1076">It was very innocent play, I still remember those. </sentence><sentence id="1077">The other thing that I remember is that at one time, a British sailor came into the town. </sentence><sentence id="1078">And I remember he had a blue pea jacket and he had his boat had been sunk somewhere. </sentence><sentence id="1079">And he had made his way from Spain to Portugal hoping to go actually to Lisbon to sail back to England, get back. </sentence><sentence id="1080">And he sort of took us under his wing and my sister and I maybe some of the other, went with him. </sentence><sentence id="1081">We walked around. </sentence><sentence id="1082">And at that time I was obsessed with getting a sling shot. </sentence><sentence id="1083">I guess it was sort of David and Goliath. </sentence><sentence id="1084">And I had, the interesting thing is that I found the fork, a piece of wood that could serve as a fork and I had a rubber band which I could use to tie. </sentence><sentence id="1085">But I didn't have a little piece of leather that you could use for putting a stone in when you -- and I mentioned this to this guy. </sentence><sentence id="1086">And I'll never forget what he did. </sentence><sentence id="1087">He had a pocket knife because it's one of the things he saved. </sentence><sentence id="1088">And he bent down and unlaced one of his shoes and he cut off the tongue and he gave it to me to use as a-- I think I wrote an essay once but I never finished it called a gift of tongue about this. </sentence><sentence id="1089">I didn't know his name so I lost sight of him. </sentence><sentence id="1090">There are others, these things that you remember. </sentence><sentence id="1091">So anyway, eventually we got to, we were allowed to go to Porto, Oporto, which is the second biggest city in. </sentence><sentence id="1092">We were not allowed to get to go to Lisbon but we somehow were allowed to leave Vila Formosa after about four months. </sentence><sentence id="1093">And we spent four or five months in Oporto and that was memorable for various reasons. </sentence><sentence id="1094">One of them was that I became more aware of women  https://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection Interview with Joseph Sucher 26 July 23, 2014 or girls will I say and I fell in love with Olivia De Havilland for a peculiar reason. </sentence><sentence id="1095">Somehow, I guess we were pretty cute kids and the owner of one of the restaurants not far from where we lived, knew we would like to go to the movies and he arranged for waiters to take us, Erika and me and two blond girls who also lived in the same building with us. </sentence><sentence id="1096">We would come every Saturday or something like that, to this Plaza de la Libertad, that was the name of it. </sentence><sentence id="1097">And we would got to his restaurant and the guy would send a waiter with us and we could go to any movie that we wanted to. </sentence><sentence id="1098">So we went to the movies as often as we could. </sentence><sentence id="1099">Although we didn't understand the language, a lot of it, I didn't realize til much later I was living in a fool's paradise, cause they were showing Superman, Batman, a lot of the American serials. </sentence><sentence id="1100">But we saw them as a continuous movie. </sentence><sentence id="1101">I didn't realize that when we came to the States I realized they had the same stuff but only got 15 minutes so there was an explosion and you come back the next week to see the rest of it. </sentence><sentence id="1102">But we saw all these movies and we also saw Robin Hood. </sentence><sentence id="1103">And there was Olivia De Havilland with her long tail and so I fell in love with her. </sentence><sentence id="1104">I'm sure I'm not the first one with Olivia De Havilland. </sentence><sentence id="1105">But I knew that we wanted to get to Lisbon because that's where the boats left from. </sentence><sentence id="1106">And eventually we got permission to go to Lisbon. </sentence><sentence id="1107">It took us about -- my father would go to the consulate every week and so forth and there are all these jokes about that. </sentence><sentence id="1108">You go to the consulate trying to get a visa and so forth, and you have to have an affidavit, all very complicated but the stories of the guy who goes to the consulate and they, you tell him well come back a year from now. </sentence><sentence id="1109">And they guy is very excited, morning or afternoon. </sentence><sentence id="1110">You know this joke. </sentence><sentence id="1111">Anyway that's the kind of -- garde humor, that means sort of hangman's humor. </sentence><sentence id="1112">Anyway so we eventually got this, well we eventually got an affidavit from some not so rich relatives in Milwaukee. </sentence><sentence id="1113">You needed an affidavit to come to the States. </sentence><sentence id="1114">And we had some very rich distant relatives in Kingston, New York but we never got anything from them, but anyway somebody, my cousin's grandmother who lived in Chicago persuaded -- her daughter was married to a furrier named Bine and he sent us an affidavit so when we came to America eventually we went to Milwaukee, cause my mother could sew very well and he needed a finisher for his furs. </sentence><sentence id="1115">Anyway that's how we wound up in Milwaukee for a while. </sentence><sentence id="1116">Yes, apropos of getting on the boat in Lisbon. </sentence><sentence id="1117">Many years later there was a PBS program about the difficulties Jews had getting out of Europe and how hundreds of thousands more could have come if it weren't for the

</sentence><sentence id="1122">And the place he was most insistent about was the one in Portugal, because that's where most, by that time, most people who were trying to get to the States were coming from Portugal. </sentence><sentence id="1123">I've forgotten his name but I look it up every once in a while. </sentence><sentence id="1124">His name was Eagleton or something like that.
