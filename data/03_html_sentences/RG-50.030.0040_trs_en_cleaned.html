<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1294">A: We live in barracks and every day, I don't know what time it was, but was usually dark...we marched...that was the guard was helping me. </sentence><sentence id="1295">He would be walking beside me, put a piece of bread in my pocket. </sentence><sentence id="1296">A lot of time was dried out, but it was terrific. </sentence><sentence id="1297">I mean you was starved. </sentence><sentence id="1298">You know what I mean? </sentence><sentence id="1299">And we walk every morning to the factory. </sentence><sentence id="1300">I don't know how far. </sentence><sentence id="1301">It took awhile and at night we walked back, and before you do anything, they were always counting the prisoners, you know. </sentence><sentence id="1302">They say: "Antreten! </sentence><sentence id="1303">One, two, three..." And even the dead ones had to lay dead to make the figure going. </sentence><sentence id="1304">And we came to the factory, and then we get like 30 minutes or 5 minutes break. </sentence><sentence id="1305">And we fall asleep instantly and then we get up, run to the machines. </sentence><sentence id="1306">And the toilets were outside. </sentence><sentence id="1307">That was the scariest part, to go out in the dark. </sentence><sentence id="1308">First you didn't know if somebody was inside, was completely dark. </sentence><sentence id="1309">Sometimes you just open the door, and you do it, and somebody scream, hey you did it my face, you know, and you run in the dark, and that was a every day situation, and, uh, food was any better than anybody else's you know. </sentence><sentence id="1310">They were giving the same garbage to eat. </sentence><sentence id="1311">And I don't remember we have any day we didn't work really. </sentence><sentence id="1312">I couldn't recall. </sentence><sentence id="1313">And, uh, a lot of time, they wake us in the middle of the night, and the start beating everybody, like somebody did something, you know. </sentence><sentence id="1314">We had to watch hanging, you know. </sentence><sentence id="1315">And that went pretty quick day by day, the same situation, and you felt yourself fortunate that you were working inside because people were in the snow and everyday you see the dead. </sentence><sentence id="1316">People were dragged around and put ont he wagon and taken away, you know. </sentence><sentence id="1317">If you were sick, you didn't get any help, but I suppose you want to come to the end of that episode. </sentence><sentence id="1318">One day, the Russians start coming and we get evacuated, but before we do, we had to make the place spic and span. </sentence><sentence id="1319">You had to clean everything, because the Russians wouldn't think much of the Germans if we leave that behind as you know, so we had to clean it up. </sentence><sentence id="1320">Shine it up! </sentence><sentence id="1321">And then march us to a railroad station, and we like cattle. </sentence><sentence id="1322">It was very cold. </sentence><sentence id="1323">I think it was in January. </sentence><sentence id="1324">It was very cold, and they left us all outside and they were inside. </sentence><sentence id="1325">And you know, you might have a stove one time when you take a chicken like a piece of chalk and go across her bill and she going to stay there. </sentence><sentence id="1326">She thinks she's tied down and it was the same situation. </sentence><sentence id="1327">We could get up and run, all of us. </sentence><sentence id="1328">Of course, they probably machine gun us. </sentence><sentence id="1329">But the guards, everything went inside because it was cold. </sentence><sentence id="1330">We just, you know, prisoners just get together like chickens and just holding on to each other. </sentence><sentence id="1331">And finally we took off and I don't know...it's kind of...I started developing typhus fever and, which came on on me, and we were like partial on trucks and on trains and eventually we were marching. </sentence><sentence id="1332">And anybody couldn't walk, they take him under a tree and bingo. </sentence><sentence id="1333">And people started disappearing a little bit. </sentence><sentence id="1334">Because the Russians were getting close. </sentence><sentence id="1335">Sometime you heard explosions, and cannons from far away, and air raids; and we were laying on the ground when there were air raids. </sentence><sentence id="1336">And we marched. </sentence><sentence id="1337">And I remember like a woman was walking with a bucket to the barn for pigs. </sentence><sentence id="1338">You know, they put bread and all leftovers. </sentence><sentence id="1339">And she walked a little too close to our column, and a couple prisoners jumped and knocked her down. </sentence><sentence id="1340">And everybody got in on the top, eating from the ground. </sentence><sentence id="1341">We were terribly hungry. </sentence><sentence id="1342">We were out. </sentence><sentence id="1343">And the guards were hitting us with the guns. </sentence><sentence id="1344">And then several of them...I think some guards escaped. </sentence><sentence id="1345">Well, finally...I forgot what transportation was used or how we did it. </sentence><sentence id="1346">I think we got somewhere to Mauthausen, or Gusen." </sentence><sentence id="1347">I told you I was going bad from typhus. </sentence><sentence id="1348">And one remarkable thing over there was that when "Antreten," when everybody lines up and some guys came--they were wearing German uniforms, but they were prisoners. </sentence><sentence id="1349">But they didn't have any insignias or anything. </sentence><sentence id="1350">And they say, "All the kapos, come out." </sentence><sentence id="1351">You know what a Kapo was. </sentence><sentence id="1352">So they figured they going to get a new position; so they all lined up outside. </sentence><sentence id="1353">Said, "Take then first one." </sentence><sentence id="1354">He said, "Did he beat on anybody, or did he ever hurt anybody?" </sentence><sentence id="1355">So nobody say nothing funny. </sentence><sentence id="1356">While we were...at one camp, I think, Dresden-Bariza--oh, that's camp I forgot--we came from the factory from work one night...one morning, and we were infestated by louse. </sentence><sentence id="1357">So they got big barrels of some kind of chemicals. </sentence><sentence id="1358">We all have to take our clothes off and dip them in there. </sentence><sentence id="1359">And then they wouldn't let us in the building, because we were wet. </sentence><sentence id="1360">So we...everybody tied on the clothes; and we run around to try and dry it out. </sentence><sentence id="1361">Because the guards would not let you in while you wait. </sentence><sentence id="1362">And here it's January...is snow on the ground. </sentence><sentence id="1363">And now and then, they were playing around. </sentence><sentence id="1364">And this boy's father...I don't know, he was a little clumsy. </sentence><sentence id="1365">So they told him to get in a barrel, and the guy put the arm around him and smoke a cigarette and wait until the guy die. </sentence><sentence id="1366">They killed him in the barrel. </sentence><sentence id="1367">So his son was young. </sentence><sentence id="1368">He come out and he say, "He killed my father!" </sentence><sentence id="1369">So the guard tell them, "Beat him up!" </sentence><sentence id="1370">So he beats him up. </sentence><sentence id="1371">He said, "Anybody want to help him?" </sentence><sentence id="1372">So they open up...he said, "This guy mistreat me, officer." </sentence><sentence id="1373">And all the Kapos were beaten by the prisoners. </sentence><sentence id="1374">One guy, he had his head split four times. </sentence><sentence id="1375">I swear, you can see it this way and that way--four splits. </sentence><sentence id="1376">And bunch of them die. </sentence><sentence id="1377">And in the morning, one got common sick. " </sentence><sentence id="1378">Could somebody help me?" </sentence><sentence id="1379">Said, "Oh, the dead ones. </sentence><sentence id="1380">Hang him in the toilet."" </sentence><sentence id="1381">We tell the Germans that he hang himself during the night.(Laughing) And they put him out. </sentence><sentence id="1382">We were surprised when they put him; and uh they said that they hang themselves. </sentence><sentence id="1383">That happened in the Mauthausen. </sentence><sentence id="1384">But now before we got there, I think...I forgot the order of things, I had to read it myself now. </sentence><sentence id="1385">It's been many years. </sentence><sentence id="1386">We were [in] Gusen. </sentence><sentence id="1387">And look like we came in and everybody over there was naked, because they got some typhus or something. </sentence><sentence id="1388">And so they took everybody's clothes away. </sentence><sentence id="1389">And they also kill a few people there, because their rations were very little. </sentence><sentence id="1390">So they were going by the morning count them; and after they deducted dead people, they say, "75 in this room, save 75 portions of bread." </sentence><sentence id="1391">So what the Kapos did: they went in the washroom and see somebody weak or something, they killed them. </sentence><sentence id="1392">Hold their nose and waited until he died. </sentence><sentence id="1393">So they got extra bread. </sentence><sentence id="1394">It's kind of sad, isn't it? </sentence><sentence id="1395">But that's what actually happened. </sentence><sentence id="1396">And uh uh then, of course, we were at Mauthausen... </sentence></p></dialogue>
