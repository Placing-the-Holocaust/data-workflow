<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="112">Q: Were you scared by this? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="114">A: Not -- Not random, oh, I don't know, maybe. </sentence><sentence id="115">You know, but I remember it only -- recollect it only because of the fact that the father has such strange answers. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="118">Q: Right. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="120">A: That was it. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="122">Q: When you went back home, I mean when he -- when you asked him there, you know, why isn't there a fire truck stopping this, and he tells you to be quiet, was there any talk when you went back home? </sentence><sentence id="123">None? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="126">A: No, wouldn't talk about that. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="128">Q: No, huh? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="130">A: Yep. </sentence><sentence id="131">We got the feeling that he didn't want to talk about it. </sentence><sentence id="132">He wouldn't talk about any politics at home. </sentence><sentence id="133">Certainly he had some contact to some representatives to the resistance movement, with one of the advisors of William Loishner, the [indecipherable] board visit  him regularly. </sentence><sentence id="134">And we got aware only of the fact that he left the house, he didn't receive th -- him in the house, and -- and everything was very secret, and -- and by that th-the kids got afraid there was something happening, and in [indecipherable] that was his conduct. </sentence><sentence id="135">And once, you know, I just picked up a sentence that was quite symptomatic, in German, that ronteheron in Berlin with an auchnie pas etou and so on. </sentence><sentence id="136">That means the people in the ministry down there wouldn't do either, you know. </sentence><sentence id="137">And certainly that reflected the situation as the German resistance, that they couldn't, in a way, use the governmental institutions to raise a resistance, because everything was Nazified, or -- or the administration was without any influence because the Nazi party had a -- a -- a bypass, or surpass them. </sentence><sentence id="138">That was the situation, but this is also a later [indecipherable] and a potential. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="148">Q: Right. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="150">A: And the other thing I remember were the -- two things I remember o-of the Nazi period. </sentence><sentence id="151">One is that it has a vidi -- visit of the famous historian, Freidich Meineker, who was known for his distance precision versus the Nazi regime. </sentence><sentence id="152">But he visited us in the summer of 1941. </sentence><sentence id="153">Then the German troops had conquered the Aprole, that was highest mountain in the Carpathors. </sentence><sentence id="154">And after Meineker had left, Sunday the father said, "Ee, Meineker's proud of that." </sentence><sentence id="155">We couldn't get to that, you know. </sentence><sentence id="156">But cernly all the money was owned in some respects, nationalist that -- although he criticized the regime, on the other hand, he was proud of the merit of the German troops, while my father, as an also World War One officer, all the time was deeply skeptical of what was going on in the Soviet Union, because he could not believe that this would end other than in a defeat. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="164">Q: Your dad was not a member of the party? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="166">A: He was a member of the party, he was -- </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="168">Q: He was? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="170">A: -- in 1940, he got a -- the -- the pressure of the district leader Karvitski that he should end the party, and then he was taken into the party, but pre-dated to 1937, but he, in a way, he came very late to the party. </sentence><sentence id="171">But you know, the party membership, as such, hasn't much meaning about what the people really thought of. </sentence><sentence id="172">And we have a lot of nominal members in that time. </sentence><sentence id="173">He had some problem, because he was a liberal historian, in the one paid he was a democrat, and in the -- 1943, he suddenly got some pressure that he would have to leave that university and -- and it was very difficult round then, there were somehow people in the education ministry in Berlin, who helped him, by that he could preserve his chair. </sentence><sentence id="174">But he lost the periodical he was editing and he -- his -- it was a ri -- way politically minored, and he would have liktus every day of that, everything was gone, and by that, he was in a bit di-difficult position, but he tried to adapt himself to a certain extent. </sentence><sentence id="175">Certainly that is what raise him to manifold that group who was not really conservative. </sentence><sentence id="176">And er -- which on the other hand, you know, lost the confidence in the  restoration, or the continuation of the parliamentary democ -- democratic system. </sentence><sentence id="177">There was some disorientation. </sentence><sentence id="178">Certainly, he was strongly directed against the prevailing tendency of the so called Reich mythology, and he still was very strong in pressing for the importance of the Bismark in tradition, so that that was a little bit directed against the great German tendencies. </sentence><sentence id="179">And so far he had a peculiar position, but he was -- he was not really a member of the opposition. </sentence><sentence id="180">He was in the midst between the camps, I think. </sentence><sentence id="181">And in a way he also had to fear that he got political pressure again, as it happened then, in 1944, I'll never forget then the famous Gunter Franzel was the historian for the peasants who were in the Third Reich, came from Strassburg. </sentence><sentence id="182">Strassburg had been lost, and now we were sitting at Marburg. </sentence><sentence id="183">So they had, years ago, a while been SS, and now my father's and -- said that he was just as helm, and I -- I never forget that the father was way, way for -- fearful that they wanted to get his chair. </sentence><sentence id="184">It looked like they had, you know. </sentence><sentence id="185">And then I met the same Franzel five months later, after the break down of the regime, you know, in another uniform, and a -- the way, free, different type, you know there you see the change. </sentence><sentence id="186">I never forgot that, you know. </sentence><sentence id="187">And so far, I think the position of my father's was a bit precarious, but he was now a hero. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="206">Q: And your -- your two older brothers, were they brought into the army in deg39, or later? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="208">A: Well, my o-oldest brother, certainly he was brought into the army with 18, and then he served all the time, first in -- in the eastern front, and then in Africa, but he -- fortunately he didn't get to northern Africa because there end of the main -- because then -- there was everything finished. </sentence><sentence id="209">And then he went back to the Soviet Union, and he survived in a way because he -- in April 1947, fled, and swam through the er -- Oude river in order to get into the hands of the Americans. </sentence><sentence id="210">That was that story. </sentence><sentence id="211">So the -- he had the pressure 0 -- you know, of being all the time a soldier at the front, and he was also ma -- sa -- two times wounded, and so on. </sentence><sentence id="212">That way, typical war -- war age cahount. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="218">Q: Right. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="220">A: And the younger one, he went in -- first was what you call in German fleckhaffer, that means he had to -- to serve as a suen in the entire air company, and then later on, he also got soldier, and -- but he was younger, and in a way -- he didn't get to the Soviet Union, but to France. </sentence><sentence id="221">And you know, that's a really strange story, because when he went back to Schlevig Kolchda, that's in the north of Germany, that was a region where still the great Admiral Doernitz had his. </sentence><sentence id="222">And there they dwell for two or three weeks, they preserved as independent military units, and what is fairly not known, that they had that, what one calls in German, Ate tu exetsianser. </sentence><sentence id="223">Exercise the great thing, Heil Doenitz. </sentence><sentence id="224">You know that Doenitz wanted to continue, instead of having the Heil Hitler, they now should use a Heil Doenitz, and that was -- is almost unbelievable. </sentence><sentence id="225">And then he came home with everything one wanted to have, because I know there was a lot of foot stuff. </sentence><sentence id="226">And [indecipherable] over there at that time, while the other came in American -- ga -- custody. </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="227">Q: Uh-huh. </sentence><sentence id="228">Tell me about school during this period, when you started going to school. </sentence><sentence id="229">I know you have no comparison, because you go to school, and it's in -- within the context of the National Socialism, but what was it like? </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="230">A: But it's strange, you know, the school was called Adolf Hitler school. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="232">Q: Really? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="234">A: Got the name after 1933. </sentence><sentence id="235">About the time I take -- round that gymnasium -- in Germany we'd say gymnasium, that was the second day of school, you know. </sentence><sentence id="236">It was one of the -- not of the old k -- gymnasium, which have Latin and Greek in the center of the lessons, but they had modern languages, that was something, and mod -- more modern type of the German secondary school. </sentence><sentence id="237">And the -- the man who was running that, the director, he was definitely non -- a non-Nazi, that's quite clear. </sentence><sentence id="238">And he tried to avoid too much in indoctrination in that time. </sentence><sentence id="239">And I have the personal experience, I always warn people to overestimate the decree of ideological indoctrination a -- during the Nazi period. </sentence><sentence id="240">You know, that was very strong in the years after 1935, but later on, it was really German, Nationalists certainly, it was -- it was not liberal, it was not democratic. </sentence><sentence id="241">But I can't remember that there was any talk about -- about race, and racial ideology or so -- th-that would play a big role, and I remember it in the later war years, we had then a specific Nazi teacher, who came with a brown uniform, and so we had a [indecipherable] start, you know. </sentence><sentence id="242">It was not a -- the experience which then occurred after, in 1944. </sentence><sentence id="243">It's because they had the same men, and also after [indecipherable] and they had a way bad life, you can -- and that was, you know, not a serious type, he was way d -- he was, I think, really different from the other professors, you know? </sentence><sentence id="244">And it -- so far, I can't remember that there was a specific Nazi indoctrination in the school. </sentence><sentence id="245">Certainly some, you know, and well, you would have the -- the typical school pil -- festivals or something, but I can't remember that we were sitting together to listen to the Hitler speech or something. </sentence><sentence id="246">Maybe that happened, but it was not very significant, I think. </sentence><sentence id="247">And as a historian, I add on the commentary, that after 1935, Goebbels in the way, certainly the propaganda on the one hand was very rapidly and tr -- especially in the Jewish case, but there was also some deportization of the whole system be -- if the citizens remained loyal, everything was not -- and -- and so far, I think the school was not too much Nazified. </sentence><sentence id="248">And there was not too much change after -- in the teacher staff, after 1945, and certainly in 1944, we got a little bit more aware of the politic conditions and so on, but there was not much talk, and every f -- thing -- you had to be very busy all the time, and certainly we are -- spent every Sunday to have collecting this or that in the service, or the Deutsch yungfolk, the youth organization of the hi -- of the Hitler youth, or later on even in the Hitler youth. </sentence><sentence id="249">I th -- I think, well usually when people think the whole time is a time of interconnection, it's not so much. </sentence><sentence id="250">At least I didn't understand anything about the Jewish question before the war was over, then I learned a little bit about it before the -- I was very naive in that way, you know. </sentence><sentence id="251">So they -- we -- the difference was that the father wouldn't talk about politics at all, you know? </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="252">Q: Right, right. </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="253">A: And that's what I have to say to the school. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="255">Q: You know, in the -- in the museum we have, on the fourth floor, this thing about the school, and we show something about "The Poisonous Mushroom." </sentence><sentence id="256">Do you ever remember reading that book, or books like it? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="259">A: No. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="261">Q: No. </sentence><sentence id="262">So this was not so typical. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="265">A: Se-Serious school teachers wouldn't use that. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="267">Q: Yeah. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="269">A: But that's a problem you know where i-it's a -- now, and there's a lot of tendency in the research to start it at -- but when should we weigh causes, you know. </sentence><sentence id="270">These things were very tedious. </sentence><sentence id="271">I can only tell my experience with it -- </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="275">Q: Right. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="277">A: -- with the Deutsch yungfolk, you know, so the -- </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="279">Q: Yes, please do. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="281">A: We had to go into the Deutsch yungfolk when we were 10, and I was in the Deutsch yungfolk from the age of 10 to the age of 14. </sentence><sentence id="282">And so that we were living in specifics quarter at Marburg, and there was something like the academic elite there, but that our -- our [indecipherable] some unit of the yungfolk, you know, had a lot of intellectuals, and you know, it's quite good. </sentence><sentence id="283">We had a library and I wa -- the -- Wolfgang, my twin brother and I, had to run the library, the fanela library, and had a lot of books, but you know, what did it guys lend out. </sentence><sentence id="284">So they lend out calimai, and technical literature. </sentence><sentence id="285">There's no universum literature dealing with a technical future, and something like that. </sentence><sentence id="286">They wouldn't read anything which is related to Nazi ideology, that was quite symptomatic. </sentence><sentence id="287">And you know, if you have to run a -- a youth group, you know, and you have to take one evening in the week, you know, which should -- what the Germans call that heimarm, that means, I have some program, you know. </sentence><sentence id="288">The pr -- The Nazi ideology is very poor, and after awhile it's very difficult to do something, and by that, you know, it was a little bit, you know, they had very different topics, but in Farenow, the specific ideological issues were not debated very much. </sentence><sentence id="289">So the e -- went -- there was criticism against it, but it wasn't -- it -- it was not so much in the minds, I think, of the people as -- from the -- from hindsight, one per -- would believe, if he looks at the specific literature. </sentence><sentence id="290">And I want to add one experience that then, in 1944, late in 1944, we were assembled and to be taken  over to the Hitler youth, that is the organization of the 14 to 18 old boys, and they had to swear the oath on Adolf Hitler. </sentence><sentence id="291">It -- The whole thing happened within the inner circle of the marble castle. </sentence><sentence id="292">And there were about 1200 boys, and we're way much packed. </sentence><sentence id="293">But the whole thing was a little bits disturbed, because there were two lightnings, and there was - - we -- we -- we would have preferred to go, you know, in it so far. </sentence><sentence id="294">In 1944 there was no much chance to indoctrinate people any longer. </sentence><sentence id="295">And -- But that's on -- all of my experience I had. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="311">Q: And in your sense, at least in the world in which you traveled, was that while people were not necessarily going to resist the Nazis, and the regime. </sentence><sentence id="312">They were not necessarily believing. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="315">A: Well, that's ish -- they were -- just to -- in the middle of that, you know. </sentence><sentence id="316">And do you know what was the problem with only if you wanted to -- to decide for assistance and -- there was some identity between the nation and the personality of Hitler, it was quite difficult for -- for I think ordinary people, you know, where you can say -- members of the elite, that's different, or Conservatives, or even Communists, that's different. </sentence><sentence id="317">But the ordinary people, what should they do, just you know, the -- the -- the -- the gentleman, tentative was, they criticize all the time the regime, and Goebbels and Himmler, and everybody, but would exempt Hitler from that. </sentence><sentence id="318">So they had a split consciousness, and you have that famous sentence, "Ven dusta fuhrer wusta," "If Hitler would know that, then it wouldn't happen," you know. </sentence><sentence id="319">And certainly that was a psychological mechanism, because you can't easily revolt against your own nation. </sentence><sentence id="320">And so far, Hitler was taken from out of that criticism, while certainly all the soldiers would say, after the war, then we will change the regime. </sentence><sentence id="321">And that was the other side of the other interrogations of German prisoners of war by the Americans. </sentence><sentence id="322">You know, we have a lot of material for that. </sentence><sentence id="323">You see, I am not a very good eye witness, you know. </sentence><sentence id="324">A historian usually -- </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="335">Q: Is not, right? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="337">A: -- reflects his own experience too much. </sentence><sentence id="338">No. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="341">Q: Yeah, was it hard during the war? </sentence><sentence id="342">Did you ha -- </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="345">A: Well, we had a good life because we are living a little town at Marburg. </sentence><sentence id="346">There was some air attacks, but not many. </sentence><sentence id="347">I never forget that I also was caring, and to help people, and if somebody wouldn't have taken me and -- and -- and thrown me back, then I would have not survived, and so on. </sentence><sentence id="348">And -- But in general, I think the conditions at Marburg were not too -- too bad, while certainly in the big cities, where you have the wide air raids, it must have been very problematic, you know. </sentence><sentence id="349">And especially in the last ter -- months of the war. </sentence><sentence id="350">I never forget when the Americans attacked the city of Giessen, that's just 30 kilometers away. </sentence><sentence id="351">That was in the night at three. </sentence><sentence id="352">And we were -- had a house with a good looking -- you could looks out a little bit on the -- on the hill. </sentence><sentence id="353">We could read on the balcony. </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="354">Q: Really? </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="355">A: Then Giessen was burning, we could read on the balcony, 30 kilometers away. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="407">A: Historians make bad witness because they put everything only the -- in history in perspective, and what you need is -- and what a historian needs if he is working with historical witnesses, that they just recollect immediately, which I hadn -- you have to get them bef -- and we have the re -- in the situation, to ask them the first time. </sentence><sentence id="408">And I am -- so a little bit ca -- or we could -- you can say afterwards, you have to shoot them, because it's quite clear that they would change an opinion, and have a -- you know, th -- that experience with the expiration of a ristock fire, where all the witnesses would change their opinion if they were in favor of a Communist, or of a National Socialist background, doesn't matter. </sentence><sentence id="409">The witness who told in 1933 that and that, they would tell them the opposite in -- after 1945, and the -- the other way around. </sentence><sentence id="410">It's very interesting, and I -- I had a way -- it was we -- when I had to study on the Volkswagen company in the Third Reich, and I had a good contact to the former -- former man of the management, who was responsible for the accunt -- commercial ex -- aspects. </sentence><sentence id="411">And I asked him, why are they put in Jewesses in the work to do to -- could use some pasokas because that was certainly not very important, and especially -- certainly they -- it was now pr-profiteering motivation [indecipherable] you know. </sentence><sentence id="412">First he immediately sa -- spontaneously answered, "Because we had to fill the capacity." </sentence><sentence id="413">A week later, or two, he called me and said he wanted talk about me, and now he added [indecipherable] of second day liberations, why that was there, but he never had reflected that the most interesting thing is when the -- th -- over 50 years, never had reflected that the occupied Jewish concentration camp inmates in the c-company. </sentence><sentence id="414">You know that, I think, was the most interesting. </sentence><sentence id="415">And then he got the original motive, that he didn't think that it just put in whom they got, in order to fill the capacity, not to lose anything of the capacity for -- well, possibly a later peace production. </sentence><sentence id="416">It was so primitive, that was it. </sentence><sentence id="417">This is one of the cases where I got him at a situation where he didn't reflect it, and then he told the truth. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="463">A: You know? </sentence><sentence id="464">And this has -- had, I think, left an imprint on me, and cer-certainly may be somewhat responsible for my lack of accepting authority, and being very nervous if I got the authority [indecipherable] conditions. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="467">Q: And wha-what do you think made those people do that, the plundering, at the end? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="469">A: Well, you know, besides all -- as you know, far more important than any Nazi indoctrination was the terrible loss of -- of moral radius, something like a -- a -- people got accustomed to moral indifference. </sentence><sentence id="470">And all these radius were gone undone, there were no longer norms, and by that, you have then this certain de-decay of a civilization. </sentence><sentence id="471">Certainly if you look at the Jewish question, you have that very clear, you know, it's the same thing. </sentence><sentence id="472">And there is also, I think the [indecipherable] not only anti-Semitic indoctrination, but it's, you know, a mentality where people just do what is in their --  their primary interest, and where we have something like an amoral vitality. </sentence><sentence id="473">And I always grow the -- the famous atrons of -- of Hannibal James Homerker, the leader of the German resistance group, the so-called crisis [indecipherable] who said the foremost talk of the resistance is to restore to picture of man in the hearts of our fellow citizens, in order just to -- to come back to something like a civilized society, so the -- the extreme decay of all radius, of all habits, and so on, and -- we-well we had something like more anarchy. </sentence><sentence id="474">This is very important. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="481">Q: Did that affect you? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="483">A: Yes, certainly. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="489">Q: Right. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="491">A: We were in that -- in that respect, I think psychologically alone. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="495">A: Psychologically alone. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="497">Q: Oh. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="499">A: Without -- Without guidance. </sentence><sentence id="500">Who could at -- help us? </sentence><sentence id="501">Also, we had to li -- also, when we learned what was happening, we had some distance to the -- to the parents, too, you know. </sentence><sentence id="502">The whole peer generation was just without any -- we didn't have any respect towards the peer generation. </sentence><sentence id="503">And that's the way it differ -- ca -- education ca -- has a -- has a certain [indecipherable] you know, it's way difficult. </sentence><sentence id="504">And to get there somebody orientation, and that made for that -- made a -- a youth career very difficult. </sentence><sentence id="505">Next -- The next generation certainly didn't have these problems any longer, because they looked, and they had economic progress, and some put -- a positive [indecipherable] and so on. </sentence><sentence id="506">But in that situation of the ultimate decay of all moral radius, and also of national radius, and up, the Germans of that time, certainly was completely a national, and without any engagement, and a famous mentality as -- that's like signified by the word onimish. </sentence><sentence id="507">That means, without my participation, and no, they wouldn't engage themselves. </sentence><sentence id="508">They were totally isolated people. </sentence><sentence id="509">And this situation, I think, is what youngsters, I think, are quite -- quite exceptional, and quite important. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="521">Q: Mm-hm. </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="522">A: I think it had a negative impact, insofar as I -- I was -- it was difficult to adapt me to conditions, which I -- already existed, and made me in a way -- in a way a critic -- a -- a critic of traditionalism, yes, maybe. </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="523">Q: Was it equally difficult for your -- for your twin brother? </sentence><sentence id="524">There he was -- </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="537">Q: After? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="539">A: -- b-by the American re-orientation, and re-education, immediately after the war. </sentence><sentence id="540">Then it bees -- became quite clear, you know? </sentence><sentence id="541">Before that, they didn't really know that. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="555"> A -- the loss of the total political ori-orientation. </sentence><sentence id="556">And as historian, I was -- I add, you know, that at the time of the Nuremberg trials, the Holocaust in it's reality, wasn't really in the minds, you know. </sentence><sentence id="557">Even Americans didn't realize that this was the biggest crime by the regime, and still people like Odeelok Lobochnick could be witnesses at a -- at a trial, instead of being persecuted by themselves. </sentence><sentence id="558">You know, it's very symptomatic. </sentence><sentence id="559">But you know, step by step, that became quite clear, and certainly the -- but the -- the American films on the concentration camps, Bergen-Belsen and so on, were more known than the Holocaust, because the Holocaust was far away, you know, and the myth I think persevered, that -- that this was nothing that the German people was related to, and it took us, as historians many, many -- and you as many years to get that into the [indecipherable] where the Holocaust was not, if I went -- done by -- performed by Himmler and his chieftain. </sentence><sentence id="560">It was also a lot of people involved. </sentence><sentence id="561">But I don't know, maybe the -- you're a bit more, but I re-recollect, you know, that -- you know there -- these typical anti-sem -- anti-Semitic songs sung in the -- in the -- in the Hitler youth, I think  we didn't realize what we were singing. </sentence><sentence id="562">And sometimes it was corrected , then there is one of the essentials today belongs as Germany, and -- and -- and tomorrow the whole world, you know, it was corrected, and it will say that it's only today will be -- will be heard by Germany, and tomorrow by the whole world, you know. </sentence><sentence id="563">Some of these guys in my hired entourage, they thought that this couldn't be -- couldn't be really real, and by that they changed that you know, that's certainly exceptional. </sentence><sentence id="564">But that also shows -- show now, as a historian, I've learned that, you know, people do not reflect too much the [indecipherable]. </sentence><sentence id="565">If they would, you know, the main problem of the Third Reich is that the Third Reich was successful in preventing the people to have any time and leisure, in order to reflect. </sentence><sentence id="566">If they would have had the possibility, then I think that -- I think the whole thing would be proten down. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="579">Q: That's interesting. </sentence><sentence id="580">You think that was on purpose, the way in which the -- </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="583">A: Well, it was not so much on purpose, but it was a -- was a mentality of the party. </sentence><sentence id="584">You know, if you have such an organization which relies on continuous dynamics, you know, and they have a feeling, if there is no longer any dynamic, then there's nothing left, you know. </sentence><sentence id="585">And I run all this theory that there is a -- a connection between the Munich agreement, which meant that Hitler couldn't have his little war against Besarakia, and the party we have forgotten, stood on alert all the time, well -- because they just thought they would have a per -- a permanent role in the war later on, that it was dropped anyhow. </sentence><sentence id="586">And the Reich's Crystal Night. </sentence><sentence id="587">Because, exactly at a moment then, the German people believe now we c -- got a bit more quiet situation, and the peace is -- is rescued and so on. </sentence><sentence id="588">Then it's like a logical reaction of the party, was to push the Jewish question ahead. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="595">Q: Mm. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="597">A: There's a psychologic connection bet -- between both events. </sentence><sentence id="598">You have a radical assession especially in situations in which otherwise, that would happen -- who would come into being a stable, political situation. </sentence><sentence id="599">And then -- then they -- you know, their unrest, their inability to -- to wait, or something like that, could use a certainly dynamics, and the steady mobilization, and it -- so far, I think it wasn't a -- a deliberate policy, but it was a specific political style they had only learned in the 20's. </sentence><sentence id="600">That would be my theory. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="750">A: Yes, the oldest one, he was archivist, but he had a -- certainly some trouble to gain a position, because it was -- he had to study, then later on, you know, he was already rather old, and what he -- when -- he lived on his whistle, I guess. </sentence><sentence id="751">The next one got a Protestant priest. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="754">Q: Interesting. </sentence><sentence id="755">So, once you started in your reluctant career, what did you start studying? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="758">Whe -- How -- How did you move into history? </sentence><sentence id="759">What was the -- </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="760">A: Well, we -- we would study many -- in two fields, or two and a half fields in Germany, and did Communistic, and as a second field, history, and at first I was at Marburg, and the only field in history which was interesting, was Medieval history, and certainly modern history was also there. </sentence><sentence id="761">The Fritz Wagner, whom I didn't like very much, as you can imagine -- although I had examinations with him, I"! </sentence><sentence id="762">never forget it, because he was really fearful, you know. </sentence><sentence id="763">In a way he didn't -- he didn't want to make blunders in the examination. </sentence><sentence id="764">Now -- And by that I -- I got a Medievalist, and then I made my exam there. </sentence><sentence id="765">I wrote a examination paper, which I deft -- I think quite interesting besides, on the development of the region in the west of the Rhine, which is to ca -- today called the naicowanda. </sentence><sentence id="766">But that didn't fit into the theories of my professor, and he gave me only a B minus. </sentence><sentence id="767">And I decided then I'll leave that, and go to teebing, to Hans Rodefass, about that I went back to contemporary history, and certainly to the Tside cacheefta essensasencherm. </sentence><sentence id="768">That means the history of National Socialism, although I did my  dissertation work on the nationality problem in the Hapsburg monarchy, and the period between 18 -- 1867 and 1907, which was quite interesting, and certainly had a lot to do with the German Czech relations at that time. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="786">Q: Mr. Mommsen, during the break you started talking more about your own naivete. </sentence><sentence id="787">So before we go back to your career, talk -- talk a little bit about what that reflection feels like, that you were so -- you say about yourself that you were so naive about what was going on. </sentence><sentence id="788">You didn't notice. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="792">A: Well, as a youngster, you wouldn't notice so much, and we were not polit -- very political. </sentence><sentence id="793">And if you are living in a situation where -- no-nobody would talk about that, then certainly some naivete is arising. </sentence><sentence id="794">I told that I d-didn't know what Jews are, what Jewish life is, that in the post-war years there, it took me awhile to realize not only that there was the Holocaust, and the Jewish persecution, that was easy, but -- but that Jews were interesting individuals, you know, because you have to -- we're living in a German little town, Jews would d-disappear from the city, you wouldn't know who they -- where they -- wh-where are Jews, and even those Jews who lived there we-were not discernible, and were the -- they would cut all communications to the so-called Aryan population. </sentence><sentence id="795">By that, if you grow up as a kid, Jews didn't have any arriello -- idea of what that -- that was, you know. </sentence><sentence id="796">And certainly I was told that we were su-surviving as a -- as a -- babies, because of a Jewish professor, who was a junior colleggest -- trolegest, and knew what to do with early birds, and so on, and we knew that there was a lot of Jewish colleagues, and the father told us about that, but you know, that was no all reality of the Jews -- y-you didn't know much about that. </sentence><sentence id="797">I think that was very symptomatic for my age cohorder, yeah. </sentence><sentence id="798">And that they certainly were told in the Hitler youth, there was a Jewish question something, in Moscow, or somewhere, but they never realized that it's our Jews. </sentence><sentence id="799">Certainly those people who were with the olderunder -- really understood what was going on inorise Crystal Night, and so on. </sentence><sentence id="800">They must have realized that, you know. </sentence><sentence id="801">That -- But that is also part of what I -- I mentioned earlier, of that incremental depolitization. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="841">Q: Right. </sentence><sentence id="842">But it's hard to know what's missing when it's missing. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="845">A: A chit -- you know, the whole -- the whole time, mention of Jewish life had disappeared in our minds, and now that was no longer existing. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="847">Q: I see. </sentence><sentence id="848">So, when did you come to decide that you would study the period of National Socialism? </sentence><sentence id="849">How did it happen that you decided that? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="853">A: Well, I decided on the one hand because we were influenced by Hans Roadface, who was running the -- the leading periodical, and also after I ta -- finished my Ph.D. there, I went into the Institute Ratied Catcheechta, that means the leading institute for contemporary history, in Munich. </sentence><sentence id="854">And certainly wat -- and I was primary -- primarily in that business. </sentence><sentence id="855">But think that's not all, but it's very symptomatic for our -- our ca -- generation that they just we -- were preoccupied to learn why the father generation had accepted the rule o-of Adolf Hitler you know, that was -- was a pressing issue, and therefore, many of my fellow students would also deal with -- especially the Wimayears, in order to understand the seizure of power later on, then we would enter also the second phase of the regime, after 1934, and studied that. </sentence><sentence id="856">That is, I think a typical process. </sentence><sentence id="857">And the following generation then, would look into 19" century. </sentence><sentence id="858">What are the basic reasons for the German way -- for the deformation of German politics. </sentence><sentence id="859">That was when, signified by the so-called Beedafeld school. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="867">Q: And how do you understand the -- th-the -- if -- if you could summarize the sort of historiography of what's going on in Germany, and how historians are trying to understand the Nazi era. </sentence><sentence id="868">Are there very clear demarcations as you see them, in how people are studying this, and -- </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="871">A: Well, the deka -- a lot of demarcation lines. </sentence><sentence id="872">In our first [indecipherable] you know, in the early post-war, those people who dealt with that, even in journalism, or 1-in history, certainly professional historians had a apprehension against -- to doing contemporary history, they did that on account of some sort epilaga -- epilagactic position, you know. </sentence><sentence id="873">And then they have the dichotomy between the SS state on the one hand, you know, the suppression, the police state, the apparatus, and on the other hand the German resistance, which we call the other Germany, and in the midst were also some people, but you know, this tule -- this picture was a way [indecipherable] one. </sentence><sentence id="874">And that was mixed then with the  fear of totalitarian dictatorship, and the idea of the molithic structure of the regime, and the predominant role of Adolf Hitler. </sentence><sentence id="875">That was the old position, which I think was prevailing in through the middle -- into the end of the 60's. </sentence><sentence id="876">Now there happened one change that the American government returned the captured German files in 1967. </sentence><sentence id="877">And our generation of [indecipherable] had the first time the opportunity to look really into the files, and not only in the selected documents, which we are typical for the Nuremberg trials, or living from memoirs of contemporaries and witnesses. </sentence><sentence id="878">We looked into the files, and we got a very different picture than that of the monolithic state, and so all the contradiction within a system, and that's why the -- but then developed it -- a quite different understanding of how the regime functioned then. </sentence><sentence id="879">For instance, Hans Roadface or Caldidish baha [indecipherable] older generation. </sentence><sentence id="880">And they also -- the so-called Functionalist school emerged. </sentence><sentence id="881">I belonged to the Functionalist school. </sentence><sentence id="882">I would certainly point it out that it -- it not sufficient only to look at the ideology on the one hand, and to -- to say that Hitler wrote his program down in the Mein Kampf, and then everything happened like that, it's nonsense. </sentence><sentence id="883">And that is also a apologetic element, just to put Hitler in the foreground all the time, because -- and our function was to show that the responsibility of what had happened, had to be put on broader sco -- shoulders, and that was, over there, some mechanisms of the -- the one hand, the -- the style of politics, and the perception of politics, which was specific Fascist, and a specific structure, which put Jews then what I call cumulative radicalization, which may explain the proceedings, or the -- the way Nazi policy took, and t -- that can be especially, I think shown with respect to the Jewish persecution. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="897">Q: Let me ask -- L-Let's go talk a little bit about -- </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="905">Q: -- debate. </sentence><sentence id="906">On the one had, the Intentionalist can often be considered to be Apologists, but there are many Jews, there are many victims who are very sympathetic with that view. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="909">A: Well, I know that, you know -- </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="911">Q: Right. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="913">A: -- and especially the Israelis, because certainly the Israelis also have that -- that [indecipherable] reason for that one-ness that the -- the Israelian historiography has been developed by German professors who were mainly representatives of the history of ideas. </sentence><sentence id="914">That has been continued by men like Talman, and the others, I know them, you know?And certainly also the background of the Jewish religion is very favored for history of ideas, you know. </sentence><sentence id="915">But that, yeah they have still today, problems to -- to do a simple social  history. </sentence><sentence id="916">But mainly they are -- they are working in history of ideas. </sentence><sentence id="917">Therefore, they have one bias in that direction. </sentence><sentence id="918">Secondly, you know, the strong connection between notion of the creation of the state of Israel, and the role anti-Semitism stands in the background. </sentence><sentence id="919">And so had sa -- the survivors, they have problems, I can understand that, to -- to accept what already was a conflict with Hana-ah, and to accept the trivial elements in that policy. </sentence><sentence id="920">It's very, very comprehensible that they don't want to have these very trivial elements as elements of explanation, and -- and so forth, the Functionalists have a difficult time if they talk to those people. </sentence><sentence id="921">Although we say one can't explain everything where the ideological factor, or the personal factor Hitler, and they have to put in that element of bureaucratic competition, and so on, and no -- but you know the whole -- whole controversy between Functionalists and Intentionalists is coming to an end, you know. </sentence><sentence id="922">Eruda Bower says that, and -- and sometimes Karl Hiberg would say that he is a Structuralist, and -- and what Chris Browning did in writing the [indecipherable] 101, he suddenly got a -- got a notion that it wouldn't work with the Intentionalist explanation, which he originally had, you know, I never forgot, and that was [indecipherable] debate with them, you know. </sentence><sentence id="923">At that time, he was in another camp. </sentence><sentence id="924">But today, most of the researchers in a way of taking up our Functionalist -- Functionalist elements of explanation, and everybody gets aware that Hitler was not a man who was -- had -- had that [indecipherable] personality, you know, that this was a merth, and that things are even more -- were even worse, because there are many people who -- who pushed the process, I think, atafond, and certainly this viewpoint increases a responsibility, and a moral responsibility of the nation, versus a specific Nazi perpetrators, you know. </sentence><sentence id="925">And my generation, we fought against that position, that there are only very few people besides of Himmler, and [indecipherable] Hitler, that they -- seduced, is the term. </sentence><sentence id="926">For fear they seduced the German nation, you know. </sentence><sentence id="927">That was your -- the main argument. </sentence><sentence id="928">And we started to -- just to get rid of that crazy idea, I wanted to show how that could happen, I certainly -- that was, and still is our question, how could that happen? </sentence><sentence id="929">And certainly I would argue then -- your argument -- I can't go to the next generation and say there was some stupid, crazy individual called Adolf Hitler, that's why they killed five million Jews. </sentence><sentence id="930">I don't think that this is sufficient. </sentence><sentence id="931">It seems to be real plausible, but then it's not plausible by -- because why could one man do that? </sentence><sentence id="932">And so on, we're -- in a way we have to describe the background on which Hitler could then have that function. </sentence><sentence id="933">And so far, I think in the fear -- the misunderstanding of both fronts, I think have overcome. </sentence><sentence id="934">There's just the next polarization between younger historians who want -- who would go back to some ideological explanation, said as Uri Shalbud, and the other ones who were some experience and say, well, you will have the same development as we had at -- that he originally stud-studied all the time, the Nazi [indecipherable] longer, and we got a idea that it's not so important. </sentence><sentence id="935">Certainly there was a basic anti-Jewish resentment, no question, but that there had been other mechanisms we share, what then may explain the perversion of a civilicized nation into a -- a apparatus of criminals, and that is still the problem. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="960">Q: Is -- Is the functional -- Was the functional -- I don't know, my study of history would s - - would suggest to me that this is a very odd dichotomy. </sentence><sentence id="961">I don't know of any other event where all of this -- where you have this -- is it a kind of fake dichotomy? </sentence><sentence id="962">How do you not  talk about ideas, and how do you not talk about the structure in terms of which these ideas function? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="966"> A That's okay, but you know, there is some difference. </sentence><sentence id="967">You know, the terms have been coined by Jim Mason at a conference near Lornan many years ago, when there was -- was a clear cut, I think, distinction of the -- of the explanation between something like a history of ideas, and something like social history, that's different, you know? </sentence><sentence id="968">And so far, that was also related to the explanation of the field, and certainly the whole metalogical difference wouldn't play such a big role if they wa-wouldn't have been loden with some role -- with some moral legacies, you know. </sentence><sentence id="969">Because the Germans need a strong Hitler, because if Hitler would be weak, they can't [indecipherable]. </sentence><sentence id="970">I never forgot that famous Louden conference, where there was a discussion where Hitler could preserve his rule for so long, it was very long, in a way, while he was -- I coined that formula, in some respects, a weak dictator. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="976">Q: Uh-huh. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="978">A: And certainly I wasn't tact all the time, because u -- I always thought I would defend Hitler, I didn't want to -- want to, but turn out that with the -- that the emotional element, that was very symptomatic, and then I said, really, look, if you have a dictatorship, then it's really likely that perseveres. </sentence><sentence id="979">Take Idi Amin. </sentence><sentence id="980">Oh, I was already wint by that, because that violated the chair of national pride. </sentence><sentence id="981">We want to have a strong Hitler, not Idi Amin, now that -- that shouldn't be done, you know. </sentence><sentence id="982">That's a basic background, all that, and to understand that, one has to come back to what we talked about, where the Germans would take the personality of Hitler out of the responsibility of the crimes and decay, because they preverse them -- pre-preserve them something like icon for their national identity. </sentence><sentence id="983">Now, in 1945, they certainly got aware that this was wrong. </sentence><sentence id="984">And not -- now the emotion turned against Hitler. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="992">Q: Uh-huh. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="994">A: And if then somebody like Hans Mommsen [indecipherable] the other week in Germany, Hitler was not only the subject, but also the object of politics. </sentence><sentence id="995">You get immediately a very angry criticisms, even by -- by very good historians. </sentence><sentence id="996">Karl Dietrich baha -- he immediately wrote and said, "How can you say that Hitler's objects are [indecipherable]. </sentence><sentence id="997">Well, why not, you know. </sentence><sentence id="998">If you talk that -- If you talk about that in England or America, it's not so difficult, be -- but there is a -- apologetic element, the emotional elements, which I think are guided the debate, and also the research. </sentence><sentence id="999">And that's why we have that -- that's not only a metalogic distinction, or dim -- different starting point, but they had then this controversy between Functionalists and Intentionalists. </sentence><sentence id="1000">That is certainly gone with the next generation, which doesn't have that necessity to defend in a way, indirectly, the Germans [indecipherable] pointing out the manipulative character of Nazi dictatorship and all that. </sentence><sentence id="1001">But they needed, in order to believe that they had been seduced. </sentence><sentence id="1002">Certainly the opposite was true, they made Hitler, they in turn wanted to use him certainly then Hitler  used them, you know, but that still proves with which certainly they -- nobody would reject them outright, but th-they are not very convenient. </sentence><sentence id="1003">And then so far, I think I am still not too old fashioned [indecipherable] an old historian, you know. </sentence><sentence id="1004">The next generation certainly doesn't have that problem. </sentence><sentence id="1005">They don't see also this specific constellation under which we developing contemporary history. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1018">Q: Let me ask you about a quote from your piece, and from Vimar, to Auschwitz. </sentence><sentence id="1019">You say that the Nazi system of rule completely lacked internal coherence. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1022">A: Yeah. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1024">Q: Can you explain that for our -- </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1026">A: Well, you know, there was a Sherman Oaks, one of the leading English experts in the field, and he talked about the re-organization of the party in 1932, in December 1932, immediately before the seizure of power, and he then said that from then on, they had 37 different territories, with a rather independent Gauleiter, and so far, as they can do what they want. </sentence><sentence id="1027">And you know, the problem is -- is not coordination within the system. </sentence><sentence id="1028">Everybody can act, everybody can make initiatives and so on, as far as that stays, as they accept the authority, or the prestige abi -- Adolf Hitler. </sentence><sentence id="1029">And the thing we have to do with the specific style of Nazi politics -- it's very difficult, especially for a European say, Americans are better, to understand this regime, which doesn't have any institutionalized governmental board, or some representation. </sentence><sentence id="1030">But after 1937, we don't have a cabinet, there is no political discourse between the different ministries. </sentence><sentence id="1031">We don't have that on the party side either. </sentence><sentence id="1032">There is nothing which would integrate diverging political interests, in sa -- in the -- the very diverging politic interests are then -- are brought to conflict or not, is by personal feuds. </sentence><sentence id="1033">That's the reason why everybody among the Nazi regime hates the others. </sentence><sentence id="1034">And some of the later Gauleiter would say if Hitler -- Himmler comes into my territory, my gow, I will imprison him, you know. </sentence><sentence id="1035">They hated -- They hated each other, you know. </sentence><sentence id="1036">And the whole system is built on that -- watha -- non-structure. </sentence><sentence id="1037">At the same time, you have a system of non-communication. </sentence><sentence id="1038">If you were in the high position of that regime, let's say you are the secretary of state in your [indecipherable]. </sentence><sentence id="1039">You know something, but you don't know everything. </sentence><sentence id="1040">The case of Mr. Kritchinger, who was a -- a member of the confessor -- confessing church, but he -- he was present at the Wannsee conference. </sentence><sentence id="1041">Was really took -- Because he didn't get a clear cut picture of the Holocaust before, I think the middle of 1942. </sentence><sentence id="1042">And then he wanted to get dismissed, and the lama said, "No, no, stay. </sentence><sentence id="1043">It would be better if you stay here," you know. </sentence><sentence id="1044">And there was a systematic non-communication. </sentence><sentence id="1045">In the newspaper, you wouldn't get the necessary information of what was really going on, and then there was the so-called shtimmelsburchter report of the securities service, made by -- these so -- should in a way replace them -- lack of information for the leading functionaries within this history -- s -- within the system. </sentence><sentence id="1046">But after they became inconvenient, because of too many inconvenient trusay they also were no longer permitted. </sentence><sentence id="1047">Where did you get information from? </sentence><sentence id="1048">It's very easy to read today the d-diary of Goebbels, and you see that even Goebbels, who is at a  [indecipherable] sometimes at a [indecipherable] the system, because they're changed all the time, he isn't very well informed about important ada -- aspects of politics. </sentence><sentence id="1049">And that is a -- cer -- specific nature of that regime. </sentence><sentence id="1050">And we have th -- we have also a travelma, to prove who was then really responsible for the onicol, because that happened, and there was no precise mechanism. </sentence><sentence id="1051">And you know, I point that out, no-not only -- not to say that people were not responsible for what they were doing, you know, but to explain why there was no opposition, you know. </sentence><sentence id="1052">And it -- In the question of the Holocaust, there could have been opposition on the side of the army, or other groups, not because they were not anti-Jewish, I wouldn't say that, but because of th -- the ta -- c-competing interests, because Jews the -- a certain amount of -- of manpower and resources in order to do the -- the Holocaust. </sentence><sentence id="1053">Cosponick has shown that in 1943, they had 300 men just to liquidate Jews in the east -- and the whole army at that time has only 1,000,800. </sentence><sentence id="1054">You know? </sentence><sentence id="1055">But under those specific ambivalent condition, where you didn't have any institutional set of politics, then something like Holocaust could occur. </sentence><sentence id="1056">That's a tatrol out of the analysis, and I've had this also a conclusion which may have -- be some importance for future events, because genocidal acts usually would come into being, if there is no clear cut command structure, not the other way around. </sentence><sentence id="1057">If we look at Vietnam, we know that we will -- certainly that could be it -- not -- no comparable level, but you know, certainly, if we look at the Holocaust, we also look helpul existence are like, which would then be a -- able to be per-perverted in that direction, that there is no protest against the destruction of all the foundations of law, and destruction of all the radius, which is certainly accompanying the implementation of the Holocaust, according to my conviction. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1090">Q: But that is somewhat counter to what one might think, right? </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1096">A: There is certainly -- well, that's -- the long run, they got accustomed to get rid of the Jews, and suddenly they learned, under the conditions of the occupied Soviet territory, where the recent study said a -- under certain conditions, then certainly then, see that it's possible, that it's the easiest thing just to kill those people. </sentence><sentence id="1097">First, before that, they want to have some reservations, solutions, that turn out to be impossible, and so on, and at the end it was for them, the easy d -- way, to kill the Jews. </sentence><sentence id="1098">And after they had started with that, then certainly the German bureaucratic perfectionism got into the business, and then they had the systematic liquidation of every Jewish women and kids which they could find in Ukraine, or elsewhere. </sentence><sentence id="1099">You know, that is really in -- that is -- well, impresses me a lot, and well there you have then the marriage between Nazi fanatism, and Prussian state tradition, and this terrible affect -- affectivity of the Germans. </sentence><sentence id="1100">Other nations would have just said, well that in -- why -- we -- we -- th-that -- that's not interesting for us. </sentence><sentence id="1101">But the Germans, and the way they are on a problem, then they do that up to the way and -- and they hold icemen so he shows that that is still -- that business of killing the Hungarian  Jews, after he had a counter order, obviously a counter order by Himmler, you know, that's very symptomatic for that process. </sentence><sentence id="1102">And it -- so far, we have not only to do with anti-Semitic moderation, but also with attitudes which are things stemming from the Prussian state tradition, in a way. -- </sentence><sentence id="1103">murdered Fromme, certainly. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1112">Q: And do you really think there's something very special about the German state, and the -- and Prussian history, given all the help that Germany got doing this? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1114">A: Well, I wouldn't overestimate the impact of national history on the process, but certainly there is something like a -- a -- the -- well -- that has been called by -- from the authoritarian character, and the authoritarian character plays a role, I think, f -- to fulfill the expectation by the Nazis and by Hitler, you know, th-they then just did, and you can see that with their example, the Reich's Crystal Night, and all the -- the German population protested way much against the violent acts in the night of the ninth of November already, and the eighth, and so on. </sentence><sentence id="1115">But then the Gestapo gave the explicit order that they should take into custody 20, or 20 thous -- 25,000 Jews. </sentence><sentence id="1116">That was a state measure, they accepted that, you know? </sentence><sentence id="1117">This is a strange element. </sentence><sentence id="1118">Law and order can work under certain conditions. </sentence><sentence id="1119">That they criticize the Nazi policy, but in -- then also can support Nazi policy. </sentence><sentence id="1120">And in a way it did, especially if you look how they then proceeded in getting these European Jewry from the last isle in Greece, or elsewhere. </sentence><sentence id="1121">You know, it's really nonsense, nobody would have done that in the whole world. </sentence><sentence id="1122">In that respect I think it's uniquely German. </sentence><sentence id="1123">Maybe the Russians, and some people there have a -- have some heritage from Germany to do that in their day, if they start then to bring it to a -- toa -- I think complete, and that's, I think one specific element. </sentence><sentence id="1124">But, on the other hand, we're starting to study what the French police did, and maybe they count a very depressing results [indecipherable] </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1136">Q: Do you think that people -- that historians now are more accepting of your view of -- of Hitler? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1138">A: Well, I think it's gone -- it's -- everybody is of that opinion, because w -- you know, we know more documents. </sentence><sentence id="1139">We know that Hitler didn't -- didn't -- he was a ideological motor all the time, especially in the Jewish question. </sentence><sentence id="1140">But, on the other hand, he didn't always push things ahead, and now it turns out that also the Wannsee conference has to be interpreted in a somewhat different context. </sentence><sentence id="1141">The main problem of Heydrich, besides of getting, or increasing his competence for the so-called Jewish question, was that he didn't want to proceed with the Nuremberg laws, and hi -- difference between Jews and half Jews, and Jews living in mixed marriages, you know, that very complicated system, to distinguish between a more assimilated, and a less assimilating [indecipherable].Because, certainly on the one hand, a party from the star wanted to include everybody who was of Jewish descent, up to the quarter Jew, and to the -- all the first -- the [indecipherable] exclusion from Germany, and later on the liquidation. </sentence><sentence id="1142">And the problem arose that Hitler didn't want to change the Nuremberg laws, and he was not following the  suggestions of Heydrich, and Himmler, and the so-called mishling question, the -- the k -- the question of -- how do you say that in English? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1149">Q: [indecipherable] </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1151">A: That means a half, quarter, and so on, Jews. </sentence><sentence id="1152">And Heydrich invited the ministers to the Wannsee conference, to decuss -- discuss that issue, and to get approval of the ministries, and the Reich chancellor, which were involved. </sentence><sentence id="1153">In order then to press on Hitler, to get the approval to include the half Jews, and the Jews living in mixed marriages. </sentence><sentence id="1154">And Hitler at that point was a -- was something like a brake. </sentence><sentence id="1155">Certainly motivation is very clear, he -- he didn't change -- want to change in later years, anything, and he thought it terribly inp -- unpopular if he would touch the assimilated Jews. </sentence><sentence id="1156">And he was less strict in that issue than Heydrich, and Himmler and others. </sentence><sentence id="1157">That gives to the Wannsee conference certainly, quite a new meaning, and Eichmann, who was expert on the mishlings question, that means the question of half and quarter Jews, he wanted to di -- let disappear his role. </sentence><sentence id="1158">And by that, he over -- he pointed at the ongoing liquidation in that famous speech delivered by Heydrich, wh -- and now -- by now we know very well that Heydrich had in mind what was going on with the construction of that so-called rollbarn defore, that was a big street between Lublin and -- and Krakow. </sentence><sentence id="1159">And from there he had a -- Jewish labor camps, and where he practized quote unquote, annihilation through labor, and that is then mentioned in this speech by Heydrich. </sentence><sentence id="1160">Because 20 days later he would, in Prague, still talk about all the deportation, all the 11,000,000 Jews -- European Jews, to the Icemeer region, where the Gestapo wanted to have a -- it's own territory, and a continuing the archy period in the gulag. </sentence><sentence id="1161">You know, that was really simple. </sentence><sentence id="1162">But in the ensuing weeks, suddenly everything changed, and then they did not he-hesitate then, to implement the systematic liquidation of the European Jews, but not so much at the Wannsee conference. </sentence><sentence id="1163">And you know, and so far, still the central part of that history, opened to different interpretations by now, but certainly that doesn't change anything in the very terrible development, and the criminal character of that, but it makes it, I think, a bit more comprehensible. </sentence><sentence id="1164">And certainly the problem still is that -- that it's not only Hitler who is doing that, certainly he's supporting that all the time. </sentence><sentence id="1165">The discussion is to what extent Hitler was informed. </sentence><sentence id="1166">Certainly I -- I wouldn't say that Hitler was not, but on the other hand, he didn't want to know too much. </sentence><sentence id="1167">And therefore, there was not too much discourse between the underlings and him, Hitler, as everybody assumed. </sentence><sentence id="1168">But the -- obviously that was not necessarily the case. </sentence><sentence id="1169">Hitler was living in the ideological world, he all the time was characterized by a flight from reality, and he was not a man who looked at things day to day, you know. </sentence><sentence id="1170">That was a original position when I started that business of Nazi history. </sentence><sentence id="1171">Well, is that some sufficient explanation of your question? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1193">Q: Yes, you did. </sentence><sentence id="1194">Let me ask you about your involvement with studying Hannah Arant, because you seem much more sympathetic than many historians. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1220">Q: How do you understand -- I have seen, over the years, not a lessening of anger at her -- at Hannah Arant, but in some sense an enlargement of the anger. </sentence><sentence id="1221">When the book came out about her relationship with Heideger, it gave people even more reason to -- </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1224">A: Well, but change, the -- the other year, I have been in Jerusalem, they had on a scolley conference on Hannah Arant, and they took over the admiration of Hannah Arant, which is I think symptomatic for the United States, we would be more critical in Germany. </sentence><sentence id="1225">And her problem certainly is that both sides don't understand that Hannah Arant is basically influenced by the [indecipherable] your Conservative -- tism. </sentence><sentence id="1226">Which is different from bigots. </sentence><sentence id="1227">One has to know that in order to understand Hannah Arant. </sentence><sentence id="1228">In all her theories, you know, of the philasinhite, of the loneliness of man, and then there comes back the -- a model -- that the Jews are the model for the world population. </sentence><sentence id="1229">Well, and if you look in a German idea, there's philosophy of the 19" century of Fishter, and all these people, you suddenly get it, that's her. </sentence><sentence id="1230">But she t -- I think masschoserv has to be a pragmatic philosopher, she is not. </sentence><sentence id="1231">Therefore -- </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1489">Q: How do you account for that? </sentence><sentence id="1490">I mean, what do you think about these diaries? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1493">A: Well, the diaries are very impressive, especially for those youngsters, and for those students who want to realize how the living condition of Jews in Germany, and posey with other parts of Europe at that time, really were. </sentence><sentence id="1494">Certainly he is living in a mixed marriage, that's -- a mixed po -- the -- Polish marriage. </sentence><sentence id="1495">By that, he even certainly has better conditions than the average Jews, that's quite clear. </sentence><sentence id="1496">But anyhow, what gets -- what gets a vivid, I think, picture of how -- what the Jewish situation in Nazi Germany was. </sentence><sentence id="1497">And that's helps for the youngsters, I think, to understand what was going on. </sentence><sentence id="1498">S -- You know, for the first time, they get an interpretation of Jews, and Jewish life, and how they had, or tried to survive, and so on. </sentence><sentence id="1499">And because it's translated by a man who belongs to the m -- basically to the German culture, and so on, it's obviously easier to understand that, anyhow, that belongs to that new wave of sensitivity towards the Jewish question, which also was to be seen in the "Schindler's List" film. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1507">Q: When -- When you read the diaries, and you think back upon your saying about yourself that you were naive. </sentence><sentence id="1508">Now, I understand you were a child, and he was an adult person, so I'm not trying to compare your naivete, and his la -- so-called lack of it, but it was fascinating to me how much he figured out. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1539">A: An explana -- no, it's -- it's not an explanation of the attitudes of the population, you're right, but it's an explanation of how the isolation came into being, you know? </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1549">Q: They talk about this as a unique event. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1551">A: Yes. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1553">Q: And from what I read about your work, that would be hard-hardly a word that you would use, because you want to talk about the Holocaust in context. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1555">A: Yes, that's right, yes. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1557">Q: So, can you tell me what you think is so problematic about this use of the word, uniqueness, and what it -- what it destroys. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1559">A: I wouldn't say it's problematic, but you know, if I study historical events, I don't study them for their u-uniqueness, but in order to learn from that, to have a better understanding of comparable, or prospeels, or opposite situations. </sentence><sentence id="1560">And by that, that category of uniqueness is not very variable, I think. </sentence><sentence id="1561">And, well certainly there is an u -- u-uniqueness  insofar as this systematic liquidation of millions of people in the 20" century. </sentence><sentence id="1562">It's incomparable to other developments. </sentence><sentence id="1563">But I'm -- I'm always a bit cautious for what -- what uniqueness can mean, you know -- you know. </sentence><sentence id="1564">Or, the other day I have been in Yucatan. </sentence><sentence id="1565">What [indecipherable] with those populations. </sentence><sentence id="1566">Well, it took them a century or two, the Germans did that within two years. </sentence><sentence id="1567">That is maybe the uniqueness, that means our century. </sentence><sentence id="1568">But the size of killing whole people, they maybe not so ni -- u-unique if you take in comparison to size of populations today, and in earlier periods. </sentence><sentence id="1569">And so far, I would also have a principle objection to use the term unique, because in a way, we don't much about what is really unique. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1581">Q: We don't know. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1583">A: We don't know much about, compare -- well, history is a very broad business, I think. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1585">Q: Is a very? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1587">A: A very broad -- </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="1591"> A -- experience, you know. </sentence><sentence id="1592">Well, you know, would have been in ancient societies, and so far, but that's not a very important point. </sentence><sentence id="1593">For me, it's not a principle question, whether the -- the pate or the uniqueness. </sentence><sentence id="1594">But certainly, it's only from a German viewpoint, the average German viewpoint's only -- it's necessary to -- to connect that with the question of the murder of the Soviet prisoners of war, or the murder of Slav people, and Gypsies, and others. </sentence><sentence id="1595">You know, that's quite clear ba -- th -- by that, it gets more comprehensible. </sentence><sentence id="1596">And -- And if you look at that in order to show the pre-conditions for any pre-ju-jub -- any genocidal policy, you know, then it shouldn't isolate that, and so far, the term uniqueness is not very helpful, but I wouldn't re -- wouldn't reject the -- that on the other hand, this is a unique event, which isn't comparable directly with the [indecipherable] gulag under Stalinism, and so on, although it | -- it lies on the same level. </sentence><sentence id="1597">They are -- We will discuss, I think, in future years a little bit, to what extent the -- the German perpetrators learned from -- from the local anti-Semitic populations in the east, and the Russians in the way. </sentence><sentence id="1598">You know, the death marches are an invention by a Soviet -- by the Soviets. </sentence><sentence id="1599">They did that with their own people. </sentence><sentence id="1600">And then the German suddenly came to the idea to do it also, first with prisoners of wars, and at -- at the end, with concentration camp inmates. </sentence><sentence id="1601">That's Soviet, the idea of that in -- can -- let -- march people about, hundreds and kilometers, was very familiar in a -- start in this period. </sentence><sentence id="1602">And so far, sometimes there are comparabilities which are -- shouldn't be precluded by accepting the unique character of the Holocaust. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1615">Q: Let -- Let me push this uniqueness just a little bit, be-because I -- there are certainly debates about -- and you take it on, though not in these terms. </sentence><sentence id="1616">The Holocaust is about the Jews, the Jewish experience is unique. </sentence><sentence id="1617">And then there's a -- a view that there's a  universal way to look at the Holocaust, that there are many victims during the Holocaust. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="1621">The Jews may have been the major, or the primary ones. </sentence><sentence id="1622">How -- How do you think it's best to actually look at this event? </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1623">A: Well, I would say -- would take up the argument that i -- on account of a -- a -- quite a lot of reasons. </sentence><sentence id="1624">Some is certainly the traditional occ-Occidental anti-Semitism. </sentence><sentence id="1625">The Jews were killed, and the others not, just because the Nazis didn't have enough time to kill the others. </sentence><sentence id="1626">And my friend Kurt Salley, he would talk about the top of the iceman to know. </sentence><sentence id="1627">Where's the iceberg, or where -- </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1633">Q: Iceberg, yes, [indecipherable] </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1635">A: Iceberg, you know. </sentence><sentence id="1636">And I mentioned that, at a talk to -- and now I got about the resettlement policy, you know, it's quite the -- after -- there was some compensation mechanism which [indecipherable] at first met the Jews. </sentence><sentence id="1637">And suddenly they are the -- the prejudice, and anti-Judaism, and not only a distinct anti-Semitic philosophy was responsible, that the selection was then made, and a lot of other factors. </sentence><sentence id="1638">But that - in -- in the long run, that wouldn't have been an isolated phenomenon, they would have killed other groups, also. </sentence><sentence id="1639">So th -- it was in a way, to put it in question marks, the easiest to kill the Jews, because they didn't get opposition from their local populations, and you know, and you know, and you know. </sentence><sentence id="1640">But the tendency to kill other groups as well, is unmistakably t-there. </sentence><sentence id="1641">And it so far, you know, you can say there was a uniqueness on their -- within the general picture, there was something like a uniqueness, like maybe kind of ca -- try to put that in that way. </sentence><sentence id="1642">And there is something which certainly explains that the -- the Jews were killed foremost, and the others anyway survived, although killing processes were underway all the time. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1651">Q: There is -- </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1653">A: Is that a sufficient answer? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1655">Q: Yes. </sentence><sentence id="1656">There is a way in which -- when I read your stuff, and I think about reading other people's material, that one gets the feeling that Nazism is either self-mutilating or suicidal, that in the end it would eat itself up with death. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1659">A: That's my thesis, yes. </sentence><sentence id="1660">So now, in the last months of the -- of the war, you know, they suddenly said, we don't need only racial homogeneity, we need only political homogeneity, and started to kill everybody in this time, 10 thousands of Germans, either, you know. </sentence><sentence id="1661">And then so far, you know, that was symptomatic for that form of -- of -- that style of politics. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1665">Q: Right. </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1666">A: You know? </sentence><sentence id="1667">If you -- If you have politics which are unable to have something like a lasting compromise, and then you have only destruction as the alternative, you know, that's really -- </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1668">Q: Tell me what you think about the emergence of movies like "Schindler's List", and television films and this sort of spate of popularization of the Holocaust, after years of a lot of people not thinking about it. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1670">A: Well, usually historians are very critical, I'm not. </sentence><sentence id="1671">I think "Schindler's List" is quite a good film, and I think the historical data are mainly, I think, reliable. </sentence><sentence id="1672">One can talk about some interpretations here, but in general I think it helped to understand the process in the minds of many youngsters in Germany. </sentence><sentence id="1673">And well, it doesn't replace the historical work, which is certainly more abstract, and less simple, but on the other hand, I think it was more helpful than the documentary films we had in the -- in the 50's and 60's, which didn't left an imprint on the German mentality, or at least not too much. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1678">Q: Including Landsman's "Shoah""? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1680">A: Landsman's "Shoah" is different, but you know, Landsman's "Shoah" has something for a few intellectuals who will sit there for 24 hours, I don't know how long that is, you know. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1682">Q: Nine hours, I think. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1684">A: Nine hours, I don't know. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1686">Q: But still -- </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1688">A: You know, that's not symptomatic for a -- for the public. </sentence><sentence id="1689">It's very impressive, you know, and [indecipherable]. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1692">Q: A-As an historian, is it an odd phenomenon that the farther one seems to get from this event, the more interest there seems to be, or is there deep -- how -- do you understand what I mean? </sentence><sentence id="1693">I mean, they -- there may -- </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1696">A: I don't understand it very well, you know, we have an interchannel change, and suddenly we have a generation which starts, and you -- well, it goes a whole way. </sentence><sentence id="1697">We did, as historians, starting with the ideas, and turning back to issues they don't know -- want to know that. </sentence><sentence id="1698">And it's so forth they have, and -- and fairly increased interest in the second World War, and the Jewish issue, and so on. </sentence><sentence id="1699">Among the younger students today, and that's quite a phenomenon, and -- but it has to be interpreted in terms of interchannel change. </sentence><sentence id="1700">Do you know, after those generations have left office, or the positions who was -- who were in this or that kind involved, now the next generation wants to know, and to provide information and -- and that -- start anew, I think. </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1701">Q: So, is that connected with what you said in your Leo Beck lecture? </sentence><sentence id="1702">Implicitly and explicitly, the legacy of Auschwitz forms the historical framework for the process of acquiring a new national self-concept? </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1703">A: Well, not necessarily, but that's certainly connected to that, that we have that phenomenon in Germany, which I think it's really remarkable. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1705">Q: So tell me what this means. </sentence><sentence id="1706">Why is this so necessary for it -- for a new self national -- a n-national self-confidence? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1709">A: You know we had a national indifference in Germany at the time, and the nation stayed traditional 19" century, almost disappeared. </sentence><sentence id="1710">If you talk to the kids today about Bismarck, they don't know who he is, you know, and if you talk about students in the war area, about the French scoo occupations, and they ask whether that's in the 17" century, or in the [indecipherable]. </sentence><sentence id="1711">That's got national history in a traditional sense, in Germany has, in a way, faded out among the next generations. </sentence><sentence id="1712">And there is, I think, growing a new national identity, which looks more at the chain of events, starting in the Third Reich, leading to the second World War, and the Holocaust, and certainly then, being in the background for the formation of the [indecipherable] republic. </sentence><sentence id="1713">That's rit -- quite a different side of historical basic facts, which have -- they have in mind, and to which I think the experience of Auschwitz belongs, in a way, you know? </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1729">Q: So, how do you evaluate, as you walk through the permanent exhibition, it's portrayal of this history? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1731">A: Well, [indecipherable] books on that, d'you ever read them? </sentence><sentence id="1732">You know, and I found it very interesting, the -- the recent book by Ted Hurwitz his name, on the -- on the miterzation of the Holocaust, you know, and he brings that interpretation that they want to put a positive meaning by stressing the Americans as liberators, and so on, in comparison to what is going on in wa -- Yad Vashem, you know. </sentence><sentence id="1733">Well, from a German viewpoint, that is -- that's not very convincing. </sentence><sentence id="1734">And I -- I always told that story that a Germans wanted to have a room for the resistance movement, but unfortunately that is too anti-Semitic [indecipherable] to wage that -- at --idea, you know, but that was very symptomatic. </sentence><sentence id="1735">But we don't have the possibility to connect the -- that, even to bend with  some sort of suppositive national tradition, you know. </sentence><sentence id="1736">That's it's -- has to do with what I told you about, the emergence of a new consciousness. </sentence><sentence id="1737">We just can't [indecipherable]. </sentence><sentence id="1738">At least the other Germany resistance no -- we have done five people, or 50, that's not enough, you know. </sentence><sentence id="1739">It's not representative. </sentence><sentence id="1740">And then so far, sh -- from a German viewpoint, you look at that as certainly a bit skeptically with all the politish and nutson went on the attendance to -- to have some general consequential slogans, or what do you say, you know. </sentence><sentence id="1741">We are far more skeptical as -- us Germans who went through that experience. </sentence><sentence id="1742">But anyhow, it's a very impressive exhibition, and is a -- is a very, very good and interesting material, in many respects, but it would be [indecipherable] to say that a most impressive place is where you have the pictures of that little town, what's the name? </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1759">Q: [indecipherable] yeah. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1761">A: But that would be also the reaction of the -- of the German yosterday, you know. </sentence><sentence id="1762">Because that's like "Schindler's List", or that's the Klemperer diary. </sentence><sentence id="1763">It shows the people again, you know. </sentence><sentence id="1764">And what is our task as historians, is to -- not to -- well, the people should stay alive in the whole description of the process, that's difficult. </sentence><sentence id="1765">And that is done, in a way, by the exhibition. </sentence></p></dialogue>
