<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="188">A: No, actually I didn't, because I was very young whe -- when I left home, but my father did have a butcher shop. </sentence><sentence id="189">So I had knowledge -- </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="190">Q: Was it -- </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="191">A: -- o-of -- of that type of business, but I really never did that type of work. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="211">A: I spoke Yiddish, I spoke Czech, Russian, Hungarian and of course I understood Polish, or a -- I also spoke German, you know, and that helped a lot because a -- when a -- in that part of -- a lot of the -- in that town, I should say, there were a lot of ethnic eastern Europeans. </sentence><sentence id="212">So I more or less had a -- you know, had a way to get by with some of the customers, so that I -- although language was a problem, but my broth -- this William Lebow instead of pe -- speaking to me Yiddish, he spoke to me in English only. </sentence><sentence id="213">So consequently I was forced to pick up the language a little faster, because everybody spoke to me in English. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="225">A: Well, I lived -- I got -- I was very lucky, I found a room in a nice house, oddly enough. </sentence><sentence id="226">It was </sentence></p><p><sentence id="227"> a new -- fairly new house that this working c-couple had, and they had a son, he was also my age. </sentence><sentence id="228">And it was a little Cape Cod, but I was fortunate, I got a room with this family. </sentence><sentence id="229">I paid them, you know, for the -- rooming there. </sentence><sentence id="230">And his son had -- their son had one room and I had another room upstairs and it worked out very nice. </sentence><sentence id="231">The woman kept the place clean and all I did really there is sleep, you know, when I would come home from work or whatever. </sentence><sentence id="232">And later on I -- as soon as I -- my sister got married, I used to have all -- most of my meals at her house, but I would live on my own, you know, in this -- so this worked out very good, it was a -- </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="233">Q: And did you go to any school to learn English -- </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="234">A: Yes. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="241">A: To learn English basically, right. </sentence><sentence id="242">To learn English, right. </sentence><sentence id="243">And then when I used up the school in this town, I went to a couple of towns away there was -- they had a larger high school, they have a little more advanced teaching, so I went over there and got some more English basically, and some other subjects that were whatever I wanted. </sentence><sentence id="244">But it was also at night. </sentence><sentence id="245">It was all after work. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="251">Q: Did you have any contact during your early period here with Jewish agencies? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="253">A: No, I did not. </sentence><sentence id="254">I -- oddly enough, I didn't have any contact with agencies, I didn't get any help from agencies. </sentence><sentence id="255">I didn't look for it, I didn't even know whether they existed in -- in some sense. </sentence><sentence id="256">But I -- I was completely -- soon as I got here I was completely on my own, which is, by the way, this is the way I wanted it. </sentence><sentence id="257">I didn't want any charity, I didn't want anything from anybody. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="264">Q: What -- why was that? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="266">A: No particular reason, I just didn't think of looking f -- to someone else, you know. </sentence><sentence id="267">Basically that's all i -- I think that's the way it was. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="270">Q: Okay, so here you are in -- working in Carteret and going to school at night and having meals at your sister's. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="272">A: Right, and so now life took -- took on -- oh yes, in the beginning I did go back to New York like on weekends, like on Sundays, because that's -- was the only day I was off and meet some other friends that I got to know, I knew a little, slightly. </sentence><sentence id="273">And we used to meet on Sunday and go out for dinner or to a movie, whatever. </sentence><sentence id="274">And -- but after -- </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="275">Q: How -- how did you get to know them? </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="276">A: Well, some of them I knew -- I don't know, through the grapevine or you know, you know a couple of people, then you would meet another two, three people and so on. </sentence><sentence id="277">So there was like five, six of us that would meet periodically, and -- </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="278">Q: Were a-any of them people that you had known in Europe? </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="279">A: A couple of them were -- I had known in Europe, but some of them I did not -- </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="280">Q: Okay. </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="281">A: -- I met here. </sentence><sentence id="282">And we were -- and the reason being is that -- oh yes, and there was still, on the east side there was some kind of a -- from one of the families there was a -- they had like a organization, they would meet once a month or something. </sentence><sentence id="283">So I went a couple of times there, and so on. </sentence><sentence id="284">And what [indecipherable] really was, that because you didn't know anyone, you didn't know the language, so you could have [indecipherable] together. </sentence><sentence id="285">But after a very short time, </sentence></p><p><sentence id="286"> maybe like three months, four months, I somehow decided that that was not for me and that I'm going to try and make fre -- American friends that are local so that I don't have to go to New York. </sentence><sentence id="287">So I started more or less -- and I met a couple of Jewish boys in Carteret, New Jersey, and we sort of became a little friendly and I went along whether it was to the beach or for pizza. </sentence><sentence id="288">And so slowly, slowly I started getting -- and with American kids saw that I'm European. </sentence><sentence id="289">So I literally -- some [indecipherable] I cut myself off entirely. </sentence><sentence id="290">Not by design, it just to happened that it -- it worked that way, you know. </sentence><sentence id="291">And of course I worked a lot. </sentence><sentence id="292">I de -- delivered groceries, big, big boxes on this bicycle, it had one si -- a big basket and a small wheel in the front, and all th- th-the groceries are in big, big boxes. </sentence><sentence id="293">I was -- and I was only like 16 on -- going on 17 really, and I was pretty light. </sentence><sentence id="294">So the box were sometimes heavier than I was on the bicycle. </sentence><sentence id="295">But anyway, I did this for quite awhile, til I started driving. </sentence><sentence id="296">I was able to drive, you know, a van, which was like a year, a year and a half later. </sentence><sentence id="297">And I worked, like I mentioned a lot of hours. </sentence><sentence id="298">We worked between 60 to 90 hours a week. </sentence><sentence id="299">Like I worked six days a week from seven to six and I -- two days a week til nine o'clock. </sentence><sentence id="300">And during the night we would go twice a week to the market to pick up vegetables. </sentence><sentence id="301">So it was like between eight oc -- eight p.m. to maybe we'll get back two, three a.m., and the next morning we start all over again. </sentence><sentence id="302">So it was qu-quite hectic and I worked like this for a number of years. </sentence><sentence id="303">And -- </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="304">Q: Thi -- this reminds me of what you said earlier, as a child you worked for your family -- </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="305">A: Yeah, right. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="307">Q: -- then you went to Hebrew school, then you went to regular school, then you went back to Hebrew school -- </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="308">A: Yeah. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="310">Q: -- then you worked again for your family. </sentence><sentence id="311">It sounds like a -- </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="312">A: Yeah, we worked all the time. </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="313">Q: -- similar kind of schedule. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="315">A: Well, th-this was sort of different because a-a-at home in Europe it was different because it was home. </sentence><sentence id="316">It was a relaxed -- 1-it -- I d -- I don't know about relaxed, but it was -- it was a different -- the confines were different. </sentence><sentence id="317">Here it was strictly a job working, and it was frustrating because I didn't speak the language, and plus the hours were allow -- they didn't allow you too much time for anything else, and I did a lot of what I would call really dirty work, okay? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="321">Q: Okay. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="323">A: Such as a -- because conditions -- </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="324">Q: With no future. </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="325">A: -- condition -- right, conditions weren't much different than this today because today you go for a job, an immigrant comes in, it's much, much different because they come in, the conditions are entirely different. </sentence><sentence id="326">In those days you came -- it wasn't even that somebody was doing something wrong -- like my brother-in-law wasn't necessarily a mean guy, he was a nice guy. </sentence><sentence id="327">He himself worked hard. </sentence><sentence id="328">His mentality worked in that direction, so what I was doing was not out of the ordinary for him, but it was out of the ordinary for me -- </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="329">Q: Okay. </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="330">A: -- because like such thing as collecting the dirty garbage with the stinking vegetables, even in Europe I would -- didn't do that, you know, so it was the kind of a thing for a young boy it was very demeaning, if you will. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="332">Q: Okay. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="344">Q: Why did you think that you wanted to go to California? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="346">A: Well, number one I wanted to live with that particular sister, near -- near her, although I had a good relationship with this sister as well, and she was very selfless. </sentence><sentence id="347">But the other one was younger, prob -- closer to my age I should say and we had more -- we grew up together so we had more of a -- a rapport, or whatever. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="350">Q: This is not the sister you came over -- was this the sister that you came over -- </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="351">A: That's the same sister that I came over with. </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="352">Q: Okay. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="358">Q: Okay. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="360">A: Okay. </sentence><sentence id="361">And not that this sister was not good, but I mean she -- she was actually always worried about me and so on. </sentence><sentence id="362">So -- but she was older and she left and I was like, about nine years old, so just for that reason alone, but otherwise I had equally as good a relationship with Ellen as I did with the other one, with Cindy. </sentence><sentence id="363">But as I worked, one thing that I do recall that used to frustrate me, I wanted to go to school and I couldn't afford to go to school because I couldn't quit working. </sentence><sentence id="364">So every so often I -- I would get sort of upset about it [indecipherable][tape    </sentence></p><p><sentence id="365"> break] </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="366">Q: You were talking about wanting to go to school. </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="367">A: Oh yes, however, there were a couple of reasons I couldn't go to school. </sentence><sentence id="368">First of all I -- my preparation wasn't as good because I left school when I was pretty young, a-a-after [indecipherable] grade, but -- plus I didn't -- my English was still very poor and I had no confidence in going to school. </sentence><sentence id="369">Plus I couldn't afford to take off from work. </sentence><sentence id="370">So I soon decided that that was the only thing I could do is work and anyway I worked like this til about -- for my brother-in-law [indecipherable] for about -- til 1952, when I was drafted into the armed services, during the Korean war. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="377">A: No, oddly enough. </sentence><sentence id="378">I was supposed to but somehow they didn't -- my papers didn't come through. </sentence><sentence id="379">So I was drafted into the service without being a citizen. </sentence><sentence id="380">And it's a very funny thing, I served the whole time in the service and I was not even a citizen, but a -- and being in the service didn't help my citizenship because it took another while befo -- when I got out of the service, to find out why I didn't get my citizenship. </sentence><sentence id="381">And of course they gave me some kind of limp excuse that I -- they were investigating me and so on that if I had any communist affiliations. </sentence><sentence id="382">So I was laughing because at 16 how could I have communist affiliations? </sentence><sentence id="383">Nevertheless I -- I did get my citizenship right after that. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="660">A: No, I was married, but by that time already my daughter was, let's see, must have been about four years old. </sentence><sentence id="661">And by that time I had a son, Jeffrey, which came later, about a year and a half or -- yeah, almost two years after my daughter. </sentence><sentence id="662">So, they was both small, Jeffrey must have been like about two years old. </sentence><sentence id="663">And I decided I've had it with this and I'm not going to live like I've lived it -- like if I was in Europe, I want to live in America. </sentence><sentence id="664">So I wanted to get out of this neighborhood. </sentence><sentence id="665">Besides, I saw there was no -- no future there. </sentence><sentence id="666">So I picked up and I went to California with my wife and children, and by that time my other brother that had come out from Russia was -- also went to Israel with the Haganah from Czechoslovakia. </sentence><sentence id="667">But eventually we brought him out to the United States because it was getting too expensive to upkeep him in Israel, we have to send him money all the time, so we decided to bring him over here. </sentence><sentence id="668">So by that time, that was, I think -- "m not sure what year it was. </sentence><sentence id="669">But anyway, by that time he was already - </sentence></p><p><sentence id="670"> - we brought him out from Israel to the United States, and -- but he also moved to California because my sister was there. </sentence><sentence id="671">So he settled in California, so when I decided to move, he was already living there, plus I had my other sister there. </sentence><sentence id="672">And when we got there we tried to get an apartment, but in the meantime I had left a lot of loose ends here in New Jersey. </sentence><sentence id="673">So -- because I didn't empt -- empty out a store and so on. </sentence><sentence id="674">So I had to come back, so I left my wife and my children there, and while I was here settling my affairs, my wife decided she didn't like it there and she came back -- she got -- hopped on a plane and came back. </sentence><sentence id="675">So that was -- </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="676">Q: With the children. </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="677">A: With the children, right. </sentence><sentence id="678">So -- </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="679">Q: And only your stuff was still in California? </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="680">A: No, and -- right, well we didn't move per se, you know, we just went physically, ourselves you know. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="682">Q: Okay. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="684">A: To find an apartment and so on. </sentence><sentence id="685">But our house -- oh yes, in the meantime, the house that I had bought, I sold, because I was moving in California, cause I -- I was so sure we were going to stay there. </sentence><sentence id="686">But anyway, at the time my wife was a little emotionally upset and so on, because of sh -- after the children, she had a little tough time of it emotionally or mentally. </sentence><sentence id="687">So anyway she -- all of a sudden something struck her there, she didn't like California, so she got on a plane. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="692">Q: Did she have family here? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="694">A: Yes, she had family here. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="696">Q: On the east coast? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="698">A: Her mother lived here, although her -- her relationship with her mother was not great. </sentence><sentence id="699">But her sisters lived here -- no, actually one sister lived here at the time, one sister lived in California I think, at the time. </sentence><sentence id="700">And anyway, she got on a plane and she came back with the children. </sentence><sentence id="701">So once she was back, I didn't have much of a choice. </sentence><sentence id="702">My house was sold and the business was gone, so I got an apartment momentarily and we lived in the apartment for a little while. </sentence><sentence id="703">And then along came -- one of my lawyers that I knew told me there was this small house available, and I decided that a house, it wouldn't cost me much more than the apartment, even though it was small. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="711">Q: Whoops, something happened. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="713">A: Oh [inaudible] </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="714">Q: Okay. </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="715">A: Okay, anyway, so on the spur of the moment, instead of staying in this apartment which we did not like, I decided -- I bought this house, it was a little smaller than I would have liked to, but we could afford it. </sentence><sentence id="716">And it's what we could afford, so we moved into this small house, in Colonia again. </sentence><sentence id="717">And the children started school over there, and we lived there f -- we intended to live there like a couple years and we -- it turned out we lived there like about 10 - 12 years in this house, cause my wife didn't want to move from there, cause she got so used to it. </sentence><sentence id="718">But in the meantime I got a job as soon as I came back, worked f-for again, a s-small s-supermarket for a shor -- for about couple of years. </sentence><sentence id="719">And then I decided to go back and to -- I found a place and I wanted to open a store. </sentence><sentence id="720">And again this time it was very important for me that I open in an area where you have Americans, that I deal with regular people rather than like back in Europe. </sentence><sentence id="721">So I opened this store in Madison, New Jersey, it was a new store and I struggled there -- </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="722">Q: A -- you opened the store, it was an independent -- </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="723">A: Ah, yeah. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="725">Q: -- grocery store? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="727">A: No, it was an independent, actually it was more of a butcher store, okay. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="729">Q: And you just opened it? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="731">A: I just opened it from scratch, right. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="733">Q: Okay. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="735">A: I set it up and I opened it, after I worked for this ga -- fellow, Woodbridge for a couple of years. </sentence><sentence id="736">And like I said, this was a new shopping center, and I opened up, but it was a ups -- coming community. </sentence><sentence id="737">So I opened the store with a little -- in mind with a little hi -- better caliber of customer, and little up -- upscale, and I struggled there for a couple of years, again not making money. </sentence><sentence id="738">Actually, I was losing money for the first couple of years. </sentence><sentence id="739">But eventually I made it, the store caught on eventually because from the start it got the good reputation. </sentence><sentence id="740">And I sit in this particular store for the next 25 years, while my kids were growing up, I sent them through school and so on. </sentence><sentence id="741">So as far as living in general, you know, we tried to live as normal as possible, as any American would. </sentence><sentence id="742">But here, for the first time in my life, the customers spoke English, I spoke English and I felt like it was -- I arrived in the United States, I didn't have to put up with places like Carteret. </sentence><sentence id="743">So in that respect I -- i-it's sort of like my dream, I guess, of living as an American came true. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="753">Q: So you had a really tough period for awhile. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="755">A: Well, i-it -- it was tough, I'm sure it was not any tougher than anybody -- but hindsight it doesn't seem so tough. </sentence><sentence id="756">At the time I -- I -- 1 remember, because one of the biggest problem was - - again, it's very hard to compare it to -- to 1999 or 2000, is because the amount of money people are making is -- was just entirely different level, you know, it was --- it was true everything was - - a -- a lot of things were less expensive, but it was very hard to make -- make money and keep it, because things -- things were difficult, especially like in my case, you know, I'm sure that there were a lot of people, i-immigrants like myself had the same problem, nobody helped you period, whether it -- but -- which was okay because I wanted to be self reliant. </sentence><sentence id="757">However, in some cases people come, they get big wedding gifts, or they get a start here, they gotta push there. </sentence><sentence id="758">Like I had a friend, he was complaining about his father-in-law [indecipherable], but he would buy him carpeting for the house, or -- or buy him a garage, or whatever, were -- were -- or -- or turned over the business to him, whatever, I didn't have that. </sentence><sentence id="759">So it was i-in a sense struggle. </sentence><sentence id="760">On the other hand, why should I look for some -- someone else to give it to me, you know, it's simple as -- as far as I'm concerned, it's okay. </sentence><sentence id="761">But it was tough, because the amount of money you made or you've been able to keep was very difficult. </sentence><sentence id="762">And in that respect, I guess it was tough, but I imagine that most people had -- didn't have it much different. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="772">Q: So now you're retired? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="774">A: Yes. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="776">Q: And how did you decide to retire? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="778">A: Well again, I was in the store and we -- I was there like 25 years and the real estate -- the shopping center was sold to another company and the first thing the new company came in, they took over, they wanted to triple my rent, which I could -- definitely could not afford. </sentence><sentence id="779">And by now the business also was suffering, cause I was in the meat business and the cholesterol thing came on very quickly, very strong, and all of a sudden the demand, plus the competition was just too much to -- to absorb, because the demand just dropped, and -- while the competition was increasing. </sentence><sentence id="780">I was in an area, it was a very competitive area. </sentence><sentence id="781">There was like four or five supermarkets within a couple of miles of me. </sentence><sentence id="782">But for the longest time I held out, but with a reduction of meat consumption, it was going down. </sentence><sentence id="783">So then when the new landlord came in, and he demanded almost triple rent, plus extra added expenses, I just felt I couldn't afford to stay there. </sentence><sentence id="784">So I retired prematurely; I really wanted to stay in business another four or five years. </sentence><sentence id="785">And -- so once -- which worried me, because I didn't think I could afford it economically. </sentence><sentence id="786">But somehow or another, once I saw that I had to go, I made the best of it and so far so good. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="797">Q: So you had worked very hard all your life, from the time -- </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="798">A: Oh yeah. </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="799">Q: -- even as a small boy. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="801">A: Yeah. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="803">Q: What was it like for you suddenly to not have to -- </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="804">A: Well -- </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="805">Q: -- not be working any more? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="807">A: -- I thought I would have a problem with that. </sentence><sentence id="808">As it turns out I don't have a -- I -- I adjusted very easily. </sentence><sentence id="809">I amazed myself. </sentence><sentence id="810">I will say -- after I retired, I did, when I got out of business, I did go part time. </sentence><sentence id="811">I worked for a supermarket in New Jersey for -- periodically. </sentence><sentence id="812">And when I didn't work there I worked someplace else, couple of -- two or three days a week or so, and now that I moved here actually, I'm also doing -- basically still doing the same thing, I'm working a little bit, part time and then I volunteer and I do things. </sentence><sentence id="813">I'm not bored. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="821">Q: Now, what -- what work do you do part time? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="823">A: Actually, right now I work -- I do some consulting, like for the food industry, like restaurants and sup -- food stores. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="826">Q: Like, for example, how -- how would that work? </sentence><sentence id="827">A client comes -- </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="828">A: Well, like somebody wants to set up a store, so I help them set it up. </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="829">Q: And how do they found you? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="831">A: Well, I find them, really -- </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="832">Q: Oh. </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="833">A: -- most of the time. </sentence><sentence id="834">Because when I came here I -- it took a long -- I did some of it in New Jersey, but when I came here I didn't know the area, I didn't know where to start. </sentence><sentence id="835">So it's a little - - I didn't depend on it too much. </sentence><sentence id="836">So I started working actually one day in Katz's. </sentence><sentence id="837">Here I walked in one day and he asked me if I could help him out, I got to talk to him. </sentence><sentence id="838">And I started helping him out, I'm still there. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="845">Q: Wh-Where is this? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="847">A: Katz's market in -- a kosher market. </sentence><sentence id="848">So I'm there -- whenever I want to work, I ge -- he and I have an arrangement, when I -- if I want to work, I work and if I don't, I don't. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="851">Q: And when you want to work, what -- what does ti -- </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="852">A: So I go in -- </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="853">Q: What work do you do when you want to -- </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="854">A: I work in the service counter. </sentence><sentence id="855">Th-Th -- they sell meat, you know, so I -- </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="856">Q: Okay </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="857">A: -- do service. </sentence><sentence id="858">So I put in like three days a week on average, two or three days a week. </sentence><sentence id="859">And what's nice about it, I -- Iam not committed where I have to, you know, I -- I work -- whenever I'm free, I work. </sentence><sentence id="860">So this way I could do what I want to do, still I work a little bit. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="865">Q: And you said you do volunteer work. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="867">A: I volunteer in the Holocaust Museum. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="869">Q: Now, how did you happen to volunteer there? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="871">A: What happened is that I had -- in the beginning when I first moved here I had a hard time to even go into the museum, by the way, it took me like two or three years prior to -- that I went in. </sentence><sentence id="872">It took me three years just to get in the door. </sentence><sentence id="873">But when I moved here, I kept on meeting people and they were telling me -- and once I walked into the museum, I realized that once I broke the barrier and I was able to walk in there that I would like to volunteer. </sentence><sentence id="874">Because I was thinking prior to this to volunteer in other museum, like in the Smithsonian. </sentence><sentence id="875">But when I got familiar with the Holocaust Museum, I decided to volunteer there. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="881">Q: And why did you decide to volunteer there? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="883">A: Well, I figured that just for the sake of enlightening, like people that come in or whatever, to make them understand certain things what they saw, something like that, something [indecipherable] </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="884">Q: What did you want them to understand? </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="885">A: Oh, they" ll un-understand, instead of just seeing pictures, or just seeing -- to give them a little more meaning to it if -- if -- if I had the chance that -- to understand. </sentence><sentence id="886">Cause sometime you look at pictures or you read something, it's one thing, but then sometime when another person sort of co-conveys a little explanation to you, maybe you got a little better insight of it. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="889">Q: Well, like what insight did you want them to have? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="891">A: Well, like understanding. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="893">Q: What did you want them to take away? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="895">A: Well, I want them to take away more or less the -- how precarious freedom can be. </sentence><sentence id="896">Basically, this is the way I see things, that if you don't know what dangers lie, you're not careful to protect what you have. </sentence><sentence id="897">If you -- th-that freedom is something you don't take for granted. </sentence><sentence id="898">That -- it's something that you have to you know, that you have to be aware of what's out there and not to allow yourself to be caught in it, basically. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="903">Q: And what do you do at the museum? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="905">A: Well, this past two years, actually, I was taking young kids through the "Daniel's Story," okay. </sentence><sentence id="906">N-Now this year I'm going to go and -- in fact they're going to have a training course for older kids, like in the permanent museum. </sentence><sentence id="907">So I'm gonna volunteer in there, I think, also. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="911">Q: And you take people through, you mean you explain -- </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="912">A: Yeah, it -- it -- it -- </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="913">Q: -- you actually explain -- </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="914">A: -- yeah, explain it, you know -- </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="915">Q: -- things as [indecipherable] </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="916">A: -- like in the "Daniel's Story," it's for the younger children, that's four to seven graders. </sentence><sentence id="917">So we take them through and we explain to them, we try to give them a certain understanding at their level. </sentence><sentence id="918">And oddly enough, in some cases I think it does a lot of good, you know. </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="919">Q: So you -- you feel that they are receptive -- </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="920">A: Yes, yeah. </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="921">Q: -- that they can understand -- </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="922">A: Right, right -- </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="923">Q: -- and they're interested. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="925">A: -- right. </sentence><sentence id="926">And I -- and I've also seen, from different aspects -- in fact, my daughter is on the board of -- in the ADL and I've ga -- and they have programs that are also sometimes in conjunction with the museum. </sentence><sentence id="927">And they started a program, they train teachers, the Catholic diocese of the Washington area. </sentence><sentence id="928">And I've seen what they did -- what they're doing in the Catholic schools is just phenomenal. </sentence><sentence id="929">And I -- I feel that when you get it out there, if you got people that cooperate and they educate and they give them exposure that you get these kids that make -- grow up to be anti -- very big anti-Semites, that they get it from education of certain -- they get certain information that I may -- they will not get at home, but they get it in the school, like in the Catholic school an -- at that, that each time you in -- you inject people like this with a little knowledge, that sooner or later it helps someplace else as they grow up. </sentence><sentence id="930">You know what's - - even if they have a background of anti-Semitism, they already -- they got it in their own school, through good teachers, which I've seen some of them are very, very capable. </sentence><sentence id="931">So this is the kind of stuff, that's one of the reasons I feel that it's very important to reach them. </sentence><sentence id="932">And a lot of the kids we get in the museum, many times you think of Jewish kids, actually we get kids from Carolinas, from Oklahoma and from that -- kids that never heard of Jews, or -- or never had any - - you know. </sentence><sentence id="933">So this way it gives them, instead of thinking of a Jew as a Jew, they think of Jew as person that went through a bad experience. </sentence><sentence id="934">And -- and maybe some of them will understand some of it. </sentence><sentence id="935">So in that respect I think it's -- it's a very good thing. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="947">Q: When we met a week or so ago, I thought you had said that you worked in the speaker's bureau? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="949">A: Oh yeah, I forgot, okay, I do that too, right, okay. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="951">Q: What do you do there? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="953">A: Well, in there I -- I speak before groups, every so often, just about my experience, basically. </sentence><sentence id="954">I-It's geared mostly to an individual's experience. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="957">Q: And how is that for you to do that? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="959">A: Well, at this age it's okay, it's a -- each time it's a little difficult because it's very emotional. </sentence><sentence id="960">But in the same time I feel that again, if people hear it, if somebody comes up with denials and they hear it from somebody like me that I went through it, all of a sudden th-they -- when a -- a denier denies, they may not buy it. </sentence><sentence id="961">And then -- so in that respect I think it's -- as a matter of fact, just recently I spoke to the -- in the museum itself, and we had a full hou -- the whole theater was full, actually standing room only. </sentence><sentence id="962">And I could not believe the amount of people that came -- came up to me and they were just, you know, genuinely touched and -- and they were [phone ringing] Excuse me. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="967">Q: Okay, we" ll turn it off. [ </sentence><sentence id="968">tape break] You were talking about speaking at the museum recently and people coming up to you afterward. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="971">A: Oh yes, and it -- it was very, you know, I don't know, how can I put it? </sentence><sentence id="972">I -- I was very surprised and -- because people came up and they actually [indecipherable] and asked for -- even for an autograph, you know, they were like very taken wi -- and the response was just fantastic. </sentence><sentence id="973">And you have to remember, most of these people -- not most -- if not all of them were -- like probably 90 percent of them were not Jewish, you know, and they wanted. </sentence><sentence id="974">So when you see it makes an impact like that it gives you an idea that it -- it's the thing to do, you know, to -- to make -- because th -- fa -- just for no other reason, just the fact that this way they could say gee, I met someone, so who is this guy denying that this happened when it did happen. </sentence><sentence id="975">I met someone that did. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="981">Q: Really. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="983">A: So that respect I think it -- it serves a big purpose. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="985">Q: You've -- you've done a lot of being interviewed, not only the speaking that you do, but for the Wiesenthal Center, for the Shoah Foundation and now today. </sentence><sentence id="986">How is that for you? </sentence><sentence id="987">What is that like for you? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="991">A: Well, a-at this stage 1-it's still -- every time I give an interview i-it's still difficult for some reason. </sentence><sentence id="992">Certain areas you just get very emotional. </sentence><sentence id="993">But the only reason I did it is because everybody says it's important for -- for the history, so when I was in California a few years ago, I -- you know, I did it because some -- for the same reason, and the same reason here. </sentence><sentence id="994">And I just feel that if there's enough information out there that the deniers will have less chance of denying, basically. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="999">Q: Mm-hm. </sentence><sentence id="1000">Can we go back? </sentence><sentence id="1001">You mentioned that you had two children, but what was it like for you when your childr -- when your first child was born? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1005">A: For me it was like probably the nicest thing that ever happened to me. ... </sentence><sentence id="1006">When my daughter was born, I -- it actually changed my life and gave me more purpose if anything, and it was just one of the nicest things probably in my whole entire life. </sentence><sentence id="1007">And -- and then of course my son came, so it, you know, iv -- it was just -- I enjoyed my kids from the time they were born. </sentence><sentence id="1008">| -- I could honestly say that. </sentence><sentence id="1009">I'm very fortunate in that regard. </sentence><sentence id="1010">As a matter of fact, yesterday was our anniversary, our 44" anniversary. </sentence><sentence id="1011">So my daughter made dinner and I can honestly say -- she is like 40 -- 42 years old, I think, and I had nothing but pleasure from her, so -- and now she has two children and it -- it's like I'm getting it all over again, so it's really very, very nice. </sentence><sentence id="1012">Now, my son got married and he -- he's also married a very nice woman and she is like -- like my daughter. </sentence><sentence id="1013">And they have a -- a little boy now, Joshua. </sentence><sentence id="1014">And so in that regard I think that between my children, my grandchildren, it's probably the crowning of my life, if you will. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1026">Q: You mentioned that you moved to this area about five years ago. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1028">A: Yes, five years ago. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1030">Q: And how did you decide to move to this area? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1032">A: Well, once I ga -- gave up the store, it was a matter of -- of I could not live where I was, because I liked it there too, but it was a matter of moving into a senior citizen complex or Florida or whatever. </sentence><sentence id="1033">And then I realized that I would rather live near my daughter so I could watch my grandchildren grow up. </sentence><sentence id="1034">So that was a easy decision, and it was a good decision because I really - - and I didn't want to go out and live in a senior citizen complex because I really didn't want to go out to pasture, I want to live among the living, that life goes on. </sentence><sentence id="1035">And so basically I got what I wanted, you -- you know. </sentence><sentence id="1036">So I -- I really made the right decision, as far as I'm concerned. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1042">Q: I also wanted to ask you about your religion. </sentence><sentence id="1043">You talked about that some when I was here a couple of weeks ago, but I wonder if you would talk about that on the tape. </sentence><sentence id="1044">You took -- you -- I saw in the -- one of the tapes that you -- your family growing up was very observant and Orthodox and that you went to Hebrew school, you were Bar Mitzvahed, and then you were -- the Holocaust came along, and then what? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1048">A: Yes, I, as far as religion, I guess I'm not what I would call religious, per se. </sentence><sentence id="1049">I'm more nonsectarian if you will, in some respects. </sentence><sentence id="1050">Yet, I am very Jewish , or I did [indecipherable] I wou -- did grow up, it seemed like when I -- where I grew up, everybody was Orthodox and everybody was observant, period. </sentence><sentence id="1051">There it was a given, you were Jewish, you were brought up somewhat -- most people were -- were Orthodox and -- and observant, especially in our town, </sentence></p><p><sentence id="1052"> but most people were. </sentence><sentence id="1053">In the city you found some people that were maybe wavering a little bit. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="1054">But I have to ad -- say, we got in -- when we got into a concentration camp, I remember the first holiday right a -- we came -- actually, we came to Mauthausen from Auschwitz, and I remember we were in Mauthausen, this was like about a week after Auschwitz actually, a week or te -- to two weeks after Auschwitz, and it was [indecipherable] because -- I remember that. </sentence><sentence id="1055">And my father, my uncle, and whoever, you know, the oldest got together in a huddle and tried to say the prayers as much as -- most of them knew it by heart. </sentence><sentence id="1056">And somehow [indecipherable] right there and then, I sort of like couldn't fake it, I just -- I just -- I just couldn't see it, because of what happened. </sentence><sentence id="1057">And from there on in I was not religious. </sentence><sentence id="1058">I literally, in the beginning, I guess it used to bother me, but after awhile you just learn to live with it and I -- I just never got -- I never thought of religion as -- as an important part of my life, that's what I'm saying. </sentence><sentence id="1059">And when I lived in Czechoslovakia for a short time after the war, there was no o-organized synagogue or anything that I recall a-at the time, and the government or the -- basically the whole population in general in Czechoslovakia was not exactly a religious type of country like in some countries. </sentence><sentence id="1060">And wherever you went, on papers you have to fill out, we put out atheist fa -- because it was easier. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="1061">If you put on -- like in Europe you have to put on Jewish, or religion on a -- on application. </sentence><sentence id="1062">And we chose atheist for one simple reason, because if some clerk would get ahold of your paper, if you said Jewish he probably wouldn't pass it. </sentence><sentence id="1063">If it was atheist he would pass it, whatever. </sentence><sentence id="1064">And -- </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1065">Q: Now this -- you said we, this is? </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1066">A: Like in general -- ge -- a lot of Jewish people in we -- </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1067">Q: Like your sister, and -- </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1068">A: -- yeah, wa -- like a lot of Jewish in general. </sentence><sentence id="1069">And it was -- religion was not part of your daily </sentence></p><p><sentence id="1070"> life. </sentence><sentence id="1071">And -- and then, of course, when I came to the United States I had to work Saturday right from the start and it so -- it so -- </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1072">Q: And that -- you were working for a Jew in a kosher store? </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1073">A: Oh no, no, no. </sentence><sentence id="1074">You mean here in the United States? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1077">Q: Yeah. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1079">A: No, no, I never worked -- no, this was a non-kosher business. </sentence><sentence id="1080">I never worked in a kosher store. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1083">Q: Okay. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1085">A: Yeah. </sentence><sentence id="1086">No, this was my brother-in-law had a non-kosher -- </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1087">Q: Okay. </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1088">A: -- it was a -- a regular store. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1090">Q: But he worked on Saturdays. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1092">A: He worked on Saturdays. </sentence><sentence id="1093">And my brother-in-law [indecipherable] was really very agnostic, he -- he just was not into religion. </sentence><sentence id="1094">He was very smart, very well read person, but he was not religious. </sentence><sentence id="1095">But he was also very well learned in religion that -- the funniest thing, cause it was -- he was -- he went to Yeshiva and all that. </sentence><sentence id="1096">But he -- he was definitely not religious. </sentence><sentence id="1097">As a matter of fact he was -- and I have to admit, I sort of went along the same -- same route, because I worked Saturdays. </sentence><sentence id="1098">And religion to me wasn't something that I had a need for, and I still don't [indecipherable]. </sentence><sentence id="1099">So I'm -- I -- I -- now I go to services and I do go because of my grandchildren and I want to belong, so I sort of -- but I'm not a very religious person, per se. </sentence><sentence id="1100">However I live, I think in life I practice most of the Jewish teachings or -- or live my life as -- as a Jew. </sentence><sentence id="1101">I never denied being Jewish. </sentence><sentence id="1102">I never went around with a thing on the lapel like some people to -- to    prove that I'm Jewish, I don't have to prove anything. </sentence><sentence id="1103">So I never had that -- but o-otherwise my thinking is also more on a nonsectarian level in some respects, like politically I -- I am liberal, I guess you would say, politically. </sentence><sentence id="1104">But I am conservative maybe in some areas, you know, and I guess Jews may be, okay. </sentence><sentence id="1105">So I'm not exactly -- but some -- but religion really doesn't play, or never played a big part in my life. </sentence><sentence id="1106">In other words, I looked at religion more of a -- as a crutch woulds -- like someone -- I see some people do and I didn't want crutches. </sentence><sentence id="1107">So this is my way of explaining it. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1125">Q: Okay. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1127">A: Yeah. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1129">Q: We do have to turn over the tape. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1131">A: Okay. </sentence><sentence id="1132">End of Tape One, Side B    Beginning Tape Two, Side A </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1136">Q: This is tape two, side A, Martin Weiss. </sentence><sentence id="1137">I -- I want to ask you what you think about some contemporary things, like recently Joseph Lieberman was nominated to be vice president on the democratic ticket. </sentence><sentence id="1138">How -- how did you feel about that? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1142">A: Well, I -- I feel good about it, however, I have a little problem with it. </sentence><sentence id="1143">I -- I like the idea that he was chosen, and I respect him, definitely, because I think he's a capable guy, not because he's Jewish necessarily, but he has a certain -- he has a good character. </sentence><sentence id="1144">But I think they overplayed a little too much, they made a -- a lot to -- too much to do with -- the press in particular, about him being Jewish. </sentence><sentence id="1145">And I think sometimes the Jewish community made a big thing to know about him being Jewish. </sentence><sentence id="1146">And I have a think on this that all things considered, that he's Jewish, we know this and a -- but he is -- more, he is running as a citizen of the United States, not as a Jew, so they shouldn't make such a big issue of him being Jewish. </sentence><sentence id="1147">In other words it shouldn't be -- like if this was in 1900 and they were making a big to-do about him being Jewish, it's one thing, but you're talking about 2000, where I think the citizens should be -- he's a citizen of the United States. </sentence><sentence id="1148">So he -- is he running as a Jew, or is he running as a citizen? </sentence><sentence id="1149">And I think they're making too much of it, the fact that he is Jewish. </sentence><sentence id="1150">And I have to admit, I have mixed feelings because when Jimmy Carter ran, one thing I didn't like about him is because of his religion, because he was a born again. </sentence><sentence id="1151">And I thought that was -- like it clouded his thinking in terms of decision making, or whatever. </sentence><sentence id="1152">So I should apply the same thing to hi -- to Lieberman. </sentence><sentence id="1153">However, whether it's my own prejudice or what, I think Lieberman is more based -- how can I put it? </sentence><sentence id="1154">Grounded, if you will, and Jimmy Carter was more emotionally born again, but -- where Lieberman is more of a -- has a good character, plus he is jew -- he is Orthodox. </sentence><sentence id="1155">So maybe there is a difference in how I see it, </sentence></p><p><sentence id="1156"> okay? </sentence><sentence id="1157">But I don't like when they stress the Jewish part to the point where they already did. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="1158">[inaudible] </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1159">Q: There have been some portrayals of the Holocaust in movies recently, such as "Schindler's List," and there was one, "Life Can Be Beautiful." </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1160">A: Yes, I saw both of them. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1162">Q: Yeah, what -- what do you think of like -- </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1163">A: Well, I -- I -- I really thought they were both very good. " </sentence><sentence id="1164">Schindler's List" of course, was in a different -- on a different level. </sentence><sentence id="1165">I think "Schindler's List" I think was fantastic, and it didn't color anything, it gave it a picture from the raw, like -- like it -- not that I was in the same place or had the same experience, but it was -- i-it was rather -- rather well done in the sense to give the portrayal of -- of what's -- how things were at the time, or how a soldier behaved, or how -- you know, different things. </sentence><sentence id="1166">As far as the Schindler story itself, I'1l be honest with you, I never heard of it before the movie came about, I never heard of this. </sentence><sentence id="1167">So from my vantage point I never believed something like this could happen in -- in reality. </sentence><sentence id="1168">Evidently it did, so I -- you know, for me it was a -- you know, something almost hard to believe on the beginning, you know, until it was well documented, that there was a German that was -- that would do something like he did. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="1175">But the movie itself, the portrayal and the circumstances of the inmates and th -- and -- versus the officer and the -- and the part and so on. </sentence><sentence id="1176">It -- it really gave it a -- a pretty good picture of a -- what life was like. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1179">Q: And what about the other one, is it life -- </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1180">A: Oh, "Life is Beautiful." </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1181">Q: Yeah. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1183">A: That one I liked too. </sentence><sentence id="1184">At first I wasn't sure I'd like it because it was a comedy, how can you make a comedy out of it? </sentence><sentence id="1185">But all in all I thought it was really a very, very good movie. </sentence><sentence id="1186">Very, very good. </sentence><sentence id="1187">I -- I thought it was just very clever and in spite of they tried to make other movies something similar, I don't think they came even close. </sentence><sentence id="1188">This -- this one here I think was very unique for this type of movie. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1195">Q: Did you feel it was realistic, or -- </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1196">A: No, no, definitely was not realistic, but -- but it was -- </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1197">Q: What -- what did you like about it? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1199">A: Well, it's -- </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1200">Q: I didn't see the movie, I know what it's about, but I didn't see it. </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1201">A: | -- I saw it awhile ago, so I don't remember exactly. </sentence><sentence id="1202">But I liked about it because it -- it sort of conveyed a certain ca -- comedy -- a -- a sort of comical part of life, in a sense, from a satirical point of view, or something like this. </sentence><sentence id="1203">I think it has a certain satire that -- that was very illuminating as -- to some extent, sort of on a human nature, of a psyche, whatever, you know. </sentence><sentence id="1204">So in that respect I thought it was a very good movie, you know. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1209">Q: Okay. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1211">A: There was one movie [indecipherable] talking about movies that I saw recently that I really thought it was very good also. </sentence><sentence id="1212">Maybe not quite as [indecipherable] but that was "Sunshine", I don't know if you heard of it. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1215">Q: I did hear about it and it was highly recommended to me. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1217">A: And it really was one of the movies that -- the reason I thought it was very good is because it dealt with the subject of assimilation, which I found very unique to Hungarian Jews, to a lot of -- </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1219">Q: Unique to Hungarians? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1221">A: Yes. </sentence><sentence id="1222">And a -- to Hungarian Jews because they tried very hard to assimilate and very har -- tried to be very like -- almost like a intelligentsia type persona. </sentence><sentence id="1223">You know, it -- it tried to take on that -- that Germanic mantle, if you will. </sentence><sentence id="1224">In -- in the -- Hungary it's very similar in the -- in the class system and so on. </sentence><sentence id="1225">Which I was viol [indecipherable] always very violently opposed to, you know, from my point of view. </sentence><sentence id="1226">And -- </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1227">Q: You were violently opposed to -- </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1228">A: Opposed to that Hungarian Jewish mentality, you know. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1230">Q: Oh, okay. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1232">A: And one of the reasons that I thought it was good is because of the -- it deals with the subject of assimilation and a lot of Hungarian Jews were -- because of you did have a class system on Hungary, and so everybody tried to make sure they act like they were very fancy, or very uppity. </sentence><sentence id="1233">And I remember even as a kid I used to find it very, very bothersome to me. </sentence><sentence id="1234">And when I saw Hungarian, a lot of Hungarian Jews, not all, a lot of Hungarian Jews, even during the war, a lot of the Hungarians were -- punished them because they were Jewish, and they were doing things to them that they were Jewish. </sentence><sentence id="1235">They would always [indecipherable] breast that they're royal Hungarians, okay, and I found that very, very disgusting to -- if you will. </sentence><sentence id="1236">If somebody beats me I'm not going to say I love you, you know. </sentence><sentence id="1237">And basically this deals with that type of subject, you know, it's -- it's a very -- you have to understand that, the -- like in the context, you know. </sentence><sentence id="1238">And I found it very amusing that somebody had enough sense to make a movie like that. </sentence><sentence id="1239">And that's about as closest to what I think, the way I understood things, that -- that -- you know, this shows it for what it is. </sentence><sentence id="1240">That if you are persecuted and somebody berates you because you're Jewish, you don't join them and become one of them because he doesn't like you to be Jewish. </sentence><sentence id="1241">Instead you tell him to go to hell, you know, where I come from, you know. </sentence><sentence id="1242">In fact during -- even in the camps, I -- I recall, a lot of the Polish Jews -- like we always had markings where we came from. </sentence><sentence id="1243">Like I -- even though I was from Czechoslovakia [indecipherable] we were taken to camp, but from Hungary. </sentence><sentence id="1244">We were not from Czechoslovakia. </sentence><sentence id="1245">So we had a mark that we came from Hungary, a U for Ungar. </sentence><sentence id="1246">And the Polish Jews used to hate Hungarian Jews, okay, and one of the reasons was, believe it or not, for that reason. </sentence><sentence id="1247">And I was [indecipherable] when I lived among the Hungarian Jews and I moved -- and I went from Hungary, I was -- lived on Hungary. </sentence><sentence id="1248">But I had the same resentment to them, for that reason, because they always insisted what good Hungarians they were. </sentence><sentence id="1249">And me, as a Jew, I don't care where I am, if a -- a Ukrainian doesn't like me, I'm not going to say I love you, I'll hate him back. </sentence><sentence id="1250">So, you know, that's my take on it, for what it's worth. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1271">Q: So you thought that was a good portrayal of -- </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1272">A: Yes, it was very good portrayal, a really [indecipherable] very good. </sentence><sentence id="1273">It tells like of three generations, and could have had some different ways that I saw things, but nevertheless it -- it really hit the mark. </sentence><sentence id="1274">I thought it was very good. </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1275">Q: Well, I don't have any more questions. </sentence><sentence id="1276">Do you have anything that you would like to say, or can you think of anything that I neglected to ask? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1279">A: No, I -- I did -- I think you covered it all. </sentence><sentence id="1280">I would just like to say that by and large most of us were lucky to come, make a life in the U.S.. And things -- all things considered, things have changed in the United States too. </sentence><sentence id="1281">I remember when I came there were a lot of things I didn't understand about -- there was Jim Crow and a lot of other things I remember. </sentence><sentence id="1282">I used to go to night school, I used to ask, and I could never understand it. </sentence><sentence id="1283">But all things considered, that things have improved, and they're improving constantly with civil rights. </sentence><sentence id="1284">So I really think I'm fortunate that I'm here. </sentence><sentence id="1285">And I think probably most people that came from Europe the time I came would probably -- probably endorse that. </sentence><sentence id="1286">And that is going to be all that I have to say. </sentence><sentence id="1287">I think it's -- and life is good if you -- as long as you stay healthy. </sentence></p></dialogue>
