How did your experience of your childhood and your life affect the raising or your children? </sentence><sentence id="3487">Or did it? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3491">A: It a -- and I would tell you in truth two things. </sentence><sentence id="3492">I was a very caring and -- and loving father. </sentence><sentence id="3493">I am still, but I had my faults. </sentence><sentence id="3494">And part of my fault was that I grew up with a certain amount of insecurity and that insecurity strived for security to counterbalance. </sentence><sentence id="3495">And as I evolve there was a mixture as a person, both of striving for certain security in terms of at least economic security, and striving to deal with anger. </sentence><sentence id="3496">Throughout my life I think that the experience of my childhood has affected my personality in the sense that I am much more explosive or ex -- more explosive than I would have been otherwise. </sentence><sentence id="3497">I'm easy to get upset and I am -- once I explode, which is -- doesn't happen often, cause I -- I control it, or it doesn't give me rise to anger. </sentence><sentence id="3498">But when I do explode, I explode. </sentence><sentence id="3499">And so I was a father who was loving and caring an-and -- and -- and they could depend on. </sentence><sentence id="3500">But if something went wrong or something was not right, they would hear about it plenty. </sentence><sentence id="3501">And so in that sense my children have a certain amount of resentment to when I wasn't as kind or as considerate or as sensitive or as -- you know, I -- as I should have been. </sentence><sentence id="3502">On the other    </sentence></p><p><sentence id="3503"> 136 Interview with Alfred Lakritz April 3, 2008 hand, my children see -- at least my daughter does, because her two sons, our grandsons live close to us and we

with my [tape break]. </sentence><sentence id="3506">Hold on, let's start over, cause I -- </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3507">Q: No, you can keep talking. </sentence><sentence id="3508">Oh -- </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3509">A: All right. </sentence><sentence id="3510">In any event, so the question you ask is did it affect me as I grew up and matured, and it definitely does. </sentence><sentence id="3511">As a trial lawyer I also see it, you know, that I can easily fire up and take intellectual insult or attack, you understand, by somebody's -- I think -- and I do it -- once I am attacked in that way, I become very foraci -- ferocious, I become like the bulldog who -- at your ankle. </sentence><sentence id="3512">And I will have the last word. </sentence><sentence id="3513">So, yes, in one sense, you understand, I have this anger. </sentence><sentence id="3514">One thing that has helped me, truly, is many years ago I started to write some of my history, some of my memories, and that became a -- like a psychological therapy for me, in many ways. </sentence><sentence id="3515">To recount for myself -- this is strictly, you know, me, some of these events, some of these experiences, some of those feelings, you know, that I have. </sentence><sentence id="3516">And part of retelling and reminding myself and crying along the story, I think has helped me to -- to reconcile myself with the injustices that happened to my family. </sentence><sentence id="3517">And I will    137 Interview with Alfred Lakritz April 3, 2008 say that I believe the reason I became a lawyer was to spend my life, to ensure to whatever degree I had, in capability of opportunity, to make sure that other people are treated fairly, according to deeds, not according to religion or not according to fate or chance. </sentence><sentence id="3518">And after 47 years of -- as a lawyer, continuous practice of law in the state of California, I think I have done that with honor and -- so the aftereffect of the experience of the war is I haven't gone out and -- and -- and get a gun and shoot the Nazis or the Germans. </sentence><sentence id="3519">I have not taken retaliation against them or others. </sentence><sentence id="3520">I have accepted the fate that we had, never to
