<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="99">A: My sister was a very artistic person. </sentence><sentence id="100">She was four years older than I, and I know I was the bane of her existence, because I always tried to go and do whatever she did, and I bothered her friends. </sentence><sentence id="101">She played the violin beautifully, and she also played the piano. </sentence><sentence id="102">I was given some lessons, but, I was not artistic at all, and they finally gave up on me with these lessons. </sentence><sentence id="103">She continued, and she sometimes, you know, played the piano during the recitals in our home, or she played the violin. </sentence><sentence id="104">I remember one incident, it's rather funny now, it wasn't at that time. </sentence><sentence id="105">I was angry with her, I was mad at her for some reason. </sentence><sentence id="106">I don't recall why. </sentence><sentence id="107">But, I got hold of some paint and I painted all the keys on our piano so that she wouldn't be able to play. </sentence><sentence id="108">I was punished for that severely. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="119">Q: How? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="121">A: I was sent to my room, and I wasn't allowed to come out for the entire afternoon. </sentence><sentence id="122">That was a lot of -- that was a big punishment for me, because I was a free spirit, and I was sort of a tomboy, and I liked to be around, you know, outside and play with children, climb trees, and do all these sorts of things. </sentence><sentence id="123">I never painted the keyboard again. </sentence><sentence id="124">It took a long time to clean it up, and I think it cost a lot of money, too. </sentence><sentence id="125">So, that was a mean deed that I did. </sentence><sentence id="126">But I loved my sister, I adored her, and she was wonderful with me. </sentence><sentence id="127">She was very patient, but I did not understand that. </sentence><sentence id="128">I felt very secure in my home. </sentence><sentence id="129">I had so much love and so much caring that in retrospect I feel that gave me the basis, the strength, to survive. </sentence><sentence id="130">I thought about it a lot, and I think that's probably why I did -- one of the reasons I survived, I was able to survive, is because I had so much love, and security and caring in my very early childhood. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="141">Q: Can you talk a little bit more about your father and these walks that you took? </sentence><sentence id="142">Was this a regular -- </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="145">A: Yes, and, I mean, the way it was arranged, my father traveled to Lvov, to the university, and  now and then he would allow my sister or me to go with him to the university, but we never went together. </sentence><sentence id="146">These were times, private times, for my father and me, or for my father and my sister. </sentence><sentence id="147">And, he, I guess now when I realize, he spoke to us a little bit on a higher level than we were able to -- than I was able to understand, but it was always very uplifting for me to be with my father one on one, just to have him to myself, and he would tell me stories, all sorts of stories, and he always tried, I don't know, it's almost -- it's scary to say this, but it's almost as if he knew that our time would not be long enough, and he tried to give me as much as he could of the knowledge that I could absorb. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="151">Q: Before we go on, could we show the picture for a second of your parents and your sister, please? </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="171">A: We would go, there was a great big park on the -- well, it wasn't quite in the middle of the town, but there was a park, and this park, I mean, was with trees, you know, and flowers, and shrubs, and this is where people used to go when they wanted to take a walk. </sentence><sentence id="172">And on the edge of that park there lived the landlord of the -- the rich landlord of the town, she owned a lot of property. </sentence><sentence id="173">She was a very old, old lady, and I remember she always wore black. </sentence><sentence id="174">She was an old lady, she was a widow, and all she had around was just servants to help her. </sentence><sentence id="175">But, the park was on the edge of her estate, and that's where I would take walks with my mother, just she and I. We would go sometimes, the whole family, too, but our time one on one was very important to my parents, and they did give us time one on one. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="181">Q: Do you remember any conversations you had with your mother? </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="199">A: No, no. </sentence><sentence id="200">There was a young woman who would come in and stay with us. </sentence><sentence id="201">No, not my father, no. </sentence><sentence id="202">He never did dishes, and he never did anything in the house whatsoever, you know, as far as helping out, no. </sentence><sentence id="203">My father had a very wonderful library. </sentence><sentence id="204">His private library was his first love after his family I think, and teaching, and he collected rare books. </sentence><sentence id="205">His books, I mean some of them were first editions, and all sorts of rare precious books. </sentence><sentence id="206">And, people in the entire area knew that he collected these books, so when they found a rare book they would come to him and he would pay through the nose to get these books. </sentence><sentence id="207">And often he would go into his library and read, or bring out a book for us to enjoy, but we always knew we had to wash our hands, and we were not allowed to touch these books without his permission. </sentence><sentence id="208">It was a very wonderful household, perhaps, nowadays it might seem too strict for the way we live here in the United States, but we didn't know any different. </sentence><sentence id="209">I mean, we accepted it, we loved it, and we gained an awful lot from that kind of upbringing, I believe. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="221">Q: And, both you and your sister were part of what was going on in the house most of the time. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="227">A: Well, I was a pain in the neck always, and I was into everything. </sentence><sentence id="228">I remember one time during Passover, there was a -- for the first Seder, which is a festive occasion, our parents gave my sister and me gold lockets with the Star of David to wear on our necks, and I promptly lost mine, and no one could sit down at the table until we found that locket, because that's what I wanted. </sentence><sentence id="229">And, I was a little spoiled I guess. </sentence><sentence id="230">We did find the locket, I mean the Star of David and the chain, and I did not remember that occurrence until we went to Israel in 1985 and one of my father's former students reminded me, because he was one of the guests at that dinner. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="243">A: Yes, yes, I did, yes. </sentence><sentence id="244">We started collecting, I think I knew how to read when I was four, because we -- it was stressed, and it was part of our make up, that as soon as you knew how to speak, and walk, and talk, you had to start acquiring knowledge. </sentence><sentence id="245">My father was almost fixed on that, I mean it was a fixation with him, and he kept saying that knowledge and education no one can take away from you. </sentence><sentence id="246">And, again, in retrospect, I didn't realize it, but now I realize that the education that my father acquired was all done out of Poland, the  reason being, in Poland there were quotas, so he had to go outside to acquire his education and to him it was priceless and he tried to, I mean, I guess, give it to us, the feeling that education is very important. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="271">Q: How did you come by this pen- knife? </sentence><sentence id="272">That seems unusual. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="275">A: I don't know. </sentence><sentence id="276">I just liked to have a penknife with me, and I asked for it, and my father and mother debated, I guess, but they finally gave it to me when I was about 5-1/2 or six years old. </sentence><sentence id="277">I had to show it every day when I'd come back, you know, from playing, that I knew how to use it, yes, and ever since, it's almost, I have a penknife with me now. </sentence><sentence id="278">I never go anyplace without a little knife. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="295">Q: Were you hearing things about what was going on in Germany even as a five and six year old? </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="296">A: I guess I was hearing, but it was sort of -- I did not realize what it was all about, but politics was part of every meeting, of every discussion, of every dinner, of every gathering in our home, yes. </sentence><sentence id="297">But, I just didn't want to have anything to do with it. </sentence><sentence id="298">It was scary, and maybe that's why, but I just did not pay much attention to it, but it was discussed continually, yes. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="398">A: In 1939 when the war broke out, September 1, the Russians -- the Soviet -- I mean at that point, now I know that Hitler and Stalin had an agreement. </sentence><sentence id="399">They divided Poland in half. </sentence><sentence id="400">We lived in the eastern part of Poland, and, consequently, the Soviet Union took over our part of Poland. </sentence><sentence id="401">I remember it happened maybe two or three days after the actual war started, and I remember long lines of people, these were the refugees who were trying to escape from the German part of Poland, they would -- I mean, there were people with bundles, children, and I mean it was a very sad picture, and that's what is in my mind, of all these people walking on the street, not even on the sidewalk because there were so many of them. </sentence><sentence id="402">And then, when they stopped, that's when the Russians came in, and there they were the soldiers and tanks. </sentence><sentence id="403">People greeted them with flowers, very happy, and it was sort of exciting for me, not  realizing what was happening, but there was no blood shed in our town, you could hear the sound, I guess, of guns and all in the background, but for a very short time. </sentence><sentence id="404">They came in, and as far as I know, nothing really changed for us with one exception, the official language became Russian instead of Polish, because -- and that was no problem, because most Europeans are bi- or tri-lingual because of necessity, our neighbors all around us were speaking a different language, so that was no problem. </sentence><sentence id="405">And, my father still had his job. </sentence><sentence id="406">I mean, he kept his position at the university. </sentence><sentence id="407">I'm sure there were some very drastic changes, but I did not realize them. </sentence><sentence id="408">Some of the people who had businesses in stores, I guess, in town, they are the ones who probably felt the change more drastically than I did, because most of the stores, or all, became nationalized. </sentence><sentence id="409">And, at first we had much of everything, and then all of a sudden things started to -- there were shortages of bread, milk, clothing, but that was not my problem, that was my parents" problems, and I did not sense any perceptible change in anything. </sentence><sentence id="410">The Russian language came after a little while, it wasn't difficult, and they did not single out one particular group of people, but I guess they did, only I didn't realize it, they singled out the people who were materialistically rich. </sentence><sentence id="411">And, now and then, I understand, there were people who all of a sudden would disappear at night and we wouldn't know, you know, what happened to them. </sentence><sentence id="412">These were the people that were, I guess, driven out to Siberia. </sentence><sentence id="413">These were the -- they called them the Kulacks, the rich people, but we were not materialistically rich, and my father was an intellectual, and he was left alone. </sentence><sentence id="414">I know one thing, that going to synagogue was a little more difficult. </sentence><sentence id="415">My father paid more attention not to be so visible in the synagogue as he was before, and I'm sure that was because of the Soviet occupation. </sentence><sentence id="416">Other than that, I really did not see many changes. </sentence><sentence id="417">Again, we still had meetings, the people congregated in our home. </sentence><sentence id="418">There were some disappearances. </sentence><sentence id="419">The Polish Kshondz, the Polish priest, wasn't there anymore. </sentence><sentence id="420">There were still the big beautiful Kosciol, that's the church, the Polish church, which was right in the middle of the city on the main street, and it was a magnificent building. </sentence><sentence id="421">It looked almost like a palace, and, again, there were old chestnut trees all around that Kosciol, and across the street there was a beautiful statue of Swienta Matka Boska, and that means Saint Mary, the mother of Jesus, it was a beautiful statue, and it was always surrounded with flowers, even in the winter time. </sentence><sentence id="422">And, that sort of got neglected when the Russians came in. </sentence><sentence id="423">The Ukrainian Tzerkev, that's their church, was very close to our home, and that was also a magnificent building with the onion-shaped domes in gold, and I noticed that there were not as many people attending as they did before the war. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="450">Q: And you noticed that then? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="452">A: Yes, but I didn't question it at that time. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="454">Q: Were you frightened during this period? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="456">A: No, no, I was not frightened. </sentence><sentence id="457">In the beginning, it was sort of exciting, you know, all these changes, I was not frightened. </sentence><sentence id="458">We were, I sensed that my parents were very disappointed, because, apparently, our papers were almost ready for our immigration to the United States I remember, I'm not quite sure, but I think it was in 1938, that we all traveled to Warsaw for  interviews, and I guess we went to the Consulate, you know, getting ready to immigrate to America, but, of course, the war interrupted all that. </sentence><sentence id="459">And, I sensed that my parents were disappointed. </sentence><sentence id="460">I know one thing that happened. </sentence><sentence id="461">In 1939, I think it was 1939, there was the World's Fair in New York, and my father was offered two tickets, he received two invitations through the university to attend the World's Fair. </sentence><sentence id="462">My father asked for four tickets, and, of course, they didn't give him the four tickets. </sentence><sentence id="463">So, that's ironic and very sad for me now. </sentence><sentence id="464">I remember taking only one trip to Lvov, to the university, during that occupation. </sentence><sentence id="465">I don't know why. </sentence><sentence id="466">I mean, during the Russian occupation, only one time, and there was a speaker, and I mean, of course, it was all in Russian, you know, and I didn't have as good a time as I used to at the university. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="478">Q: Do you remember why? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="480">A: No, I don't know why, but I did not have as good a time. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="482">Q: Your father didn't go to Krakow anymore? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="484">A: No, that was another thing that, again, I mean these things come out only when people question me, because I don't, you know, realize how important it was. </sentence><sentence id="485">He used to be a visiting professor at the Jagelonski University, which is a famous old university in Krakow, Poland. </sentence><sentence id="486">And, when the Russians became our -- when they occupied our part of Poland, my father's visits or trips to Krakow stopped, yes. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="490">Q: Was your mother working during this time? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="492">A: No, she was not working, no, I mean working for pay, no, she was not, no. </sentence><sentence id="493">So, I mean, we didn't have money problems, but we didn't live a very -- we lived a comfortable life. </sentence><sentence id="494">I didn't know any better. </sentence><sentence id="495">We used to get shoes twice a year, in the summer and winter, that's it. </sentence><sentence id="496">And, I mean, you know, everything was just regimented and very -- not frugal, but my mother -- my parents were very careful with the money because there wasn't that much money. </sentence><sentence id="497">We lived comfortably, and I wasn't lacking in anything, and it was a wonderful life. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="504">Q: When the Russians were occupying, your sister was a teenager at this time. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="512">A: No, there were no boyfriends per se, but there were boys who would come to the house, but there was no dating. </sentence><sentence id="513">Everybody went in groups, and that's when I started going on my own. </sentence><sentence id="514">I was old enough, I think, I guess, what was I, eight or something -- </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="518">Q: "41? </sentence><sentence id="519"> 0 </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="522">A: -- no, "41, that's "39 to "41, nine, ten, at that point I already had my own friends and I didn't bother my sister too much, she was far too old for me at that point. </sentence><sentence id="523">But, no, there was no dating, but there were activities at home, and we used to observe Imieniny. </sentence><sentence id="524">Imieniny is like a birthday. </sentence><sentence id="525">It's actually, it means giving a name, and they had Imieniny every week it seems like one of her group, you know, had a party, and at school there were parties, and there was a very active social life, and there were lots of activities. </sentence><sentence id="526">She had a bicycle, my sister, and that was rather -- that was a luxury. </sentence><sentence id="527">I never learned how to ride a bicycle, and I did not have one of my own. </sentence><sentence id="528">I was supposedly to have gotten her's later on, but it never came to be. </sentence><sentence id="529">And, we used to go on Wycieczki, and that's like trips, I mean, just go to the park, you know, picnics, and from school, these were organized things, organized activities, and then we did it also on our own, and there were many sports events. </sentence><sentence id="530">I don't know, it wasn't football, I think it was soccer, and there was, I want to say softball, it's not softball, with a net, what do you call it, volleyball, yes, volleyball. </sentence><sentence id="531">There were all sorts of activities and, I mean, games that we used to play, and in school I remember, there was a huge school yard, and we would go out for there for hours for our physical education, there was physical education from the time you were in kindergarten, and it's organized, you know, and I mean we used to play all sorts of games and these were very entertaining and very fulfilling. </sentence><sentence id="532">We used to run, have games of running, and walking, singing, and it was a lot of fun. </sentence><sentence id="533">And, I guess when the Russians came in they just took over the schools and all, but they continued with the same activities. </sentence><sentence id="534">There was one thing that I would like to bring out, too. </sentence><sentence id="535">I wanted very much to become a Brownie, and Jews were not permitted to be in the scouting movement. </sentence><sentence id="536">That was - - when I say there was no anti-semitism, that is the one sign, I didn't realize why, but Jewish boys and girls were not allowed to become Boy Scouts and Girl Scouts, and I missed that because of the physical -- I mean, they had so many physical games, you know, and they did their activities, they were very fulfilling to me, very appealing to me, and I could not participate in that. </sentence><sentence id="537">I know I'm jumping from one thing to another. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="554">Q: When did life change drastically, 1941? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="556">A: In 1941, early summer, life took a turn for the worse. </sentence><sentence id="557">Apparently, my parents did hear, and the whole community, they heard what was going on in the German part of Poland, but I don't know, but it seems, of course, I didn't know then, but it seems no one could believe the atrocities that took place, and so, we just went on with life as it was. </sentence><sentence id="558">In 1941, in the summer, all of a sudden we heard bombs and the airplanes flying overhead, and after a few days the Germans marched in very much like the Russians did a few years before, and, again, I mean, there was no bloodshed as far as I can recall. </sentence><sentence id="559">They came in with tanks. </sentence><sentence id="560">They came in, the soldiers looked much -- they were much better dressed, and they came in and people again greeted them with flowers, and they were very welcome in our town. </sentence><sentence id="561">A lot of people were very happy that the Germans came in, and that the Russians were leaving. </sentence><sentence id="562">If there were fights, they were outside of the town, so, really, there was very little fighting in Horochow. </sentence><sentence id="563">But in 1941, early summer, was when the world became completely topsy-turvy for the Jews. </sentence><sentence id="564">When the Germans came in, from the very beginning, they concentrated and they let it be known that the Jews are the ones that they are going to try to murder, all of us. </sentence><sentence id="565">What they did, I don't recall if it was the first or second day after they came into Horochow, they went  1 around with a list and they looked for people by name. </sentence><sentence id="566">These were people who were leaders, the Jewish leaders, and my beloved father was among them. </sentence><sentence id="567">They came into the house, they burst in, and they asked for him, and my father saw them, he tried to get out the back way. </sentence><sentence id="568">They caught him, and they led him away. </sentence><sentence id="569">He never even said goodbye. </sentence><sentence id="570">I'll never forget that look in his eyes. </sentence><sentence id="571">And, this way, they took away about 300 of the Jewish leaders. </sentence><sentence id="572">The next day, it seems every day from then on there were decrees. </sentence><sentence id="573">At first, it was for the Jews, we always had to congregate in the marketplace, that's the central place. </sentence><sentence id="574">And, each day there were new decrees. </sentence><sentence id="575">First, we had to bring all the gold, all the silver, all the radios, all the furs, all the rugs, the Persian rugs, everything that was of any value, we had to bring to the marketplace to give to the Germans. </sentence><sentence id="576">It was an organized thing, and everyone, there was so much chaos, and so much panic, that it's almost like people were going in a trance. </sentence><sentence id="577">All of a sudden, most of the heads of the families were gone. </sentence><sentence id="578">We didn't know where, when, or if we'll ever see our fathers and brothers again. </sentence><sentence id="579">I know now that when they took my father away, my mother was still a very young woman and she turned gray overnight, but she tried very much to camouflage her feelings, and she did not want us to feel the despair that she probably felt, and everyone else there, too. </sentence><sentence id="580">We were gathered every day for different things. </sentence><sentence id="581">First, I mean, we had to part with all our dearest possessions. </sentence><sentence id="582">Then, they gathered us in the marketplace and we had to watch when they burned the main synagogue and the little -- there were little, they call them schtiebels, they were separate synagogues. </sentence><sentence id="583">They burned all our Torahs. </sentence><sentence id="584">They burned all the books of prayer, and we had to stand and watch. </sentence><sentence id="585">Everyone who was over 14 years of age was sent to slave labor, and that was right from the beginning after they, you know, ordered us to bring all the things to the marketplace. </sentence><sentence id="586">My mother and my sister ended up working. </sentence><sentence id="587">My mother was digging ditches, and so was my sister, and they marched them, they met at the marketplace in the early morning and they were marched back at night, and sometimes both my sister and my mother were black and blue from beatings, from, you know, awful treatment that they endured during the day. </sentence><sentence id="588">This lasted about two weeks. </sentence><sentence id="589">I'm not quite sure of the exact time, but then one day people were told not to go to work, and we were given approximately an hour to take whatever we could carry with us, and we had to congregate again at the marketplace. </sentence><sentence id="590">There, we were told we are going to move, we are going to live in a new place, and this was the ghetto. </sentence><sentence id="591">They marched us into one of the poorest sections of town, and we were assigned a place to live.

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="648">Q: What happened to you when he left? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="650">A: His face was very sad and there were tears in his eyes. </sentence><sentence id="651">He tried to put on a jacket, a coat jacket, and they wouldn't allow him, so he went in his shirt sleeves. </sentence><sentence id="652">It was almost a bewildered look, but he turned his head, and they held him on each side, there was a Ukrainian, there were Germans, but the Ukrainians were the ones who grabbed him, and these were people, I'm sure, that he knew. </sentence><sentence id="653">I don't know who they were, but my mother said she knew who they were. </sentence><sentence id="654">And, there was a look, I can't describe it, but it was great sadness, and bewilderment, and love. </sentence><sentence id="655">It was a mix of many feelings in that one last look. </sentence><sentence id="656">And, my mother gathered my sister and me, we just looked and we started crying. </sentence><sentence id="657">And, that's the way they took him away. </sentence><sentence id="658">They took him out the back, the kitchen door, not in the front. </sentence><sentence id="659">It was a very poignant, very sad moment in our lives, but I don't know, but my mother, whatever she felt, she didn't show. </sentence><sentence id="660">She right away tried to tell us how wonderful it will be when we are all together again, from the very first. </sentence><sentence id="661">And, the next morning she got up, she was gray, completely gray. </sentence><sentence id="662">This lasted, again, all these horrible things, lasted for about two weeks, and then when we were herded into the ghetto life took a new turn for the worse. </sentence><sentence id="663">My mother and my sister were still marched to work every morning. </sentence><sentence id="664">The people, like myself, under 14 and very old, were left to ourselves. </sentence><sentence id="665">The ghetto was completely enclosed by a high fence that was reinforced with barbed wire. </sentence><sentence id="666">There were two gates, one in the back, I mean, one in the front and one in the back, and one could not enter or leave without a written pass. </sentence><sentence id="667">We had to wear the Star of David on the front of our clothing and on the back, for some reason it had to be yellow in color. </sentence><sentence id="668">Everything was very regimented. </sentence><sentence id="669">The Germans appointed a Judenrat. </sentence><sentence id="670">The Judenrat was a group of men who were sort of in charge of the ghetto, and anything and everything that the Germans wanted from the Jews they went through the Judenrat, because it was beneath them to go to an ordinary Jew to request things, so they did it all through the Judenrat. </sentence><sentence id="671">This is also a very sad occurrence, because here our brothers, our own kind, who are requested, "I need 200 people," you know, and they have to make the selection who these 200 people will be to deliver to the Germans, and at that point we didn't know what was going to happen to these people. </sentence><sentence id="672">Every now and then in the ghetto there were, they called them Lapanka, and these were round-ups again. </sentence><sentence id="673">The Germans would drive by with a van or a truck, and they would grab people randomly, and I mean it didn't matter if you were a worker, or if you were an old person, or a child, and these people would never be heard from again. </sentence><sentence id="674">And, sometimes during when people were working, during work, and consequently that made it very, very difficult. </sentence><sentence id="675">Every morning when I would get up and I would say goodbye to my sister and my mother, I never really knew whether or not they would return to the ghetto that evening, because they could have had a Lapanka at work. </sentence><sentence id="676">I forgot to tell you, about my father's library, and this was before we were gathered into the ghetto. </sentence><sentence id="677">One day, that was during the two weeks of our sort of being still neither here nor there, one day a van pulled up in front of our house and several Germans came out, very  3 well dressed, and they knocked on the door and came in, and demanded to know where my father's library was. </sentence><sentence id="678">And, my mother showed them, that was after my father was already gone, and they came in and meticulously took every single, precious book with them, and they even gave my mother a receipt for these books. </sentence><sentence id="679">And, that was one time when they addressed her as "Gnadige Frau"! </sentence><sentence id="680">at that point she was a lady, not a Jew, because she had all these precious books that they appropriated. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="712">Q: They took something else, didn't they? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="714">A: Oh, yes. </sentence><sentence id="715">My father was given a gift from some of his students. </sentence><sentence id="716">It was, I guess, a relief map, you call it, it was built from plywood and it had every continent, every panel had a different continent, all the continents of the world, and that was in his study, that was not in the library, and when they saw that they took that off and they took that with them, too, and this was, it's almost as if they took everything that was the dearest to my father. </sentence><sentence id="717">First they took my father, and they then took all the dear possessions of his, and they drove away. </sentence><sentence id="718">Interestingly, at that point, it comes -- I mean, one has to think, how did they know about that? </sentence><sentence id="719">The local populace must have told them, somebody must have told them. </sentence><sentence id="720">These were our neighbors, our friends, who worked with my father and mother, and we considered them friends, and all of a sudden they turned against us, and for no reason at all, and to this day I cannot understand why they had to be so mean and ugly. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="742">Q: Charlene, can you describe the day that you moved from your house into the ghetto, what that was like? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="744">A: Yes. </sentence><sentence id="745">I would go a little bit back, because as soon as they took my father away, and then they took his library away, my mother came home from work one day, one evening, and whatever we still had, a little bit of jewelry, some gold coins, she sewed in some of these coins and jewelry in each of our clothing, and her own, and my sister's, and mine, and I sort of thought it was really exciting and fun at that point. </sentence><sentence id="746">I said, "Why are you doing that?" </sentence><sentence id="747">She says, "For a rainy day." </sentence><sentence id="748">And, I mean, these clothes were -- it was my coat, I had a heavy coat, and she says, "Wherever we go, whatever we do, you take that coat." </sentence><sentence id="749">And, that's what she told my sister, too. </sentence><sentence id="750">But, anyway, so we did have these things sewn in the lining of our clothing, and when the time came that we had to go to the ghetto, we were herded into the ghetto, we paid attention to take these pieces of clothing with us. </sentence><sentence id="751">What I grabbed, I remember, a pillow, and some underwear. </sentence><sentence id="752">I was wearing my high-top shoes, even though it was in the summer, and I took that winter coat and a sweater, and I don't recall, no toys, none whatsoever, and I don't know what my -- my sister tried to grab her violin, but my mother told her to leave it, and she took some food, we had dried noodles and some food that could be -- that wasn't perishable. </sentence><sentence id="753">My mother took some pots and pans and some of her clothing and one suitcase, and I don't know what she threw into that suitcase, but that's all I remember that we took with us, nothing else. </sentence><sentence id="754">She took some blankets, I think. </sentence><sentence id="755">And, when we were thrown into that ghetto, we were assigned one room. </sentence><sentence id="756">It was a large building, actually as far as I recall it was a three-story building, it was in the poorest section of town, and it was in great disrepair. </sentence><sentence id="757">We were assigned this one room, and there were three other families with us to share that one room. </sentence><sentence id="758">The entire house had one bathroom and one kitchen, and the running water was almost nothing, I mean there was very little water, there was no warm water, only cold water. </sentence><sentence id="759">If you wanted hot water you had to heat it on a wooden stove, and there was no wood. </sentence><sentence id="760">There was not enough room to sleep everyone on the floor in our room, and so the women, and there were two boys in that group, found some wood and they built bunks, I guess, so that we slept like in threes, because there was not enough room for all of us. </sentence><sentence id="761">Most of the people in our room were people who went to work. </sentence><sentence id="762">There were only, I think, three, four of us who were not quite 14 years of age, and we were the ones who were left at home in the house to fend for ourselves in the very beginning. </sentence><sentence id="763">The people who did not go to work did not receive any rations. </sentence><sentence id="764">The rations were very meager. </sentence><sentence id="765">I am not quite sure of the weights, but it was like maybe two slices of bread, some oleo, a little bit of sugar, and I think some vegetables. </sentence><sentence id="766">I don't think there was any meat at all, and these rations, first they were given daily, then when the Judenrat organized everything it was done once a week, and usually by the second or third day everything was gone. </sentence><sentence id="767">My mother and sister shared their rations with me. </sentence><sentence id="768">It was very difficult, and in the beginning there was an awful lot of chaos. </sentence><sentence id="769">The kids, like myself, the younger, were really left with nothing to do. </sentence><sentence id="770">We were very hungry. </sentence><sentence id="771">We were dirty. </sentence><sentence id="772">We were unsupervised, and it was very difficult to comprehend what really went on. </sentence><sentence id="773">We ate only at night, when our parents or whoever took care of us came home, and all day there was nothing to do. </sentence><sentence id="774">Consequently, the kids, like myself,  5 decided that we had to go outside and try and get some food. </sentence><sentence id="775">It was an unbelievable feeling to be hungry, and it's a hunger that is very difficult to describe, for a child to be hungry and there was nothing to eat. </sentence><sentence id="776">And, I was asked many times what did we play, what did we do, we pretended, and what we played about mostly is about food. </sentence><sentence id="777">We talked about food, we pretended about -- I mean, everything centered around food. </sentence><sentence id="778">And so, ingeniously, we dug out two holes in the fences, below the fences, so that a child could sneak out to the other side and, you know, take off the Star of David and try to act like a normal human being and see if we could obtain food. </sentence><sentence id="779">And, now and then, children brought home some food back to the ghetto. </sentence><sentence id="780">I did it many times. </sentence><sentence id="781">It was very dangerous, because if one was caught one would pay with life. </sentence><sentence id="782">I mean, this was the order, to shoot to kill the person, the perpetrator. </sentence><sentence id="783">I was very lucky, and now and then I would bring a slice of bread, I would bring a carrot, or a potato, or an egg, and these were very, very great achievements. </sentence><sentence id="784">My mother made me promise that I wouldn't do it anymore, but I disobeyed. </sentence><sentence id="785">One time -- no, let me go back to the ghetto again, in the very beginning, my mother and several other women organized a clandestine school for children who were below the age of work, and it was a wonderful thing because we had something to look forward to. </sentence><sentence id="786">It made us forget about the hunger and about all the inadequacies of living such a primitive life, and this school existed for several months. </sentence><sentence id="787">Several of the ladies, including my mother, would barter on the outside and they came home with crayons, with writing paper, with some books, and I mean they would tell stories, we would sing and we would color, and it was something to look forward to. </sentence><sentence id="788">It was really...if it only could have lasted, but it didn't. </sentence><sentence id="789">It lasted a few months, and pretty soon there was not enough jewelry or money to barter with, there were no more supplies, school supplies, and the morale sort of sagged in the ghetto. </sentence><sentence id="790">The women came home, they were too tired, and too hungry, and too beaten up to be able to go and put on a happy face for us kids. </sentence><sentence id="791">So, that disintegrated into nothing also. </sentence><sentence id="792">In the very beginning, there was like a -- not really a hospital, but there was one room, and there was still one doctor in the ghetto, and somehow they obtained some medical supplies. </sentence><sentence id="793">And so, in the beginning there was sort of a little hospital when people got sick or needed some medications. </sentence><sentence id="794">But shortly after the ghetto came into being, the doctor was grabbed in one of the round-ups, in the Lapanka, and that was the end of the hospital. </sentence><sentence id="795">From then on, people who became ill, first they stayed in their rooms, then there was no room in the rooms and you'd walk down the ghetto street and you would see people sick, or dying, or dead, and there was a committee within the Judenrat who was in charge of burying the dead. </sentence><sentence id="796">And, sometimes they wouldn't get to these people for days, because it was -- there were so many of them, and there was a lot of work to be done. </sentence><sentence id="797">It was a very sad sight. </sentence><sentence id="798">When one imagines the ghetto was completely cut off from the entire world, there was no newspaper, there were no radios, there was no mail, it was like we were in Mars, not on the planet Earth. </sentence><sentence id="799">The only way people did get information was through the workers who were going out of the ghetto and they somehow would gather rumors and information from the people on the outside. </sentence><sentence id="800">In retrospect, I think my mother did a super human job in keeping my sister, and me fairly healthy and sane. </sentence><sentence id="801">It was very demoralizing to live in these conditions when we had to share one bathroom, and this building, this was one of the bigger buildings in the ghetto, there were about 100 people, and just to go to the bathroom was a horrendous experience. </sentence><sentence id="802">There was no water to cleanse oneself. </sentence><sentence id="803">It was very difficult. </sentence><sentence id="804">I remember one time when my sister and my mother, when we got into the ghetto,  6 my sister was very lucky to obtain a new job. </sentence><sentence id="805">My mother was still digging ditches and repairing roads, but my sister was able to get into an old warehouse where young women were knitting and crocheting articles of clothing for the soldiers on the front, and that was a very, a choice job because you were sitting inside and, you know, it wasn't labor, you know, manual labor. </sentence><sentence id="806">One time she was ill, and she couldn't go in to work, and so, she gave me her pass and I was to take her place in the warehouse. </sentence><sentence id="807">And so, I gathered in front of the gate with all the other young women and passed as my sister. </sentence><sentence id="808">No one paid any attention, you know, as long as you had the piece of paper. </sentence><sentence id="809">And so, when we got into the warehouse I took her place, her friends showed me where she was sitting, and picked up a scarf that she started knitting the day before. </sentence><sentence id="810">I was not very good at what I was doing, and one of the German guards started staring at me intently, and he kept watching me for quite a while, and then he started cursing and yelling at me, and I know he said I wasn't doing it fast enough, and I still didn't do it much faster because I didn't know how, and he got very annoyed with me. </sentence><sentence id="811">He grabbed one of the knitting needles out of my hand and pushed it in my forefinger, and this is what it looks like now. </sentence><sentence id="812">I passed out, and I got home that evening and that was a bitter lesson for never to try and take my sister's place for the ration that she would have lost that day. </sentence><sentence id="813">There were many awful incidents and occurrences in the ghetto. </sentence><sentence id="814">One time there were three men, young men, who tried to escape from work. </sentence><sentence id="815">They were working and they were trying to make their way to freedom they hoped, instead they were caught and the Germans hung them in the ghetto. </sentence><sentence id="816">It wasn't the marketplace, but there was a central place where we all were forced to gather and to watch the hangings. </sentence><sentence id="817">And then, they let them hang there for several days, and each morning the people who went to work had to march by and turn their head to the right, and they were forced to look at these poor victims. </sentence><sentence id="818">There was one time when I snuck out of the ghetto and I was lucky to obtain two eggs, and I remember I was wearing a dress with little puffed sleeves, and I put an egg in each sleeve and tried to make my way back into the ghetto. </sentence><sentence id="819">I paid for these two eggs with a small gold ring that had a ruby in it that my mother sewed into my coat. </sentence><sentence id="820">I was quite proud of myself, and I just could picture my mother's and my sister's faces when they came home and we had two eggs to eat. </sentence><sentence id="821">Just before I was entering the hole, the camouflaged hole back into the ghetto, a Ukrainian guard spotted me, and he ran over and he started screaming at me, and he found the two eggs and threw them on the sidewalk and made me kneel down and rubbed my face in them, and screamed at me to get right back where I belonged and never to show my face again on the outside. </sentence><sentence id="822">I was petrified, and I didn't give away the hiding place, the hiding entrance, I marched back into the ghetto, or he threw me back into the ghetto and that was the end of that. </sentence><sentence id="823">I guess he was one of the kind ones because he could have killed me, or he should have killed me. </sentence><sentence id="824">When I told my mother and my sister that evening about my experience, she just hugged me. </sentence><sentence id="825">A few days later, one of my best friends, and I can't name her because she has family and I did not tell them about that, I didn't have the heart, she snuck out of the ghetto, and she obtained some bread, and as she was trying to get back into the ghetto she was caught and she was murdered. </sentence><sentence id="826">They displayed her body in the ghetto for about a week, and we were forced to march by and look at her, and they didn't allow the burial society to bury her. </sentence><sentence id="827">These were lessons that we learned every day, and, yet, the will to live was so strong that everyone tried to survive as best as one could, and took chances, because there was no other way. </sentence><sentence id="828">I snuck out many times after that and was lucky. </sentence><sentence id="829">And, again, even though I  7 promised my mother I wouldn't, but hunger is a very strong motivator. </sentence><sentence id="830">I don't know if there are any adjectives with which to describe what real hunger is. </sentence><sentence id="831">It's a pain, a physical pain to be hungry, where your insides become like a knot and your brain stops working. </sentence><sentence id="832">There was no brain, it just says hunger, I want to eat, I want to eat no matter what, I want to eat. </sentence><sentence id="833">That went on for a long time, like an eternity, but it seems like when winter came it was doubly difficult, because we had to contend, not only with hunger and horrible conditions of living, but there was the cold, there was no wood to heat the places, there was not enough clothing to protect us, and in spite of my mother's support and love there was creeping in a feeling of despair, and there was a lot of demoralization in the ghetto. </sentence><sentence id="834">People started being hopeless. </sentence><sentence id="835">There was no way out, it seemed like. </sentence><sentence id="836">But, again, the strongest survived, and, apparently, my sister, and I, and my mother were the few of the strongest because we did survive. </sentence><sentence id="837">I don't know how. </sentence><sentence id="838">I think it was, again, my mother's constant preaching almost and telling us not to give up hope. </sentence><sentence id="839">She was an amazing person. </sentence><sentence id="840">She tried to instill hope where there was little hope, and she tried to make up stories and keep us entertained with everything that had a happy ending. </sentence><sentence id="841">How she felt inside we don't know, I know that she didn't feel that way, but she tried to transmit it and give it to us, and it did work, somehow it did work. </sentence><sentence id="842">Somehow we lived through until the next spring, and by that time I think the ghetto was probably diminished in population by half. </sentence><sentence id="843">A lot of people died of starvation and cold. </sentence><sentence id="844">Some people were taken away in the round-ups, and others died because they gave up, not because they were ill, but they just gave up. </sentence><sentence id="845">They just felt they didn't have anymore strength to fight all these obstacles of life. </sentence><sentence id="846">And so, the Germans, every day there were different decrees. </sentence><sentence id="847">I mean, they made life more miserable. </sentence><sentence id="848">It was almost a design every day to torture by different decrees. </sentence><sentence id="849">I mean, they would demand money. </sentence><sentence id="850">They would demand more gold. </sentence><sentence id="851">They knew we gave it all up, no, we had to do more, we had to give more. </sentence><sentence id="852">It was just -- the Judenrat had a terrible time trying, you know, to be the mediator between the Germans and the Jews, and there were times, I understand, where they were having terrible arguments and discussions with our Jewish people in the ghetto, because it's as if they sat in judgment what to do and who to send out, and they really had no choice in what they were doing. </sentence><sentence id="853">By early spring, our community dwindled to about, as I said, half, and the Germans decided we had too much room and we were too comfortable in our ghetto, and so, one day they again gathered us all in the little place, it wasn't the marketplace because that was outside the ghetto, and we were told again that we can take whatever we wanted and whatever we could carry with us. </sentence><sentence id="854">By that time, our possessions were even more meager than they were last fall, and we marched again to a new place. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="976">A: Well, predominantly women, and old people, and young kids, yes. </sentence><sentence id="977">There were several men, yes. </sentence><sentence id="978">How did they get along? </sentence><sentence id="979">They tolerated one another. </sentence><sentence id="980">The women tried to do -- to be the  8 soothe-sayers. </sentence><sentence id="981">They tried to appease everyone and to keep quiet, but tempers were rising, people were very argumentative, and people were hungry, and they were in pain, and they were not -- </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="988">Q: We have to stop for a minute. </sentence><sentence id="989">There's a problem with the level. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="992"> A? -- </sentence><sentence id="993">from brothers, my father helped them escape, and he's there, he says, "Can you tell me really what happened to my mother, sister and father?" </sentence><sentence id="994">His father was taken away with mine, too, but his sister was the one who was caught, and I couldn't tell him that, and I never did, so that's why I don't mention names because you never know, you know. </sentence><sentence id="995">But, that was her name, her name was Duba, actually, Dvora, you know, Duba, yes, but I didn't have the heart. </sentence><sentence id="996">But, we had a discussion, my husband and I, maybe I should have told him the truth, what good would that do? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1002">Q: Are you rolling? </sentence><sentence id="1003">Okay. </sentence><sentence id="1004">When we were breaking, you were talking about what the household was like. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1008">A: Yes. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1010">Q: The big house. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1012">A: Mostly, there were women. </sentence><sentence id="1013">There were some kids, like myself, and there were some males, but, really, predominantly it was women, and there were some old people, very old people, some grandfathers, and several grandfathers and a grandmother, I think, there were altogether about 100 people. </sentence><sentence id="1014">This was one of the largest houses in the ghetto. </sentence><sentence id="1015">It was a three- story building. </sentence><sentence id="1016">And, we did try to co-exist, and the women tried to always make peace, but tempers flared, and it was a difficult situation. </sentence><sentence id="1017">And, I mean, when you think that there's one bathroom, and one kitchen, and I mean it was a primitive kitchen too, it was very difficult. </sentence><sentence id="1018">So, in the beginning everybody was trying to be accommodative, but at the very end people were not as nice as one should be to one another. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1026">Q: Did it smell? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1028">A: Oh, yes, yes, horrible smells, yes. </sentence><sentence id="1029">1 remember we used to be -- we always slept with open windows, and, yet, you know, you tried to open the window and other people would say it's too cold, you know, I would rather be cold than choke, you know, from the awful smells. </sentence><sentence id="1030">Yes, what a question, yes. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1038">A: Not that much noise, no, no, but the smell was awful, very, very disagreeable, yes. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1040">Q: Can you describe when and how the children, you and the other children, dug these holes? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1042">A: Yes. </sentence><sentence id="1043">It started almost like a play in the very beginning when we were in the ghetto, it was still summer, and we said, we got together, had nothing to do, all we talked about is hunger, we said, well, let's try and dig a tunnel. </sentence><sentence id="1044">And, we had some, like, shovels, actually, I don't know if they were toy shovels, but they were not full size, and there were some boys with us and they started it, and it was a game. </sentence><sentence id="1045">We did it within three or four afternoons, because several of us had to watch, you know, on the outside and on the inside, and it was an exciting thing to do. </sentence><sentence id="1046">We dug two such holes, and we camouflaged them so beautifully, and I'm proud to say that not one child ever gave away our two exits, not one. </sentence><sentence id="1047">I don't know if the Judenrat inside the ghetto knew of the -- well, they knew that there were some illegal exits, but they sort of looked the other way. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1054">Q: How did you camouflage them? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1056">A: We camouflaged them with like rags, there was no grass or anything, stones, and broken chairs, and it was just done so that nobody paid any attention. </sentence><sentence id="1057">And, on the outside, there was grass, and there were leaves, and I mean it just looked very normal, and some plaster and stuff like that on the outside, but not on the inside. </sentence><sentence id="1058">It was done beautifully. </sentence><sentence id="1059">I was very proud. </sentence><sentence id="1060">I was not the main engineer of it, but there were some kids who were just wonderful at doing that, and it gave us a way of getting out. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1066">Q: When you went in and out, did anybody stand guard? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1068">A: Yes, oh, yes. </sentence><sentence id="1069">It was a very well-organized -- </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1072">Q: Can you describe it? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1074">A: Well, what we did, first of all, for instance I said I want to go tomorrow, you know, so there were three or four of us together, and there was also an agreement, whoever went out, and whatever you got, in the beginning we tried to share, but then it was very -- it was not feasible. </sentence><sentence id="1075">If somebody got a slice of bread, you wanted it for your family, so we decided whatever one got it was for him, or for her, and her family, and we took turns. </sentence><sentence id="1076">And there were about 20 or 30 kids, and we took turns in standing guard, and who would get out, and mostly we volunteered to get out, because we wouldn't say, well, you go, but mostly we volunteered. </sentence><sentence id="1077">And I went out a number of times, yes. </sentence><sentence id="1078">And I don't know if I should be proud, it's nothing to be proud of, but when my friend was killed there was one other boy who was also murdered, but that was almost at the very end of the first ghetto, and they buried him right away. </sentence><sentence id="1079">I don't know why, maybe because they knew we were going to move pretty soon. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1086">Q: You saw your friend killed? </sentence><sentence id="1087"> 0 </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1090">A: Yes, I did. </sentence><sentence id="1091">She was a beautiful girl. </sentence><sentence id="1092">She was probably one, she looked like a baby doll, she had blond hair and blue eyes, and she was so beautiful. </sentence><sentence id="1093">When she'd walk down the street, people turned their heads to look at her, she was so -- her features were so perfect. </sentence><sentence id="1094">She was my friend. </sentence><sentence id="1095">She was about a year older than I, and we became very good friends before the ghetto, because we didn't live very far away from one another. </sentence><sentence id="1096">And then, in the ghetto, we were even better friends. </sentence><sentence id="1097">She had a mother and one brother, and she had a brother who left Poland. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1106">Q: This must have been difficult for you to see her, you saw her murdered? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1108">A: It was very traumatic. </sentence><sentence id="1109">I mean anybody, to see the hangings, and to see other incidents like that, were very traumatic, but this, this was my friend, my dear friend, and she looked so peaceful, and there was blood on her dress, and she looked like she was asleep. </sentence><sentence id="1110">And, my mother kept comforting me, and she kept saying, "She's not suffering anymore, she's not in pain." </sentence><sentence id="1111">Her mother died, my friend's mother died about a month after my friend was murdered in the ghetto. </sentence><sentence id="1112">In the spring, when the Germans decided we had too much space and we were too comfortable, they built a new ghetto. </sentence><sentence id="1113">I thought that was the poor section of town. </sentence><sentence id="1114">Well, the new ghetto was really in the slums. </sentence><sentence id="1115">This was a group of houses or a space where most people did not live for years already, but there were just a few dilapidated houses. </sentence><sentence id="1116">The only difference between the new ghetto and the old was that the new ghetto was surrounded by a high fence and barbed wire on three sides, and the fourth side of the ghetto was bordered by the river. </sentence><sentence id="1117">And, that part, that side, was not -- did not have any fences. </sentence><sentence id="1118">We were assigned a little nook in a house right on the river, and, again, I mean, it was -- my mother made the best with what she had. </sentence><sentence id="1119">We tried to make it home, and the main thing was to have enough space to sleep everyone on the floor. </sentence><sentence id="1120">And, again, they had to build these bunks, because there was not enough space on the floor to sleep all of us. </sentence><sentence id="1121">This time, we had only two other families with us in that little room, and these were all women and children. </sentence><sentence id="1122">There were no boys, or elderly or men. </sentence><sentence id="1123">My mother and my sister kept going to work again, as if, you know, nothing happened, or, I mean, as if they were still in the old place, and rumors began to fly that our end was near. </sentence><sentence id="1124">It was spring, 1942, and my mother tried desperately while she was working, when she was on the outside, to make contact with some of our friends from before. </sentence><sentence id="1125">She wanted to find a place where someone would hide the three of us, because that's what everyone tried to do. </sentence><sentence id="1126">Finally, one day she came home and she was very excited, and she told us that she found two places. </sentence><sentence id="1127">She couldn't find one place where the farmer or the people would be willing to hide three people, so she found two. </sentence><sentence id="1128">One place would hide one person, and another place, the people were willing to take two people. </sentence><sentence id="1129">And, there was my mother's difficult decision, how and who should go where. </sentence><sentence id="1130">And in her infinite wisdom, she decided that my sister, being the older one, would be able to manage on her own, and mother and I would go to the other place, the two of us. </sentence><sentence id="1131">And, by that time, I mean, she was making plans, or she was excited, or she tried to be excited for our sake, and she kept telling us exactly where we were going. </sentence><sentence id="1132">I don't recall the name of the farmer that my sister was going to, but that was on the edge of town, and he -- the plans were that he would pick her up after work one evening, and that one morning when we all got up, we ate  1 our meager breakfast, and my sister took her little bundle with her, the most important things, clothing that she still had. </sentence><sentence id="1133">She wasn't crying, and I wasn't crying either. </sentence><sentence id="1134">We hugged, we embraced, and we said goodbye, and my mother kept saying how wonderful it would be when all this is over, we'll meet again, and papa will come home and we'll have great celebrations. </sentence><sentence id="1135">And so, she and my sister went to work, and that evening my mother came back by herself, and she told me that sister went off and everything was working according to her plan. </sentence><sentence id="1136">And I don't recall exactly, it wasn't the same evening, but maybe a few short days later, when there really were signs in the ghetto that something was happening, we saw the number of the guards increase immeasurably. </sentence><sentence id="1137">I think they doubled the guards around the ghetto, and there were a lot more Germans in the ghetto and right outside. </sentence><sentence id="1138">And, one sensed that there was some commotion, something was taking place. </sentence><sentence id="1139">At that point, I knew that people really became hysterical, and a lot of people started building partitions in their, you know, rooms, thinking that they could build like false walls with scraps that they got from somewhere, and if they hide in these partitions, in these false walls, that the Germans wouldn't find them. </sentence><sentence id="1140">Some people, you know, would make a hiding place in the chimneys of the houses, and some of them went and dug cellars and tunnels, all this within I think like two weeks after we moved to the new ghetto. </sentence><sentence id="1141">Anyway, there was a lot of panic and chaos in the ghetto at that point, and a few days after my sister left, my mother came home from work and she says, "It's time to go."" </sentence><sentence id="1142">And so, she made me dress in my best clothes, and, again, | still had that coat with a few sewn in coins, and I put on my high-top shoes, and she got dressed and whatever she felt was still not threadbare, and she made two little bundles, one for myself and one for her. </sentence><sentence id="1143">We ate our meager supper, and when it got dark, really dark, it was a dark night, it was very quiet, we stepped out of our room, we didn't tell anyone. </sentence><sentence id="1144">At that point, no one shared information with anyone else. </sentence><sentence id="1145">It seems like everyone was an entity unto oneself. </sentence><sentence id="1146">We walked out, we didn't say goodbye to anyone. </sentence><sentence id="1147">And pretty soon we were in the river. </sentence><sentence id="1148">It was very quiet, and there were a lot of bulrushes and there's a lot of underbrush, and I held on tightly to my mother's hand, and all of a sudden shots rang out, and we ducked, and when it stopped we proceeded a little further. </sentence><sentence id="1149">But then, the gunshots were sporadic, but we could not move because it was still, and when we moved we made noise. </sentence><sentence id="1150">And so, we just stayed there, and we stayed the entire night, because these sporadic gunshots were making it impossible for us to move. </sentence><sentence id="1151">The next morning, there were no sporadic gunshots, it was regular now, and it seemed to come from every which side. </sentence><sentence id="1152">We heard a lot of noise, a lot of commotion, we saw fire, we heard screams, we heard babies crying, and it seems that it was none to soon that we got out. </sentence><sentence id="1153">At that point, a lot of other people from the ghetto tried to do the very same thing we did, and they ran towards the river. </sentence><sentence id="1154">At that time, the guards started screaming, the Ukrainian guards, and this is a phrase in Ukrainian "Wylaz Zyde ya tebe bachu," and that means, "crawl out, Jew, I can see you." </sentence><sentence id="1155">That phrase rings in my ears constantly, and a lot of people came out. </sentence><sentence id="1156">My mother held me down and we stayed put. </sentence><sentence id="1157">And, that went on for several days, and my mother made me eat the soggy bread that was in the bundle. </sentence><sentence id="1158">It tasted awful, and she kept saying I have to be strong, and I can't give up now, and she kept giving me directions of how to get to the farmer's house on the other side of the river that was supposed to have been our hiding place. </sentence><sentence id="1159">And I felt I knew, and I told her, "Stop repeating it, I know how to get there," because we used to go there before the war and my mother used to buy some of the dairy products, like milk, and cheese, and butter  2 from that farmer, so I knew his name, I knew his family, and I knew where he lived, only we didn't go through the river, we went all around. </sentence><sentence id="1160">That was in a little village called Skobelka. </sentence><sentence id="1161">And we stayed pinned down, and at that point the gunshots were working full time. </sentence><sentence id="1162">There were screams from the ghetto and fire, and it never let down even at night, night and day. </sentence><sentence id="1163">I don't know how many days we stayed in the river, but it was several days, and I kept dozing off. </sentence><sentence id="1164">And one time I woke up, or I thought I woke up, and I looked around, and my mother wasn't there. </sentence><sentence id="1165">I really became panic stricken, and I didn't know what to do, and I just stayed there until the very end of that day. </sentence><sentence id="1166">And, by that time, everything quieted down. </sentence><sentence id="1167">There was no more sound except my own sobbing. </sentence><sentence id="1168">I was crying. </sentence><sentence id="1169">It was so still. </sentence><sentence id="1170">And, somehow at that moment I felt I let my mother down. </sentence><sentence id="1171">I fell asleep, and she probably couldn't wake me up, and she had to leave, and so, when it got real dark I made my way to the other side of the river, and by that time it was dawn. </sentence><sentence id="1172">I was wet, and petrified, and utterly confused. </sentence><sentence id="1173">I made my way to the farmer's house, and the farmer saw me and he led me into the barn, and I asked him, "Is my mother here?" </sentence><sentence id="1174">He said, "No." </sentence><sentence id="1175">I said, "Well, she is supposed to be here." </sentence><sentence id="1176">He says, "Yes." </sentence><sentence id="1177">I said, "Well, I'll wait until she comes." </sentence><sentence id="1178">And, he said, "No, you will not wait here. </sentence><sentence id="1179">I'll feed you, you'll stay until it gets dark, and you better leave." </sentence><sentence id="1180">And, I looked at him, I said, "You made an agreement with my mother," and I asked -- I mean, I addressed him by his name, which I don't want to give now because I think I have a lot of questions and I would like to resolve them some day before I die when I go back there, and I asked him, "You made an agreement." </sentence><sentence id="1181">He said, "I changed my mind," and he shrugged his shoulders and he said I have to go when it gets dark. </sentence><sentence id="1182">If I don't go, he'll report me to the authorities. </sentence><sentence id="1183">It was very ironic, because he was wearing a farmer's, like a coverall, and in the corner I saw my father's gold pocket watch with the chain, which I'm sure was part of the money that my mother tried to buy the hiding place for us. </sentence><sentence id="1184">That evening, he didn't even come out, his wife came out, the farmer's wife came out, and gave me some food. </sentence><sentence id="1185">She gave me an apple, and she said I had to leave. </sentence><sentence id="1186">I was so stupefied and so bewildered, I walked out and I walked on the main street of the village, not realizing that anyone could see me and give me away. </sentence><sentence id="1187">But, I just, I don't know, if there is a God he must have been with me, because I walked through the main street of that village and didn't encounter anyone. </sentence><sentence id="1188">And finally I ended up in the fields which were right on that farm, I guess, I don't know. </sentence><sentence id="1189">There were fields, wheat fields, all around, and they were almost ripe for harvesting at that time of year, and I sat down in the middle of the wheat fields and I sat there for two days. </sentence><sentence id="1190">My food went, and I tried to gather my thoughts. </sentence><sentence id="1191">I had a terrible sinking feeling that I let down my mother, and I felt very guilty about it, and right then and there I decided that I must find my mother. </sentence><sentence id="1192">And that's when my odyssey really starts. </sentence><sentence id="1193">The area where I come from is surrounded by many, many forests, and I felt, or I tried to feel, that my mother was there waiting for me and I had to find her, no matter what. </sentence><sentence id="1194">And so, I started, I knew that I would have to go to the forests, and I started walking. </sentence><sentence id="1195">And, the thing was that when you look at a forest it looks so close, and yet when you really start trying to reach it, it's much further than your mind tells you it is. </sentence><sentence id="1196">And so, I walked most of the nights and hid in the forests during the day. </sentence><sentence id="1197">But then, there was another problem. </sentence><sentence id="1198">One had to eat, and I was hungry, and so, I had to find forests that were near villages where I could sneak into a garden, or a yard, or a potato cellar, or something where I could get something to keep me from dying from hunger. </sentence><sentence id="1199">The very beginning, the first months, were very, very painful, very -- I mean, it's almost like I was in a daze. </sentence><sentence id="1200">Several  3 things happened. </sentence><sentence id="1201">One of them, which, again, is riveted in my memory, was an incident that involved six other people. </sentence><sentence id="1202">The very first months after | was wandering in my search for my mother, I encountered stragglers from other ghettos, apparently, most of the surrounding ghettos, neighboring ghettos, were liquidated around the same time. </sentence><sentence id="1203">It was the fall of 1942.And so, we would sit and exchange some information and try to find out if, perhaps, they knew anything about our loved ones and vice versa. </sentence><sentence id="1204">And so that at one time there were six other people, some of them from Lokacze, from Beresteczko, and a few other neighboring villages, towns. </sentence><sentence id="1205">And there we were at the edge of a forest, exchanging information and just glad to see other human beings like ourselves. </sentence><sentence id="1206">All of a sudden, there were some children playing and they noticed us and they started screaming "Zhid"--just yelling "Zhide, Zhide," meaning "Jews"--and they ran back to the village. </sentence><sentence id="1207">There was a very small remuneration for reporting a Jew, and I'm sure they wanted to report Jews and get the money for us. </sentence><sentence id="1208">And so we didn't know what to do. </sentence><sentence id="1209">First we tried to run into the forest. </sentence><sentence id="1210">That forest happened to have been a forest where there was very little underbrush and consequently one could see very far, so it was not very good for hiding. </sentence><sentence id="1211">There were many huge haystacks in that field because it was harvest time, and so we decided to go into a haystack to hide. </sentence><sentence id="1212">Why we all selected one haystack, I cannot answer. </sentence><sentence id="1213">I don't know. </sentence><sentence id="1214">But we all ran into one haystack, and we tried to cover ourselves as best as we could. </sentence><sentence id="1215">Pretty soon we heard the children back and adults. </sentence><sentence id="1216">And they made a game out of it. </sentence><sentence id="1217">They kept pushing their pitchforks into the haystack. </sentence><sentence id="1218">And there were screams and cries, and after it got completely quiet, that was it. </sentence><sentence id="1219">I waited and waited and waited. </sentence><sentence id="1220">It was quiet. </sentence><sentence id="1221">And it seemed it was an eternity, and then I made my way out of that haystack. </sentence><sentence id="1222">And there I saw six bodies lined up in front of the haystack, mutilated. </sentence><sentence id="1223">The only one I recognized there was a baby--that child must have been maybe two years old--that baby was on the chest of his mother. </sentence><sentence id="1224">They were all undressed, their shoes taken away, lined up very neatly. </sentence><sentence id="1225">I didn't even cover them, I just walked away. </sentence><sentence id="1226">And I walked into that forest, and there was no place to hide and I walked and walked and there was no end to that forest. </sentence><sentence id="1227">And so I decided to climb up a tree. </sentence><sentence id="1228">And a good thing too because that next morning--for some reason I don't know, it was near a big town or something--but that forest was full of Germans and Ukrainians. </sentence><sentence id="1229">They had a picnic or something. </sentence><sentence id="1230">And I sat there on that tree trying not to move all day long. </sentence><sentence id="1231">I'm sure if I had been below, I would have been found. </sentence><sentence id="1232">It was really torture because the trees were, evergreens, you know, and they hurt when I was sitting there. </sentence><sentence id="1233">But I sat there all day without moving. </sentence><sentence id="1234">I went to the bathroom just like that, under me. </sentence><sentence id="1235">And when night fell and they left, I climbed down and started walking until I got to another forest, which was I think dawn of the next day. </sentence><sentence id="1236">There were many awful incidents. </sentence><sentence id="1237">I remember once I didn't feel well, I was very hungry and I was very thirsty also. </sentence><sentence id="1238">Thirst is just as bad and just as painful as hunger. </sentence><sentence id="1239">And with my hands I clawed, I dug a little hole and I climbed in and I covered myself with leaves and I just lay there. </sentence><sentence id="1240">I must have fallen asleep, I don't know. </sentence><sentence id="1241">When I woke up, I felt better. </sentence><sentence id="1242">I don't know how long I slept. </sentence><sentence id="1243">Animals kept walking by, nuzzling, you know. </sentence><sentence id="1244">There were snakes. </sentence><sentence id="1245">There were smaller animals. </sentence><sentence id="1246">I saw a bear one time, I think at that point, I did; and the only reason I can figure out that they didn't touch me is because I smelled like them. </sentence><sentence id="1247">I'm sure they thought I was one of them. </sentence><sentence id="1248">Not one animal tried to harm me except the stupid dogs in the villages. </sentence><sentence id="1249">They were awful. </sentence><sentence id="1250">The dogs--you know, you come to a village, or try to sneak into a barn or a shed and the dogs would give you away because they would bark and they  4 would really be vicious. </sentence><sentence id="1251">I was bitten a number of times by dogs but never by an aminal in the forest. </sentence><sentence id="1252">One time I ran into a bunch of tents and this was a group of partisans. </sentence><sentence id="1253">And I was very glad to see other human beings. </sentence><sentence id="1254">They were cordial to me and they asked me if I was Jewish, and I said yes, which was a mistake because I spoke perfect Polish or Ukrainian. </sentence><sentence id="1255">But then they said--I said I would like to join them. </sentence><sentence id="1256">They said fine; there were some girls with them. </sentence><sentence id="1257">Young women. </sentence><sentence id="1258">But I would have to contribute a weapon. </sentence><sentence id="1259">And I said "I have a little knife." </sentence><sentence id="1260">And they thought it was very funny. </sentence><sentence id="1261">And they would not accept me. </sentence><sentence id="1262">But I got even with them: before I left, or I was told to leave, they fed me. </sentence><sentence id="1263">But before I was told to leave-- [Technical conversation] End of Tape #2  5 Tape #3 </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1425">A: Yes, they made fun -- the partisans made fun of my weapon, a little penknife. </sentence><sentence id="1426">Well, again, I was very saddened that I would be alone, but I got even with them in my own way, before I left I appropriated a warm long coat, a pair of boots, they were different sizes, I remember that, but they were warm boots, and some mittens and a shawl, a lot of warm clothing, and they had lots of it, and also I took some food, and I just left. </sentence><sentence id="1427">My life in the forests is very hard to analyze. </sentence><sentence id="1428">I think what kept me going is my quest, I mean my search for my mother. </sentence><sentence id="1429">Maybe deep in my heart I realized that I would never find her, but I was afraid to admit it, because if I had admitted that, I would have given up, and I had to go on. </sentence><sentence id="1430">So, I pretended, I think in retrospect I guess, I pretended that I'm looking for her and that I would find her no matter what. </sentence><sentence id="1431">So, I kept on going. </sentence><sentence id="1432">And, the hunger was awful, the thirst was awful, the cold was indescribable, terror and being afraid of everything and anything, because anything alive was my enemy. </sentence><sentence id="1433">But, more than anything else was the pain of being all alone. </sentence><sentence id="1434">Sometimes weeks and months went by without my hearing another human voice, and that is something that I cannot convey in words how painful and difficult it is. </sentence><sentence id="1435">I started talking to myself. </sentence><sentence id="1436">I listened for sounds. </sentence><sentence id="1437">Sometimes I imagined that I heard voices of people, and usually when I heard people's voices they didn't bode me anything good, and, yet, I longed for it. </sentence><sentence id="1438">So, in addition to being terrorized and tortured by all these uncertainties and fears, I missed a human voice, the sound of a human voice. </sentence><sentence id="1439">Sometimes I would sneak into a yard to a barn, because I was hungry, but more so because I wanted to hear the sound of a human voice, and that was very difficult. </sentence><sentence id="1440">I never felt that I could go on without living, without hearing another human's voice. </sentence><sentence id="1441">I could go on with hunger and thirst, but I couldn't go on for any length of time without hearing a human voice. </sentence><sentence id="1442">It was very difficult. </sentence><sentence id="1443">There were many close calls that I had that I can't even begin to describe. </sentence><sentence id="1444">One time I -- I don't know if I told that before, but I saw the Galowy, that's the man in charge of the forest, a forester, is that what you call them here, and he came up out of nowhere it seemed like. </sentence><sentence id="1445">I was in my little grave, every forest that I planned to spend more than a day in I tried to dig a little hole and camouflage it, and all of a sudden I looked up and there he was on a horse, and I didn't even hear him coming. </sentence><sentence id="1446">And, he was kind, but he says, "What are you doing here? </sentence><sentence id="1447">You are not going to survive. </sentence><sentence id="1448">I'm going to take you to the authorities, it's better that you give up." </sentence><sentence id="1449">I said, "No, I'm not going to give up if you don't denounce me." </sentence><sentence id="1450">And, finally, I took out a gold coin and that gold coin saved my life then. </sentence><sentence id="1451">I still had two gold coins left after that, and each time they bought me my life in a roundabout way, and this guy came back, he followed me, and about a month later he followed me into another forest, and he knew that I had some more money, and so I gave him the next coin, and the third one I gave to the Russians, that was later on. </sentence><sentence id="1452">How I lived in the forest, or in the forests, plural, I don't know, but it's an amazing thing, when one is hungry and completely demoralized, you become inventive. </sentence><sentence id="1453">I never, when I even say it I don't believe it, I ate worms, I ate bugs, I ate anything that I could put in my mouth, and I don't know, sometimes I would get very ill, there were some wild mushrooms, I'm sure they were poison, I don't know, poisonous ones, I was ill, my stomach  6 was a mess, but I still put it in my mouth because I needed to have something to chew. </sentence><sentence id="1454">I drank water from puddles, snow, anything that I could get hold of. </sentence><sentence id="1455">Sometimes I would sneak into potato cellars that the farmers have around their villages, and that was a good hiding place because it was a little warmer in the winter, but there were rodents there and all. </sentence><sentence id="1456">And, to say that I ate raw rats, yes, I did. </sentence><sentence id="1457">Apparently, I wanted to live very, very badly, because I did indescribable things. </sentence><sentence id="1458">I ate things that no one would dream of being able to. </sentence><sentence id="1459">Somehow I survived. </sentence><sentence id="1460">I don't know why, I keep asking myself, but I did. </sentence><sentence id="1461">To this day, I'm still looking for my parents and my sister, none of them survived. </sentence><sentence id="1462">I tried to go back, and it seems every year Iremember more details, but I try not to, I try to forget, but I can't. </sentence><sentence id="1463">I feel that I'm a prisoner of my memories, and I'm imprisoned in a jail that I can't break away from. </sentence><sentence id="1464">But, I do feel that I have a mandate, and I must speak out for the millions who never had a chance. </sentence><sentence id="1465">I'm their spokesperson. </sentence><sentence id="1466">I have to tell the world what went on, so we can learn from these past mistakes, from the cruelty, and from the inhumanity of man towards man. </sentence><sentence id="1467">I'm saddened that in this day and age we have learned very little, and I've had several incidents where after I made a short presentation to school children a parent was questioning the truthfulness of my story, and verbatim he said, "Oh, come on, that's a figment of your imagination," and that makes me very sad, and it makes me more determined to tell the world my story, because it did happen, and it should not happen ever again. </sentence><sentence id="1468">I'm sure you want to know more details about my life in the forest. </sentence><sentence id="1469">I don't know how I can tell you much more, except to tell you that I lived just like an animal. </sentence><sentence id="1470">I ate and drank human waste, but I never killed another human being, and I don't think that should I meet face to face with people who are responsible for my parents" and my sister's murder, and for the millions of others, I don't think I'm capable of killing another human being. </sentence><sentence id="1471">I could even forgive, but I cannot forget, and I do not want the world to forget. </sentence><sentence id="1472">And, my message to people who will listen to my story is that, in spite of all this I do feel that there is hope for humankind, and we must learn from the atrocities and from the past that were so unkind to me and to millions of others. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1531">A: The day started when it started getting light, and usually at that time I would reach a forest, because I had to walk all night long. </sentence><sentence id="1532">My one good thing was the darkness. </sentence><sentence id="1533">So, early in the morning I would find a spot, dig a hole and cover myself and sleep, because I was exhausted from all the walking. </sentence><sentence id="1534">Then, if I had something to eat, I would eat around noon or so, and then I would start wandering again in the forest, and make my plans for the next day. </sentence><sentence id="1535">That was on good days, when I was healthy. </sentence><sentence id="1536">Many times, I would dig myself into a grave and cover myself and stay there for days until I'd lose count, yes, until I was just so hungry, or so  7 thirsty, that I had to get up and go, but I would stay in the forest for many days at times. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1561">Q: Did you have daydreams? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1563">A: Yes, oh, yes, yes. </sentence><sentence id="1564">I remember once seeing a rainbow after a rain in the forest, and it was so beautiful, I will never forget that rainbow. </sentence><sentence id="1565">And, I kept imagining and I kept remembering how my house looked back when, and I even smelled the smell, there are certain aromas now that, you know, I associate with home, and there was in that forest, which I loved the smell of the forest anyway, even under these circumstances, but I smelled the grass, and the leaves, and the earth, it was beautiful, but I smelled flowers, because when I looked at a rainbow I saw flowers, I saw the shrubs, and I saw the jasmine and lilacs that surrounded our house, and that was very pleasant and it gave me strength. </sentence><sentence id="1566">Yes, I guess you can call ita daydream, yes. </sentence><sentence id="1567">I wished that I had some tangible proof, or a photograph or something, of my parents and my sister, and I should have packed that in my bundle, but I didn't have that. </sentence><sentence id="1568">I didn't have anything, any tangible proof, or anything that I could look and remind myself, because some days I was just wondering who I am, and who my family was. </sentence><sentence id="1569">It's almost as if I couldn't visualize it in my mind, and I had to strain to remember. </sentence><sentence id="1570">That was very difficult. </sentence><sentence id="1571">One time I ran into a village, and ended up in a barn, helped myself to milk from a cow, and then they found me, a boy came into the barn and saw me, and I started running. </sentence><sentence id="1572">There was no place to go, and he ran for his parents, apparently, and I ran and there was a well sort of, I guess, on the edge of the village. </sentence><sentence id="1573">I don't know if it was an abandoned well or what, and I jumped in and I stayed there, I think, for a day and a half, and they didn't find me. </sentence><sentence id="1574">But, I had to claw myself out of there, and, you know, the walls were round, and there was nothing to latch onto. </sentence><sentence id="1575">That was a difficult thing, but I did somehow, I clawed myself out of that well, and that's another experience. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1595">A: I saw it was there. </sentence><sentence id="1596">Yes, there's no logic to it. </sentence><sentence id="1597">It's just like when we went into the haystack, why did we all go into one haystack? </sentence><sentence id="1598">And, they were huge haystacks, and I don't know if I explained, but when I told the story to my husband and son, they listened, but they didn't ask  8 any questions. </sentence><sentence id="1599">And, I guess they didn't have the heart, but when we went back on our trip in 1988, we were in the car, and my son almost jumped out of the car, he said, "Oh, here, so that's what a haystack looks like." </sentence><sentence id="1600">They are huge haystacks there, just like a barn, because here the haystacks are very small. </sentence><sentence id="1601">And, there, they make them very big, and he says, "Now, I understand how seven people could hide in one haystack." </sentence><sentence id="1602">I said, "If you didn't understand, why didn't you ask me?" </sentence><sentence id="1603">He says, "I just didn't have the heart to ask." </sentence><sentence id="1604">I don't know. </sentence><sentence id="1605">I saw the well. </sentence><sentence id="1606">There was no other place to go. </sentence><sentence id="1607">It was too far to go to a forest, and I just jumped in, and they never looked there. </sentence></p></dialogue>

welcomed commodity, it was traded for necessities of life. </sentence><sentence id="1800">And, that's the way we lived, or that's the way I lived. </sentence><sentence id="1801">And then I went to school and started again searching for my family, and it's very -- I don't know how to bring it out, but it seems to me to this day, I am not at peace with myself because I have nothing tangible to mourn. </sentence><sentence id="1802">When one dies, there is a grave, a cemetery, I have nothing, and maybe that's why to this day I'm hoping against hope, I know it's ridiculous, that, perhaps, I could find someone in my family. </sentence><sentence id="1803">To this day, when I walk on the street and I see a person who is very tall, my father was about 6'4", and my mother was almost 6 foot tall, and when I see people of that height and build I have to run in front of them to verify that that's not them, and that's very difficult for me. </sentence><sentence id="1804">In 1988, my son expressed a desire to go back where I came from, he wanted to see the surroundings. </sentence><sentence id="1805">And, after about a year of red tape, the Soviet Union allowed me to go to Lvov, but they said that if | wanted to go to my hometown, which is an insignificant little dot on the map, they cannot allow me now, they will let me know when I get to Lvov whether or not they would allow me to go to my hometown. </sentence><sentence id="1806">And so, we took our chances and we did go. </sentence><sentence id="1807">I couldn't go directly to Lvov. </sentence><sentence id="1808">They told me I had to go via, at that time Leningrad, Moscow, Kiev and then Lvov, and that is a story of another -- for another time. </sentence><sentence id="1809">We were supposed to be with a group, a tour group, because otherwise, you know, I could have gone on my own, they said, no, you can't do that. </sentence><sentence id="1810">When we got to Leningrad, we come to the tourist people, and I said, "Where is the group we are supposed to join?" </sentence><sentence id="1811">There was no group, so we were left on our own anyway, but, yet, I mean, the bureaucracy was such that I had to fight for everything until we got to Lvov, and it's a good thing I still speak the language, or else we would have been lost. </sentence><sentence id="1812">But, anyway, we went, we finally ended up in Lvov, and that evening we were let know, they let us know that they gave us permission to go to Horochow, my hometown, for two hours only, and they stood there with their watches, you know, watching. </sentence><sentence id="1813">Why, I don't know. </sentence><sentence id="1814">I cannot understand it. </sentence><sentence id="1815">When we finally got to Horochow, we went by car, and we had two drivers. </sentence><sentence id="1816">These two drivers were supposedly our guides, but they really were the KGB men, and mind you, that's 1988, where when we had already glasnost and perestroika to some degree. </sentence><sentence id="1817">We got to my hometown. </sentence><sentence id="1818">I don't know where reality ends and imagination  2 begins, but it seems that was not my hometown. </sentence><sentence id="1819">There were no sidewalks. </sentence><sentence id="1820">There were no trees. </sentence><sentence id="1821">There was nothing the way I remembered it. </sentence><sentence id="1822">I looked for my house and finally an elderly gentleman, I mean, they came out of the woodwork, there were many people who came out, and they all, of course, remembered my family, and, of course, if they would only have been able to help they would have, so they tell me then, and they pointed out the place, supposedly, that was my home, my house. </sentence><sentence id="1823">It's still there, but it doesn't look anything like my house. </sentence><sentence id="1824">It's still on a terraced hill. </sentence><sentence id="1825">There are no shrubs, nothing. </sentence><sentence id="1826">On either side of the house, they added buildings, and they painted the house, it was plaster, I guess you call it, they painted it a horrible color of blue, and there was a woman standing in the door as if daring me to go up. </sentence><sentence id="1827">I didn't have the heart, and I could not do it. </sentence><sentence id="1828">So, I didn't go in, but it didn't even look like my house. </sentence><sentence id="1829">Our son had a camera, and he tried to go around the side of the house to take a picture from the back, and he sort of disappeared. </sentence><sentence id="1830">I didn't pay much attention. </sentence><sentence id="1831">I tried to ask about things in the city, and any information about my family and the rest of the Jews from the ghetto, and all of a sudden one of our guides heard screams, a mother, I'm a mother, and I didn't hear it. </sentence><sentence id="1832">And, there was my son screaming, "help, help." </sentence><sentence id="1833">It turned out they ran, and I ran with them, and so did my husband, and we ran around the corner and there were two militia men, local militia men from Horochow, who tried to kidnap my son in a van and drive off. </sentence><sentence id="1834">He doesn't speak Russian. </sentence><sentence id="1835">He didn't know, you know, what was going on. </sentence><sentence id="1836">They tried to force him into that van to drive off, and that's when a little fight ensued between the local militia and the two -- the guides who whipped out their KGB cards and then they let my son go. </sentence><sentence id="1837">That's in 1988. </sentence><sentence id="1838">I managed, I didn't, I know they erased, they leveled the ghetto, I didn't get to see anything, because time was taken away. </sentence><sentence id="1839">I managed to find out that the river in which I was hiding was diverted, there was no river there anymore. </sentence><sentence id="1840">I did not see the space, the place, but they told me there is no more river. </sentence><sentence id="1841">They verified again about my sister, that she was denounced, paraded in the nude and murdered within days of the liquidation of the ghetto. </sentence><sentence id="1842">My father, they think, he ended up in Dachau, but I'm not sure. </sentence><sentence id="1843">When we were in Germany after the war, I mean after I got married, my husband was stationed in Germany in Munich, and we went up several times to Dachau and I looked and asked, but there is no way to verify whether or not my father was murdered in Dachau. </sentence><sentence id="1844">But, there is another possibility now. </sentence><sentence id="1845">They told me when I went back in "88 that there was a mass grave on the outside of my hometown, and possibly the 300 men who were grabbed in the very beginning of the German occupation ended up there. </sentence><sentence id="1846">I don't know, and I was not given a chance to see that mass grave. </sentence><sentence id="1847">No one knows anything about my mother. </sentence><sentence id="1848">No one could give me any information. </sentence><sentence id="1849">Of all the Jews, as far as I know, there is only one other survivor, an older lady who lives in the United States also, and there are some other survivors, but these are people who made their way from our hometown in an illegal way as the war started. </sentence><sentence id="1850">That's as far as I know. </sentence><sentence id="1851">I might be incorrect, but I have not found any other survivors. </sentence></p></dialogue>

- but it gave him something to think about and something to remember about a grandfather that to him is just stories, you know, and one picture that I have. </sentence><sentence id="2035">And, I thought that was one very, very pleasing or good moment in our trip. </sentence><sentence id="2036">I would like to bring to the attention of my listeners, my future listeners, that in 1988, so many years after the war, we went to see the concentration camps in Poland, and we also stopped at Babi Yar in Kiev. </sentence><sentence id="2037">Babi Yar is a place where a hundred thousand mostly Jews were murdered by the Germans within ten days. </sentence><sentence id="2038">When we ended up -- when we got to Kiev, we wanted to take one of the normal tours, as we did in every city, to see all the most important things in that city, and we did that, and it was finished. </sentence><sentence id="2039">And, I said, "Well, we didn't go to Babi Yar," and our guide says, "Oh, we don't go to Babi Yar. </sentence><sentence id="2040">You want to go to Babi Yar, you make your own arrangements." </sentence><sentence id="2041">So that, right away, made me very angry, but we did make arrangements, and next morning we went to Babi Yar. </sentence><sentence id="2042">First of all, the guide keeps telling us about the hundred thousand Soviet citizens who were murdered there, no mention about Jews. </sentence><sentence id="2043">Then, there is -- what do you call it when you commemorate -- a memorial, a memorial, and on the memorial in Russian it says that Russian citizens, 100,000 of them, were murdered here, no mention of the Jews. </sentence><sentence id="2044">I got very angry, and I really gave them a piece of my mind. </sentence><sentence id="2045">It wasn't because of me, but now I understand they have a new memorial that explains that they were mostly Jews and they commemorate the right people who were murdered there. </sentence><sentence id="2046">Another thing, they kept saying nobody in Kiev knew what was going on. </sentence><sentence id="2047">Well, the geographical location of Babi Yar is right in the middle of the city, how people could be deaf and blind is beyond me. </sentence><sentence id="2048">That's one thing. </sentence><sentence id="2049">When we got to Poland, Poland had several million Jews, now they have, I think, 5,000 Jews in the entire country of Poland. </sentence><sentence id="2050">The anti-semitism in 1988, you could taste it, you could slice it with a knife, it was in the air everywhere, and everywhere they took us to the concentration camps, starting with Auschwitz, Treblinka, Majdanek, there was no mention of Jews, Polish citizens were murdered here. </sentence><sentence id="2051">And, I, again, expressed my very, very unhappiness with the state of affairs. </sentence><sentence id="2052">I understand that it's being corrected now, but I spent a week in Poland, that if I didn't die out of frustration and anger, it was just so obvious that the anti-semitism is still there, and I'm not accusing anyone specifically, but the country as a whole. </sentence><sentence id="2053">And, I'm sorry I feel that way, and people might disagree with me, but, unfortunately, in 1988 all I felt is hate and despicable distaste for the Jews that the Poles have there. </sentence><sentence id="2054">And I feel it's unfair. </sentence><sentence id="2055">There are no Jews there to hate anymore, and, yet, it was so obvious everywhere we went that the Jews are very much disliked there. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2084">Q: Charlene, when you were in the forest, how did you decide where to go? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2086">A: I didn't. </sentence><sentence id="2087">I just went happenstance. </sentence><sentence id="2088">I learned how to, you know, tell north, south, east and west, and I kept going east, then after a while I went south, and that's the only way I went. </sentence><sentence id="2089">I don't know, I did not have any plans of where to go and how. </sentence><sentence id="2090">The forests are, they stretch for miles, and miles and miles, and thank God I had good legs, I guess, because I don't know how many hundreds of miles I must have walked in these years that I was there, but there  6 was no plan. </sentence><sentence id="2091">I might have ended up in the same villages, for all I know, several times, I recognized them, yes, but I had no plan. </sentence><sentence id="2092">I didn't know what I was doing. </sentence><sentence id="2093">It was all -- you mentioned before, it was almost all unreal. </sentence><sentence id="2094">I don't know. </sentence><sentence id="2095">It was something was driving me to keep on going, and that was, I guess, the spirit of my mother, because I felt I had to find her. </sentence><sentence id="2096">But, how I went and what I did, there was no plan. </sentence><sentence id="2097">I had no plan, none whatsoever. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2110">Q: What did you do for shoes? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2112">A: Well, I had a pair of shoes, then they fell apart, and I used the leaves with boughs of evergreen, you know, to tie them around, and the next year I had those wonderful boots from the partisans. </sentence><sentence id="2113">One was about two sizes too big, and the other one was a little too small, but who cared, they were wonderful, yes, that's what I did for shoes. </sentence><sentence id="2114">But, I think the partisans, in some way, even though they didn't allow me to join their group, they saved my life, too, yes. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2118">Q: Why don't we change the tape and go to a half hour tape. </sentence><sentence id="2119">Can we do that? </sentence><sentence id="2120">Thank you. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="2124"> End of Tape #3  7 Tape #4 </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2126">Q: Okay. </sentence><sentence id="2127">You were talking about shoes, and your change of shoes, and how many miles you walked. </sentence><sentence id="2128">Can you talk a little more about that? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2132">A: Well, yes, I don't know how many miles, but it must have been, if I say a thousand in the years, probably more, I know I walked, and walked and walked, and the original shoes, the ones--the high-tops, fell apart, and for a time I didn't have anything, I just put leaves and the evergreen -- the longer branches and wrapped them around, and that was all I had. </sentence><sentence id="2133">And, sometimes I would get into the barns and get some straw, but I didn't have anything to fasten it with. </sentence><sentence id="2134">One time I remember getting a little bit of burlap in a potato cellar and I made string out of that and tied the leaves around my feet. </sentence><sentence id="2135">It was very rough until I got new shoes, and the new shoes were the boots that I appropriated from the partisans. </sentence><sentence id="2136">But, until then, mostly I had no shoes, and I walked barefoot in the snow, and it was terribly cold. </sentence><sentence id="2137">Part of my toes, you know, have no circulation, they are frozen. </sentence><sentence id="2138">My hands are also partially frozen, frostbitten, and my stomach is ruined. </sentence><sentence id="2139">Otherwise, I'm all right. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2148">Q: Did you have a hat? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2150">A: No, no, no, I didn't have a hat. </sentence><sentence id="2151">When the partisans, you know, left me to myself, I appropriated a shawl, and I wrapped my head at that time, but until then, no, I did not have a hat. </sentence><sentence id="2152">I had long hair, and sometimes I chopped it up with my little penknife because I had lice, and I was itching, and I had sores, and it was very difficult to take care of. </sentence><sentence id="2153">So, now and then I would chop it off. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2158">Q: How did you use your penknife? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2160">A: Oh, the penknife was used for a million and one -- for everything. </sentence><sentence id="2161">I used it to help me dig my little holes in the forest. </sentence><sentence id="2162">I used it to cut up my potatoes, my raw potatoes, to cut vegetables from the gardens, or I sometimes would get these wild nuts in the forest, and in order to open them I would use the penknife because I didn't have anything else. </sentence><sentence id="2163">I started doing it with my teeth, but my teeth were hurting badly. </sentence><sentence id="2164">I don't think I could have survived without my penknife. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2170">Q: Is that how you killed the rats? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2172">A: Yes. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2174">Q: This is difficult to express, isn't it? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2176">A: Yes, it's difficult for me today to believe that I stooped that low, that I did that, but I did. </sentence><sentence id="2177">I'm not proud of it. </sentence><sentence id="2178">I feel very humiliated to share this with you, but, yes, I did it. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2182">Q: Well, I'm grateful that you told me. </sentence><sentence id="2183"> 8 </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2186">A: Thank you. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2188">Q: I know this sounds like a silly question, because you used the word humiliation, you were put in such a horrible situation-- </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2190">A: I never shared these kind of details. </sentence><sentence id="2191">When I speak at schools and all, I'm very -- not superficial, but I don't go into such details, because I don't feel comfortable talking about it, and I do feel humiliated, but I guess it has to be told and I hope whoever listens will respect me regardless. </sentence><sentence id="2192">I did that to survive. </sentence><sentence id="2193">And, perhaps, part of my survival, the meaning of my survival, is to talk about it now so people will know. </sentence><sentence id="2194">Again, I feel that my parents have given me such a solid early childhood that I did have the strength to survive and to end up now reasonably well. </sentence><sentence id="2195">I must thank my wonderful husband and son. </sentence><sentence id="2196">They have supported me 150 percent, and I'm not a very easy person to live with, and my husband has been my friend, my nurse, my mother, my father and my lover, and he is a very understanding man, even though he says he could never walk in my shoes. </sentence><sentence id="2197">He understands my moods. </sentence><sentence id="2198">He understands my shortcomings, and he puts up with it in a very big way, and I appreciate it. </sentence><sentence id="2199">I always say that my marriage is not 50/50, my marriage is 95, I take 95 percent, and I can only give five. </sentence><sentence id="2200">But, he's a very special man, and my son has been very understanding, and very giving, and very loving, and now I have a grandson and another one on the way, so there are many happy things in my life. </sentence><sentence id="2201">They don't compensate for my early life, but in a way I have many blessings, and I'm grateful for those. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2214">Q: You told me that in the ghetto there were many actions where they picked people up. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2216">A: Yes, these round-ups, the actions, we called them Lapanka, and they started early. </sentence><sentence id="2217">They started, actually, the first one was when they rounded up my father and the other men, before we were herded into a ghetto. </sentence><sentence id="2218">One action, one such action after my father was taken, took place a few days later, and everybody was at work, the adults and the children 14 and over, and I found myself alone. </sentence><sentence id="2219">We were still in our house at that point, and I saw, you know, they would come with sirens and all, you know, make a big to do about it, they let you know that they are coming to grab you. </sentence><sentence id="2220">And, near our house there is a magnificent big one, a big Christian cemetery, and I ran to that cemetery to hide. </sentence><sentence id="2221">It had many trees, and little chapels, and little mausoleums, and that's where I ended up. </sentence><sentence id="2222">When I came back in 1988 to visit my hometown, there was an elderly gentleman who told me that he remembered me and he saw me in that cemetery where I was hiding. </sentence><sentence id="2223">I did not know that someone saw me and didn't report me, but he told me he saw -- how else would he know where I was. </sentence><sentence id="2224">He took me to that cemetery, because it's very close to our home, and he showed me the little chapel where I was hiding. </sentence><sentence id="2225">I was hiding there, yes, for several hours. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2236">Q: So, you were always very quick. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2238">A: Yes, you had to be quick on your feet, or else you would not survive, yes. </sentence><sentence id="2239">But, you know what helped me in a way, I guess, it helped me also I was a tomboy, I was always running,  9 doing things that other young girls, perhaps, were not so eager to do, and I was comfortable with that, yes. </sentence><sentence id="2240">So, maybe that helped. </sentence><sentence id="2241">And, there were other round-ups in the ghetto later on, too. </sentence><sentence id="2242">I would say there was one on the average of once a week, once every other week, yes. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2248">Q: Were you feeling fear all the time? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2250">A: Yes, yes. </sentence><sentence id="2251">I still feel it when I talk about it, I still feel fear. </sentence><sentence id="2252">And, I don't know, it's also a very - - it's a indescribable kind of feeling, because fear is something that you fear people, you fear, you know, emotions, you fear nature, I was fearing fear itself. </sentence><sentence id="2253">I was always in fear for everything that was going on. </sentence><sentence id="2254">I was always -- I was not at ease with anything that was going on in my life. </sentence><sentence id="2255">But, while we were still in the ghetto, while my mother was still there, she was such a -- she was solid as a rock, and she gave us all the comfort that we needed, and that was enough. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2262">Q: So, you never saw her cry? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2264">A: Never saw her cry, never, not when they took my father away, no. </sentence><sentence id="2265">She just hugged us. </sentence><sentence id="2266">She took my sister and me close to her and she hugged us. </sentence><sentence id="2267">We cried, she did not. </sentence><sentence id="2268">She probably cried that night, but she didn't cry then, no. </sentence><sentence id="2269">She took his jacket to the ghetto with us, the jacket -- the sports jacket that he was going to put on, because he was always a very formal dresser, you know, and she took it. </sentence><sentence id="2270">She had it in the river with her, yes. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2278">Q: She was wearing it? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2280">A: Yes. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2284">A: Yes, they were very close. </sentence><sentence id="2285">They were very close, from what I saw they were very loving, very understanding of one another, and complimenting one another on everything they did and everything they said. </sentence><sentence id="2286">And, I mean, I was telling this to some of my friends and they said, ah, I mean, you are idealizing it, there's no such a human being to be so -- I mean, two human beings to be so perfect and all. </sentence><sentence id="2287">I said, "My parents and my sister were perfect," and that's the way I remember them. </sentence><sentence id="2288">I don't remember one flaw, nothing. </sentence><sentence id="2289">I can't remember anything that they did that I didn't admire, and I was very, very lucky, very lucky. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2296">Q: Did you ever pray to God when you were in the forest? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2298">A: I don't know if I prayed to God, but I did pray, but I was also very angry with God, very angry, and I kept saying, "God, if there is a God, why did you let this happen? </sentence><sentence id="2299">Why do I have to be all alone now?" </sentence><sentence id="2300">And, it was always centering around me, I was very selfish, I guess, in that respect, and I was always referring to myself, selfishly, why did this happen to me, why did I end up like this. </sentence><sentence id="2301">I did not -- I don't know, I couldn't see on a larger scope, it was just my own person at that point. </sentence><sentence id="2302">But, yes, I did. </sentence><sentence id="2303"> 0 </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2310">Q: Did anything funny happen? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2312">A: Not funny, but I saw little birds, you know, being hatched, or what do you call it, you know, and it was a miracle of birth and it was beautiful to watch. </sentence><sentence id="2313">Nothing funny, but interesting things happened like that, and I watched, and I was fascinated by that, and it gave me strength to go on, because if a bird can survive, I can survive, too. </sentence><sentence id="2314">And, that was beautiful to watch. </sentence><sentence id="2315">But, funny, no, I don't remember anything funny happening, no. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2320">Q: So, laughter was -- </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2322">A: No, I don't remember laughter. </sentence><sentence id="2323">I don't remember playing in the ghetto, except talking about food and pretending, you know, that we were at a banquet, and who is going to have the first, you know, piece of the meal, the first part. </sentence><sentence id="2324">And, it was always centered around food. </sentence><sentence id="2325">Maybe our group was an exception. </sentence><sentence id="2326">I understand in the concentration camps kids were playing, and, you know, with rag dolls and all. </sentence><sentence id="2327">I don't know. </sentence><sentence id="2328">We didn't play, no. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2336">Q: You said that when you were in the forest that you couldn't trust anybody. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2338">A: No, how could I trust anybody? </sentence><sentence id="2339">Everyone I knew betrayed me. </sentence><sentence id="2340">It seemed I could not, to this day I cannot understand, people who were our friends, people who were our neighbors, didn't extend a helping hand in our time of need. </sentence><sentence id="2341">And, I cannot understand that. </sentence><sentence id="2342">I cannot. </sentence><sentence id="2343">I don't want to refer to it, but in a way Bosnia nowadays, it's almost a paradox, the Croatian people are the ones who were helping the Germans, and the Serbs were the victims, now the Serbs are trying to take revenge, I guess, in a way to put it very simply, on the Croats. </sentence><sentence id="2344">But, I was one of the first of our group, the survivors, who wrote letters to anybody and everybody who would only read that we want all these atrocities to stop, because it's like a vicious circle, like a catch-22, enough is enough. </sentence><sentence id="2345">But, in the beginning, right after the war, I was very confused. </sentence><sentence id="2346">I hated with a passion. </sentence><sentence id="2347">I was angry. </sentence><sentence id="2348">| think that anger has subsided somewhat. </sentence><sentence id="2349">I try not to hate, because hate is such a wasted energy, and I try to put my life to good use, and I do as much as I feel I can. </sentence><sentence id="2350">I'm not working anymore now, so I do try to relate my story in schools as often as I possibly can, but every day I come back from a presentation it's like the wound has been opened anew. </sentence><sentence id="2351">And, people tell me, oh, it's so long ago, it shouldn't hurt. </sentence><sentence id="2352">Every day it hurts the same, and even more, because I remember details that I haven't spoken about before. </sentence><sentence id="2353">But, as I said before, I think I'm trying to learn to forgive, but I can never forget, and I don't want the world to forget, and that is one of my missions, to bear witness, as Elie Weisel says, he was another one of my early inspirations, and I feel that if he can talk about it I have to make myself talk about it. </sentence><sentence id="2354">I'm not as eloquent, and I'm not as smart as he is, but in my own small way I try to do the best I know how, and maybe that's my mission in life and the reason for survival. </sentence><sentence id="2355">I don't know. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2374">Q: Do you think you can sing one of those songs you sang to yourself? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2376">A: Oh, there's another lullaby that my mother -- and, these were all in Polish, I don't know why,  1 we spoke Yiddish at home, but I guess it was part Polish and part Yiddish, because the songs that I remember mostly are Polish. </sentence><sentence id="2377">There are some that my father used to sing, "Oif dem pripiczik brent a feierl", , and he used to sing that to us. </sentence><sentence id="2378">But, the other one is, let's see -- Guzety led gwazd, Dulety le miast, Gzwadzy miastomny ja znasz, ze dzieczy musial spai a spie kochanie a czego prognac znamy znar dostanies, wszystkie dzieczy nawet zwie, padgrozonie sa wsnie, a ty jedna tylko nie, a, a katki dwa szary bury, szary bury a, a katki dwa odbydwadeg I mixed up the stanzas, but that's a lullaby that my mother used to sing. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2403">A: What happened, are you coming apart? </sentence><sentence id="2404">This picture of my parents and sister is a composite. </sentence><sentence id="2405">When my husband and I were stationed in Japan, I'd been asking my family here in America to try and find some pictures of my family, and they did find some, but none of them looked like my parents and sister that I remembered. </sentence><sentence id="2406">And, finally, they found these pictures, and this is the way I really remember my family. </sentence><sentence id="2407">I remember my mother, I remember the suit, it's a black suit with a stand-up collar, and the scarf that she is wearing is multi-colored, even though here it looks just black and white. </sentence><sentence id="2408">My sister is wearing a beautiful white lacy dress with eyelet, and the little bolero has red and white polka dots. </sentence><sentence id="2409">I remember it as if it were yesterday. </sentence><sentence id="2410">And, she's wearing, I think, white ribbon in her hair. </sentence><sentence id="2411">Father looks just as if he is right here right now. </sentence><sentence id="2412">I remember his hair was sort of longish, and he parted it in the middle, and his eyeglasses are very dainty, very delicate, and you could hardly see the gold little rim that went around his ear, and he's wearing a collar with a tie, like a bow-tie, and it's also, it's a suit, I don't remember exactly what suit this is. </sentence><sentence id="2413">But this is the way I remember my family, and to me, looking at them right now, is very important and very meaningful. </sentence><sentence id="2414">I love you. </sentence></p></dialogue>
