<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="75">  Interview with Brooks McClure deg July 7, 2011 </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="76">A: So, at any rate, he was a wonderful old man, and -- but he -- he got very, very sick. </sentence><sentence id="77">Heart can -- heart condition, and we knew he wasn't going to be around a long time, so we had to prepare for this. </sentence><sentence id="78">And the preparation did not include any possibility of going to college. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="82">Q: I see. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="84">A: Because not only did we not have enough money to cover that, but I knew that with a high school education, at that time when jobs were very scarce, I didn't have much of a chance. </sentence><sentence id="85">So -- but I did have an interest, and the interest was in journalism, which actually I developed in the grammar school. </sentence><sentence id="86">And before I got out of grammar school, I had an idea, I--I had a-- I wa -- a little play friend, the -- these correspondences with children from other places. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="90">Q: Oh, pen-pal. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="92">A: Yeah, one of -- one of my teachers went to, of all places, western Australia, which is just -- just about west of anything in the wor -- in the world. </sentence><sentence id="93">And so I-I got the -- my friend sent me the local paper -- matter of fact, all of the local papers. </sentence><sentence id="94">And I noticed that one was a weekly, which looked more like an American paper than any of the others. </sentence><sentence id="95">There was the lingering influence of the British journalism, with the ads on the page one and that sort of thing. </sentence><sentence id="96">This was different, this had headlines on page one [indecipherable] news on page one. </sentence><sentence id="97">And I was really intrigued by this. </sentence><sentence id="98">And I had already started my self-education, read every book that had to do with journalism. </sentence><sentence id="99">I   Interview with Brooks McClure " July 7, 2011 don't know whether I understood it or not, but at any rate, I did that. </sentence><sentence id="100">And -- and then one day I got the notion that maybe these people out in poor old Australia, would like to have a correspondent in the United States. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="111">Q: Not a bad notion. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="113">A: And I noticed that they had a regular correspondent in -- in Asia who traveled around. </sentence><sentence id="114">And then they had another correspondent in London, which was home to the Australians. </sentence><sentence id="115">And so these were very special needs. </sentence><sentence id="116">One was, of course, the local aspect, of the -- of news, and the other was London. </sentence><sentence id="117">And -- but I said th -- I-I decided to write a letter to the editor. </sentence><sentence id="118">So I went to the British -- the -- I don't read it any more, but oh, I can't remember the name of it. </sentence><sentence id="119">At any rate, it's -- was -- it's a -- it's a British publication, similar, but rather more serious than the World Almanac for -- that we have. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="127">Q: The Economist? </sentence><sentence id="128">Would it be the Economist? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="131">A: No, no, the -- </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="132">Q: No? </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="133">A: -- no, no, no, this i-- no, no. </sentence><sentence id="134">No, it says -- A2: You mean like the encyclopedia. </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="135">A: Sure, it's got the name of a -- of a the -- research publication, but -- </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="136">Q: I see, okay. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="137">  Interview with Brooks McClure deg July 7, 2011 </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="138">A: But at any rate, it was the one place where they had all of the editors by name, everywhere in the British commonwealth. </sentence><sentence id="139">And so I thought, well, in the British commonwealth, they speak English, and that's the only thing I can speak, so I wrote them a letter and I said, I am a student of journalism. </sentence><sentence id="140">No mention of grade, age, anything like that. </sentence><sentence id="141">So, I had the -- and I followed my father's rules. </sentence><sentence id="142">He said, when you write a letter, you keep it on one page, if you possibly can, because you lose the reader on the second page. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="148">Q: Absolutely right. </sentence><sentence id="149">Absolutely right. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="152">A: And so -- so I followed all the rules, and I used the simplest language, don't be fooled by the multi-syllable words. </sentence><sentence id="153">So I just said in plain English that I was a--a journalism student [indecipherable] without experience as of now, but I noticed their paper, and I noticed that they had correspondents in these other places, and none in the United States. </sentence><sentence id="154">So would they be interested in taking me on, course free, as a correspondent. </sentence><sentence id="155">And I thought afterwards, what a stupid thing to do, you know. </sentence><sentence id="156">I consulted no one, and I got --I had the shivers afterwards. </sentence><sentence id="157">Then, in the normal turn of events, which between the United States and -- and Australia is about two months, I got a letter back, and it was from the publisher, who said, you know, we are -- we are interested in you. </sentence><sentence id="158">We have to know a lot more about you, but then he said, let's consider it a possibility. </sentence><sentence id="159">And so I did, I-- I found the name of the editor of the publication: that was on the masthead of course, And I wrote him and sent him a very    Interview with Brooks McClure deg July 7, 2011 long article about the failure of the -- 0-o-of Roosevelt's policies. </sentence><sentence id="160">Because at that time, it were -- that was about 1937 was it, something like that. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="171">Q: So you weren't even 20 years old? </sentence><sentence id="172">You were like 18. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="175">A: Oh, oh, I was far from 20 years old. </sentence><sentence id="176">I -- I was [indecipherable] nothing man, I had -- had absolutely nothing, so -- so -- </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="177">Q: But chutzpah. </sentence><sentence id="178">A lot of chutzpah. </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="179">A: Oh, a lot -- a lot of --a lot of gall. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="181">Q: So, I'd like to turn this now to -- as you're speaking, a number of thoughts are going through my mind. </sentence><sentence id="182">When I've interviewed other people who were part of liberating forces, U.S. forces, most of them do not have the exposure that it sounds like you did, to news, to world events, to -- it-- to people who were different from yourselves. </sentence><sentence id="183">So one of the key questions that I often ask somebody is, before they even get to Europe, did you meet anybody who was Jewish. </sentence><sentence id="184">Well, if you live in Manhattan, chances are you did. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="189">A: You couldn't miss them. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="191">Q: Okay. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="193">A: Oh yes, well, that's a Jewish city, almost. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="195">Q: And then my second question is, is that if you were interested in news and journalism, were you aware, even as a teenager, of the news coming out of Europe, of what Germany was doing? </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="244">Q: Mm-hm. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="246">A: A-Another series. </sentence><sentence id="247">And so here I was reading the classical 20" century -- or 19" century literature from Europe, in English, of course, translated, and then these other books, and enjoying them both. </sentence><sentence id="248">But at any rate, no, I was really up on the news in Europe. </sentence><sentence id="249">There were a lot of other things too, the same time, an awful lot of trouble there. </sentence><sentence id="250">France was having a terrible time. </sentence><sentence id="251">This was followed up by the other activities that are -- were very ominous in Japan. </sentence><sentence id="252">They were going after Manchukuo -- ma -- Manchuria. </sentence><sentence id="253">And -- and in Africa the Italians were trying to take over -- </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="254">Q: Ethiopia. </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="255">A: Ethiopia. </sentence><sentence id="256">So, it was a very disturbing time, interesting time. </sentence><sentence id="257">I can't say that I was scared by it. </sentence><sentence id="258">I was intrigued by it, and there was some very good books at the time coming out, various commentators; professional journalists wrote books. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="274">Q: So I'd like to turn it back to, again, what you talked about earlier in your father, and his role in your education. </sentence><sentence id="275">And -- did these -- these events, these world events that you are talking about, not only in Europe but elsewhere, but of course for us it's particularly what was going on in Europe; were you discussing these at home? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="278">A: Oh yes, well, we -- we, of course, had dinner every night in the dining room, and it was a conversat-sational sort of sport. </sentence><sentence id="279">So we talked about everything, and sometimes when I wasn't old enough to know, I got instructed from the higher people, my mother and father. </sentence><sentence id="280">And yeah, you know, it was a -- it was a very good way to get educated, I think, without feeling the pain. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="284">Q: Yeah, it is. </sentence><sentence id="285">It is. </sentence><sentence id="286">To have got -- to have -- to have conversations around the dinner table about important events of the day is something that doesn't happen that often any more. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="304">Q: Yeah. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="306">A: The pretty -- pretty much accomplished journalists. </sentence><sentence id="307">And the -- and who could expound on a-anything. </sentence><sentence id="308">I think they had a little more freedom than they do today, because there are other people who popped up and said, you're wrong. </sentence><sentence id="309">And so that was a very good example of growing up in a democratic state. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="314">Q: Yeah, yeah. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="316">A: It was a-- it was a fine experience, and a lot of fun. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="322">A: Well, I did, actually I did, but that -- long before that, they had that article, which was very long. </sentence><sentence id="323">It took a whole bedsheet of paper, that they used to print on those days, and oh, they had the [indecipherable] that they -- usually you find in the -- in the English press, but in the American. </sentence><sentence id="324">Our correspondent in New York -- </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="325">Q: Yeah. </sentence><sentence id="326">That's right. </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="327">A: -- tell us what in the world is going on there? </sentence><sentence id="328">So -- so I was astonished, because they were sort of ta-- presuming. </sentence><sentence id="329">They didn't know how old I was. </sentence><sentence id="330">I know they wanted to find the -- </sentence></p><p><sentence id="331"> Interview with Brooks McClure " July 7, 2011 </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="332">Q: They didn't ask the basic questions. </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="333">A: They weren't -- well, they wanted to find out, but events were moving too fast. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="335">Q: Yeah. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="337">A: And I was, of course, absolutely stunned, because I had a plan. </sentence><sentence id="338">As soon as I got that rejection, I would write to an English paper in South Africa, and see if I could work on them. </sentence><sentence id="339">And there was no -- there was no compensation for this, but every few weeks I'd get a very generous check, a hundred dollars, which to me -- </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="340">Q: That's a lot of money. </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="341">A: -- was a lot of money, to cover my expenses. </sentence><sentence id="342">Well, my expenses were because I traveled by subway, and you know, were -- were very slim. </sentence><sentence id="343">And -- but I-- I had a terrible time because I found that between reading about these things and getting an idea of how coverage is done, and then having your pencil in your hand and trying to decide, do I do it, or d-d-- or don't I? </sentence><sentence id="344">I had a couple of disastrous -- potentially disastrous experiences. </sentence><sentence id="345">One was Lena Medina. </sentence><sentence id="346">Lena Medina was a five year old girl in Lima, Peru who gave birth to a child -- at least the story, this is what the story said. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="347">And my source was I had read it, it was a UP dispatch. </sentence><sentence id="348">And I knew because I'd gotten the -- a sort of the copy boy's job at the "Herald Tribune" at the -- at that time. </sentence><sentence id="349">I knew that the paper always substituted the UP for AP or anybody else in Latin America, because they felt that it was more reliable. </sentence><sentence id="350">So in comes this strange story, and I was too young to have the educational experience of anything involving women. </sentence><sentence id="351">Women were </sentence></p><p><sentence id="352">  ontectnetonancedjusetneey for tarher biormatoerabouttfisestecion </sentence></p><p><sentence id="353"> Interview with Brooks McClure " July 7, 2011 there, and what it takes -- what I assume it -- you know, it assumes that. </sentence><sentence id="354">But at any rate </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="355">Q: That it's unusual if they give birth at five. </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="356">A: -- this was all to -- very unusual, I thought it was -- I thought instinctively it was impossible, because I had never met anyone five years old who had a child. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="357">A2: Reasonable conclusion. </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="358">A: And so I sent in my cable as one of the little stories I had from America, this strange place where five year olds have children. </sentence><sentence id="359">And then apparently -- </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="360">Q: They printed it, I bet. </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="361">A: They -- they printed it, oh what they did though, they did a very clever thing. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1616">A: You just think of the idea, planning and executing these people in such a way. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1618">Q: Yeah. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1620">A: And this was the other way. </sentence><sentence id="1621">These were the dregs. </sentence><sentence id="1622">These were -- these were not the people who were employed in [indecipherable] plants all through Germany, or -- there -- there were a lot of commercial properties that were managed and run by these people. </sentence><sentence id="1623">Some fantastic stories about that, but seeing it is an emotional experience. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1641">A: We had the -- the -- the third army had the southern quarter of Germany to take care of. </sentence><sentence id="1642">We -- we were -- were -- we were at one point closest to Berlin, then moved down, on orders, of course. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1645">Q: Yes. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1647">A: And Patton was assigned this last southeastern quarter of Germany, and what went with it, a little bit of Czechoslovakia. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1649">Q: Right. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1651">A: And -- and Austria, of course. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1653">Q: Right. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1655">A: The Austrian experience is also -- that's where they have separate comment. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1657">Q: I'd like to get there. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1659">A: We were all a little anxious, I suppose. </sentence><sentence id="1660">We were doing very well, but when you're in a battle, if you're moving forward, you feel pretty good about that, but your -- you're further exposing yourself to doom. </sentence><sentence id="1661">And the -- I was -- I was not aware of -- of this sweep, but I knew it happened. </sentence><sentence id="1662">And in fact, after -- after the Battle of the Bulge, our --   Interview with Brooks McClure * July 7, 2011 our -- our army -- 1 --I--I---I'm afraid I--I shouldn't say our army, I wasn't in the army, but I -- in that army, but because I -- of my personal experience. </sentence><sentence id="1663">But oh, the casualties were fearsome. </sentence><sentence id="1664">And the men who really fought have a different, instinctive feeling about it. </sentence><sentence id="1665">But our infan -- infantry really ch -- went through them so fast, that we had some surprises. </sentence><sentence id="1666">We overtook the -- the retreat of the Germans. </sentence><sentence id="1667">They'd retreat a while, then they'd surrender. </sentence><sentence id="1668">And so -- but as I say, in -- in Austria they got another picture of it. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1680">Q: What happened in Austria? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1682">A: Because they were -- these were civilians and -- and the Austrians that were in the army were, of course, in the German army. </sentence><sentence id="1683">And so they didn't have much to do in Austria. </sentence><sentence id="1684">I know wa -- in our experience, the Austrian takeover was a cinch, after the fighting that we had done before. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1688">Q: Was this already -- if you were in Ohrdruf in a -- in April, where did you -- when the war ended in early May, do you remember that, where you were at the time? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1690">A: Yes, I was in Linz, Austria. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1694">A: Sure. </sentence><sentence id="1695">Sure, I -- the -- the end of war is really the end of war for -- for the Austrians, there was nothing. </sentence><sentence id="1696">And all the pretty girls, some very eager to cooperate ger -- Austrians, but not -- not resisting. </sentence><sentence id="1697">We had to face the possibility that we'd have to fight    </sentence></p><p><sentence id="1698"> Interview with Brooks McClure *e July 7, 2011 through it, but they didn't have -- they did -- they didn't have a home guard or anything, to give us any trouble, so [inaudible] </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1699">Q: Let's talk then about that second -- second episode -- </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1700">A: Oh yeah, well, that's a different thing entirely, and -- and in retrospect, it's a funny experience. </sentence><sentence id="1701">I enjoyed it so much afterwards, because it was so dangerous when it was done. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1704">Q: So tell us about that. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1706">A: I-- we were -- we were stationed in Linz, in western Austria, and I was -- I --I had attached myself to the -- to the intelligence section of the army. </sentence><sentence id="1707">And get -- got to know a very affable, probably 25 year old major who was working there too. </sentence><sentence id="1708">He was an infantry officer, a big man. </sentence><sentence id="1709">I -- apparently he certainly never showed any fear or anxiety under extreme pressure. </sentence><sentence id="1710">But at any rate, I reported in one day. </sentence><sentence id="1711">It was across town, I was with ya -- with my infantry friends, and -- eating there and so forth. </sentence><sentence id="1712">So I came in one morning, about eight o'clock I suppose, and there was this major whose name I can't remember -- and that's a shame, you know, that just -- should never forget the name of somebody who made such an impression. </sentence><sentence id="1713">But at any rate, he was a good -- good old boy, an Irish American, and he looked in his flushed face [indecipherable] and he looked very affable, friendly, took care of his non-coms and was very much appreciated. </sentence><sentence id="1714">So, he had come into the office just before me, and he got a call from the director of the museum. </sentence><sentence id="1715">And the director said oh, he was very sorry, had to bother him </sentence></p><p><sentence id="1716"> Interview with Brooks McClure * July 7, 2011 this way, but he heard about the -- the exchange of troops. </sentence><sentence id="1717">We had gone on the -- on the u-upper Austrian side of the Donau river, and had -- the Russians had moved in too far when we -- when we met. </sentence><sentence id="1718">There was a clerical error. </sentence><sentence id="1719">So that was passed. </sentence><sentence id="1720">The Russians were in that territory, we didn't try to throw them out, of course. </sentence><sentence id="1721">But they were advanced maybe -- maybe a couple of miles on -- on what was supposed to be a straight line of division. </sentence><sentence id="1722">And so they now -- now decided that they would settle all this at the very highest level. </sentence><sentence id="1723">Probably Patton himself participated, and they decided they'd better change this. </sentence><sentence id="1724">So they got together with the Russians and with perfect agreement on it, the Russians would pull back, and we would mo -- we'd move forward into that area. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="1725">And when -- although we didn't know anything, or I didn't know anything, of course, let me say that when I say we don't know, that means I don't know. </sentence><sentence id="1726">But at any rate, I didn't know there were planning to do this, they didn't consult me. </sentence><sentence id="1727">And so, both the major and I were very upset. </sentence><sentence id="1728">What happened was, when we first came in, the major went over to this museum, and talked to the director, who seemed to be a perfectly reasonable sort of person, to see were there kind of any pictures that were reputed to have been put there by Hitler. </sentence><sentence id="1729">And -- excuse -- </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1730">Q: Sure. </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1731">A: The director at that time said that no, there were no pictures, but that we could see that there were spaces where pictures had been. </sentence><sentence id="1732">And we didn't know what -- what wa -- happened to them. </sentence><sentence id="1733">So -- but nevertheless, any amount of questioning as the director, </sentence></p><p><sentence id="1734">  ontectnetonancedjusetneey for tarher biormatoerabouttfisestecion </sentence></p><p><sentence id="1735"> Interview with Brooks McClure * July 7, 2011 produced no answers. </sentence><sentence id="1736">And then of course, suddenly, the -- there came this change, and he discovered what he knew, or something, that the pictures were in a certain farm wa -- in a-- ina barn, couple of miles in -- in that area. </sentence><sentence id="1737">And so he said -- </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1738">Q: Where the Russians were -- where the Soviets were. </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1739">A: Yeah, right. </sentence><sentence id="1740">And he had -- he had the -- in fact, address. </sentence><sentence id="1741">He knew exactly how to get there. </sentence><sentence id="1742">He'd obviously checked somebody. </sentence><sentence id="1743">What they were, were cases, beautifully made, of wood, for each picture, whether it's small or large, and were beveled off so that they wouldn't hurt anything. </sentence><sentence id="1744">And he said, he se -- he was sort of apologetic because he knew he should have revealed this before. </sentence><sentence id="1745">Although I do -- I think if that had happened, what would happen is the Russians would have stiffened, and taken him away. </sentence><sentence id="1746">So we're probably lucky that this happened. </sentence><sentence id="1747">And -- and so, they --- "m-- I'm surprised they didn't have Russian guards on -- on these things. </sentence><sentence id="1748">But, at any rate -- </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1749">Q: Did he ask -- was his request to your Irish American major that -- that the Americans go and get his pictures back? </sentence><sentence id="1750">Was that what the request was? </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1751">A: No, it was a sort of a-- a spontaneous reaction of idiocy by everybody there, you know, they -- they really -- we all agreed. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1753">Q: That you had to get the pictures back? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1755">A: Yeah, had to get the pictures back. </sentence><sentence id="1756">And I don't know what happened to me. </sentence><sentence id="1757">I-- "m not prone to make profound decisions like this, but -- but he went around, and asked each soldier, do you want to go? </sentence><sentence id="1758">It's a little dangerous, but let's go. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="1759"> Interview with Brooks McClure * July 7, 2011 </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1760">Q: And this is your major? </sentence><sentence id="1761">Yeah. </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1762">A: Yeah, this fella, he didn't know any more than I did really, but at any rate, he's a very low rank in that big army, and he was making an awful decision. </sentence><sentence id="1763">But he -- we could have all been wiped out. </sentence><sentence id="1764">Was the craziest thing, going over the Linz bridge, to the other side of the Donau, and feeling that you might be going to your death. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="1765">Anyway, there we were, all armed, everybody had a rifle or a machine gun or something, whatever had been assigned to them. </sentence><sentence id="1766">And it was a -- I thought it was a comical thing afterwards, but I didn't think that -- very much that way at the time. </sentence><sentence id="1767">So we all went in a little convoy, with the major out ahead in a Jeep, and most of us back in the trucks. </sentence><sentence id="1768">We had two big trucks, and we didn't know how much we were going to face. </sentence><sentence id="1769">Well, we got out there, and in very short order I remember thinking, if I were driving, I wouldn't have been that -- that -- that good. </sentence><sentence id="1770">But we arrived in there, in the top of an enormous barn. </sentence><sentence id="1771">You know the way those barns were constructed? </sentence><sentence id="1772">They used the upper levels for hay that they dropped down in the spring. </sentence><sentence id="1773">And so there were the pictures, among a lot of fressen for the cow -- for the -- the bulls, or what have you. </sentence><sentence id="1774">And the -- we became a little worried, because the biggest thing of the lot -- not -- not -- not the -- the heaviest thing was an unusual shape. </sentence><sentence id="1775">It was about two feet wide, two feet high, and about six feet long, and weighed like lead, oh. </sentence><sentence id="1776">We c -- we -- we could move the pictures pretty easily, but this thing, we didn't know what it was, we couldn't take the time to open it, and so we thought we had [indecipherable] take -- take it. </sentence><sentence id="1777">So for </sentence></p><p><sentence id="1778">   Interview with Brooks McClure " July 7, 2011 our two and a half ton truck, we -- we put it on the -- the -- down early. </sentence><sentence id="1779">But it took all the muscular strength we could master. </sentence><sentence id="1780">And so when we got back, w-we drove back, and that was a terrorizing experience, because there was nothing but death. </sentence><sentence id="1781">Nothing moved in that whole distance that we had -- </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1782">Q: You did -- did you -- </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1783">A: -- that -- that they had evacuated. </sentence></p></dialogue>
