<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1322">A: Kerosene, we had kerosene lamps. </sentence><sentence id="1323">Okay, the members of the family. </sentence><sentence id="1324">The priest had died some years before, two, three, five, I don't know. </sentence><sentence id="1325">The wife of the priest was very highly revered in the town and she was, in fact, feared. </sentence><sentence id="1326">She was spoken of in the third person, you know. </sentence><sentence id="1327">Enormous respect was accorded her. </sentence><sentence id="1328">She was spoken of in the way you speak of a -- almost a god or a monarch, or whatever. </sentence><sentence id="1329">Very highly respected and revered. </sentence><sentence id="1330">People paid court. </sentence><sentence id="1331">There were obligatory visits that they had to make. </sentence><sentence id="1332">They brought baskets of fruit, or whatever, to visit her. </sentence><sentence id="1333">They would nod in our direction whether we were sitting by the window or not, nod toward our house as they walked by to pay respect, that sort of thing. </sentence><sentence id="1334">Now she was a very bright woman. </sentence><sentence id="1335">It was decided that my new identity was going to be that she was -- she spoke fluent Polish -- she was very well educated. </sentence><sentence id="1336">She was fluent in Polish so my identity was going to be that she was Polish and had married the Ukrainian priest but she had a sister back in Poland and I was that sister's child. </sentence><sentence id="1337">That was -- since I came from, I don't know where, wherever they had me come from in Poland, my Ukrainian was not perfect, my Russian was not This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="1338">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="1339"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection absolutely perfect, but that was the excuse. </sentence><sentence id="1340">I was brought from the city of -- I was her niece, or her relative, or whatever and that was why my name was different. </sentence><sentence id="1341">I didn't look exactly like them and that was my beard. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1363">Q: You were given a new last name? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1365">A: Yes, yes. </sentence><sentence id="1366">So I had a new last name which was a Polish last name. </sentence><sentence id="1367">Theirs was a Russian name, obviously. </sentence><sentence id="1368">I remember only that my name was purported to have ended in ski whereas theirs ended in kvov which son of whatever as does ski, I think. </sentence><sentence id="1369">In any case, so I was --well, it's irrelevant, okay, I won't give you all that. </sentence><sentence id="1370">In any case, this woman had five children. </sentence><sentence id="1371">The oldest was Ivan and Ivan was the son who really didn't take too terribly well to education. </sentence><sentence id="1372">I don't think he was ever sent abroad. </sentence><sentence id="1373">He was sort of more interested in farming. </sentence><sentence id="1374">He was very practical, he was the farmer. </sentence><sentence id="1375">He was huge, he had a moustache, he never smiled, he rolled his own cigarettes, he spat into a spittoon. </sentence><sentence id="1376">You know, he was more like a peasant. </sentence><sentence id="1377">He was very well liked and respected and he was like one of the boys and probably the head boy, you know. </sentence><sentence id="1378">Then there was a middle son and he was very rebellious. </sentence><sentence id="1379">He ultimately ran off to the forest and was with the partisans. </sentence><sentence id="1380">In fact, I used to hide out by the woods when the Germans came. </sentence><sentence id="1381">At one point, I was hidden in the hayloft, haystack rather. </sentence><sentence id="1382">He once or twice came and gave me messages which I carried back. </sentence><sentence id="1383">But I hardly remember him because he left. </sentence><sentence id="1384">I don't even remember his name. </sentence><sentence id="1385">I remember that his mother -- I remember his mother describing him to someone, and she said, and it's funny because it's an expression that I've used many times because it described him so well, it described his nature. </sentence><sentence id="1386">She said that this middle son when he has a cause or feels strongly about something would fight until he was up to his knees in blood. </sentence><sentence id="1387">I don't know whether that was a Russian saying but I've heard myself saying that in describing such a person, a kind of tenacious stubborn person. </sentence><sentence id="1388">The youngest son was two years older than I was. </sentence><sentence id="1389">His name was Vali and I was -- he and I slept in the same bed. </sentence><sentence id="1390">I was, I don't know, five and a half, six; he was two years older. </sentence><sentence id="1391">I can describe him perfectly. </sentence><sentence id="1392">He was very tow headed. </sentence><sentence id="1393">He had a cowlick in sort of in the wrong place. </sentence><sentence id="1394">It was just above the widow's peak where his hairline began. </sentence><sentence id="1395">He had a sort of a double cowlick with cowlicks going in opposite directions at that point. </sentence><sentence id="1396">Because of that, his hair was almost shaved off. </sentence><sentence id="1397">Because had it not been, it probably wouldn't have been able to sort of stay all in the same direction. </sentence><sentence id="1398">So he has this Russian version of a crew cut. </sentence><sentence id="1399">So those were the three sons. </sentence><sentence id="1400">The two daughters were Rya, who I've already told you about and the older one whose name I really don't remember and whom I didn't get to know very well because she already worked and lived in, sort of in town. </sentence><sentence id="1401">So she had some sort of office type job. </sentence><sentence id="1402">Rya was the homemaker and Ivan was the farmer who grew the whatever, the provider and the man about the house. </sentence><sentence id="1403">Vali was the kid and my playmate sort of, and the middle boy was the rebellious, I don't know, 14 year old he was, who ran off and joined the partisans and became what we called a Cossack. </sentence><sentence id="1404">So that was the household. </sentence><sentence id="1405">Now I was not received with any degree of love or kindness. </sentence><sentence id="1406">I wasn't sheltered or shielded or loved at all. </sentence><sentence id="1407">I was tolerated, I was respected and I was sort of taken care of but never with kindness, never with love. </sentence><sentence id="1408">I was never complimented. </sentence><sentence id="1409">If1I did something very well, it was -- more than anything I had the feeling of resentment. </sentence><sentence id="1410">Furthermore, I was from the city. </sentence><sentence id="1411">I was urbane and Vali was a peasant. </sentence><sentence id="1412">He had never been to the city. </sentence><sentence id="1413">I described the building in which I lived which had four floors. </sentence><sentence id="1414">He couldn't understand that there was a room above a room. </sentence><sentence id="1415">| explained to him that it was like the attic where they dried their apple slices on a -- strung from one end to another -- and stored things. </sentence><sentence id="1416">Also like the cellar where the cabbage slaw was kept and that, in fact, his house had three floors. </sentence><sentence id="1417">But these were four floors of one above the other, bedrooms and, you know, apartments. </sentence><sentence id="1418">I described one apartment building. </sentence><sentence id="1419">He couldn't conceive of such a thing. </sentence><sentence id="1420">He couldn't conceive of such a thing as chocolate either. </sentence><sentence id="1421">So that when we were finally This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="1422">It is

</sentence><sentence id="1425">They were, you know, driven out by the Russians and there was fighting back and forth. </sentence><sentence id="1426">So they were there several times, in and out. </sentence><sentence id="1427">At some point, I became very brazen and I wound up sitting on the laps of officers. </sentence><sentence id="1428">They would pinch my cheeks, kiychy-koo and play with me and so forth and give me chocolate. </sentence><sentence id="1429">I would then take the chocolate and give it to Vali. </sentence><sentence id="1430">Until the mother found out about this and put a stop to it because it was, you know, absolutely life threatening. </sentence><sentence id="1431">Well, anyway I never really had any love. </sentence><sentence id="1432">I was incredibly lonely. </sentence><sentence id="1433">I kept thinking about my mother. </sentence><sentence id="1434">One day, it just occurred to me that she's not living and she'l never come back. </sentence><sentence id="1435">Meanwhile the mother, Vali's mother, Rya's mother, was teaching me to read, to sew, to be a Ukrainian child, girl. </sentence><sentence id="1436">Taught me all the things, how to spin, how to weave, how to sew, how to mend, how to cook a little bit although it was very difficult because of the primitive style of cooking in deep ovens with iron pots. </sentence><sentence id="1437">You know, children couldn't physically manage that but everyone had jobs and mine was peeling the potatoes. </sentence><sentence id="1438">In the time that I was there, in the two and a half years, I must have peeled ten truckloads of potatoes, that's all I did. </sentence><sentence id="1439">I peeled potatoes. </sentence><sentence id="1440">I read with the mother and at first she would read to me. </sentence><sentence id="1441">She read me Bible stories. </sentence><sentence id="1442">She would read to me and she would point to the words with her finger. </sentence><sentence id="1443">I would watch her moving finger across the page and then she would turn the page and there would be a picture that related to the story. </sentence><sentence id="1444">She would continue the story and I kind of fell in love with one story. </sentence><sentence id="1445">I kept asking her to read it over and over. </sentence><sentence id="1446">It was the story of the prodigal son. </sentence><sentence id="1447">I don't know why I liked that one especially but somehow... So she read it over and over and then one day in the middle of the story, she sort of looked up and she said, you read, and I did. </sentence><sentence id="1448">And not only did I read but -- maybe because I had heard that one so many times -- I understood it and I read it and we turn the page and went on to the next story. </sentence><sentence id="1449">At one point we turned the page and there was a picture of little girls crossing a little bridge over a -- you know -- like a little stream. </sentence><sentence id="1450">Hovering -- and there was a very sort of rickety little bridge, maybe a log, whatever it was, and it looked dangerous with the rushing water underneath. </sentence><sentence id="1451">Hovering in flight with arms outstretched behind the little child was an angel with beautiful wings like a bird and a flowing gown. </sentence><sentence id="1452">I said what is that and she explained to me about angels. </sentence><sentence id="1453">I said everybody has an angel? </sentence><sentence id="1454">She said every child has an angel to protect it. </sentence><sentence id="1455">I said even Jewish children? </sentence><sentence id="1456">She said yes, even Jewish children and even you. </sentence><sentence id="1457">You have a very special angel. </sentence><sentence id="1458">So that night I went to sleep and I woke up and I knew who my angel was. </sentence><sentence id="1459">I was absolutely certain that my own angel was the infant Jesus and that I would be protected because I had a Jewish angel. </sentence><sentence id="1460">No harm would come to me. </sentence><sentence id="1461">I knew that I would be all right. </sentence><sentence id="1462">I can tell you a lot of stories about life in that village. </sentence><sentence id="1463">I was there two Christmases and three Easters or maybe the other way around. </sentence><sentence id="1464">It's the other way around. </sentence><sentence id="1465">One day, you're not going to believe this, you're not going to believe this...
