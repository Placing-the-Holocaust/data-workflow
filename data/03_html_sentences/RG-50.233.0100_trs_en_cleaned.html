<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1197">Q: You were someplace in the western Ukraine, late summer, end of summer deg41 and your mother is now giving you to this young woman who was also from Warsaw originally? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="1199"> A No. </sentence><sentence id="1200">Now [ have to give you a little bit of background. </sentence><sentence id="1201">First of all, Rya was no more than a teenager at that point. </sentence><sentence id="1202">I would say, that at the most, she was 16 or 17. </sentence><sentence id="1203">I would have been say five and a half, six. </sentence><sentence id="1204">So Rya was, I don't know, ten years older. </sentence><sentence id="1205">A little background... In the Ukraine, what I know of the Ukraine, there are little villages. </sentence><sentence id="1206">Obviously, there are big towns but the countryside of the Ukraine was... This is another life, now I'm giving you history that I -- this is where I lived. </sentence><sentence id="1207">There were little villages which were connected to each other by dirt roads. </sentence><sentence id="1208">During the summer these roads were traversed by horse drawn carriage, not carriages but carts. </sentence><sentence id="1209">The villages -- surrounding these villages were the farms. </sentence><sentence id="1210">The land had been divided after the fall of the Czars, Czar, First World War, had been divided among the peasants. </sentence><sentence id="1211">Previous to that, it was owned by the Church. </sentence><sentence id="1212">So that now although the people were very religious and were very loyal to the village priest and they were very generous to him; he was no longer as wealthy and flamboyant as they had been during the time of the Czars, during White Russia. </sentence><sentence id="1213">But because the peasants were religious, the priests lived a far better life than did the peasants. </sentence><sentence id="1214">Now it's the Greek Orthodox Church, the Bible is in Greek. </sentence><sentence id="1215">The priests marry and have families. </sentence><sentence id="1216">The families were the intelligentsias, if you will, of the village. </sentence><sentence id="1217">The children of the priests became the postmaster, the school teachers, the mayor, if there was such a thing. </sentence><sentence id="1218">They sort of ran the community. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1239">Q: They could read and write? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1241">A: They could read and write. </sentence><sentence id="1242">Some f them were very highly educated. </sentence><sentence id="1243">The more wealthy was the priest, the better educated were his children. </sentence><sentence id="1244">In order to be educated they were sent "abroad". </sentence><sentence id="1245">Abroad meant great cities in Europe like Warsaw where this particular Rya, child of a priest in an Ukrainian village would up studying in Warsaw with my father. </sentence><sentence id="1246">Apparently she took private lessons at home or somehow or other got home to meet my mother and became enamored of my mother and became a frequent visitor. </sentence><sentence id="1247">I told you earlier about the generosity of my grandmother and her warmth and so forth, and I am sure that my mother befriend this young girl from the Ukraine in a similar sort of way, although this girl was not of peasant stock. </sentence><sentence id="1248">But my mother liked her and they had a relationship. </sentence><sentence id="1249">Therefore, when my mother bumped into her in town and explained our plight, Rya must have asked -- I had to have been a baby, less than four -- and Rya must have played with me or possibly babysat or whatever. </sentence><sentence id="1250">So when my mother explained our plight and the possibilities of our disaster, Rya being an altruistic, kind and religious teenager said, well I'll take her home and hide her with me, without any thought to the consequences or to the reaction of her family or the possible danger to herself, her family, the entire village, the future, I mean, you know, nothing. </sentence><sentence id="1251">She simply offered and my mother jumped at the opportunity. </sentence><sentence id="1252">So my mother sent me off with a little package of clothing wrapped around a handkerchief, my teddy bear who was now significantly smaller than I was. </sentence><sentence id="1253">I remember walking down the front steps. </sentence><sentence id="1254">I remember my mother standing on the stairs saying don't turn around. </sentence><sentence id="1255">Just go, walk through the gate and don't turn around, keep walking. </sentence><sentence id="1256">Remember what I told you, remember what I told you. </sentence><sentence id="1257">We walked through the -- down the stairs and through the garden. </sentence><sentence id="1258">I remember that the garden was overgrown and unkempt and wilted and a great mass of jungle. </sentence><sentence id="1259">It had been cultivated at one time. </sentence><sentence id="1260">That's why I -- it was late summer. </sentence><sentence id="1261">I remember walking with Rya holding my hand and I holding on to my teddy bear and Rya with the bundle. </sentence><sentence id="1262">We walked out and I turned once to look at my mother and she was holding a handkerchief up to her face. </sentence><sentence id="1263">She yelled again don't turn around, keep walking. </sentence><sentence id="1264">That's my last memory of my mother. </sentence><sentence id="1265">I don't even remember getting to the village or anything    about it. </sentence><sentence id="1266">I don't remember arriving, I don't remember any of that. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1293">Q: Had you remembered Rya from before? </sentence><sentence id="1294">Or were you -- as far as you were concerned this was a stranger? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1297">A: No, I might have -- I don't know, I really don't know. </sentence><sentence id="1298">I don't remember whether I remembered then or...I was just an obedient child and I went... If my mother said she would come for me, she would come for me. </sentence><sentence id="1299">If she said that I would be safe and I should go, that was it. </sentence><sentence id="1300">I trusted my mother and I knew not to argue with my mother. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1305">Q: Were you wearing your yellow star? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1307">A: I don't know. </sentence><sentence id="1308">I don't imagine so, I don't know. </sentence><sentence id="1309">I'm not sure that that yellow star was on summer clothing. </sentence><sentence id="1310">I think it might have only been on outerwear. </sentence><sentence id="1311">I really don't recall that. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1317">Q: But Rya knew you were Jewish? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1319">A: Rya. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1321">Q: Rya. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1323">A: Yes, yes. </sentence><sentence id="1324">So now we arrive in the village of the Ukraine. </sentence><sentence id="1325">I'll describe the village to you. </sentence><sentence id="1326">There was a dirt road through which you got to the village. </sentence><sentence id="1327">When you got to the village, there were houses, there's one in these pictures somewhere. </sentence><sentence id="1328">There's a man standing in front of it -- I was looking at it before and now I can't find it. </sentence><sentence id="1329">It's kind of log cabins with thatched roofs. </sentence><sentence id="1330">Why don't you turn that off for a moment and I'll look for the pictures? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1339">Q: Sure. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1341">A: There were houses like I pointed out to you with thatched roofs, log cabin kind of houses, but whitewashed; whitewashed log cabins. </sentence><sentence id="1342">Then the road split like a wishbone. </sentence><sentence id="1343">In the crook of the wishbone sat a small, white church with steps going up. </sentence><sentence id="1344">It had a large door and two windows. </sentence><sentence id="1345">When I looked at it, it looked like a clown face because it had a big window on each side of the door and the steps -- it looked like a clown with his tongue hanging out. </sentence><sentence id="1346">It had a sharp point at the top of the cross with the slash underneath. </sentence><sentence id="1347">The road went around it. </sentence><sentence id="1348">Behind the church was a small cemetery with crosses, stone crosses. </sentence><sentence id="1349">There was a legend that the cross of the priest whose family I was about to live with, that stone cross grew every year. </sentence><sentence id="1350">The people wee so superstitious and they had revered this particular priest to such a degree that these legends about him grew. </sentence><sentence id="1351">Anyway, the houses continued as the road -- the two roads... </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1363">Q: Diverged. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1365">A: Diverged, exactly behind the church. </sentence><sentence id="1366">I would say that at the very most there were 30 to 50 houses. </sentence><sentence id="1367">That was the entire town. </sentence><sentence id="1368">On the left side behind our house, which was the most elegant house, it was a clapboard house, very different from the other cabins...Further back behind our house was a stream and then a forest. </sentence><sentence id="1369">On the opposite side of town, to my right, as I was facing the church was a road that led out to the fields where all of the various wheat and grain and hemp and barley and whatever all was grown was. </sentence><sentence id="1370">That was the entire town. </sentence><sentence id="1371">There was no electricity, there were no automobiles, there were no telephones. </sentence><sentence id="1372">The donation that I   made to you, I wrote a little piece to go with it. </sentence><sentence id="1373">The little dress we grew our own hemp. </sentence><sentence id="1374">We spun on a spinning wheel, we spun the yarn. </sentence><sentence id="1375">It was loomed at home, on a loom. </sentence><sentence id="1376">I sewed it by hand. </sentence><sentence id="1377">Life was primitive. </sentence><sentence id="1378">I am sure that it was no different than it had been two centuries before. </sentence><sentence id="1379">That was the life of the village. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1396">Q: Okay. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1398">A: So I've described the village to you. </sentence><sentence id="1399">Okay, the household. </sentence><sentence id="1400">I mean I could describe our house. </sentence><sentence id="1401">Very briefly, I'll tell you that life was centered for the most part around the kitchen, primarily because it was the warmest place. </sentence><sentence id="1402">There was no central heating of any kind, in fact. </sentence><sentence id="1403">There is usually a fireplace in one room and the wall against which the fireplace is in one room is the bed wall in the adjacent room simply because of the heat, you know, the warmth. </sentence><sentence id="1404">There was one room which must have been the back of the kitchen, the wall behind where the oven where we baked our bread was. </sentence><sentence id="1405">We used to sit in that room a great deal. </sentence><sentence id="1406">Or if not sit, we would stand with our hands behind our back leaning on that warm wall. </sentence><sentence id="1407">We would take turns because only one spot on the wall was really warm and so we would take turns. </sentence><sentence id="1408">That was how our evenings were spent. </sentence><sentence id="1409">We would tell stories. </sentence><sentence id="1410">In fact, Rya devised a game. </sentence><sentence id="1411">She would start a story. </sentence><sentence id="1412">She would say Mirka and Vali were two beautiful children and they went on a picnic. </sentence><sentence id="1413">When they got out to the woods a wolf suddenly jumped out from behind a tree and Mirka said ---, and she would point to me and I would have to pick up the story. </sentence><sentence id="1414">Then I would take the story to some precipice and the next person would go on with it. </sentence><sentence id="1415">This is how we entertained ourselves at night and then we would all go to sleep. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1434">Q: Just you and Rya? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1436">A: No and other members of the family. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1438">Q: Were there other brothers. ..? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="1440"> A Yes, I'll tell you about that. </sentence><sentence id="1441">That's how our evenings were spent. </sentence><sentence id="1442">There wasn't much to the evening because we woke up to the roosters. </sentence><sentence id="1443">They took off with the first light, they would crow. </sentence><sentence id="1444">Life would start at five in the morning or whatever it was and I am sure we were all in bed and asleep by dark. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1450">Q: Candlelight? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1452">A: Kerosene, we had kerosene lamps. </sentence><sentence id="1453">Okay, the members of the family. </sentence><sentence id="1454">The priest had died some years before, two, three, five, I don't know. </sentence><sentence id="1455">The wife of the priest was very highly revered in the town and she was, in fact, feared. </sentence><sentence id="1456">She was spoken of in the third person, you know. </sentence><sentence id="1457">Enormous respect was accorded her. </sentence><sentence id="1458">She was spoken of in the way you speak of a -- almost a god or a monarch, or whatever. </sentence><sentence id="1459">Very highly respected and revered. </sentence><sentence id="1460">People paid court. </sentence><sentence id="1461">There were obligatory visits that they had to make. </sentence><sentence id="1462">They brought baskets of fruit, or whatever, to visit her. </sentence><sentence id="1463">They would nod in our direction whether we were sitting by the window or not, nod toward our house as they walked by to pay respect, that sort of thing. </sentence><sentence id="1464">Now she was a very bright woman. </sentence><sentence id="1465">It was decided that my new identity was going to be that she was -- she spoke fluent Polish -- she was very well educated. </sentence><sentence id="1466">She was fluent in Polish so my identity was going to be that she was Polish and had married the Ukrainian priest but she had a sister back in Poland and I was that sister's child. </sentence><sentence id="1467">That was -- since I came from, I don't know where, wherever they had me come from in Poland, my Ukrainian was not perfect, my Russian was not   absolutely perfect, but that was the excuse. </sentence><sentence id="1468">I was brought from the city of -- I was her niece, or her relative, or whatever and that was why my name was different. </sentence><sentence id="1469">I didn't look exactly like them and that was my beard. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1489">Q: You were given a new last name? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1491">A: Yes, yes. </sentence><sentence id="1492">So I had a new last name which was a Polish last name. </sentence><sentence id="1493">Theirs was a Russian name, obviously. </sentence><sentence id="1494">I remember only that my name was purported to have ended in ski whereas theirs ended in kvov which son of whatever as does ski, I think. </sentence><sentence id="1495">In any case, so I was --well, it's irrelevant, okay, I won't give you all that. </sentence><sentence id="1496">In any case, this woman had five children. </sentence><sentence id="1497">The oldest was Ivan and Ivan was the son who really didn't take too terribly well to education. </sentence><sentence id="1498">I don't think he was ever sent abroad. </sentence><sentence id="1499">He was sort of more interested in farming. </sentence><sentence id="1500">He was very practical, he was the farmer. </sentence><sentence id="1501">He was huge, he had a moustache, he never smiled, he rolled his own cigarettes, he spat into a spittoon. </sentence><sentence id="1502">You know, he was more like a peasant. </sentence><sentence id="1503">He was very well liked and respected and he was like one of the boys and probably the head boy, you know. </sentence><sentence id="1504">Then there was a middle son and he was very rebellious. </sentence><sentence id="1505">He ultimately ran off to the forest and was with the partisans. </sentence><sentence id="1506">In fact, I used to hide out by the woods when the Germans came. </sentence><sentence id="1507">At one point, I was hidden in the hayloft, haystack rather. </sentence><sentence id="1508">He once or twice came and gave me messages which I carried back. </sentence><sentence id="1509">But I hardly remember him because he left. </sentence><sentence id="1510">I don't even remember his name. </sentence><sentence id="1511">I remember that his mother -- I remember his mother describing him to someone, and she said, and it's funny because it's an expression that I've used many times because it described him so well, it described his nature. </sentence><sentence id="1512">She said that this middle son when he has a cause or feels strongly about something would fight until he was up to his knees in blood. </sentence><sentence id="1513">I don't know whether that was a Russian saying but I've heard myself saying that in describing such a person, a kind of tenacious stubborn person. </sentence><sentence id="1514">The youngest son was two years older than I was. </sentence><sentence id="1515">His name was Vali and I was -- he and I slept in the same bed. </sentence><sentence id="1516">I was, I don't know, five and a half, six; he was two years older. </sentence><sentence id="1517">I can describe him perfectly. </sentence><sentence id="1518">He was very tow headed. </sentence><sentence id="1519">He had a cowlick in sort of in the wrong place. </sentence><sentence id="1520">It was just above the widow's peak where his hairline began. </sentence><sentence id="1521">He had a sort of a double cowlick with cowlicks going in opposite directions at that point. </sentence><sentence id="1522">Because of that, his hair was almost shaved off. </sentence><sentence id="1523">Because had it not been, it probably wouldn't have been able to sort of stay all in the same direction. </sentence><sentence id="1524">So he has this Russian version of a crew cut. </sentence><sentence id="1525">So those were the three sons. </sentence><sentence id="1526">The two daughters were Rya, who I've already told you about and the older one whose name I really don't remember and whom I didn't get to know very well because she already worked and lived in, sort of in town. </sentence><sentence id="1527">So she had some sort of office type job. </sentence><sentence id="1528">Rya was the homemaker and Ivan was the farmer who grew the whatever, the provider and the man about the house. </sentence><sentence id="1529">Vali was the kid and my playmate sort of, and the middle boy was the rebellious, I don't know, 14 year old he was, who ran off and joined the partisans and became what we called a Cossack. </sentence><sentence id="1530">So that was the household. </sentence><sentence id="1531">Now I was not received with any degree of love or kindness. </sentence><sentence id="1532">I wasn't sheltered or shielded or loved at all. </sentence><sentence id="1533">I was tolerated, I was respected and I was sort of taken care of but never with kindness, never with love. </sentence><sentence id="1534">I was never complimented. </sentence><sentence id="1535">If1I did something very well, it was -- more than anything I had the feeling of resentment. </sentence><sentence id="1536">Furthermore, I was from the city. </sentence><sentence id="1537">I was urbane and Vali was a peasant. </sentence><sentence id="1538">He had never been to the city. </sentence><sentence id="1539">I described the building in which I lived which had four floors. </sentence><sentence id="1540">He couldn't understand that there was a room above a room. </sentence><sentence id="1541">| explained to him that it was like the attic where they dried their apple slices on a -- strung from one end to another -- and stored things. </sentence><sentence id="1542">Also like the cellar where the cabbage slaw was kept and that, in fact, his house had three floors. </sentence><sentence id="1543">But these were four floors of one above the other, bedrooms and, you know, apartments. </sentence><sentence id="1544">I described one apartment building. </sentence><sentence id="1545">He couldn't conceive of such a thing. </sentence><sentence id="1546">He couldn't conceive of such a thing as chocolate either. </sentence><sentence id="1547">So that when we were finally  http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection invaded by the German army, the first time I was hidden in the haystack which I already mentioned. </sentence><sentence id="1548">But then they went back and forth and in and out. </sentence><sentence id="1549">They were, you know, driven out by the Russians and there was fighting back and forth. </sentence><sentence id="1550">So they were there several times, in and out. </sentence><sentence id="1551">At some point, I became very brazen and I wound up sitting on the laps of officers. </sentence><sentence id="1552">They would pinch my cheeks, kiychy-koo and play with me and so forth and give me chocolate. </sentence><sentence id="1553">I would then take the chocolate and give it to Vali. </sentence><sentence id="1554">Until the mother found out about this and put
