care of him? </sentence><sentence id="255">And so my mother went up and got one of the -- one of the neighbors to take care of me "till my grandmother could come and collect us. </sentence><sentence id="256">And that the last time I saw my mother and father "till spring of 1941. </sentence><sentence id="257">And they went to the downtown Vienna prison, and I understand for the two years they were in the downtown Vienna prison they saw each other one time in the exercise yard and never talked. </sentence><sentence id="258">But you have to understand here is a woman who has had the best of everything and she's living in a wing with 200 women, one shower, no doors; one toilet, no doors. </sentence><sentence id="259">But through this entire time, my former nanny used to come and collect her laundry and do her laundry for her, you know, what little rags she had. </sentence><sentence id="260">And she -- it was just kind of  ontectnetonancedjusietneey for tarher biormatieraboutfisoeecion Interview with Paul Halpern 10 different, you know. </sentence><sentence id="261">So we -- we went to -- we went to my grandmother's house and that's -- if you're going to record this, this is -- my grandfather, right after the Auschwitz and the troops were in the street, went on a normal business trip to Switzerland. </sentence><sentence id="262">And about three days later, my mother got -- my grandmother got a letter. </sentence><sentence id="263">And the letter said, By the time you get this letter. </sentence><sentence id="264">I'm on my way to the United States. </sentence><sentence id="265">I am not coming back. </sentence><sentence id="266">They don't want you. </sentence><sentence id="267">They want me. </sentence><sentence id="268">So sometime in the next week they will come and say to you, Where's your husband? </sentence><sentence id="269">And you show them this letter, and they're going to say, When is he coming back? </sentence><sentence id="270">And you're going to say, He's not coming back. </sentence><sentence id="271">Just show them the letter, and eventually they'll let you go because they don't want you. </sentence><sentence id="272">Sign over anything they want, give them anything you want -- they want, and they'll let you go -- because this is still early on. </sentence><sentence id="273">And that's exactly how it happened. </sentence><sentence id="274">And so, finally, after about by the spring of "39, my grandmother's arranging for us to go into Kindertransport, and they said, Just sign here. </sentence><sentence id="275">Give us the bill and then sign over and get out. </sentence><sentence id="276">And she said, Not until I put my kids -- my grandkids on the train. </sentence><sentence id="277">And they said, No, you have to get out. </sentence><sentence id="278">She said, No. </sentence><sentence id="279">I'm not getting out until they get on the train. </sentence><sentence id="280">That's how tough she was. </sentence><sentence id="281">And she was the only member of my family who was over 5'6, you know. </sentence><sentence id="282">So she was the queen. </sentence><sentence id="283">She put us on the train, and she went to the United States; and she joined her husband who was -- he had guts. </sentence><sentence id="284">I mean, he played -- he played with people's lives, but he -- he knew human nature. </sentence><sentence id="285">He knew that as long as they got what they wanted they were going to -- and I went to England, and I remember the -- I remember the train ride. </sentence><sentence id="286">And, you know, a little them -- them memories and I had my father's brother was in London, and he had come to England with his wife, Auga (ph),  Interview with Paul Halpern 11 as a domestic. </sentence><sentence id="287">They signed on as a couple, and Auga (ph) came over pregnant. </sentence><sentence id="288">So their son, Ralph, was born in England and was a British subject, and did very well. </sentence><sentence id="289">He is a Lord of the British Emperor. </sentence><sentence id="290">His name is Sir Ralph Halpern, and he was chairman of the board of Burton Industries, and he now lives in South Beach, and my -- my son and he are good friends. </sentence><sentence id="291">And I see them occasionally, and he was always a -- always a Brit and he's always been a Brit. </sentence><sentence id="292">Calls me Dear Boy and he's six years younger than I am. </sentence><sentence id="293">And it's kind of racy, and I -- he and I have a good time together. </sentence><sentence id="294">And -- and but there was nowhere we could stay in England -- we could stay with him in London. </sentence><sentence id="295">We'd stay a couple of days, and then went down to Bunce Court and Dan (ph) Court to -- Kindertransport. </sentence><sentence id="296">They made an arrangement for the kids who did not have -- weren't going to be taken there by families. </sentence><sentence id="297">There was -- there were these estates out by Kent, and they brought in an educator from Berlin named Anna Essinger and who was the most magnificent teacher. </sentence><sentence id="298">I was there 16 months, and I stayed in one school, and my sister stayed in the other school. </sentence><sentence id="299">And I can't tell you whether I was in Bunce Court or Dan Court. </sentence><sentence id="300">I think I was in Bunce Court because it comes easier to my mind, but, you know, the memories are strange. </sentence><sentence id="301">All I know is that I did a lot of schooling because I jumped like three years when I came here immediately because they thought I was a poor refugee kid until I -- I told them -- they put me in the second grade. </sentence><sentence id="302">I could read. </sentence><sentence id="303">I could do math. </sentence><sentence id="304">I -- I had a little bit of chemistry. </sentence><sentence id="305">I knew European History because that's what that's what the regimen there was, and the -- they -- the -- the -- the bombings were pretty bad around that area because a lot of fighter bases were in that area, and we got sent to London and -- which is interesting because then the Brits started in London for sure. </sentence><sentence id="306">And  http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection Interview with Paul Halpern 12 the Brits -- Britains decided to have their own Kindertransport and, they went and signed up 30,000 children to get them first to the countryside and then to the colonies Australia, South Africa, New Zealand, Halifax. </sentence><sentence id="307">And it was a little bit different. </sentence><sentence id="308">And from what I'd been read -- what I read -- it was part of the government in power at that time, and he said this is a mistake because they have to go by boat. </sentence><sentence id="309">And the -- the Germans controlled the seas. </sentence><sentence id="310">And if we lose one boat, when the war is over, we will lose the election because that will be an issue. </sentence><sentence id="311">And we were supposed to go in December of -- September 10th or 12th we were -- 1940, we were supposed to go from London to Liverpool to catch a boat, and I remember we sat in the station -- in Victoria Station because the air raids were very bad at that time, and we missed the boat. </sentence><sentence id="312">And it was the City of Benares, and the City of Benares was a troop ship converted from a Cunard-White Star Line. </sentence><sentence id="313">The City of Benares was sunk a three days later in the -- on its way -- way, and I think 89 children didn't die in the sinking but died of exposure to water. </sentence><sentence id="314">It was a horrific thing. </sentence><sentence id="315">And Churchill immediately cancelled that -- and about 3500 -- there were books on that -- there were more books on that Kindertransport than our Kindertransport because it was a different issue. </sentence><sentence id="316">And we stayed in Liverpool, and four days later we -- we got on the SS Antonia which was a converted Cunard-White Star Line, and all I remember is we were the only two kids on the boat and we saw in the crew quarters and my -- and for luck they would play cards with us sitting on their lap. </sentence><sentence id="317">And we were supposed to go to New York, and there was a -- there was a U-boat scare. </sentence><sentence id="318">So we went to Montreal, and we arrived in September 30th, 1940. </sentence><sentence id="319">And I got to see my first comics, and I can still remember the -- you know, Americans comics was something usual. </sentence><sentence id="320">And I -- I can tell you the  Interview with Paul Halpern 13 story. </sentence><sentence id="321">It was a Dick Tracy story, and I can do that when I get a smart -- I always -- I've always been trying to get the copy of that -- that particular page from September 30th so I could show -- and my grandfather -- my grandfather had us picked up in Montreal. </sentence><sentence id="322">We got put on the train, and the first day we were in -- in New York City, we went and applied for first citizen -- first papers because as far as everyone knew, my parents were dead. </sentence><sentence id="323">So my grandfather was my guardian. </sentence><sentence id="324">And we applied for first papers for -- for declaration, not to -- to get out of refugee status. </sentence><sentence id="325">And I lived in Forest Hills with my -- with my grandmother, and my sister went to my grandfather's brother who lived in Kingston. </sentence><sentence id="326">He was also quite wealthy. </sentence><sentence id="327">And it was a good life. </sentence><sentence id="328">And I -- and I went to school in Forest Hills and I went to PS3, and they -- a week after my teacher called my grandmother and said, He's seven and a half years old and he doesn't belong in the second grade. </sentence><sentence id="329">We're going to put him in the third grade. </sentence><sentence id="330">So I finished that year, and they said, We need to put him in the fifth grade next year. </sentence><sentence id="331">And my -- and my grandmother said, No. </sentence><sentence id="332">He's -- he's a smart kid, but he needs -- he needs a little bit of respect. </sentence><sentence id="333">He needs to be leveled off a little bit. </sentence><sentence id="334">He needs to be with his age. </sentence><sentence id="335">You can put him in the fourth, but you can't put him -- you can't put him in the fifth. </sentence><sentence id="336">So I was always early because of that. </sentence><sentence id="337">But my grandmother was very -- very clever about that she said, you know, He needs peer pressure, and he's not going to get it if he's a smart-alecky kid three years over his head. </sentence><sentence id="338">And -- and then in his early 1941 my grandfather who was in the -- he owned real estate, office buildings and apartment houses. </sentence><sentence id="339">They invested with -- with friends. </sentence><sentence id="340">He was in RNS associates and he was visited by a member of the German litigation who said to him, Would you like to buy a couple of Jews? </sentence><sentence id="341">And I think my grandfather always kind  Interview with Paul Halpern 14 of said that that's basically what he said. </sentence><sentence id="342">Would you like to buy somebody? </sentence><sentence id="343">And my grandfather said, Who? </sentence><sentence id="344">And they said, Your daughter and her husband. </sentence><sentence id="345">And my grandfather said, I sat shiver (ph) for them two years ago because my grandfather did -- was observant a little then. </sentence><sentence id="346">And they said No, they're alive. </sentence><sentence id="347">They're alive. </sentence><sentence id="348">And so an arrangement was made. </sentence><sentence id="349">And from what I understand, and I can't
