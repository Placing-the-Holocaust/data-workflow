<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="95">Q: What was your experience of Kristallnacht or what did you hear? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="97">A: Well, it was interesting. </sentence><sentence id="98">We had a sudden telephone call from my 16yearold cousin who was working in Berlin, and she told us that "Uncle Iz" as she called himmy father whose name was Israel. </sentence><sentence id="99">Should go for a walk, and of course we immediately realized that somehow he shouldn't be home so he went over and stayed with his sister because we knew the Gestapo didn't look in women's houses. </sentence><sentence id="100">They only looked in families. </sentence><sentence id="101">They This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="102">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="103"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection didn't look at women's houses. </sentence><sentence id="104">My uncle went to his girlfriend's house. </sentence><sentence id="105">My grandfather stayed home because he was 72 already. </sentence><sentence id="106">And my brother of course was only 12; so we didn't think that that was dangerous. </sentence><sentence id="107">We had a visit from our janitor's wife who asked us whether father was in, and we said no he wasn't, and I don't really know why she visited whether she visited with a view to telling him to go out or whether the Gestapo had sent her on an advance to make sure that he was there, but in any event we were lucky. </sentence><sentence id="108">He was gone, and about ten minutes later two black leather coated men came up and asked for my father. </sentence><sentence id="109">We said he had gone out, and they very politely asked to look through the apartment to make sure; and we said, "Sure go right ahead." </sentence><sentence id="110">And of course he was gone, and they saw my grandfather sleeping there and asked how old he was, and we told him 72, and after they left, I remember my mother saying she was shaking all over, poor thing. </sentence><sentence id="111">And of course us children we didn't realize the import of it all. </sentence><sentence id="112">But it was from that day onward that we did think of getting out of the country. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="131">Q: What steps did you take to leave the country then? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="133">A: It's so happened that at our Jewish school, there were some forms being passed around where a secondary school in London had gotten together with a parentteacher association, and they had decided to bring to England three children: One from Austria, one from Czechoslovakia, and one from Germany, in fact three girls because it was a girl's school, and since my parents said, well really should try to get out, I completed the form, and it was sent back to England. </sentence><sentence id="134">And I was very lucky to be chosen the German girl to go to England to school. </sentence><sentence id="135">So in May 21--I shan't never forget it of course--we went to the railroad station, and off I went with the children's transport. </sentence><sentence id="136">It was a dreadful experience because there was a Polish woman on the platform who was being dragged away by Gestapo men by her hair, and she was screaming, and we didn't really know whether we'd all by arrested before we left. </sentence><sentence id="137">So it was very awful in leaving my parents really not with a view that I wouldn't see them again because I never thought that would happen. </sentence><sentence id="138">But it's a new experience to go a country with another language, and I remember I had a little gold ring and in the compartment, the train compartment, somebody mentioned that, "oh, we shouldn't have any jewelry with us." </sentence><sentence id="139">And I remember going to the toilet and hiding this little gold ring, and after we got to Holland, I picked it up again. </sentence><sentence id="140">I think it was in the garbage can, something like that. </sentence><sentence id="141">But it was--we were very happy when we left Germany. </sentence><sentence id="142">It was like we could suddenly breathe freely, and there was some people in the railroad station that brought us cookies and crackers and welcomed us with juices. </sentence><sentence id="143">And it was like being in another world, and it's very odd, but after I left Germany, I started growing and getting bigger. </sentence><sentence id="144">I used to be a really thin little thing, and I guess being in a free country makes you think and eat differently, and I became a normal 13yearold. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="157">Q: Tell me, you say your parents were planing to emigrate. </sentence><sentence id="158">Had they made any attempts to emigrate as a family? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="161"> This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="162">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="163"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="164">A: Only illegal attempts. </sentence><sentence id="165">My father was very scared that at the last minute at the border we would be caught, and of course that would be worse than not going out at all. </sentence><sentence id="166">So when I left, one of the things my parents had tried to get us out, which I did tried to do and I did manage to get my twin brother out, but unfortunately the war broke out, and I could not get my parents out, and they perished in Auschwitz. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="170">Q: On Kristallnacht, when your father was fortunate enough to leave the house, do you know of any other men who were not so well prepared, and what happened to those? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="172">A: Yes, I remember about six weeks after Kristallnacht, my father's brother who was a teacher in Dortmund came back from concentration camp, and he had frostbitten fingers and toes, and he looked absolutely dreadful. </sentence><sentence id="173">He had been in a concentration camp. </sentence><sentence id="174">And then my English teacher came back from concentration camp and his teeth, his front teeth, had been smashed in. </sentence><sentence id="175">And it was a very dreadful experience for us because as children you grow up trusting, trusting your parents, trusting the system, and all of a sudden you realize that you're on the outside looking in, and things won't get better. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="180">Q: These men came back from concentration camp? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="182">A: Well, as far as I can remember, I guess the Germans were not ready yet to keep men on a permanent basis; so that they let them go after about six weeks, and then they fined all Jews for the murder of Vom Rath, and we all had to give up part of our silver and pay money to compensate the Germans for having lost Vom Rath which was the excuse, of course. </sentence><sentence id="183">And eventually, of course, they did get concentration camps ready, but at that time they didn't have sufficient facilities to keep people. </sentence><sentence id="184">And I think they would have been very happy to let all the Jews go out of the country, because but of course they weren't allowed to take their money with them anyway, so they would have kept the money and got rid of the Jews. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="188">Q: They would have been happy to get the Jews go, but the Jews weren't ready to go then? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="190">A: No. </sentence><sentence id="191">I think the Jews were ready to go, but they didn't want to go without any money, which is what they would have had to do. </sentence><sentence id="192">My father lost his four stores. </sentence><sentence id="193">They were all broken into, and things were stolen, and after that he didn't have any work anymore. </sentence><sentence id="194">So it was living on your income, whatever you had, but not making any more money. </sentence><sentence id="195">So it was a matter of really thinking we have to get out of here. </sentence><sentence id="196">But it was easier said than done. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="204">Q: What was your experience as a Jew in the non Jewish community before Hitler and then after Hitler came aboutcame to power. </sentence><sentence id="205">Was there any change in the attitude of your friends and neighbors? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="208">A: We really didn't have Christian friends because of the school we went to with the other little girl was Jewish also, and just like in any big society in an apartment life, you This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="209">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="210"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection don't really have neighbors with whom you associate. </sentence><sentence id="211">So I can really say because we were all in Jewish circles. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="218">Q: Was there any change among the people that you weren't necessarily friendly with, but neighbors? </sentence><sentence id="219">Did you discern increased hostility? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="222">A: No. </sentence><sentence id="223">We lived our lives completely apart, but we were very careful not to give any neighbors cause to criticize us. </sentence><sentence id="224">I remember very clearly listening to the BBC and foreign broadcasts, and our parents always while they were listening, had us gomy brother went to one door, and I went to the other to make sure the noise wasn't penetrating the apartment so thatbecause you could get arrested for listening to foreign news services. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="228">Q: On your train ride out of Germany and toward England, tell me how were you provided for? </sentence><sentence id="229">Did you take food along with you? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="232">A: I don't really remember whether we took food along, but we did get fed when we crossed the Dutch border, and we were also fed on the ship before we arrived in England. </sentence><sentence id="233">And I shall never forget that because we had white bread, which I had never seen before and cornflakes, which was another thing that was new in my life, not having eaten cereals in Germany. </sentence><sentence id="234">And then by train we were taken to London to a hall guess it must have been in the railroad station, and names were called of children, and various people picked them up and when my name came, there was a young blonde girl by name of Yolanda who came and picked me up, and she explained to me that she was the ward of the head mistress of the school who had really been very much ahead of her timesingle woman who had adopted a German, a Czech, and an Austrian child. </sentence><sentence id="235">And the German teacher had paid for my school education, which I didn't find out until the very end. </sentence><sentence id="236">Anyway, I'm proceeding myself. </sentence><sentence id="237">We went to the home of a Norman and Elsie Denim where I was to live. </sentence><sentence id="238">They had a daughter about my age who went to the same school and a son four years older, and Yolanda spoke a little bit of German to me, and this was when she got to the house, she said, "Well, that's the last time I'll be speaking German with you." </sentence><sentence id="239">And I was sort of scared because I didn't speak very much English. </sentence><sentence id="240">But everybody was very welcoming. </sentence><sentence id="241">And I do remember that we had tea, and everybody sat around the table, all these new people chattering in English, and there was something that looked like chocolate paste, and I asked the young boy by name of Hue what it was, and he spoke a little German so he explained to me that it was chocolate the (? </sentence><sentence id="242">retch?) </sentence><sentence id="243">It turned out to be Marmite and very spicy, and I learned very soon to take very little of it. </sentence><sentence id="244">And then I went upstairs and cried. </sentence><sentence id="245">I went into the bathroom and cried, and after that I guess I decided this was my new life, and I was going to have to accommodate to it. </sentence><sentence id="246">And people were very, very kind. </sentence><sentence id="247">I'm still in touch with Marry, my foster sister, and Hue, my foster brother. </sentence><sentence id="248">We visit each other's homes, and we've been very close friends. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="266">Q: Were you able to contact your parents during this period? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="268"> This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="269">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="270"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="271">A: I wrote to my parents on a regular basis, and they answered, and Auntie Elsie took me to a Jewish language school every Sunday, which was a big sacrifice for her because they were very devout Plymouth Brethren Christians, and so she missed the Sunday morning service taking me to Hebrew class. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="273">Q: What were you permitted to bring on your trip to London when you left home? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="275">A: Well, I remember I was allowed to carry one suitcase, which of course we each had to carry ourselves, and I remember my mother buying me some nice clothing to take along, all of which turned out to be completely unsuitable because we wore uniforms to school. </sentence><sentence id="276">And as soon as I got to London, friends of Marry's would contribute school uniforms for me to wear, and as I said, I grew too quickly after that that in no time flat I had out gown all my beautiful clothes. </sentence><sentence id="277">I remember that when I was evacuated to Chichester after the war had started, Auntie Elsie sold my clothes, and all I got from these beautiful garmentswhich actually I think I never wore againwere three pairs of black woollen stockings which I detested but which were part of our school uniform and I had to wear. </sentence><sentence id="278">And I guess I've always remembered it because I was so unhappy about losing all these beautiful things. </sentence><sentence id="279">But makes sense; they didn't fit me anymore. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="285">Q: How did you feel? </sentence><sentence id="286">You were from obviously from a welltodo family, and suddenly you're taking handmedowns from other families. </sentence><sentence id="287">You were an impoverished child. </sentence><sentence id="288">How did that affect you? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="293">A: Well, it didn't bother me too much. </sentence><sentence id="294">Everybody was so kind, and it bothered me a little bit about the clothes as I said, but generally speaking, I was feeling so liberated and wonderful to be out of this scary atmosphere where you couldn't say what you thought, and all of a sudden I could say whatever I felt like, and when I saw a policeman and I cringed, Auntie Elsie would say, "You don't have to be afraid of "our Bobbies"," which they were called in England. " </sentence><sentence id="295">They will always be there to help you." </sentence><sentence id="296">And it was such a wonderful feeling to be free, really free. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="301">Q: How did you feel about being Jewish in an essentially Christian community? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="303">A: I didn't worry about it at all because everybody was so very kind to me that I just felt I was one of the people, and nobody ever asked me was I Jewish. </sentence><sentence id="304">Nobody treated me differently because I was Jewish. </sentence><sentence id="305">And as children will, they take for granted that whatever happens to them is the right thing, so I had no worry about that. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="309">Q: Tell me more please about your experience in the Jewish Sunday school. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="311">A: Well, we walked across the common every Sunday morning, and I went to Hebrew class, and having been told by my parents that I really should try and get our family out of Germany, I approached the head rabbi who was teaching us one Sunday morning and asked him if they could not find a home for my brother. </sentence><sentence id="312">And he looked at me and he said, This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="313">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="314"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection "Oh. </sentence><sentence id="315">You're the little girl who lives with nonJewish people." </sentence><sentence id="316">And I said, "Yes, I am." </sentence><sentence id="317">And he said, "Well, until you move to a Jewish family, there's nothing we can do." </sentence><sentence id="318">So I said to him, "But if I move to a Jewish family, I'm already taking away the place that my brother could take." </sentence><sentence id="319">And he said, "No, no there's nothing we can do until you move to a Jewish family." </sentence><sentence id="320">So I left Sunday school very depressed and very unhappy and started crying on the way home, and Auntie Elsie said to me, "What's the matter? </sentence><sentence id="321">Why are you crying?" </sentence><sentence id="322">And I told her about the incident, and it was Auntie Elsie and Uncle Norman who decided to adopt my brother who then came to England at the beginning of August 1939 and started to process papers for my parents to come over, but unfortunately due to the war breaking out in September, they never made it. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="337">Q: How did you feel telling Auntie Elsie what the rabbi had said to you? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="339">A: I was very ashamed that a Jewish person would do a thing like that. </sentence><sentence id="340">I'm still ashamed. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="343">Q: How did that effect your feelings towards Judaism? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="345">A: Well, that's an interesting question because inat the outbreak of war, we werethe children that is to sayall of the school were all evacuated to Chichester, a small, very old town in the south of England. </sentence><sentence id="346">And there was no Jews in Chichester. </sentence><sentence id="347">My Uncle Norman wrote to my father through the Red Cross asking whether it would be all right for Hans, my brother, and myself to go to church, and my father wrote back and said that his children were old enough to know what was right, and that if he felt that since there was no Jewish house of worship, we should go to Sunday schoolthat he should feel very free to send us. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="351">Q: Did Uncle Norman want to convert you? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="353">A: No. </sentence><sentence id="354">Not at all. </sentence><sentence id="355">Which is why theyUncle Norman was a customs official in the British Civil Service, but he was interested in religion and had studied religion theology, and in fact he was a doctor of theology which he never, never talked about. </sentence><sentence id="356">But that was why he was interested in Jews and Judaism because, of course, he understood the connection between the Old and the New Testament. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="361">Q: What was Auntie Elsie's attitude toward you as a Jew? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="363">A: Auntie Elsie treated me not as a Jew, but as another child in the home. </sentence><sentence id="364">She endeared herself to me because I had brought a doll to England, and during the transport its eyes had fallen out, and she took me to a doll hospital and had the eyes put back in. </sentence><sentence id="365">And the doll meant very much to me. </sentence><sentence id="366">It was the only cuddly thing, and the family was not a cuddly family so that all of a sudden physical contact was gone. </sentence><sentence id="367">I guess as Jews or Germans, perhaps we were more physically effusive certainly my family was with hugging each other which the Denim family never did. </sentence><sentence id="368">This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="369">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="370"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="379">Q: Did your brother fit into the family there? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="381">A: Well, he fitted in very well because he had Hue as a companion, and of course, he was only there for about three weeks because at the beginning of September, we were evacuated to Chichester. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="383">Q: How did you adapt to the new school especially in a language you didn't understand? </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="476">A: Well, there are several. </sentence><sentence id="477">One was that due to the fact that we had only cold water to wash with and no bathroom, I took a catlick in the kitchen in the morning, and one day my schoolteacher said to me, "Inga, you've got a dirty neck," which was very embarrassing and humiliating, and after that I even managed to wash my neck with cold water. </sentence><sentence id="478">That was one experience. </sentence><sentence id="479">Another one was went I was bicycling home from school there was a German airplane very, very low in the sky, and I felt sure it was going toto machine gun me, and so I dashed off the bicycle and into a doorway and of course that this (? </sentence><sentence id="480">hagencoits?) </sentence><sentence id="481">the swastika still frightened me so much. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="503">A: I sort of resented going to Sunday school at church, and there was a dear old man who was in charge of Sunday school, and whenever he called on me with a question, he would say, "My child of Aberham." </sentence><sentence id="504">He always called me his child of Aberham. </sentence><sentence id="505">And I would argue with him fiercely because I was very well acquainted with the Old Testament, of course not with the New, but it was something which came to mean a lot to me, and I got to the point where one night I dreamt about Jesus Christ, and I felt that, yes, I was converted, and it made me very happy. </sentence><sentence id="506">Jesus Christ to me was someone I could talk to anywhere, not just in church. </sentence><sentence id="507">I would be in the bathroom, and I could talk to him or in the kitchen or in my bed, and somehow I remember Yahova as being a very strict god, a god who was jealous of his prerogatives and to me, I guess Jesus was more of a friend and father which I did not have. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="513">Q: Any other experiences at Chichester? </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="531">A: I think that they were not too skeptical of us because we didn't speak German anymore. </sentence><sentence id="532">Our English was perfect, and we were still children; so I don't think that we had any difficultly in that respect. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="602">Q: Do your children identify themselves as Jewish? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="604">A: One daughter does because she is married to a Jew, and although they are not religious, they don't go to synagogue at any time, but their son was Bar Mitzvah, so that's a sign of Judaism anyway. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="632">Q: What exactly are doodlebugs? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="634">A: They are pilotless planes, really, rocketsthe first rockets. </sentence><sentence id="635">And they were programmed to go down over cities such as London, and they would make a noise. </sentence><sentence id="636">You could hear the motor, and all of a sudden the motor would stop, and within a few minutes it would crash so that whenever you heard the motor stop, you dove under the table because you were scared that it might crash right over you. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="640">Q: Did you continue to hear from your parents during the war? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="642">A: We had a letter from our parents in 1941 just before they left for Theresienstadt and asking us if we could raise a certain amount of money so they could go to Shanghai. </sentence><sentence id="643">Unfortunately, we couldn't raise the money, and so they did go to Theresienstadt. </sentence><sentence id="644">I remember receiving one letter after they were in Theresienstadt, but after that we never did, and I think that we felt it was not possible to write to them. </sentence><sentence id="645">We may have been wrong. </sentence><sentence id="646">Perhaps this could have been done, but we were so far away from anybody who could have given us any advice on this that we never did write and felt that if we wrote, it would be construed as writing to the enemy. </sentence><sentence id="647">This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="648">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="649"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="660">A: My parents at one point in 1944 were sent from Theresienstadt to Auschwitz, and I believe almost immediately killed there. </sentence><sentence id="661">The way I found this out was after the war, I went to Germany as a translator for the US War Department, and when I was in Germany, I used to go to the Joint Distribution Committee in Munich every week to see if I could find their names. </sentence><sentence id="662">And I would put in the names of all my entire family, of whom there were 18 members, to see if anybody got out alive, but we heard from some lady who had met them in Auschwitz, and she said that they had been killed. </sentence><sentence id="663">And of course, their names never turned up. </sentence><sentence id="664">Of all the people whom I put in traces for, only one aunt and one cousin were saved. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="682">A: We were trained in Paris and given American uniforms. </sentence><sentence id="683">Then we went to a little place called Pullach, which is outside Munich, and I was a translator of letters which had been confiscated for censorship. </sentence><sentence id="684">Letters, that might have let us know where some Nazis were hiding so these could be prosecuted. </sentence><sentence id="685">I was only 18 at the time; so I was one of the youngest people there. </sentence><sentence id="686">All the camp consisted of elderly refugees who had been in England during the war. </sentence><sentence id="687">Also some AmericanAmericans who had come to America as refugees, all of us speaking German and English of course. </sentence><sentence id="688">And I was there for two years, and after being there a year, and meeting some British people, I got to realize that I was really the only one who thought of myself as British. </sentence><sentence id="689">Everybody else all, the other English people that I knew thought of me as a German refugee. </sentence><sentence id="690">On the other hand, I felt that Americans had definitely assimilated, felt American, were treated as American and so I said okay I'm under 21, and I'm free, and I'm not close to my brother really, and my parents are dead, and I decided to immigrate to the United States. </sentence><sentence id="691">I wrote to an aunt in Los Angeles of whom I learned through her GI sons who were in London. </sentence><sentence id="692">And I was sent an affidavit, and so at the ripe old age of 21, I came to the United States which was, apart from going to England, probably one of the best decisions I could have made. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="704">Q: How did you learn about this opportunity to translate in Germany? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="706">A: I learned of it through a member of the church, strangely enough, who told me that Americans were hiring British subjectsBritishnot necessarily citizens, to go to Germany, and I felt that was the best way to find out about my parents. </sentence></p></dialogue>
