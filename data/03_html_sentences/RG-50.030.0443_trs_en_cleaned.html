<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="165">Q: What year was that? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="167">A: That was about 1928 or "29, probably "29. </sentence><sentence id="168">Every Saturday, the Jewish older fraternities went on a boomer (ph) on the parade (ph) to the university everyone had a place where they stood and the Jewish students, national fraternities to which the __ was one, the second oldest, the oldest was Fatima (ph) after whom a saint was recently named, Jerusalem, then Fatima had a place, too, and from time to time the German students, the nationalist fraternity, stood next to us, they started to beat us and to throw us out of the university and before this happened every time they sung a certain song and then after they sung it, they kicked us out. </sentence><sentence id="169">And once you knew only from the atmosphere that it was to happen before they started the song and once when they were close to starting the song, I then walked up there and said, "I want to speak to your leader" and said, as soon as I came to him, I was brought to him and said I had to leave a message from the Jewish student organizations, bang-then I hit him very hard which, of course, immediately that I was grabbed and beaten and kicked out, but the fight developed in the university and we were all thrown out as we usually were, but at that time it was not that you risked your lives, they just beat you. </sentence><sentence id="170">Once only at such a riot a man was badly injured and this was the son of Sigmund Freud, Martin Freud was his name. </sentence><sentence id="171">He became a lawyer. </sentence><sentence id="172">He was badly injured at one of those fights and I was accused of having starting the riot at the university just so, but the others had started the riots and I usually would not, they would throw us out anyhow, so I started it. </sentence><sentence id="173">And this is very interesting political , the rector(ph), the do you director, too? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="182">Q: Yeah. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="184">A: Director of the University, Paxton (ph) Manificos(ph) was exchanged from year to year from one faculty to the other was at that time the initver (ph), the name was I-N-I-T-V-E-R, and he was a theologian. </sentence><sentence id="185">He was applied by the theologian faculty and he was a priest and he was___and I told him, "You don't think that I would be crazy to start a fight; how many are we and how many are the others?" </sentence><sentence id="186">And of the newspapers in Vienna, they are largely in Jewish hands and liberal, very liberal, and they looked out for the chance to hear to have the director of the university who was a theologian and he was then finally called to this panel and he announced that I am being warned. </sentence><sentence id="187">That was all. </sentence><sentence id="188">I could have been excluded from the university , because he had told me, I had told him, "You know that you really don't start this" and he said,"___I don't know." </sentence><sentence id="189">Well, he was very mild (ph) and the journalists were waiting outside for me to come out with accusations toward the Director and I told them he was a nice man, he has a very liberal attitude so this makes a nice story, too. </sentence><sentence id="190">So they had a big story that a priest who is not radical and who is most pleasant sort and had very good press and shortly after that the Olsten (ph) party formed a coalition to look for a Minister of Social Welfare and they got him because he was accepted to the liberal school. </sentence><sentence id="191">I think this has something to do with my, with my___ until I was mentioned by the and he became Minister of Social Welfare and he was one of the Olsten Provision (ph) government and then they told the Cardinal of Vienna died and he was well-liked by everybody, that they made him, the Pope made him Cardinal for Vienna, but he behaved very badly, well, the, the Nazis came in and he was the first one to turn to the Nazis and publish a poster, "Heil Hitler," which he agreed very much with the regime. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="200">Q: Let me ask you, during these early years, did you at any time think of settling in Palestine? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="202">A: The event (ph), which is just what I wanted to emphasize, Zionism was very much of a national minority that is you of it, primary understanding for national minority, so the Jews were very satisfied that the League of Nations had adopted a law for protection of minorities and    this vision was that the Viennese Jews in their mass (ph) were least protected by these Jews very conscious of their Jewish culture. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="205">Q: So, how specifically did you get involved specifically with the Betar movement and revisionism, which is obviously a very logical specific type of Zionism? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="207">A: There was at this time a discussion going on whether the Jewish, whether Zionism was really a state or was it a strong movement that we want a bi-national unit at the time and those people, and I knew about it and I was always radical. </sentence><sentence id="208">I was for the state and by then I went into the Congress, I went for the first time in 1935 to Israel when I was...1935, I was 29 years old. </sentence><sentence id="209">I went to Israel, but before this 1935 I went to the Congress in Zurich (ph). </sentence><sentence id="210">Aisha (ph) was a friend of mine. </sentence><sentence id="211">And then I heard Gobutinski's (ph) speech. </sentence><sentence id="212">But I heard him, then I formally joined, like I had heard him already in Catovitz (ph), which was a revisionist a few years before this, as I was very much impressed. </sentence><sentence id="213">He was a most impressive personality. </sentence><sentence id="214">I knew him well. </sentence><sentence id="215">A book came out recently by Shotz (ph) in manages very permanently (ph). </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="225">Q: What was it about Gobutinski that impressed you, that type of Zionism? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="227">A: No, it was not only the Zionism, it was the personality. </sentence><sentence id="228">He was an excellent orator and then he came to Vienna. </sentence><sentence id="229">Everybody went to hear him. </sentence><sentence id="230">He didn't advertise what he's talking about. </sentence><sentence id="231">They had a big placard that said, "Gobutinski's Speech", "Gobutinski ." </sentence><sentence id="232">And that was enough to have people come there. </sentence><sentence id="233">And he is not only, I don't think he could give it a specific name. </sentence><sentence id="234">Half of Zionism seems (ph) one and the Jewish state. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="243">Q: Did your activities intensify between...after 1933? </sentence><sentence id="244">I mean you were very active well before 1933, but then, when Hitler came to power, at the time did you see that as a seminal event at the time? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="247">A: I don't remember what I thought at the time. </sentence><sentence id="248">But I was very active in the Jewish community. </sentence><sentence id="249">The Jewish community has been a assimilical (ph) community with the old people coming to well- to-do Jews who are running it and after that . </sentence><sentence id="250">Many not-well-to-do poor Jews from the East came in as refugees from the Russian advance and they formed the majority finally of the Viennese Jews and I was active in the viacom (ph) in the fight, in the fight, for getting elected into this Jewish community. </sentence><sentence id="251">The Jewish community was something entirely different than it is here or    anywhere. </sentence><sentence id="252">By law, incorporation to which every Jew belongs whether they wanted to or not. </sentence><sentence id="253">And to put, they tax you. </sentence><sentence id="254">If you didn't pay your tax to the Jewish community, the tax of the government taxed your property. </sentence><sentence id="255">They had very officious tactics, this Jewish community. </sentence><sentence id="256">There was only one way to get out, to declare ousted (ph) of the ; "I don't want to be a Jew any more," and you were not in the Jewish community. </sentence><sentence id="257">So the Jewish community was really direct presentation of the Jews and I was very active for, for the Zionists, for Zionists who finally got the majority. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="270">Q: Now when did you begin to, with the issue of emigration what was termed illegal emigration. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="272">How did you arrive at that as a solution? </sentence><sentence id="273">How did you come to that? </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="274">A: When Hitler came to power in Germany, the refugees come over from Germany to Vienna, mainly well-to-do people, and they were in Vienna and their children sometimes had the desire to go to Palestine and they couldn't get visas, certificates from Betar (ph). </sentence><sentence id="275">The Betar (ph) was the strongest Jewish organization in Vienna and you couldn't get any number of certificates . </sentence><sentence id="276">You know emigration was very limited by ability and the people of the leftist organization, of the liberal group, they got most of the certificates, but the Betar didn't get enough certificates. </sentence><sentence id="277">so one day I was in my office just as I described here, I was a lawyer, and a man came in and said, "I have a message from Dr. Wolfgang , who was a Viennese Zionist from an old Vienna family, a nobility, which was very rare for Jews and his message was, "Bill, Willy, listen to this man, he has something interesting to say", and he suggested that we, he said I have some contact with...he was a Palestinian Jewish Patriot Adventurer, he was a real adventurer, and he said that I have contact with underground in Greece and I suggested following it, rent a boat from these people. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="283">Q: This is 1937? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="285">A: This was 1936, that we...could have been "35. </sentence><sentence id="286">That we rent a boat from them and put our batterime (ph) on it and for people who really want to emigrate and on the way to supposedly going to the Vierra De Tripoli (ph). </sentence><sentence id="287">We really wanted them to be as a very rich and well-to-do, a center of power, a country should be run (ph) and there was much propaganda to go to the Vierra De Tripoli (ph) and he said, "We ride the boat to go to the Vierra De Tripoli (ph)?" </sentence><sentence id="288">But if we don't come to the Vierra De Tripoli, it was only the batterime (ph) will force the __ to go to Palestine instead and there will be a big stinking develop because Jews from good houses that pilot the ship and go to... </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="294">Q: You wanted the publicity... </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="296">A: We wanted the publicity in order to point out to the world that in spite of the need to, a land to go to, in spite of what the League of Nations has decided on the strength of that this should be a Jewish nation alone, Palestine, that this is not being done. </sentence><sentence id="297">And.. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="300">Q: Was this successful? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="302">A: This is what was suggested to me. </sentence><sentence id="303">His name was Shriebelstein (ph) G-R-I-V-O-L-H-E-I-N (ph) Moshe Grivolhein, Galinin. </sentence><sentence id="304">He changed his to Galinin (ph), and I saw a different _--._--"I said, "This propaganda is very good, but we can do better. </sentence><sentence id="305">We can bring the people in and try to smuggle (ph) them in." </sentence><sentence id="306">He said there would be no problem with the because the problem being in the of this , So try to smuggle (ph) them in but you're going to help us to smuggle them in and we'll smuggle them in once, twice, three times until they catch us; then we will have the publicity, and in the meanwhile, __ you people into Israel. </sentence><sentence id="307">And he agreed to that. </sentence><sentence id="308">This is when we started organizing the first two transports; we did not get enough people to go with the first one, the people were scared to go... </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="316">Q: So you had to convince people to... </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="318">A: Well, I was a lawyer. </sentence><sentence id="319">I would be able to smuggle them. </sentence><sentence id="320">There was not so much need yet. </sentence><sentence id="321">And so I traveled to Eastern Slovakia, Topachkarusha, Russia (ph) it was called, it was part of Slovakia and there the policy was very great about the Jews and from there you go up to Tareem (ph) to some I think only two or three batterime (ph) from Vienna of the first 16 people, 15 or 16 that had transports, I have the number here, which to Palestine. </sentence><sentence id="322">Independent of this, which I did not know that Gobutinski had called at one of his articles for breakings of the rules of the British persuasions and to make illegal propaganda and to make it a Jewish spot, but it was already, it had happened. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="329">Q: What part did they leave from in Europe? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="331">A: Different... </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="333">Q: Different. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="335">A: Different parts. </sentence><sentence id="336">First you came by train to Greece and then left from Athens, but the problem was that the British demonstrated, the British government demonstrated, with the governments of those countries, that they supported by letting the Jews in. </sentence><sentence id="337">But we needed, they said, "How do you know __illegally into Palestine?" </sentence><sentence id="338">They said, "Because they don't have a visa to go anywhere to." </sentence><sentence id="339">So, we had a man, Dr. Diamand, a very educated scholar, who told us, we formed a small group, The Axion (ph), who was the active action group within the revisionist party, about five or six people, and he told us, "You know the danube is international, it is an international treaty about the danube that you can go down the danube without visa to the seaport, because Britain now intervenes with all these countries, with Slovakia, with Hungary, with Yugoslavia, Bulgaria, Romania, that they shouldn't let our ships through. </sentence><sentence id="340">Well, our ships went through without problems, without visa, so we went down the danube until they came with and we did not know, generally assumed, and I am always asked, "How did you get out?" </sentence><sentence id="341">It was no problem to get out; the problem was to get in!The problem with all of them is the very end, then the problem to get out, of course, it was not possible to get out anymore, because at the same time it was closed, the borders were closed and it was after the Panzer (ph) conference and you can't get out anymore. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="350">Q: Clearly, in the 1930's which we're talking about now, so you're saying the problem wasn't leaving Europe, the problem was nowhere to go, who would accept Jewish refugees at the time. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="352">A: The Germans helped the people travel up in German down the danube with us about 1500 miles I think, so all this ___ to the German ships flying the Nazi flag and they are loaded with refugees and turn in Galas (ph), which is over in the Donow (ph) Delta, in the Delta where the Donow gets into the Black Sea and Gallas (ph), which was the biggest sport which is already on the ocean and Tunashaveshal (ph), which is a small place, which I was informed that Nazis traveled to the grave (ph) ships. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="354">Q: And when you talk about, when you mentioned, you referred before to the Jewish pirates, did they literally force the ships to go to... </sentence></p></dialogue>

Right, so, so the first few transports were, in fact, successful? </sentence></p><p><sentence id="362">A. Very successful, because we boated people out. </sentence><sentence id="363">We didn't have so many. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="364">Q. When was the first time a ship was caught, I mean, by the British, you know, at Palestine? </sentence></p><p><sentence id="365">A. I believe the first ship which was caught was at Pareta (ph). </sentence><sentence id="366">Pareta was on the high seas and could not land nowhere. </sentence><sentence id="367">The British had organized and they came too near the border and the British Navy was there and the Air Force, the British Air Force and they blocked their advance so they retreated at Pareta (ph) to some barely little Greek Islands, inlets, in the sea there and seen some and so on and then they got out and they couldn't get through. </sentence><sentence id="368">Well, the Pareta (ph) beach was not run by because it was representative from : [end of side one, tape one] </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="369">Q: This a continuation of the U.
