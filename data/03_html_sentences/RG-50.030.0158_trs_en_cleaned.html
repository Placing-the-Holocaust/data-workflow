<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3">Q: Could you tell me your name please? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="5">A: Frank Meissner, M-E-I-S-S-N-E-R. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="7">Q: Where were you born? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="9">A: In uh a little town of Trest, T- R-E -S-T. In Germany, it's called Trich. </sentence><sentence id="10">And it was a uh Jewish community that has been around for something like two or three hundred years. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="13">Q: In what country? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="15">A: In Czechoslovakia. </sentence><sentence id="16">And uh the town is exactly half way between Prague and Vienna. </sentence><sentence id="17">And it used to be a very important Jewish community. </sentence><sentence id="18">The way it was in uh Central Europe that uh Jews were mostly in the rural areas, and as the industrialization of Czechoslovakia, of Bohemia and Moravia, took place uh more and more opportunities uh started uh (cough) bringing about uh opportunities outside the rural areas and so gradually uh the real people with the guts would, leaved the little town and go to bigger cities in uh Prague or Vienna or Berlin. </sentence><sentence id="19">Some of them even would go abroad or to the United States. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="25">Q: Let's talk about Frank Meissner though, and Frank Meissner's town. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="27">A: Well, this was my town. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="29">Q: Tell us about uh Trest? </sentence><sentence id="30">Tell us about your family first. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="33">A: Well, in the first place uh the city was, has had a population of five thousand for years and years and years and it still does. </sentence><sentence id="34">And uh the community from its highest uh the Jewish community has dwindled gradually from something like four hundred to about uh seventy hundred (ph) in 1938. </sentence><sentence id="35">And our family has always been one of the important families in town and has almost looked like uh generation after generation; and the Meissners would be uh presidents of the congregation. </sentence><sentence id="36">Three or four generations that I know of - it's almost as if uh some couldn't avoid this opportunity and uh my dad was a uh industrialist that uh had a factory for making uh shoes, wooden shoes. </sentence><sentence id="37">And then when uh leather shoes became uh the thing to do he had to close down the factory and became in uh furniture. </sentence><sentence id="38">So uh my mother and father worked full time in the factory and I had a whatever you called it, German  and uh the furniture factory went bust during the financial troubles. </sentence><sentence id="39">So uh we could no longer have uh anybody take care of me, and both my father and mother worked together. </sentence><sentence id="40">My mother worked as a uh secretary, working for my, for her brother that had a machine factory, and Dad couldn't uh get himself a new job, and so he became what is now-a-days called a uh househusband, I presume. </sentence><sentence id="41">Which was at that time very unusual. </sentence><sentence id="42">And uh because of the town was uh small we didn't have a high school, so when I was uh ten or eleven I had to go to the next town which had a high school. </sentence><sentence id="43">I would uh stay with a family during the weekend and come home, uh during the week, and come home during the weekend. </sentence><sentence id="44">And I wasn't a very good student. </sentence><sentence id="45">I was in fact a lousy student. </sentence><sentence id="46">I had problems all time and uh...with teachers and low grades and my father had to go to talk to the teachers to see what they could do and I never flunked completely...and just barely going from grade to grade. </sentence><sentence id="47">And at one point in 1930 ... "37, the decision was to be made whether I was going to go on to senior high school and the decision was that I would said Dad. </sentence><sentence id="48">And I said and I wouldn't. </sentence><sentence id="49">So he said you have to. </sentence><sentence id="50">So I said uh, I'll show you. </sentence><sentence id="51">Czechoslovakia at that time uh if one went or flunked one subject in the curriculum, you had to go a whole year around and so I said I'll show you and within two or three months I flunked out of Latin. </sentence><sentence id="52">And that was in 1937. </sentence><sentence id="53">And at that time I uh, it has already has become fashionable to uh let smart kids, teenagers to learn something with their hands because chances were that one would leave the country. </sentence><sentence id="54">So I went to work as an apprentice in my uncle's uh machine factory and uh then this uh possibility came about. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="78">Q: Can we hold it for a minute? </sentence><sentence id="79">Because this is a good place, I think, to ask about what it was like as a Jew in Trest. </sentence><sentence id="80">What was it like growing up as a Jew, particularly since your family was as prominent as it was? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="84">A: Obviously in a little town like this uh you uh couldn't uh get away from being Jew, because everybody knew everybody else, whereas in bigger cities you could uh go pass by. </sentence><sentence id="85">So obviously in uh grade school I got beaten up and had all sorts of problems because I was Jewish. </sentence><sentence id="86">And uh we uh lived across the street from the temple and by that time uh the congregation was so small that we had to have uh mobilized everybody for the _ group every morning. </sentence><sentence id="87">So uh I was mobilized and of course getting up at six o'clock in the morning was not exactly what particularly I was interested in. </sentence><sentence id="88">But my grandfather, my mother's father, used to live with us. </sentence><sentence id="89">He was a widower, a guy with lots of uh sense of humor and so he made it easier for me to make it easier to go to the synagogue in the morning. </sentence><sentence id="90">But five crowns (ph) a week kind of on the side - that was at that time quite a bit of money. </sentence><sentence id="91">Uh... </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="100">Q: Was your family very religious? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="102">A: Well, I mean at that time Czechoslovakia had mostly religious. </sentence><sentence id="103">There was nothing in these uh little villages. </sentence><sentence id="104">There was nothing except uh highly kosher and things like that. </sentence><sentence id="105">Uh and obviously being a kid of my father who was the congregation president, we had to at least show that we behaved properly. </sentence><sentence id="106">And uh the congregation was very small and very together. </sentence><sentence id="107">And uh since most of the people from our town already had been the first generation that have left the town and for instance in Vienna, there was a it is called, of Trest  which had at that time more Jews, two hundred, than the city of the origin. </sentence><sentence id="108">Just like uh the USS. </sentence><sentence id="109">has more Irish than Irish has in its uh state. </sentence><sentence id="110">And so people were always very loyal to the place where they came from and in my, since my dad was president of the congregation, all of them would come and visit. </sentence><sentence id="111">And he also would be uh paying out uh I don't know what it is called - uh there was a great deal of loyalty to the uh young and old poor people that came from the eastern provinces and my dad had to help them, so we uh had quite a bit of both the western and eastern uh Jewish. </sentence><sentence id="112">By uh by our standards we were already the western Jews and there was always quite a bit of looking down on the eastern - the same thing that happened between the German in this country and the Russian - I mean every major congregation in the U.S. had these frictions. </sentence><sentence id="113">So that's uh basically the town. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="126">Q: OK. </sentence><sentence id="127">So as a young man then, you decided that high school was not for you. </sentence><sentence id="128">You flunked Latin. </sentence><sentence id="129">Uh and you became an apprentice. </sentence><sentence id="130">Tell us about being an apprentice with and what was it like"? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="136">A: Well, in - I was an apprentice in the lathe, uh metal lathe uh proposition and ... </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="138">Q: I don't understand. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="140">A: Lathe. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="142">Q: Oh, a lathe. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="144">A: And uh at that time the apprentices of course were taking care of everybody else and with coffee and what have you and cleaning the uh shop on Saturday afternoons. </sentence><sentence id="145">So one didn't learn a hell of a lot. </sentence><sentence id="146">But there was one week in uh uh when one went to a uh school that by law one has to go and he taught all sorts of uh drafting and kind of a uh vocational proposition so that was nice. </sentence><sentence id="147">On Thursdays one could be away from the factory and uh learn something. </sentence><sentence id="148">Uh the factory had uh produced manufacture of equipment for uh bakeries and uh meat proposition - that was a very specialized factory. </sentence><sentence id="149">And the factory still exists. </sentence><sentence id="150">No longer in this machinery but now they make agriculture machinery. </sentence><sentence id="151">And last time we were there in Christmas it was a terrible mess. </sentence><sentence id="152">But, one at least saw that it existed. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="162">Q: OK. </sentence><sentence id="163">So you were an apprentice, and what did you do next? </sentence><sentence id="164">What did you decide to do at this point? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="168">A: Well, then this uh opportunity came up with the so I went off to Prague for a little . . </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="169">Q: How did you become interested in this? </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="170">A: Because I was always a uh Youth Aliyah, a Zionist, youth Zionist. </sentence><sentence id="171">Uh that was the only thing that I was interested in high school. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="174">Q: Was there a large group of young Zionists in this school? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="176">A: Well there were maybe thirty or forty of them in the town where I went to school and to high school. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="178">Q: Can you describe what you did as a group, ..... Zionists ...? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="180">A: Well it was just like uh like uh a youth group would. </sentence><sentence id="181">And uh would go out on Saturdays and Sundays, and going out in to nature. </sentence><sentence id="182">And uh I learned uh Hebrew and knew about Palestine. </sentence><sentence id="183">My dad was a very uh important Zionist, so it came natural. </sentence><sentence id="184">Except uh I was the only one that did something about it. </sentence><sentence id="185">My uh uh mother had uh, we had several opportunities to go to Palestine but my mother just couldn't to get away uh from the the whole family and in uh - well, it was this way. </sentence><sentence id="186">I mean it was a major decision just like any other decision that uh American Jews that came from Poland or from Russia - some of them took and some of them didn't take an opportunity. </sentence><sentence id="187">And my mother has uh always going to the uh going to the cemetery. </sentence><sentence id="188">Very important. </sentence><sentence id="189">And when it came down to the uh major decision it was always she couldn't get away from the cemetery. </sentence><sentence id="190">And my brother-in-law (ph) was a electric engineer and in 1938 he was a real good boy, always a good boy. </sentence><sentence id="191">That was one of my problems that I, my dad always said why can't you be uh like your brother-in-law. </sentence><sentence id="192">I told him very simple, because I am not my brother. </sentence><sentence id="193">But he was, uh he got a job in Anssuan in electricity in Egypt under the English and uh he could have gotten a good job and good uh salary and mother would never had anything with it. </sentence><sentence id="194">I mean they just said impossible to be that way,  farms in Denmark .. . </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="210">Q: OK. </sentence><sentence id="211">Before we get to Denmark, uh can you describe what it was like for you in in Prague? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="214">What was the city like and what year are we talking about? </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="215">A: Well, I was staying with my uncle for six months, and we were just, there was sort of a uh vocational school basically and uh there were about uh fifty, sixty of us and all of them were then became part of the possible uh Alyah because there were always some people that had to be made uh prepared. </sentence><sentence id="216">In my case it was relatively easy because I used to work on my grandfather's farm but uh for most other kids that came from cities uh it was a little difficult because during the summer we were we were put out on the farms in Czechoslovakia. </sentence><sentence id="217">Just uh the same thing that we did in Denmark. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="221">Q: OK. </sentence><sentence id="222">Let's talk about that. </sentence><sentence id="223">Uh you're in Prague. </sentence><sentence id="224">When did you decide, when did you go to Denmark and what was ...? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="229">A: It's wasn't my decision. ( </sentence><sentence id="230">OK. </sentence><sentence id="231">Tell me what happened?) </sentence><sentence id="232">By the time I was in this uh in this uh group of uh kids, it was just a question of when we could uh be uh exported to Denmark. </sentence><sentence id="233">By that time it was not uh my decision any more. </sentence><sentence id="234">I could of course have said in the last minute that I don't want to go but uh in October 1939, you just uh obviously you would immediately grab the opportunity. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="241">Q: What was October 1939 like in Prague? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="243">A: Nothing. </sentence><sentence id="244">By that time the World War II just started about two weeks I think it was, in September something. </sentence><sentence id="245">And things were, on the surface things were relatively normal. </sentence><sentence id="246">Of course uh the Jews were running around wondering how they could get out of the place. </sentence><sentence id="247">By that time of course uh for many of them it was too late. </sentence><sentence id="248">So the opportunity when grabbed. </sentence><sentence id="249">I mean it has never even occurred to me that I uh, that there was any alternative because that was uh a real opportunity to get away from my family. </sentence><sentence id="250">And since they were Zionists but didn't do much about it, I was the only one that did. </sentence><sentence id="251">As it turned out, I never eventually went to visit them (ph). </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="261">Q: OK. </sentence><sentence id="262">So it's October 1939. </sentence><sentence id="263">What did your group do? </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="277">Q: Who was in the group? </sentence><sentence id="278">You talk about distributing ... </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="279">A: Just people like me. </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="280">Q: From all over Europe? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="282">A: No, this was in Prague. </sentence><sentence id="283">I mean uh actually ours was basically of young people from Austria, Czechoslovakia and Germany and this happened to be a group that on October 10 or something like this went from Prague to Copenhagen. </sentence><sentence id="284">And then there were other groups from Austria, from Germany, for all together about six hundred of these kids what uh over several years - we were the last ones. </sentence><sentence id="285">They were uh the Hehalutz people, that the older ones that already started ...to come to Denmark in about middle 1930". </sentence><sentence id="286">And we were basicaly the last one and the kids were very young kids. </sentence><sentence id="287">I was 16, I was the oldest, they were kids like from 14 to 16. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="294">Q: So you landed in Denmark where did you go, where you have take... </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="296">A: I went to a little place then on the island south of Copenhagen in a uh very small uh Danish farm, very uh very uh missionaries... </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="298">Q: I'm sorry? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="300">A: Missionaries. </sentence><sentence id="301">And it was a small farm, and I didn't understand anything. </sentence><sentence id="302">They didn't understand anything. </sentence><sentence id="303">It was cold and I had to uh go into the fields in October and uh harvest sugar beets and things like that and for the first week it was pretty tough because still Sunday uh when they took me to the uh see the Danish minister, a Lutheran minister which spoke uh German, I really didn't have any way of uh communicate with them. </sentence><sentence id="304">But there were about uh ten or fifteen people that were in that region, with a bicycle get together, and we had a uh, a teacher who would go around and keep us together, so we had about one day a week to get together. </sentence><sentence id="305">So... </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="312">Q: Did the people on the farm, uh the owners of the farm, uh did they know you were Jewish? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="314">A: Of course. </sentence><sentence id="315">I mean that was the whole proposition. </sentence><sentence id="316">And uh I on the second farm that I went to I really became part of the family and uh and the boy and the girl really became my brothers and sisters. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="320">Q: Tell me about that farm? </sentence><sentence id="321">What were the people's names? </sentence><sentence id="322">What was the family like? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="326">A: Well, of course uh being Danes their name was Nielsen (ph) though you couldn't tell from anybody else. </sentence><sentence id="327">And it was uh, for me it was a uh small farm, with very diversified agriculture - mostly uh dairy farming and pigs. </sentence><sentence id="328">This used to be uh the Danish export of cheese and uh butter and bacon. </sentence><sentence id="329">And uh in the good old days before World War II, they were bringing in feed from abroad, mostly from the United States, and by that time it was cut off, so then the question was how to survive during World War II because most of the Danes were not very enthusiastic about about switching exports from England which was now impossible, to feed  the Germans. </sentence><sentence id="330">So was difficult. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="336">Q: The family's were, was named Nielsen (ph) and you said you were very close to them. </sentence><sentence id="337">What kind of things did you do with them? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="340">A: Well, everything that they did. </sentence><sentence id="341">I mean uh working, whatever needed to be done on the farm, and of course they had small uh groups at that time uh - ten miles was a long ways and so there would be a community get-together around the church and they would have uh invite uh neighbors for dinner, things like that. </sentence><sentence id="342">And I was always part of it. </sentence><sentence id="343">As any kid, part of the family. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="348">Q: Were you, can you - were you on this farm when the Germans invaded Denmark? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="350">A: Yes. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="352">Q: Can you describe the invasion? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="354">A: Very easy. </sentence><sentence id="355">They had a uh, one had uh very primitive uh toilet actually above uh the manure behind the, in the cows and I was sitting there in the morning and, and all of a sudden I hear all those, all those airplanes wondering what the hell was that. </sentence><sentence id="356">That's how the Germans invaded Denmark. </sentence><sentence id="357">And the question was what do we do, and the answer from our group in Copenhagen that took care of us said uh just uh leave alone. </sentence><sentence id="358">Just uh don't uh... </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="364">Q: Let's hold and stop the tape please. ( </sentence><sentence id="365">Technical conversation.) </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="368"> End of Tape #1  Tape #2 </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="370">Q: Can you describe the effect of the invasion on a Denmark farm? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="372">A: I even never saw a German soldier. </sentence><sentence id="373">In "41, I went to a vocational school in Denmark. </sentence><sentence id="374">They had uh four or five months uh during the off-season when they would put, they would put together teach young kids about vocational agriculture during uh when the snow was on the ground and they could uh utilize their time in going to school. </sentence><sentence id="375">And the schools were very small, about sixty, seventy sch... uh seventy youngsters and I got scholarship and uh then had to uh work after the six months working on the uh agriculture school. </sentence><sentence id="376">They had that agriculture school, they had that agriculture school they had a farm and so I became the guy to take care of uh the hogs and the cows. </sentence><sentence id="377">It was of the few jobs in my life which I hated because uh I had to do it because I had to pay off for my uh school and there was no way of getting away from it. </sentence><sentence id="378">It was lots of work so in Demmark at that time one had to have a vocational school of this sort as a uh resident for turning up for the agriculture school. </sentence><sentence id="379">It was part of the uh requirement so I had to have this vocational school and uh the director of the school had to give me a uh a uh a good uh (pause) well, he had to certify that I was at the school, that I made OK and he just had me because I just had this uh, had to have this certificate. </sentence><sentence id="380">So that was in uh "42, late "42, early "43 and in uh the middle of 1943 I finally ended up starting in Agriculture College at the University of Copenhagen. </sentence><sentence id="381">I three years B.S.in Agronomy and uh it was in October, September, October "43 when uh I uh was a uh freshman and one day I got a call, not I but the President of the University got a call in the morning telling me that he should tell me that the Gestapo was uh on my tail and uh my landlady said I should never come back home again. </sentence><sentence id="382">That was at the time when uh the Germans have gotten after the Jews. </sentence><sentence id="383">Uh the Germans did it differently from what they have done in Central Europe and Germany where they uh got the Jews together in the center, in the center and then they would put the Jews together before they were to export them to concentration camps. </sentence><sentence id="384">Uh in Denmark, they couldn't get away with it because the Danes would object to it so the trick that the Germans did is uh picked the people at home so that one wouldn't see anything in front of the rest of the uh population. </sentence><sentence id="385">It just so happened that uh there was a German naval attache at the uh German uh ambassador, embassy in Copenhagen and he was friendly, knowing what uh was happening and let the Danish uh Prime Minister know what the Germans had in mind and that was on uh Yom Kippur and uh the Prime Minister let the Danish chief rabbi tell the people at Yom Kippur that go and tell them then to disappear because if they will be at home, the Germans will pick them up. </sentence><sentence id="386">So most of the people, the seven million, seven thousand people, the Danish uh Jews, were disappeared and the underground got them to Sweden. </sentence><sentence id="387">I think only about five hundred or so got uh went to Theresienstadt, most of them from our group because our group, uh we went, they distribute the Danish congregation so we really didn't know what was happening. </sentence><sentence id="388">And uh so then I  and tell him something and the President called me by name and I came from this theater, took about a half a minute uh wondering what the hell did I do now. </sentence><sentence id="389">And so he said your landlady called, and don't come ever back again. </sentence><sentence id="390">So I happened to, about two or three blocks from the university where a uh Danish uh uh Lutheran reverend whose uh whose uh young boy was a very close friend of mine, and so I went to the church and said what do I do now. </sentence><sentence id="391">So he uh made a couple phone calls and said uh everything is fine. </sentence><sentence id="392">Take your bicycle, drive uh south of uh a little fishing village south of the international headquarters of Copenhagen and a lady will take care of you. </sentence><sentence id="393">And uh by that evening I was in uh Sweden. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="418">Q: Where? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="420">A: In Sweden. </sentence><sentence id="421">That's how easy it was. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="424">Q: Describe that trip. </sentence><sentence id="425">You were on your bike. </sentence><sentence id="426">Where did you go? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="430">A: Well, I left the bike with the lady and she took me uh at night uh to the little fishing uh port and there was a tiny little boat for thirteen, there were thirteen people of us and they just took us over to uh to uh Malm6 and took about an hour and a half and it was October - very rought seas. </sentence><sentence id="431">It was lots of people left there outside out, because the sea was very rough, and that was it. </sentence><sentence id="432">So by that time the Swedes already had uh uh prepared uh the need for putting the people together to uh take care of them. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="436">Q: What, as you were on your bike going to to meet this lady, what were you thinking? </sentence><sentence id="437">What were you ...? </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="502">A: Well, obviously uh the seven uh Jewish people in the in Trest gradually uh had their jobs uh - they couldn't continue them. </sentence><sentence id="503">Finally they uh took them and concentrated them from fifteen or so houses into little groups where the family would be able only to have uh two or three uh hou... places to get together. </sentence><sentence id="504">And every week or month there would be additional squeezing and uh people would have to give their houses away and uh uh gradually would uh have to go to uh Theresienstadt and take a couple of thirty (ph) uh kilos (ph) that they could take along with them, and then they would be in Theresienstadt for uh about a year and that in October or September 1944 I would, I found out that they went to Auschwitz and that's the last I ever heard from my entire family. </sentence><sentence id="505">My uh grandfather and my uh mother's brother, my brother and his uh new uh he got married - the whole family just disappeared. </sentence><sentence id="506">That was about uh October "44. </sentence><sentence id="507">So after (cough) from England, uh from uh Sweden I eventually ended up in the Czech exile government uh Army. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="542">Q: I'm sorry. </sentence><sentence id="543">I don't understand. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="546">A: The Czech uh school would uh, or the Czech exile government had a uh high school for the kids uh that uh belonged to the uh Czech uh ministers of the government, and uh so the captain arranged for me to uh do uh my communication long-distance and uh so eventually I got my high school degree. </sentence><sentence id="547">So uh that made it possible for me after World War II to to go back to the university. </sentence><sentence id="548">So then uh when the war was over in Central Europe in May 1945 I uh went back to Prague looking for my parents. </sentence><sentence id="549">By that time I thought maybe it would have been long enough time to, for them to come back, but they were not and uh a lady that was in uh in uh the mail room in the little city was a friend of our family's and she wrote to me and says, your folks have not come back and we have very small chances that they might be. </sentence><sentence id="550">So that was in uh May or June 1945. </sentence><sentence id="551">So that's the end of the story. </sentence></p></dialogue>
