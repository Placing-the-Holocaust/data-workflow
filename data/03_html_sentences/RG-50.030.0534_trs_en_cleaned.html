one and a half? </sentence><sentence id="43">One? </sentence><sentence id="44">I'm not sure. </sentence><sentence id="45">I have been trying to get information, but I haven't gotten anything so far. </sentence><sentence id="46">I do have a booklet that was given to my mother when they brought her -- when they brought me to her, and it has the pictures of the women who -- the nurses who took care of me, who were Swiss Red Cross nurses, and some pictures of different periods, which I still have. </sentence><sentence id="47">We -- after ri -- Rivesaltes, we went to Tres, and there I have very few memories. </sentence><sentence id="48">The first memory I have is not feeling well, not being able to speak, and my mother going back and forth. </sentence><sentence id="49">I think it's my mother. </sentence><sentence id="50">And there must have been a little mirror, because I remem -- that's the only thing I remember, and I know I was very young. </sentence><sentence id="51">And then I do remember Tres. </sentence><sentence id="52">Not Tres, Marseilles. </sentence><sentence id="53">We went to Marseilles, it was the end of the war, and there were a lot of air raids, and we used to go to shelters. </sentence><sentence id="54">The one I remember particularly well was the time I locked myself in the room, and the air raids went on and my mother went hysterical and my father had to break open the door. </sentence><sentence id="55">I remember getting a good spanking for that later, and I remember we did go to the shelters. </sentence><sentence id="56">The shelters were very frightening, because they were very dark, to me at the time, they were dark and cold. </sentence><sentence id="57">And I always cried. </sentence><sentence id="58">So there was a gentleman that I remember that we always used to see. </sentence><sentence id="59">His wife was blind. </sentence><sentence id="60">That I still remember. </sentence><sentence id="61">And he taught me how to -- taught me different songs. </sentence><sentence id="62">And   http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection Interview with Joyce Mizrachi deg July 23, 2009 that, I guess, stopped my crying, which became a pain in the neck to everyone else. </sentence><sentence id="63">I remember that. </sentence><sentence id="64">And I remember the different things. </sentence><sentence id="65">I remember being very spoiled by a lot of very different people. </sentence><sentence id="66">And I never had what my sister and brother had. </sentence><sentence id="67">I never remember hunger, because I was never hungry. </sentence><sentence id="68">I was frightened because no matter how young you are, people's emotions do -- do penetrate, and fear is very, very noticeable and affective. </sentence><sentence id="69">It affects you. </sentence><sentence id="70">So I was always frightened of that. </sentence><sentence id="71">I was always afraid of being taken away. </sentence><sentence id="72">The other thing I remember is that I guess it was -- it was a big Catholic organization, and in France the nuns had very big headdresses. </sentence><sentence id="73">I don't know the order, but I remember we used to get hot chocolate there, or something like it. </sentence><sentence id="74">And my mother -- I was so s -- very afraid of my mother leaving me, and being very -- screaming very badly. </sentence><sentence id="75">Those are the things I remember, being very frightened. </sentence><sentence id="76">So remember being in back of a woman, because Marseilles was a very, very rough city, at that time especially, because it was near the waterfront. </sentence><sentence id="77">And walking -- and we were walking behind a couple, and she had her bag over her wrist, and somebody just cutting the bag off. </sentence><sentence id="78">And she stood there with just the strap, screaming, and we were not far behind. </sentence><sentence id="79">I don't know if my father was there, because he usually was very good at running after anybody who was -- had to be caught. </sentence><sentence id="80">And that always, always stuck in my mind. </sentence><sentence id="81">There was a couple who wanted to adopt me, and my mother said, no way. </sentence><sentence id="82">It was a friend of   http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection " Interview with Joyce Mizrachi July 23, 2009 theirs, I-- I don't know, they just figured my mother had two children and they had none, and times were very bad. </sentence><sentence id="83">And she said, probably, I don't know who they were. </sentence><sentence id="84">I know my friend -- friends of ours that still live in Brussels told Lucie about it when she was in Brussels. </sentence><sentence id="85">I don't know who it was, someday I'll go, in the near future, because they're rather old, and I have to go and see what they know. </sentence><sentence id="86">Then I remember coming to Belgium after the war, going to school. </sentence><sentence id="87">Things were very tough in Belgium after the war. </sentence><sentence id="88">Work was very difficult. </sentence><sentence id="89">The anti-Semitism was horrible, very, very strong. </sentence><sentence id="90">I went to school in yeshiva, but because I was very rambunctious, not the greatest student, because I couldn't care less, and I didn't like it. </sentence><sentence id="91">There was an orphanage nearby of all the kids that had lost their parents during the war, and they were sent to France and from France they were going to be sent to Israel, eventually, or some other place, or stay in France. </sentence><sentence id="92">And that made me very frightened. </sentence><sentence id="93">And ultimately my mother was asked to find another school for me, because I was such a wonderful child. </sentence><sentence id="94">They were thrilled to see me go, and I was thrilled to get out. </sentence><sentence id="95">And the next school I went to was an all-girls school. </sentence><sentence id="96">It was not a Hebrew school, it was very -- it was mixed. </sentence><sentence id="97">Very few Jews, and I was one of them. </sentence><sentence id="98">And the antisis -- anti-Semitism was very much felt when I was told, it's a shame that they didn't get you too. </sentence><sentence id="99">And I didn't know what they were talking about, because my parents never spoke about it, not in front of me. </sentence><sentence id="100">My father never spoke   http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection 4 Interview with Joyce Mizrachi July 23, 2009 about it til the day he died, til he had Alzheimer's, then he went back through everything. </sentence><sentence id="101">So he never spoke about anything. </sentence><sentence id="102">But I never understood what she was talking about. </sentence><sentence id="103">It was -- it was tough. </sentence><sentence id="104">Then we came and what we did for entertainment was we went to the movies. </sentence><sentence id="105">And I decided that, since I entertained everybody anyway -- I used to put on accents -- I had to do that, I felt, because everybody was always so grouchy, and that made them laugh. </sentence><sentence id="106">So I entertained. </sentence><sentence id="107">And coming to this country meant that I wanted to know where Hollywood was. </sentence><sentence id="108">I was nine on the boat, and it was -- I was thrilled. </sentence><sentence id="109">I was thrilled to come, til I came and I didn't particularly care for it. </sentence><sentence id="110">I was very homesick, I missed my friends. </sentence><sentence id="111">My parents did not talk about their experience when I was young in front of me. </sentence><sentence id="112">It was all kept very quietly. </sentence><sentence id="113">We came to this country, and my father, who did not want to come, only wanted to go to Israel. </sentence><sentence id="114">My mother refused. </sentence><sentence id="115">She said that she was not going to have us taken away any more, and he had a choice. </sentence><sentence id="116">He either could come -- because she had one sister left, that lived here -- he had a choice; either he came with us, and she was going and she was taking us, or th -- he could go and he'd never see us again. </sentence><sentence id="117">So she blackmailed him into coming, which wasn't really the best thing for him, because he could never adjust very well to this country. </sentence><sentence id="118">She loved it. </sentence><sentence id="119">And every day I thank her. </sentence><sentence id="120">She did speak about it, ultimately, but he never, ever, ever spoke about it. </sentence><sentence id="121">I never knew he was in the resistance. </sentence><sentence id="122">I never knew that he had   http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection Interview with Joyce Mizrachi deg July 23, 2009 gotten people out of the camp, because he was a plumber, and he knew the underground works, where he had to fix things, and that's how he got people out. </sentence><sentence id="123">I never knew all these things. </sentence><sentence id="124">Everything about him was a mystery, yet he was a wonderful father. </sentence><sentence id="125">He was wonderful when we were little, because he managed to play with us like a child, and have the most wonderful stories for us. </sentence><sentence id="126">She -- my mother was very depressed for most of the time that I remember when I was sma -- young. </sentence><sentence id="127">I remember her crying a lot. </sentence><sentence id="128">I remember her when her niece's birthday and her nephews, or whoever, always having -- we didn't have very much money, but she always managed to get flowers next to their picture. </sentence><sentence id="129">And I always think -- I always thought, I don't get flowers on my birthday, or anything like that. </sentence><sentence id="130">Why do they? </sentence><sentence id="131">I always had a feeling -- well, it's my own insecurity, but I was always afraid that she was not my mother, because I used to think, if you -- she got me out when I was one or two, how did she know it was me? </sentence><sentence id="132">Who told her it was me? </sentence><sentence id="133">Children change. </sentence><sentence id="134">How did she know? </sentence><sentence id="135">We stayed at the HIAS when we came, and that was really a shelter. </sentence><sentence id="136">It was a lot of different people from a lot of different places, and it was very much like a shelter, today, I would imagine. </sentence><sentence id="137">There were cots. </sentence><sentence id="138">And my aunt felt that that really wasn't proper for me, and I stayed with her. </sentence><sentence id="139">And I was -- as I said, I was always very -- my sister and brother do not want to think that I experienced anything. </sentence><sentence id="140">If I say I remember something, they're very fast to either say,   ontectnetonancedjusetneey for tarher biormatoerabouttfisestecion Interview with Joyce Mizrachi

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="254">A: For me the HIAS was very exciting, it was very different. </sentence><sentence id="255">And I thought, oh, what a different place, what a different world. </sentence><sentence id="256">But I soon -- and then we moved to Riverside Drive and I went to school. </sentence><sentence id="257">But there were always things lingering, there was always this heaviness that I remember. </sentence><sentence id="258">When I went to school, high school, there were a lot of -- which was Washington Heights, there were a lot of refugees there, and it's funny how you click. </sentence><sentence id="259">And that's what you do. </sentence><sentence id="260">Even later on you do. </sentence><sentence id="261">And the frightening thing was, one of my friends found out when she was 16 that that was not her parents, they were aunt and uncle. </sentence><sentence id="262">She was put up as a child. </sentence><sentence id="263">And that reinforced my feeling that, oh I-- I know she's not my mother. </sentence><sentence id="264">And I remember thinking -- and I know, because I was such a difficult child. </sentence><sentence id="265">I was difficult also because she was 43 when she had me. </sentence><sentence id="266">I was not exactly what you call a planned child. </sentence><sentence id="267">And I remember thinking, yeah, if I'm gonna have a kid, I'm gonna have somebody like you. </sentence><sentence id="268">Til much later in life that I realized she is my mother because I look just like her. </sentence><sentence id="269">But that could be with adopted child as well. </sentence><sentence id="270">I am ju--I am very   ontectnetonancedjusetneey for tarher biormatoerabouttfisestecion Interview with Joyce Mizrachi deg July 23, 2009 much like her, and I know, I know that who -- that I'm not. </sentence><sentence id="271">Not that it would matter anyway, after a certain age. </sentence><sentence id="272">As a mother she was a fantastic mother. </sentence><sentence id="273">She let me live and be who I am, which is more than I can say for a lot of children of -- who are survive -- children of survivors. </sentence><sentence id="274">Because they burden -- there is a burden on you. </sentence><sentence id="275">There is a--a very heavy burden on you that you have to protect, even when it comes to your siblings, and you cannot do certain things that would upset them too much, because they were upset enough. </sentence><sentence id="276">But all in all they were -- she really did a phenomenal job. </sentence><sentence id="277">She is the reason why we're alive. </sentence><sentence id="278">She is the one who masterminded everything. </sentence><sentence id="279">But a lot of it was also a lot of luck, because she was stopped by Gestapo, and she was -- and he looked at her and he said, I will let you go this time, but if I catch you again, you will not survive. </sentence><sentence id="280">So things like that did happen. </sentence><sentence id="281">She did not -- one thing she did teach me, was not to dislike anybody for anything that happened before. </sentence><sentence id="282">And that I'm thrilled about, because I do have friends that are everything different. </sentence><sentence id="283">As I said, she didn't put all the ugliness on me, but unfortunately we do that ourselves. </sentence><sentence id="284">I don't -- I'm very careful who I speak to about it. </sentence><sentence id="285">I don't watch any movies with anyone around me, that pertain to the Holocaust. </sentence><sentence id="286">And you get your own things that you have to live through and work through, but I didn't have the hardship that they had. </sentence><sentence id="287">For that, I'm lucky too. </sentence><sentence id="288">Okay. </sentence><sentence id="289">And that's my story. </sentence><sentence id="290"> Interview with Joyce Mizrachi " July 23, 2009 </sentence></p></dialogue>
