few memories. </sentence><sentence id="48">The first memory I have is not feeling well, not being able to speak, and my mother going back and forth. </sentence><sentence id="49">I think it's my mother. </sentence><sentence id="50">And there must have been a little mirror, because I remem -- that's the only thing I remember, and I know I was very young. </sentence><sentence id="51">And then I

break open the door. </sentence><sentence id="55">I remember getting a good spanking for that later, and I remember we did go to the shelters. </sentence><sentence id="56">The shelters were very frightening, because they were very dark, to me at the time, they were dark and cold. </sentence><sentence id="57">And I always cried. </sentence><sentence id="58">So there was a gentleman that I

</sentence><sentence id="67">I remember being very spoiled by a lot of very different people. </sentence><sentence id="68">And I never had what my sister and brother had. </sentence><sentence

me, and being very -- screaming very badly. </sentence><sentence id="77">Those are the things I remember, being very frightened. </sentence><sentence id="78">So remember being in back of a woman, because Marseilles was a very, very rough city, at that time especially, because it was near the waterfront. </sentence><sentence id="79">And walking -- and we were walking behind a couple, and she

it when she was in Brussels. </sentence><sentence id="89">I don't know who it was, someday I'll go, in the near future, because they're rather old, and I have to go and see what they know.

rambunctious, not the greatest student, because I couldn't care less, and I didn't like it. </sentence><sentence id="95">There was an orphanage nearby of all the kids that had lost their parents during the war, and they were sent to France and from France they were going to be sent to Israel, eventually, or some other place, or stay in France. </sentence><sentence id="96">And that made me very frightened. </sentence><sentence id="97">And ultimately my mother was asked to find another school for me, because I was such a wonderful child. </sentence><sentence id="98">They were thrilled to see me go, and I was thrilled to get out. </sentence><sentence id="99">And the next school I went to was an all-girls school. </sentence><sentence id="100">It was not a Hebrew school, it was very -- it was mixed. </sentence><sentence id="101">Very few Jews, and I was one of them. </sentence><sentence id="102">And the antisis -- anti-Semitism was very much felt when I was told, it's a shame that they didn't get you too. </sentence><sentence id="103">And I didn't know what they were talking about, because my parents never spoke about it, not in front of me. </sentence><sentence id="104">My

decided that, since I entertained everybody anyway -- I used to put on accents -- I had to do that, I felt, because everybody was always so grouchy, and that made them laugh. </sentence><sentence id="112">So I entertained. </sentence><sentence id="113">And coming to this country meant that I wanted to know where Hollywood was. </sentence><sentence id="114">I was nine on the boat, and it was --

</sentence><sentence id="117">My parents did not talk about their experience when I was young in front of me. </sentence><sentence id="118">It was all kept very quietly. </sentence><sentence id="119">We came to this country, and my father, who did not want to come, only wanted to go to Israel. </sentence><sentence id="120">My mother refused. </sentence><sentence id="121">She said that she was not going to have us taken away any more, and he had a choice. </sentence><sentence id="122">He either could come -- because she had one sister left, that lived here -- he had a choice; either he came with us, and she was going and she was taking us, or th -- he could go and he'd never see us again. </sentence><sentence id="123">So she blackmailed him into coming, which wasn't really the best thing for him, because he could never adjust very well to this country. </sentence><sentence id="124">She loved it. </sentence><sentence id="125">And every day I thank her. </sentence><sentence

do they? </sentence><sentence id="139">I always had a feeling -- well, it's my own insecurity, but I was always afraid that she was not my mother, because I used to think, if you -- she got me out
