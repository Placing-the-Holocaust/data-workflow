<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="13">A: My name is Isaac Nehama. </sentence><sentence id="14">I was born in Athens, Greece, April 29, ninetweent-- 1926. </sentence><sentence id="15">I returned to Athens from the partisans. </sentence><sentence id="16">I was stationed at that time in Thessaly, in the city of Lireza, which is the capital of Thessaly. </sentence><sentence id="17">I returned to Athens t -- either towards the very end of October, "44, or beginning of November deg44.Approximately two or three weeks after the liberation of Greece -- actually, the Germans left Greece because the Russians were about to enter Yugoslavia, and therefore their retreat would have been cut off. </sentence><sentence id="18">So the Germans essentially left Greece. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="26">Q: And when were you reunited with -- with your father? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="28">A: Well, [ arrived in Athens on, I remember, a Sunday. </sentence><sentence id="29">And the reason this is prominent, because I think Sundays everywhere in the world are very quiet days, sometimes they are deserted. </sentence><sentence id="30">I arrived in Athens f -- with a bus that I had taken from Lireza perhaps around four or five o'clock in the afternoon. </sentence><sentence id="31">I called from the bus </sentence></p><p><sentence id="32">   USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0069 3 station, and I was told to immediately come. </sentence><sentence id="33">I took a taxi, and when finally we were approaching our neighborhood, and my house, I expected to be greeted in the street by my two younger brothers, but I saw no one. </sentence><sentence id="34">In fact, there was not a single person in the street. </sentence><sentence id="35">And I walked up to our apartment, I rang the door. </sentence><sentence id="36">A woman came out, who I recognized to be the woman whom I had seen in t -- in Lireza two weeks or so previously, who had told me that she had been passing through, and she had a message from my family, they were, all of them anxious, waiting to -- to be reunited with me, and she was the one who even gave me money for the -- for the fare back. </sentence><sentence id="37">Of course, I -- Inow know, and -- or soon learned that my father had given her the money to -- to give me for the fare. </sentence><sentence id="38">In any case -- so she -- she s -- immediately, without even -- I think she didn't even say a -- any words, but simply with a finger pointed upstairs to the apartment of our pre-war neighbors, a family called Shabitai. </sentence><sentence id="39">I didn't know what to make of it, why would I have to go to the Shabitai's to see my family? </sentence><sentence id="40">So I went one more flight, and I knocked on the door, and Mrs. Shabitai opened the door, and she embraced me, and I was shown into their living room, and then I saw my father, and only my father, with Mr. Shabitai. </sentence><sentence id="41">I -- I -- we embraced, and I immediately asked where is mother, and -- and -- and Sam, and -- and Mekko, as we used to call the youngest brother. </sentence><sentence id="42">And my father was crying, and I think un-unable to explain, and Mr. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="43">mi -- Shabitai said that th-they were not there, they were -- they were caught, but that that wasn't the time to explain. </sentence><sentence id="44">They implied that I must have known that terrible things happen, and that my mother and brothers were caught, and no one knows -- knew where they went. </sentence><sentence id="45">That was the -- the reunion. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="46"> USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0069 4 </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="47">Q: Tell me how you proceeded from -- from that im -- immediate reunion, to beginning to plan where you would live, and how you would put your lives together? </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="48">A: Yeah, but I have to -- to cover iv -- the brai -- brief period that occurred about two weeks after my arrival. </sentence><sentence id="49">I -- in -- in the beginning of December of "44, there was a brief civil war between the left -- political left, and the government, and also the British forces in Athens. </sentence><sentence id="50">And these troubles primarily occurred in Athens. </sentence><sentence id="51">There -- there was fighting in the street, and all of us were sort of hiding to try to avoid being injured. </sentence><sentence id="52">Then, in about 15 days after the start of the troubles -- I's -- even then we called it the events, our neighborhood was liberated, and as I recall by a small group of English parachutists, I remember their red berets. </sentence><sentence id="53">So that was the beginning of what I thought was going to be normalcy, but very quickly, two days later, I was standing in line to buy some food, which was unavailable, and I was arrested by Greek gendarmes, taken, interrogated. </sentence><sentence id="54">They wanted me to reveal names of known leftists. </sentence><sentence id="55">I explained to them I had been gone for slightly over a year, I knew nobody, I was not politically active. </sentence><sentence id="56">But it -- nevertheless, I was -- I was taken in a c -- little camp out -- out -- outside of Athens, and eventually to Africa. </sentence><sentence id="57">But very shortly, through the intervention of relatives, I was freed, and came back. </sentence><sentence id="58">So I think it was, essentially in the beginning of deg45 that we even began to even think about the restoration of our lives. </sentence><sentence id="59">Since as soon as I finish high school in 1942, the universities were closed, and I couldn't go on, and my father had resumed his occupa -- work with -- he was chief accountant of a large textile firm in Athens. </sentence><sentence id="60">So he resumed hi-his -- his profession. </sentence><sentence id="61">Also, I must note that the apar -- our apartment in Athens, where we lived before, a -- a couple, a husband and a USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0069 5 wife, one of them being the woman who gave me the money in -- in Lireza. </sentence><sentence id="62">They were occupying half of the apartment, they couldn't be evicted, or -- or -- it was out of the question to -- to -- to -- to -- to take any action. </sentence><sentence id="63">So my father and I sort of lived in half of the apartment, until about six or eight months later, after Sam returned, Mr. and Mrs. Stasinopolous, that was their name, eventually left, and went, and found another - - another apartment. </sentence><sentence id="64">So immediately I -- I then began getting preparations for taking the entrance exam to the Polytechnic Institute in Athens, which I -- this usually took place in the end of August, beginning of September. </sentence><sentence id="65">And indeed, in -- in September of 45, I took the exams, and I was admitted, and I -- I had one semester in the Polytechnic Institute, before I had found out -- which we perhaps will go into in -- ina moment, that my father had begun to, without telling me a word, working assiduously to find a way for me to study all -- abroad, which he eventually was successful, and -- but that's ano -- a different chapter. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="85">Q: Yes. </sentence><sentence id="86">When you were a teenager, you had been working. </sentence><sentence id="87">What was the work that you were doing then, and you were doing it until 1943? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="91">A: Well, I -- I -- I -- as I said, I finished high school in June of "42. </sentence><sentence id="92">Since the universities were closed, then it was unthinkable, I think, for my father and mother that I would simply remain idle. </sentence><sentence id="93">So I was -- my father found a job for me. </sentence><sentence id="94">Let me describe it as being the clandestine, or an illegal market in currency. </sentence><sentence id="95">There was a -- not a black market, but a clandestine market of currency in -- in -- in Greece during the occupation. </sentence><sentence id="96">What was exchanged were principally, and almost exclusively, gold coins, either British sovereigns, French gold francs, or Swiss francs. </sentence><sentence id="97">Occasionally -- and the  USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0069 6 only non-metal currency that was acceptable were U.S. dollars. </sentence><sentence id="98">And also, occasionally, small bars of gold. </sentence><sentence id="99">So, this individual, who was originally from Salonika, and who was a -- in the stock market in Salonika, the legal stock market, he had, with his family, escaped from Salonika, established himself in Athens, and then started a -- an office by himself. </sentence><sentence id="100">A bureau conducting this sort of activity. </sentence><sentence id="101">Very briefly, the way it worked, if somebody wanted to, let's say sell or buy gold coins, against drachmas -- because drachma of course was, in the occupation, highly devalued. </sentence><sentence id="102">The -- the value of -- th -- the price fluctuated according to the political fortunes of the allies. </sentence><sentence id="103">For instance, while Rommel was advancing in North Africa, then the pound, and the dollar -- or the gold pound and the dollar, would then be def -- deflated. </sentence><sentence id="104">And when, on the contrary, when the allies began to -- to -- to -- to -- t -- to win, and turn the tide around, then the -- the -- the drachma would be more highly valued, because it would have s-some value other than what the piece of paper that was the currency during the occupation. </sentence><sentence id="105">So this is what, essentially, he was doing. </sentence><sentence id="106">And my job was -- I didn't do the trades, but I had to deliver to a buyer, or -- a f -- f -- first of all, even to deliver a roll of let's say, 10 gold sovereigns to the buyer, I had to go first to the seller, to his house, get the roll of coins, put them in my pocket, and deliver them to the -- to the buyer. </sentence><sentence id="107">It was, let's say, a dangerous activity because possession, let alone trade in gold, was illegal. </sentence><sentence id="108">If I had been caught, I -- I would have been jailed, shot, or whatever it was. </sentence><sentence id="109">Even conducting this sort of business was -- was illegal. </sentence><sentence id="110">So there was a f -- the front was that -- there we -- we had a number of shelves in the office with textiles. </sentence><sentence id="111">Woolens, and some silks, USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0069 7 pretending that it was that sort of business, but actually, the -- the business itself was the -- the currency. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="135">Q: And was this a Jewish enterprise? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="137">A: Well, it -- the man, his name was Haim Romano, happened to be a Jew from Salonika, but th-the traders were both Christian Greeks, as well as Jews. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="139">Q: Mm-hm. </sentence><sentence id="140">And when you mention your neighbors in the apartment above, were -- were they Jewish? </sentence><sentence id="141">And I know that your parents sort of social network was generally family contacts. </sentence><sentence id="142">I think people they knew from Monisteer, or -- </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="143">A: Relatives. </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="144">Q: -- it was a -- a Jewish world in which they led their lives, would you say? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="146">A: Yes, yes. </sentence><sentence id="147">Well, and the Shabitais were Jews, but they were not Sephardim. </sentence><sentence id="148">Mr. and Mrs. Shabitai -- Mrs. Shabitai was from Yarninar, and Mr. Shabitai was from Trikola. </sentence><sentence id="149">Both of them are what is referred to as Romaniots, which can be explained either as Greek speaking, or negatively, non-Ladino, not Judeo espanole speaking, or they were not descendants of the Jews who were expelled from Spain in 1492. </sentence><sentence id="150">In contrast, my parents on both sides -- both of them were born in Monasteer, traced their ancestry to the Sephardim who left Spain, and eventually ended up in that part of the Balkans, which was, at that time, a part of the Ottoman Empire. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="156">Q: Mm-hm. </sentence><sentence id="157">Do you think that your group had any -- was there a Sephardim look? </sentence><sentence id="158">I mean would -- could you -- could you say that you were slight in build, and dark, and - - I mean, is -- was there a difference between the Sephardim and the Ashkenazis? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="162"> USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0069 8 </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="163">A: Do you see any difference? </sentence><sentence id="164">No, no, I -- I -- I don't recall -- really I think that I couldn't distinguish any surface difference between the looks of my family or our relatives, and other Greeks. </sentence><sentence id="165">They all have, perhaps the same kind of Mediterranean look, which not even -- has even particularly darker skin coloration. </sentence><sentence id="166">Of course, a -- a -- you -- you -- you would find very rarely, even among Greeks, or -- or Turks, or southern Italians, or Spanish, blonde people. </sentence><sentence id="167">But there were a few there, but otherwise there were no such characteristics of Sephardim. </sentence><sentence id="168">The thing that was distinguishing, of course was that my parents spoke Ladino to each other, and my maternal grandmother, who would come and visit us, at least two or three times a week, she lived with an aunt -- a sister of my mother's, that's the only language that she understood, and we had to speak to her, and she spoke to us with s -- Ladino. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="175">Q: Mm-hm. </sentence><sentence id="176">Was Ladino your mother tongue? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="179">A: Not mine. </sentence><sentence id="180">Mine was, well dual, Greek primarily because of my friends and going to school, but at home it was obligatory to speak French, bo -- my mother was a teacher of French, and my father had studied in Paris, or -- we -- we were obliged to speak in French. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="183">Q: But you don't know what you spoke first as a child, or -- or fr -- from the very beginning? </sentence><sentence id="184">Perhaps you were speaking Ladino and French right from infancy on. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="187">A: I -- I don't believe that I spoke Ladino. </sentence><sentence id="188">Perhaps, before I began to go to school, I believe, and I -- I seem to -- I recollect that I spoke to my parents in French. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="191">Q: I'm backing away now and coming -- thinking again of your father at this time. </sentence><sentence id="192">Do you have a sense of how he was coping? </sentence><sentence id="193">I mean, he had lost his -- at this particular </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="197"> USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0069 9 point, he had lost his wife and two sons. </sentence><sentence id="198">Do you have a sense of what gave him strength, and what his state of mind was? </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="199">A: I can only surmise -- I -- I have to -- because this -- it occurs, and I think about it very often. </sentence><sentence id="200">Or in discussions I have with people. </sentence><sentence id="201">And I always have to remind myself and my interlocutors that at least in those times, and -- and in -- in that particular part of the world, parents were not really very communicative about personal and intimate things, with y-young children. </sentence><sentence id="202">I -- I -- I think -- I -- I -- I ca -- I recollect from cousins that they began to have conversation as between adults, and equals with their parents, after they themselves had matured, and were married. </sentence><sentence id="203">So I don't think that there was, let's say, reluctance. </sentence><sentence id="204">My father used to be a great storyteller, but I must say that very seldom, 0-o-other than in passing he would say how dinner was in -- on -- on high holidays in Monasteer, how the dinner would be prepared, and things like this. </sentence><sentence id="205">A episode of things like this. </sentence><sentence id="206">But not very much about personal life. </sentence><sentence id="207">But coming back to your question, there was very little exchange between us as to either how we felt -- I told him about some of the things that I had thought about during my sojourn in the Greek mountains with the partisans, but really very briefly, and I think mostly superficial. </sentence><sentence id="208">We didn't go into -- into that. </sentence><sentence id="209">Knowing my father as I recollect him, he was an individual of -- you know, he was lame, as you know, because of polio, and he had a club foot. </sentence><sentence id="210">So he was always hobbled. </sentence><sentence id="211">He always wor -- wor -- walked with a cane. </sentence><sentence id="212">But he -- he had a -- an inner strength that became evident to me very rarely. </sentence><sentence id="213">I think you -- you know the example of his urging me not to be caught alive by the Germans. </sentence><sentence id="214">So, I can only imagine the -- the pain that he had with the loss -- or at that USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0069 10 time, you know, we still had a very, very faint hope that perhaps they might return. </sentence><sentence id="215">We -- remember the war was not over in Europe until April -- end of April "45, so the pictures of -- and -- and -- and stories, and -- and things about like the horrors of the camps was still totally unknown. </sentence><sentence id="216">So there was a -- a -- a residue of hope, although very, very slight, that they mi -- they might come back. </sentence><sentence id="217">And the focus, therefore, was I think a -- a tacit -- a mutual understanding that we had to get on with our lives as best we could, and so my father resumed his work, and I then resumed the preparations for taking the exams. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="238">Q: Mm-hm. </sentence><sentence id="239">You know, wh-when I asked you that question, I was thinking of his admonishing you to not be taken by the Germans. </sentence><sentence id="240">And I think he spoke of that, I'm assuming, because you had shown your determination not to go into hiding, but to go to the mountains. </sentence><sentence id="241">And you were the oldest, and you'd had your Bar Mitzvah. </sentence><sentence id="242">And times were times of duress, I -- which prompted me to think perhaps he was more open in what he said to you. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="248">A: Well, but you have to remember that -- th -- it was such a special moment, | -- I cannot conceive of an -- a recollection -- let me back off, very quickly. </sentence><sentence id="249">In the summer of "39, my father took me to a -- there's a -- a place about a hundred kilometers from Athens, it's called Lutrikey, and it's a -- sort of a spa, because it has water sources that are -- contain rad-radio activity, radium. </sentence><sentence id="250">And they were thought to be very beneficial for whatever a-ails you. </sentence><sentence id="251">It was essentially a resort. </sentence><sentence id="252">And so we went ahead of the rest of the family for three or four days. </sentence><sentence id="253">It was shortly after by -- my Bar Mitzvah, and I still remember the first time that -- so we were the two of us, and is the first instance that I USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0069 11 recall my father telling me, for example [indecipherable] personal plans, that he had begun to -- I see -- remember telling me -- put some money aside, and part of plan was we were going to leave the apartment where we had lived for -- since I rec -- I recall. </sentence><sentence id="254">And we're going to buy a house. </sentence><sentence id="255">So it was the first time that I had heard my father telling me of something about his -- let's say dreams and plans for the future. </sentence><sentence id="256">So, in other words, it was the first instance where I think I was tr -- being treated as an adult. </sentence><sentence id="257">The unfortunate thing is that as soon as we returned, the war started, in September of deg39, so we too -- September thir -- or -- or -- or that summer of "39, it's the last summer -- and that in 1940 because the war didn't touch Greece until the fall of 1940 that are the last two summers that I can recall of being if not happy, at least -- I have to use a French word, insouciance, that we were not bothered. </sentence><sentence id="258">The war had started, it was a terrible thing. </sentence><sentence id="259">My parents had both gone through the experience of the first World War, and it's horrors in Monasteer, but it was so far away that it didn't yet begin to touch us until the fall of 1940. </sentence><sentence id="260">So, it's a long detour to what's -- what -- what you ask. </sentence><sentence id="261">So I -- I -- think there was a tremendous amount of resilience, and strength that -- in my father, which was not apparent on the surface. </sentence><sentence id="262">When he admonished me not to be caught alive by the Germans, I think it was because he knew from all the reports of the 30's, since the rise of Hitler in Germany, the history of the -- of the Jews in Gaspora, all these things, you know, get farely concentrated, and simply -- al-although I don't think he -- no one knew at that time of concentration camps, but he knew that it was not a good thing to be caught alive by the Germans. </sentence><sentence id="263">So he -- he -- it was a second USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0069 12 instance of I -- his addressing me as an adult, and telling me that it's better to -- to be dead, than be caught alive. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="282">Q: And I would assume then, that there might have been more confidences shared at that stage in your life, were it not for the fact that I think you s -- you also talk earlier in your interview on videotape about the pall that descended, so that it became a situation from your parents when they -- their fears were something they di -- they wanted to protect you from. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="284">A: F -- yo-your absolutely correct about the pall, because it was so palpable, I -- I can still feel it. </sentence><sentence id="285">I don't re -- recall that there was, let's say, a smile on their faces after about mid or early April of 1943, because the news began to come in very quickly about both Monasteer and Salonika. </sentence><sentence id="286">Those occur about two or three weeks apart. </sentence><sentence id="287">And the -- although -- sou -- a few things were written up in the papers that was really not -- some that was really spoken, but they knew from reports of relatives. </sentence><sentence id="288">And as I say, I -- from then on, I don't recall their being a single smile in their faces. </sentence><sentence id="289">Now I've lost track of what you asked. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="296">Q: Oh, and they wanted to protect you, I think, from their fears. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="325">A: I believe we were talking about the situation a-after April deg43, when the news from Salonika and Monasteer came, and I think I was alluding to the fact that although our parents did not take us into their confidence about their concern, their worries, but I can only surmise, and I'm almost positive now in checking with my brother, that a lot of the time, intervening time, was spent in preparing for -- not inevitability, but in -- in the event that the same thing would occur in Athens. </sentence><sentence id="326">Because I cannot explain in any other way, the fact that practically as soon as the signal was given to disperse in Athens, the plan was already in place about where to go. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="327"> USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0069 14 </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="328">Q: And the plan about where to go raises lots of questions for me about the -- the friends, or the people with whom you -- your family, not -- not you, ultimately, sought shelter, or -- or -- or homes, and the extent to which those people took risks, or did not take risks. </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="329">A: All right. </sentence><sentence id="330">A couple of weeks before the dispersal, a friend of -- a sc-schoolmate -- I -- I would speak about my role first. </sentence><sentence id="331">Although again, I hadn't discussed this with my parents, but sensing what was happening, this school f-friend, Thanasis Mikalopoulus, who is a Christian Greek, I had told him that there may come a time when I may have to go into hiding, and then -- we were close friends, but I hadn't even met his parents. </sentence><sentence id="332">He says, "They'll be n-no question, you will come and stay with us." </sentence><sentence id="333">So that sort of was done. </sentence><sentence id="334">When then we had this family council about where to go, I will tell you very quickly, my -- my father -- first of all, no Jewish family, really more than three or four at most, could possibly be hiding all together, because it would have been very apparent, no matter where they were hiding, that neighbors would immediately see, suddenly, not one or two, which you can justify as being my visiting relative from the provinces. </sentence><sentence id="335">Well, not suddenly, you know, a whole -- a whole family. </sentence><sentence id="336">So, this person was essential. </sentence><sentence id="337">My father went and -- and stayed for a certain period of time. </sentence><sentence id="338">Certainly until my departure from the mountains about a month later, with a -- a couple, they were childless. </sentence><sentence id="339">Both the man and the -- the -- the woman -- his name was Tenasias, her name was Ellie, they were both working in the same company that my father did, so they were both colleagues, as well as friends of long-standing. </sentence><sentence id="340">Next door to our house in Athens, to our apartment, was a man who had a small store that was really a mini USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0069 15 variety store. </sentence><sentence id="341">By that I mean he -- he sold tobacco, cigarettes, newspapers, but also in the back o-of -- he had thread, and needles. </sentence><sentence id="342">It was that -- that sort of convenience neighborhood store. </sentence><sentence id="343">And over the years my father had become very, very friendly with this individual, and he had a house in one of the suburbs on the eastern side of Athens, really a -- a vi -- a far suburb. </sentence><sentence id="344">And that's where my mother and two brothers went. </sentence><sentence id="345">So when we dispersed, that's how we -- that's where we went. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="364">Q: Yes. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="366">A: You ask about risks. </sentence><sentence id="367">Well, really all of them took risks, and the same risks, because the Germans made it known that sheltering Jews, or sheltering people like members of the resistance, whether arm resistance or the political resistance was a capitol offense, an -- and from time to time they would shoot them in the street. </sentence><sentence id="368">So taking risks was quite a -- a -- well-known, and all of them took risks, and the same risks. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="372">Q: Mim-hm. </sentence><sentence id="373">I was interested in the -- what took place in Germany, and it seemed to me that -- and I think you mentioned this, that Greeks helped the Jews, and they said, "We're all humans." </sentence><sentence id="374">It's common humanity. </sentence><sentence id="375">But I think it's worth you discussing that more, just because something happened in Germany where -- perhaps it was baser instincts of humans were worked on, but they began to see the Jews as not human. </sentence><sentence id="376">And that enabled them to collaborate with the Nazis. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="382">A: Well yes, but remember, it took quite a bit of time, and quite a bit of history for things of that sort to take place. </sentence><sentence id="383">Look at Bulgaria. </sentence><sentence id="384">In 1941 they pass a law, which has about -- magnificent Orwellian title, the law for the protection of the state. </sentence><sentence id="385">But it was almost patterned -- similar to the Nuremberg laws, and -- and most of it's provisions USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0069 16 were clearly anti-Semitic. </sentence><sentence id="386">Or what happened to the Romanian Jews? </sentence><sentence id="387">Half a million people were -- most of them massacred by the Iron guard of Romanians themselves. </sentence><sentence id="388">Or the -- the Jews of Serbia and Croatia? </sentence><sentence id="389">Most of them died of starvation by the Ustasha, th-th-th-th -- the -- the Croatian Fascists. </sentence><sentence id="390">So, the Germans, by no means had - - didn't have, you know, the exclusive patent to brutality and cruelty. </sentence><sentence id="391">They rose it to -- to heights of subtlety and -- and demonic deviousness. [ </sentence><sentence id="392">indecipherable] Salonika Jews, they were telling them that they gonna send them to Krakow, and -- and un- unfortunately, the -- the chief rabbi, who was the leader of the community in Salonika was a -- a gullible, naive, stupid individual, who then tried to reassure the -- th-the Jews of Salonika that their brethren in Krakow were going to take care of them. </sentence><sentence id="393">Of course, the Germans didn't tell them that Krakow had already been totally eliminated. </sentence><sentence id="394">So this kind of a thing hadn't reached Greece or Italy. </sentence><sentence id="395">Maybe -- I don't know, maybe the ethnic character, it would never have taken root, but I have to admit that I often think that we have failed miserably, in the last 50 or 60 years. </sentence><sentence id="396">When I was in the mountains we thought that that was going to be the end of this sort of brutality, and one sees it repeated over, and over again, as if these things didn't happen. </sentence><sentence id="397">So I feel a personal sense of failure, that my generation has done something terribly wrong. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="415">Q: Also, do you think that the role of the Greek church was very critical in being outspoken and saying that we oppose this? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="417">A: Look, le-le-let's put things perspective. </sentence><sentence id="418">There was really one extremely courageous voice, that's was Thamskino's, the archbishop, who not only protested openly, and who I think, perhaps -- I don't know if it was mentioned in the videotaping, he was USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0069 17 threatened by the German general Stupa that he would be shot, and Thamaskino said, "Greek clergy traditionally have been hanged." </sentence><sentence id="419">And he expected Stupa to follow the same tradition, yeah. </sentence><sentence id="420">But look, I know of no really massive -- by that I mean even in t - - in the [indecipherable] of Jews that were saved through the action of the Greek Orthodox church. </sentence><sentence id="421">The -- it is a fact that Thamaskinos, the archbishop said that Jews would find refuge in monasteries, but I really don't know of a single case where Jews survived because they were sheltered in monasteries. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="428">Q: Yeah. </sentence><sentence id="429">There are not remarkable stories of righteous acts, then? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="432">A: Oh, there are -- there are lots, but they -- they -- they are not on the part of an organized body, wha -- be it the church. </sentence><sentence id="433">For example, the then chief of police, Evert, he -- I mean, in the German occupation, he personally issued or gave orders, and faked id -- identity cards were issued to Jews. </sentence><sentence id="434">These -- these were acts of heroism that are -- really were individual. </sentence><sentence id="435">Other than Evert, and this act of Thamaskinos of open protest, all the other Jews who were saved was through the act of, I think, great humanity, first of all, and even at times against a -- a -- you know, a palpable danger on the part of individual Greeks. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="440">Q: Let's go on now to the reunion with your brother Samuel. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="442">A: Well, as you recall from the other tape, beginning in May, or June of *45 as I recall, when the first news of the liberation of concentration camps, then -- and -- and -- and - - and DP's -- displaced persons began to be processed, then there were both -- there were reports both in the Greek newspapers, and also on the radio of rec-recitation of names of the known people who were -- would be returning. </sentence><sentence id="443">And I found this out from </sentence></p><p><sentence id="444"> USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0069 18 a neighbor in the -- in one morning, that she had heard my brother's name. </sentence><sentence id="445">But within really t-two or three days shortly after this news, Sam already had been moved, eventually from Germany to Italy, Bali, and then to Pardres, and then he called on the phone and told us that he was arriving, and I went to the station and -- and there he was. </sentence><sentence id="446">Well, i-i -- first of all, I cou -- I didn't recognize him right away, because he had grown so much in the brief year and a half that -- almost two years since I had see -- we had seen each other. </sentence><sentence id="447">And two things I think, or one thing s -- that struck me was that his behavior, at least outwardly in the days and weeks after his return, to -- at least to me it appeared as if he had not really -- or -- or -- or all these horrors, and all these experiences had not left such a -- a -- a mark on him, because he -- he would laugh, and sing, and -- and I remember he was into -- into jazz, and -- and -- and modern music, and going out with -- with friends. </sentence><sentence id="448">Whereas I had really, in the -- in the -- in the months in the mountains, I had spent a great deal of time just thinking about what had happened, and also looking to a much better situation afterwards, and I had all kinds of plans, and especially about my mother, who was always a very demanding woman, and who I thought was not -- never satisfied with my accomplishments, and that she would be very proud about things that I was going to do. </sentence><sentence id="449">And -- and -- and I had been, I think, much more touched by the events than I could see Sam. </sentence><sentence id="450">Of course, it's very difficult to read what is really deep in -- in somebody's mind, or psyche. </sentence><sentence id="451">But at least outwardly, I was astounded at the resilience of human beings to go through this -- this horror which you would begin to see in newsreels and read progressively in books, that the term Holocaust hadn't even been invented yet. </sentence><sentence id="452">But I was astounded. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="453"> USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0069 19 </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="454">Q: And did you -- were you able to come up with any explanation of how Sam could be coping? </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="455">A: Well, the only explanation was that -- that simply because he was not only young, absolu -- in absolute terms, but that -- that in that period of 13 or 14, there was more elasticity in -- in -- in somebody's mind and character and emotions than there would be -- we only had four years apart -- in any -- in any case, it -- it -- I was much more affected by the -- by the war experience, all the events, than I saw Sam being affected. </sentence><sentence id="456">And that's -- simply surprised me. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="459">Q: Mm-hm. </sentence><sentence id="460">How did you view, subsequently, your decision not to remain in Athens, but to go to the mountains? </sentence><sentence id="461">In a sense it seemed to me you -- your -- you were in hiding, but you were in hiding with the partisans in the mountains. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="465">A: All right. </sentence><sentence id="466">I have -- I have thought about this thing very, very much, but I -- I can really tell you that it was not resolved of a great deal of rational thinking, and weighing of factors for and against. </sentence><sentence id="467">I can only ascribe it to pure instinct, number one, to a aspect of my personality that I simply -- when I thought about it, I re -- re-refused to -- to -- to -- to s -- to s -- to accept the possibility of remaining in hiding for an indeterminate period of time. </sentence><sentence id="468">I had never been away from home, although the Mikalopoulus's were very kind to me, they accepted me, th-th -- Thanasis, my friend, was the only child, the only son, and -- and there was never any hesitation, accepting me as another, but it wasn't really that I felt a stranger, simply that I could not withstand a life of continuous hiding, which then made me an -- and the moment this took root, then what I call personality, I -- I've believe that what is referred to USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0069 20 sometimes, I'm goal oriented. </sentence><sentence id="469">That means I -- once I set a -- a target, then I -- I do whatever I can to -- to -- to reach that -- that outcome. </sentence><sentence id="470">That was what propelled me. </sentence><sentence id="471">The -- it wasn't really based on any other set of weighing of rational pieces of information for or against. </sentence><sentence id="472">That was going to be it, and I was going to a total unknown. </sentence><sentence id="473">I didn't even know where I was going. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="484">Q: Was part of it your wish to be actively resisting? </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="490">Q: And I wonder if you talked with your father about this, but it seems that for those in hiding, they must have been -- have felt imperiled. </sentence><sentence id="491">I mean, when they'd go to sleep at night, you never knew when you wou -- would be denounced. </sentence><sentence id="492">I think of how fearful a time it must have been when the rest of your family, your mother, grandmother, and brothers were taken for questioning. </sentence><sentence id="493">Did you talk to your father about what that stage was like for him? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="498">A: The answer is, we didn't talk, but -- and I again, I surmise that -- l-let's put some dates, so we -- we -- we will know what we are talking about. </sentence><sentence id="499">My mother and brothers were caught towards the end of June, beginning of July of 1944. </sentence><sentence id="500">They were incarcerated in the detention camp of Hithari. </sentence><sentence id="501">And on July 29, they were put on board the last transport that ever left Greece, together with the 1800 Rhodesian Jews. </sentence><sentence id="502">I can imagine that my father learned about that not because anyone went and told him. </sentence><sentence id="503">There was no such contact, but he must have surmised, because they say from a negative side, lack of contact from time to time, my mother, or Sam would go to my father, not so much alone to see him, but also to get money. </sentence><sentence id="504">Also, perhaps -- we didn't USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0069 21 cover that, I don't believe in the video interview, but I know subsequently, that my father changed hiding places three times, because -- you know, the -- you can only maintain a -- a pretense of a visiting relative up to a certain point, all right? </sentence><sentence id="505">So there would come a time when it was time to go. </sentence><sentence id="506">Some -- ok -- times there were 0 -- really ostensible reasons that people would suspect, or even somebody would whisper and say -- they begin to s -- to know that you are Jews, whereupon both the family who were doing the sheltering, as well as the sheltered, knew that it was time to -- to move. </sentence><sentence id="507">So my father moved three times. </sentence><sentence id="508">At the time of, I think, the capture of my mother, grandmother and brothers, he -- it was finally in the last place, the third place, before the liberation. </sentence><sentence id="509">And simply, he must have realized that something had happened, because there were no contact -- there was no contact. </sentence><sentence id="510">Of course, he found out immediately after -- after the liberation. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="525">Q: Mm-hm. </sentence><sentence id="526">What did Sam later tell you about that? </sentence><sentence id="527">I mean, were they -- were they brutally treated, because I -- I think the Germans would want to find out where your father and you were? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="531">A: Yes. </sentence><sentence id="532">Yes, this is a -- a -- really a very painful a-aspect to me, because of what Sam told me. </sentence><sentence id="533">In their interrogation, the beatings that my mother and he were subjected -- not the young one, not the me -- Mekko. </sentence><sentence id="534">And they kept on asking them about my father's and my whereabouts. </sentence><sentence id="535">Of course, in -- in a case for me, she did not know. </sentence><sentence id="536">And then Sam told me that for months, and months, and months, my mother was really destitute, and -- and -- a -- I mean, extremely concerned about what had happened to me. </sentence><sentence id="537">She did not know where I had gone. </sentence><sentence id="538">I'm sure my father told her, "He's gone to the USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0069 22 mountains." </sentence><sentence id="539">But even with my father I didn't com -- there was no way to communicate and -- and send notes from time to time, I'm -- I'm fine. </sentence><sentence id="540">There were no ways of doing that. </sentence><sentence id="541">So the combination of her concern about my fate and whereabouts, and -- and the brutality and the beatings, and -- and the other thing which is so revealing about my mother that Sam mentions in his interview, was her almost foolhardy defiance of the Gestapo. </sentence><sentence id="542">Of cursing them, of calling them criminals, of telling them that their comeuppance would come very soon. </sentence><sentence id="543">This -- I mean, either heroism -- you know, that's un-unthinkable, or foolhardiness, another thing my mother was a foolhardy person. </sentence><sentence id="544">But it's an aspect that's -- is so telling about -- about her. </sentence><sentence id="545">I don't think that's -- I don't even know if my father knew about these events. </sentence><sentence id="546">They didn't come up. </sentence><sentence id="547">I didn't learn about what I just related to you, until I saw Sam's interview with the sh -- the Spielberg foundation. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="566">Q: I think you had mentioned earlier that in that family, that one family council meeting, you had agreed that you would never disclose where each of you were. </sentence><sentence id="567">And it's interesting therefore, your mother's defiance. </sentence><sentence id="568">But I wonder also if you had her determination. </sentence><sentence id="569">She was a strong personality, I think, and it may have been that spirit from her that drove you to go to the mountains. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="574">A: I would like to think that that's the case, but I have to also confess that it was not, again, a conscious thing. </sentence><sentence id="575">In other words, I -- I -- I set my -- I became determined to do it. </sentence><sentence id="576">I even -- I mean, in -- in retrospect -- no, you know from my thi -- the other interview, that I didn't even have an identity card. </sentence><sentence id="577">I -- I -- I manufactured one of them, which really would not pass scrutiny even by a -- an idiot, but fortunately we were not USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0069 23 stopped. </sentence><sentence id="578">S -- the fact that -- that -- that I did it, that I didn't know where I was going to end up, it was something that -- that simply drove me, and if it was a part of -- a similarity in -- in character traits, that's what it is. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="585">Q: What did you later learn from Sam about your younger brother? </sentence><sentence id="586">I'm wondering if your mother protected him? </sentence><sentence id="587">I -- I -- I think he was -- he would be 10 when he died, I think. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="981">A: Yes, and again, since I have no other way to compare it, I would have to ask myself where if I had simply had a room in it, or -- or a place in a dorm, or -- or -- or ina rooming house, would I be able to, al-almost in one fell swoop, be a brother to f -- to 40 or 50 other people? </sentence><sentence id="982">I-It wouldn't have happened. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="994">A: None, none. </sentence><sentence id="995">Of course, there -- there is a similarity, you know, whenever groups of people do similar things together, there are ties and camaraderies, and of course I leave out a big -- I was in the mountains, that's a different story, and participated in an action, and so forth, but in the American army I was not in any battle situation. </sentence><sentence id="996">Because there is a special ties that get formed when people share dangers. </sentence><sentence id="997">In the army, what was shared in the beginning was, during basic training, where you undergo a mixture of both discipline that is -- has some meaning, and a lot of mindless nonsense, which has even particular words in the -- in American army that we will not mention now in -- you know, the tape. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1136">Q: And then after serving in the army, you returned to Bell Labs, and continued to work in this exciting new field? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1138">A: Right. </sentence><sentence id="1139">But i -- i -- i -- i -- a personal aspect of my life is that it -- that just before I went in the army, I got married. </sentence><sentence id="1140">In fact, I lived with my first wife in Colorado Springs, because after basic training in New Jersey, I was then sent to the fifth army's headq -- school -- signal school in Colorado Springs. </sentence><sentence id="1141">And since in the army it's very important -- or even more important what you don't do, than what you do, instead of cleaning pots or -- or -- or being in the trenches, I was teaching in the signal school, reserve officers who were passing every three months, to take refresher courses in radio, telephony, and things like that. </sentence><sentence id="1142">So that's where I spent my -- my two years. </sentence><sentence id="1143">Upon our USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0069 45 return then, to New Jersey, I resumed my work at Bell Laboratories, but then there was a -- arift, and in 1957, I was divorced. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1458">A: But the long and the short of ICC was that after the horses, then we got involved in satellite communications. </sentence><sentence id="1459">And I can tell you -- perhaps you know enough about computers to know that computers really don't care whether you're dealing with blood, or -- or horses. </sentence><sentence id="1460">It's information that you are -- are -- are exchanging, so very -- when we got into satellite communications, we bodily lifted elements of software from USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0069 58 the racetrack systems into satellite communications. </sentence><sentence id="1461">And you tell that to people who don't understand, they say, "Well, how can that be?" </sentence><sentence id="1462">Well, [indecipherable] understand. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2385">A: Well, let me give you an example, all right? </sentence><sentence id="2386">A few years ago, the -- after my first grandson was -- was born, Ian, then I said, all right, there will come a time where, like everyone will -- will ask, wh-what is relativity about? </sentence><sentence id="2387">So -- so I put together a little handmade illustration like a film, that explains, I thought -- explains relativity -- special relativity, not general relativity to a child. </sentence><sentence id="2388">The truth is that it requires a little bit more sophistication, although children grasp things much more quickly, because they don't carry terrible baggage that they have to discard first. </sentence><sentence id="2389">But there are certain aspects of special relativity that one has to be able to at least make a leap of [indecipherable] because one thing to which special relativity is key, namely the velocity of light, we cannot experience it. </sentence><sentence id="2390">You can only think about it, and the -- in fact there have been books that tell you, supposing the velocity of light was not what it is. </sentence><sentence id="2391">Suppose it was on -- an every day kind of speed, like you drive you car -- say speed of light was 30 miles per hour. </sentence><sentence id="2392">What would happen? </sentence><sentence id="2393">You -- you go out in the street, and -- and you see a person in a bicycle, and as he moves, you would see him squashed, because it's one of the lengths in -- in -- in a -- in a direction of travel shrink because that's one of the aspects of -- of special relativity. </sentence><sentence id="2394">But because you can't make -- you know, but -- so you have to be able to imagine this thing, and then -- but I made this film, so "m waiting for a time when my grandsons would begin to ask questions about the relativity, or about mathematics, and either I will make films for them, or -- or tell   USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0069 93 them, or tell them other stories. </sentence><sentence id="2395">Because I remember from childhood I would be fascinated I had certain heroes. </sentence><sentence id="2396">Ulysses was one of them, or Odysseus. </sentence><sentence id="2397">Or -- or Hercules, or Eracles. </sentence><sentence id="2398">Then later on, in the be -- when I started -- another hero was Alexander the Great. </sentence><sentence id="2399">Now in subsequent reading now, I have concluded he was a thug in many respects. </sentence><sentence id="2400">That's the kind of thing that I would like to do. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2418">Q: Yeah. </sentence><sentence id="2419">So it sounds to me as if you -- there may be a market for those ideas. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2422">A: Right, sure. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2424">Q: I was thinking, I think Einstein said he asked the questions only a child would ask, and that ties in with something you said earlier about working in fields where you are free of the sort of strictures sometimes placed by -- </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2425">A: Yes. </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2426">Q: -- certain workplaces, and so on. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2428">A: Yes. </sentence><sentence id="2429">Well, you see, Einstein said that imagination is much, much more important than even very sharp intelligence. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2438">A: Look, I -- I have felt, or I have thought about the Holocaust and what happened to my mother, brothers, the other relatives, and I am absolutely certain that he has    USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0069 94 colored part of my outlook to life, to other people. </sentence><sentence id="2439">But can I make a connection, can I - - was there -- was there a time when I had personal difficulties? </sentence><sentence id="2440">I mentioned to you the divorce. </sentence><sentence id="2441">But I -- I didn't find that -- that a, even if there was a connection, that I would be able to -- to -- to get relief, to -- tying it to God. </sentence><sentence id="2442">So it's one of the unanswered things. </sentence><sentence id="2443">I have been m-more impressed by the works of all of the writers of the Holocaust, there've been quite a few. </sentence><sentence id="2444">But the one that -- that I admire most is Primo Levi. </sentence><sentence id="2445">Number one may be because he was both a -- a scientist and a chemist, as well as a extremely sensitive individual, let alone a -- a wonderful writer. </sentence><sentence id="2446">And you know, although most people now conclude that he committed suicide, rather than dying because of an accident falling down -- downstairs, I have not ever found it ne -- essential, or at least that I could even remotely hypothesize that this particular personal problem is tied -- and as far as looking for help, maybe it could be resolved, but it would not be cause of that, not because of the Holocaust. </sentence></p></dialogue>

the work that I was doing was very rewarding, and I-I -- I think it's very rewarding. </sentence><sentence id="2467">But there were also some byproducts, if I can call them, which really would last a lot longer, because in the process I came into contact with individuals of similar interests. </sentence><sentence id="2468">There's a matter of me corresponding with -- his name is Moses Hasson, he lives in Santiago, Chile, because the people from Monasteer were early settlers in 1916 in a small town called Temooko, in the lake district in Chile. </sentence><sentence id="2469">And -- and was one of the oldest Sephardic as well as monastilee communities in South America. </sentence><sentence id="2470">Then I -- I met -- and I have not met yet in person, a man who wrote a book about Monasteer, his name is Mark Cohen, he lives in San Francisco area. </sentence><sentence id="2471">And it was through Mark's researchers that I found, and I fe -- I have copies now of reasons the s -- s -- the declaration of 16 prominent Mo-Monasteer Jews, among them my great-grandfather Solomon, to establish the alliance frangaise in -- in Monasteer. </sentence><sentence id="2472">Then in 1924, my grandfather, Isaac, whose name I bear, was the president of the Monasteer communit -- the Jewish community of Monasteer, and we have a facsimile of his letter from Yale, in Yale, where's he's addressing the illion israllitany versell in Paris, thanking them for the donations of clothing and money to the Jews of Monasteer who had been severely -- suffered through fierce bombardment during

to being gratifying that -- that I -- I -- | have some lineage of people who gave something to the community, which reminded me of a thing my father would tell me when I was growing up, that human beings, in their infancy, for self preservation are very selfish. </sentence><sentence id="2476">They don't think about anybody else. </sentence><sentence id="2477">Then they go to school, they meet other people, so they begin to share. </sentence><sentence id="2478">When they have a family, they begin to give to others. </sentence><sentence id="2479">But some people stop there. </sentence><sentence id="2480">Now, very few people begin to give to a larger circle, namely their immediate community. </sentence><sentence id="2481">Still fewer give to even larger circle, the country to which they belong. </sentence><sentence id="2482">And finally, extremely few, maybe one in million, give to the entire world. </sentence><sentence id="2483">So the idea of -- of giving back harks back -- and I don't know whether my father was saying it because of the -- the -- the -- the -- the -- the history that he knew of the environment of his own ancestors in community affairs. </sentence><sentence id="2484">So I'm glad that -- that -- that to some extent -- and I also believe that there is a kind of a ledger that somebody keeps, and so I -- I like to make the books balance. </sentence><sentence id="2485">So that's the kind of -- of reward that the work is -- that I've done represents, and then finally that I may be able, both through the video recording, as well as the audio recording, it's -- it's -- sort of relieves me from something else that my children have been asking me insistently to do, to write my memoirs. </sentence><sentence id="2486">So at least I -- if -- if 1 only write certain other parts, and I don't write others, as least there will still be part of the record that they can refer to, if they choose to, after I'm gone. </sentence><sentence
