<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="110">Q: Right. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="112">A: And I was there all during the war. </sentence><sentence id="113">I was with a group of young people, we wer -- we survived the war intact. </sentence><sentence id="114">Not one of us got taken and it was due to the leader of the pack. </sentence><sentence id="115">That was Manfred Greenback, who is still alive and who is still in Amsterdam and -- and who is actually getting a pension from the Dutch government for the work he and his sister, both -- she also s -- also has a kind of a small pension from the Dutch government, for the work that they did during the war. </sentence><sentence id="116">But, as a -- I was in that group with hi -- with them. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="122">Q: But this was a -- this was illegal work that he did at the time, right? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="124">A: This was -- during the war, it was underground work. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="126">Q: Yeah. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="128">A: In the underground. </sentence><sentence id="129">But he definitely -- he and his sister both, definitely saved us. </sentence><sentence id="130">With the -- through their organization, their ability to get the various papers that you needed to survive and to get food stamps and -- and their connections with other groups. </sentence><sentence id="131">And it was like a large spider web of -- of underground activity. </sentence><sentence id="132">They were all connected, one way or the other, even though their beliefs might have been and their reasons for doing the work might have been very different from each other. </sentence><sentence id="133">During the war, they all worked together. </sentence><sentence id="134">And anyway, I sa -- we survived the war and after the war, I was in the ballet with Sonia Gasco. </sentence><sentence id="135">It is a -- the ballet that -- that later became Niederlancer Balletta, the big Dutch ballet in -- in the Stutz-Hober, the big theater in -- in amst -- the state ballet. </sentence><sentence id="136">It was then called the  ontectnetonancedjusetneey for tarher biormatoerabouttfisenecion USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0019 6 Ballet 1945, when -- when I was in it. </sentence><sentence id="137">That was the beginning. </sentence><sentence id="138">And Madame Gasco, who -- who started it, started organizing this last month before the war was ended. </sentence><sentence id="139">We -- we already knew, you know, that the war was going to end and we started practicing and -- and -- and rehearsing and doing all these things. </sentence><sentence id="140">And we were ready -- not quite -- by the time the war was -- was actually ended. </sentence><sentence id="141">And I -- I worked with her and I danced with the ballet and I had various other jobs. </sentence><sentence id="142">I also did photography. </sentence><sentence id="143">I studied photography with a friend of my mother's, who had also survived the war and had actually sort of held her hand over my head, even though I didn't even know it. </sentence><sentence id="144">But she had sort of protected me from various things that went on during the war. </sentence><sentence id="145">So it's all very complicated, but -- but it -- that's how it was. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="166">Q: Ca-Can you give me an example? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="168">A: Well, during the war, I was -- I was dancing. </sentence><sentence id="169">| -- I -- I think I tell all that on the -- on the other tape. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="178">Q: No, I just meant about the way this woman was -- was protecting you. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="180">A: Well, that's right, she was protecting me in the sense that they decided that some of the things I was during -- doing during the war, was endangering myself. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="182">Q: I see. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="184">  ontectnetonancedjusetneey for tarher biormatoerabouttfisenecion </sentence></p><p><sentence id="185"> USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0019 7 </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="186">A: And she saw to it that I had to stop doing them. </sentence><sentence id="187">She never talked to me, but she talked to the people who I'm do -- I was doing it with and they managed to -- without letting me know why -- to dissuade me from continuing what I was doing. </sentence><sentence id="188">And so in that sense, I didn't know til after the war that it was her -- she who had done this. </sentence><sentence id="189">It was very interesting. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="190">So, as I was saying, it was a spider web and -- and it was extended to me, I was part of it and they took care of me. </sentence><sentence id="191">So, even though I didn't know it. </sentence><sentence id="192">But anyway -- so, after the war, I was dancing with ga -- Sonia Gasco and friends of my parents started writing letters to our old address and -- and saying, "Well, what happened to your family? </sentence><sentence id="193">What happened?" </sentence><sentence id="194">You know, and these were people all over the world. </sentence><sentence id="195">I mean Australia and South America and America -- you know, was North America. </sentence><sentence id="196">Canada, every -- letters came from all over the world. </sentence><sentence id="197">And I went back to our old apartment, which was the place they all wrote to. </sentence><sentence id="198">And I told the lady where I was and she -- she forwarded all the mail. </sentence><sentence id="199">When I saw them all -- all these letters, I ch -- answered only the ones that I could remember, because many of these peop -- they were all friends of my parents, not of mine. </sentence><sentence id="200">And some of them I didn't remember and some of them I did. </sentence><sentence id="201">And the one I remembered best, was Dr. Kalinoffsky's family, because in Berlin we used to have gymnastics with their two daughters, they had two daughters, Hilda and Lothar Kalinoffsky. </sentence><sentence id="202">And we had gymnastics with them in Berlin and when we came to Holland, they had gone -- he was a psychiatrist in Berlin and they had gone to Rome. </sentence><sentence id="203">And he had to study again, he got a degree in Rome. </sentence><sentence id="204">And he was a psychiatrist in Rome. </sentence><sentence id="205">And then, when a -- when he felt like things weren't going so well in Italy, he decided to go to the United States. </sentence><sentence id="206">He went to the United States with his family and </sentence></p><p><sentence id="207">  USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0019 8 he had to do a third degree -- the third -- you know, he got -- he got his doctorate in psychiatry in New York. </sentence><sentence id="208">And that's where he was, in New York. </sentence><sentence id="209">So when I got their letter, I wrote. </sentence><sentence id="210">And it turned out that he had been asked to help establish the Department of Psychiatry at the free University of Berlin. </sentence><sentence id="211">I think it's in Dallem. </sentence><sentence id="212">It's in Dallem or wherever it is. </sentence><sentence id="213">It's in -- near Berlin -- in Berlin. </sentence><sentence id="214">And so h-he decided he was going to go via Amsterdam and -- to Berlin, from -- from the in -- from New York. </sentence><sentence id="215">So he came by and he said, "Come to the United States. </sentence><sentence id="216">Come -- we take care of it, come." </sentence><sentence id="217">You know? </sentence><sentence id="218">Well, I was doing very well at that time and I kept saying, "No, I -- I can't make up my mind." </sentence><sentence id="219">He kept saying, "Look, your parents aren't going to come back and --" as I'm telling on the other tape, I kept thinking, "Yes, maybe they will come back, and my sister. </sentence><sentence id="220">Somebody will show up, you know, they will be all r -- somebody will come, I can't come right away." </sentence><sentence id="221">So I postponed and postponed. </sentence><sentence id="222">Finally, in 1947, he ca -- I mean, he kept coming, every three, four months, when he had to go to Berlin, and say, "Come, come, come." </sentence><sentence id="223">And he sent me an affidavit. </sentence><sentence id="224">And I got a call from the American embassy in Rotterdam and they were saying, "Well, do you want to come, or don't you want to come? </sentence><sentence id="225">You got plenty of people who want to come, I mean, what's going on there?" </sentence><sentence id="226">And so I took a deep breath and I went. </sentence><sentence id="227">It was terribly hard. </sentence><sentence id="228">I mean, I had a boyfriend and I had -- you know, I was -- I was in the ballet, I was doing well and I was getting up there and it was just terribly hard to leave. </sentence><sentence id="229">But on the other hand, I really -- I didn't see a real future and I -- I thought, well, you know, my parents were killed, my sister was gone, my grandmother was gone, my -- I had family. </sentence><sentence id="230">I had a lot of family still, my mother's family there. </sentence><sentence id="231">And even a cousin of my father's, Heinz    </sentence></p><p><sentence id="232"> USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0019 9 Kemfer was still there and -- in Holland. </sentence><sentence id="233">And -- but it wasn't really my own, you know? </sentence><sentence id="234">It wasn't close enough and -- so many changes had taken place, and I should make a change. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="235">And it doesn't have to be forever, I kept taying -- saying to myself. </sentence><sentence id="236">You know, I mean, after all, I could come back and you know, if I -- if I really didn't like it, you know, I could come back and -- </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="237">Q: And what was your immediate plan? </sentence><sentence id="238">What would you be going when you got here? </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="239">A: Well, that -- tha -- I didn't even think about that because he's -- well, I thought I was going to dance, actually. </sentence><sentence id="240">Yes, I thought I was going to dance. </sentence><sentence id="241">Well, it turned out that they lived on Long Island. </sentence><sentence id="242">And I -- I'm having trouble remembering the town. </sentence><sentence id="243">I know that the second house that they had was -- oh yeah, I know, it was Babylon, I think. </sentence><sentence id="244">I think it was Babylon, but I'm not sure. </sentence><sentence id="245">The second place they lived was Brightwaters. </sentence><sentence id="246">They moved pretty soon after I had came, they had -- they moved to Brightwaters and that's -- you know, it is a ways from New York. </sentence><sentence id="247">It -- you have to take the Long Island railroad. </sentence><sentence id="248">And as I found out pretty soon, you know, it was difficult. </sentence><sentence id="249">I had to be in New York for the dance -- for my classes at the American School of Ballet and it was hard to get to and fro -- get the timing right. </sentence><sentence id="250">I could never date, because I -- the train came -- you know, the train -- I had to take a certain train back. </sentence><sentence id="251">And it was just too complicated t-to -- to live out on the island if you wanted to be in New York, which I did. </sentence><sentence id="252">And so I met a girl, Ellen Crooks, I met her in -- at the balle -- in the ballet class, at the American School of Ballet. </sentence><sentence id="253">And she was born and raised in Greenwich Village and her mother had a spare apartment. </sentence><sentence id="254">And so she and I moved in together to -- in Greenwich Village. </sentence><sentence id="255">And it was wonderful to have her, because I mean, USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0019 10 she was -- she knew every little corner of -- of Greenwich Village, having been raised there. </sentence><sentence id="256">And she was very nice girl -- very good girl and -- and we -- we had -- we lived together. </sentence><sentence id="257">We finally took another -- a girl -- a woman -- a girl, I guess we were then. </sentence><sentence id="258">And we lived there together and where we lived was on Third Street, where now is the library of New York University, the law library of the uni -- and at the time, they were already trying to empty the buildings, you know, so there were quite a lot of empty apartments, people whose lease had run out and they weren't replacing these people, because they wanted to empty the buildings, but they had to go to the end of people's contract. </sentence><sentence id="259">And -- and her mother's contract was very long. </sentence><sentence id="260">So we were just -- there were a few people left in the building, so it was -- got quite creepy, because there were many, you know, people kem -- kept sleeping up on the stairs, you know, bums and -- and hobos and whatever you have there. </sentence><sentence id="261">And it was quite an exciting time in Greenwich Village. </sentence><sentence id="262">It was still a little bit of the old Greenwich Village, you know, that you -- that you hear about. </sentence><sentence id="263">Many Italians -- downstairs was a li -- a small Italian restaurant, that was where our telephone was. </sentence><sentence id="264">He -- he would keep message and get messages for us and we could, you know, go and get the messages and we could make calls there. </sentence><sentence id="265">And many, many a time. </sentence><sentence id="266">So -- but it was very nice. </sentence><sentence id="267">I mean, it was exciting, scary and nice. </sentence><sentence id="268">I had to learn how to ride those subways. </sentence><sentence id="269">I mean, I came out of Amsterdam, after the war and it was -- I mean, when I got here with the clothes that I thought were very fancy -- I had taken my mother's -- I had some of my mother's clothes in Holland and I had them remade for the United States. </sentence><sentence id="270">Well I got to the United States and I looked like a spook, compared to the other people in the United States. </sentence><sentence id="271">It was -- there was something going on  USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0019 11 called the new look. </sentence><sentence id="272">Remember, they wore these -- these very -- these skirts with many tuffles, sort of wide with -- with underskirts underneath, sticking out a little bit on the -- on the borders and I mean I looked absolutely -- what I thought was high elegance, I looked weird, highly weird. </sentence><sentence id="273">So the first day that we were there, Mrs. Kalinoffsky took me into New York, went to Macy's and she got me outfitted. </sentence><sentence id="274">I got a new coat -- I'll never forget the coat. </sentence><sentence id="275">These kind of things, you remember. </sentence></p></dialogue>
