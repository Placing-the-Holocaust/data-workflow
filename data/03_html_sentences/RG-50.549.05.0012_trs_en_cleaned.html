<body><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1">A: I think so, but I wouldn't know for sure. </sentence><sentence id="2">In Amsterdam I would say that was not necessarily the case. </sentence><sentence id="3">But I really don't remember, I remember only really family from Germany. </sentence><sentence id="4">I don't remember any children from school or acquaintances of my parents. </sentence><sentence id="5">For that matter I wouldn't know what their religion was. </sentence><sentence id="6">So, I really can't answer. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="13">Q: And then another question from a different time. </sentence><sentence id="14">When you were living in Amsterdam, I believe you mentioned in the first interview that before your family was actually caught in a round-up and deported to Westerbork, you had been caught in another round-up and somehow managed to get out. </sentence><sentence id="15">Now that wasn't clear to me from the first interview what had happened during that time. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="19">A: I don't remember whether I was picked up at home or off the street and taken to a collection point where we were supposed to have been deported somewhere. </sentence><sentence id="20">And I walked away from it, and wasn't challenged in the process and got back home. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="23">Q: So it was just you? </sentence><sentence id="24">It wasn't members of your family? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="27">A: I don't know. </sentence><sentence id="28">I think it was just me, that's right. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="31">Q: And what happened the second time when your whole family was deported? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="33">A: The second time they, as they always did, they came in the middle of the night and you had five minutes to get dressed and get your, your bags were always packed because you knew it could happen. </sentence><sentence id="34">And you were hauled off in a truck along with other people, taken to the railroad station. </sentence><sentence id="35">Put on a train not knowing where to. </sentence><sentence id="36">And then I went to Westerbork, which was the transit camp that the Germans had established; it's in the eastern part of Holland near Zwolle. </sentence><sentence id="37">And we were held there for about six months. </sentence><sentence id="38">I don't think there were any other deportations. </sentence><sentence id="39">There may have been one or two trains before we were hauled out. </sentence><sentence id="40">And I think the general impression was that they were going to go to Theresienstadt. </sentence><sentence id="41">Why I don't know. </sentence><sentence id="42">But... never heard of Belsen before. </sentence><sentence id="43">As a matter of fact, we were one of the earliest ones in there. </sentence><sentence id="44">Belsen was... I'm not sure if it was on a previous tape or not. </sentence><sentence id="45">When we got there, of course it was a very large facility. </sentence><sentence id="46">Part of it was a Russian POW camp. </sentence><sentence id="47">But obviously designed for officers, because they had little cabins and gravel walks between them and that sort of thing. </sentence><sentence id="48">And then there were two sections to the non-POW prisoners. </sentence><sentence id="49">One was for, called criminals and the second section was for the Jews. </sentence><sentence id="50">And as they started to fill up the Jewish section there were a number of trainfuls of Jews from Holland, a lot of Hungarians, French women. </sentence><sentence id="51">They were the wives of officers who were POW's from the French Army. </sentence><sentence id="52">And then after the, in "44, after the invasion of Italy, a lot of Libyan Jews that Rommel had shipped off to Italy and they had been held in camps in Italy and apparently under Red Cross supervision. </sentence><sentence id="53">They all had British uniforms and heavy British, woolen coats and the like, and lots of good food. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="75">Q: Yeah, you did talk some about that in the first interview. </sentence><sentence id="76">When you were heading towards Westerbork, did you know anything about Westerbork before you arrived? </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="90">Q: Did you have any idea at the time of what had started to happen to Jews? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="92">A: No, no. </sentence><sentence id="93">They always said we'd be relocating in a work camp or whatever. </sentence><sentence id="94">Or vague promises of exchanging for money, that relatives, particularly in America could buy you and so forth. </sentence><sentence id="95">But no, nobody had any inkling of what lay ahead in terms of the violence. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="100">Q: And you talked in some detail about what you remembered of your time in Westerbork and that you had been, you had contracted polio. </sentence><sentence id="101">Had you really recovered from the symptoms of that by the time that you were deported to Bergen-Belsen? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="104">A: I would say so. </sentence><sentence id="105">The problem that I had were primarily with the right knee and I still have some problems with that knee. </sentence><sentence id="106">But I was spared the recurrence that apparently happened to older people when it was discovered in the last ten or 15 years or so. </sentence><sentence id="107">It must have been a fairly mild case even though polio, of course back then was rampant. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="112">Q: Tell me if, I have an impression, and tell me if it's correct. </sentence><sentence id="113">I have the impression that your family was fairly close-knit and that you're weren't necessarily forming strong bonds with other people outside of your family. </sentence><sentence id="114">Is that correct? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="118">A: Yeah, I think so. </sentence><sentence id="119">I don't think anybody formed any bonds at all. </sentence><sentence id="120">It was a matter of survival and I don't mean to imply that you tried it at the expense of somebody else. </sentence><sentence id="121">But once we realized, I'm not sure we really realized, but when it became a matter of trying to survive, you didn't and a fellow that was in the bunk either with you or next to you may not wake up in the morning. </sentence><sentence id="122">Nobody really tried to get attached to anybody else. </sentence><sentence id="123">You didn't form any bonds other than to, you didn't try to antagonize anybody, but there wasn't any real friendships or relationships of any kind. </sentence><sentence id="124">Well, there really wasn't much time either. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="132">Q: Do you remember, was there kind of a gradual sense of deepening horror and insecurity or was there a moment when you really, that you remember having been really, realized what was happening? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="134">A: No, it was, that was, in a way the tragedy was that it was a gradual tightening of the noose, so to speak, in that... I remember the first two days in Belsen, there was so much food we couldn't eat it. </sentence><sentence id="135">There was no nutrition, but a liter of soup, even if it was only a liter of warm water with nothing in it. </sentence><sentence id="136">You're not used to drinking a liter of volume, a quart. </sentence><sentence id="137">It took two days and you ate it all and were hungry. </sentence><sentence id="138">And then the amount of food that you got kept getting less and less. </sentence><sentence id="139">And initially there were, the guards kept changing constantly and surprisingly they kept getting more and more vicious rather than less so. </sentence><sentence id="140">The last group which maybe was there for a year, year and a half, I don't recall for sure for how long, were World War One veterans who were too old or too feeble or had been wounded. </sentence><sentence id="141">But they were not suitable for frontline service in the German Army. </sentence><sentence id="142">And you would think that they would be not so hateful. </sentence><sentence id="143">And they weren't maybe the first 4 This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="144">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="145"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection USHMM Archives RG-50.549.05*0012 5 week, but they got there very quickly, got to be pretty vicious. </sentence><sentence id="146">And I'm not sure whether they were told to or it was a natural progression as the sensitivities wore off. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="161">Q: So even as a young child you grew somehow hardened to this experience would you say? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="163">A: Well you had to if you wanted to survive. </sentence><sentence id="164">You couldn't, it wasn't that you wouldn't help somebody up if they had fallen, but you had to be very careful. </sentence><sentence id="165">Yes, you probably were...maybe more encapsulated than hardened. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="170">Q: Do you remember private conversations that you were able to have with your family? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="172">A: None, absolutely none. </sentence><sentence id="173">I don't really remember very much. </sentence><sentence id="174">You remember the weird things but not the everyday. </sentence><sentence id="175">And I'm sure that others would have remembered something totally different that I don't even remember happening. </sentence><sentence id="176">Like that Easter Sunday, the fighter attack. </sentence><sentence id="177">Well, because of it, one of the barracks that got shot up was the warehouse. </sentence><sentence id="178">And one thing the Germans had were cans of beef in its own juice. </sentence><sentence id="179">And apparently some of those got bullet-riddled so they had to use them right away. </sentence><sentence id="180">For a couple of days we actually got food, but then they made up for it for a long time with nothing, because the food was gone again. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="190">Q: Do you remember the day that you were deported from Westerbork to Bergen-Belsen? </sentence><sentence id="191">Anything about that? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="194">A: No, nothing in particular. </sentence><sentence id="195">They, I guess in the afternoon the train was pushed into, the empty train was pushed into the compound. </sentence><sentence id="196">It was passenger cars. </sentence><sentence id="197">Then they posted names, they called them out and you had to be there whenever, an hour or so later. </sentence><sentence id="198">Got on the train, nobody knew where it was going to go. </sentence><sentence id="199">Supposedly it was just a relocation and they always promised you something better. </sentence><sentence id="200">Of course it never was. </sentence><sentence id="201">But particularly initially you didn't know. </sentence><sentence id="202">And I guess they had to, that I'm sure explains why there was no really massive resistance. </sentence><sentence id="203">If you knew you were going to go to the gas chamber you may as well try and fight it. </sentence><sentence id="204">So you get shot on the spot. </sentence><sentence id="205">I think that's why there's, the general docility of the deportees. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="218">Q: Had transports been leaving from Westerbork for some time before yours left? </sentence><sentence id="219">In other words, were you... </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="222">A: We were not the first ones, but yes, but I don't know whether we were the third or fifth or tenth. </sentence><sentence id="223">But yes, there had been others. </sentence><sentence id="224">And of course you never got any feedback in terms of where they went or how they were treated. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="228">Q: So, you may have had the sense then that at any point your name could be called and you'd be getting on the... </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="230">A: Yes, yes, I think so. </sentence><sentence id="231">Yeah, I think it was generally recognized that Westerbork was a transit camp and not a permanent installation. </sentence><sentence id="232">So, I think so. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="236">Q: And about your time in Westerbork, I'm sorry, in Bergen-Belsen. </sentence><sentence id="237">You were there relatively early as you just mentioned. </sentence><sentence id="238">And I wondered if in the long term you feel that having been there 5 </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="264">Q: To what extent did you have contact with the other members of your family while you were in Belsen? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="266">A: We saw them almost every day. </sentence><sentence id="267">My dad and my brother and I, we were in the same barrack. </sentence><sentence id="268">At night the men and the women were separated, but during the day they could mingle freely if you were there. </sentence><sentence id="269">We all were in work details. </sentence><sentence id="270">My mother worked in the, what do you call it?Hospital, there was no hospital, so the infirmary. </sentence><sentence id="271">So, she physically stayed inside the camp. </sentence><sentence id="272">My dad worked, I think he worked the whole time on the shoe disassembly detail. </sentence><sentence id="273">I was on it for a little while before they shipped me outside to work details outside. </sentence><sentence id="274">My brother was working outside the camp too, I think. </sentence><sentence id="275">But I don't remember where, what details he was assigned to. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="287">Q: And what about, you mentioned having to steal food in order to survive. </sentence><sentence id="288">Was that something that the newer prisoners maybe wouldn't have known how to do or that you kind of eventually learned? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="291">A: Well (laughs)... no, I think everybody... you didn't steal from each other, generally. </sentence><sentence id="292">Even though it was a matter of survival. </sentence><sentence id="293">I mentioned the Libyans who came from Italy. </sentence><sentence id="294">They came with humongous quantities of food. </sentence><sentence id="295">And we had the opportunity to steal some of it. </sentence><sentence id="296">And we actually buried it between the tracks so we could bring it back slowly. </sentence><sentence id="297">The other thing is being on the outside you were, not always, but sometimes you were patted down, and so you couldn't have anything on your body that didn't belong to you. </sentence><sentence id="298">They must have had a bad storm some years prior to establishing the camp. </sentence><sentence id="299">Bergen-Belsen was inside a military training camp, similar to Fort Knox. </sentence><sentence id="300">A lot of trees had been, had fallen over in this storm or storms. </sentence><sentence id="301">And they had cut the trees and hauled them off, but there were the roots, you know, standing up. </sentence><sentence id="302">And for a number of months I worked in the woods digging up those tree stumps, which were then, were hauled into... once a week they came out with the horse-drawn wagons and we had to load those tree stumps that we had dug up on it and they were hauled in. </sentence><sentence id="303">There was another detail inside the camp that was chopping them up into firewood. </sentence><sentence id="304">That's the one I was assigned to the day of that air attack. </sentence><sentence id="305">There were blueberries growing in the woods and one, of course we ate as much as we could, but also we all had, like a bag that was tied to your belt inside your pants. </sentence><sentence id="306">So you could pick berries and bring them in for the family to eat. </sentence><sentence id="307">So there was that and then, of course, if we could we stole the food from the guards. [ </sentence><sentence id="308">Laughing.] </sentence><sentence id="309">Boy, they'd take a whipping. </sentence><sentence id="310">They 6 This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="311">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="312"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection USHMM Archives RG-50.549.05*0012 7 would get their food and most of the time if they didn't finish it, it just sat there. </sentence><sentence id="313">And if somebody, we got a chance, we would try and get those cans and eat it. </sentence><sentence id="314">But apparently one day we ate them before they had eaten and so we got a pretty good whipping for that. </sentence><sentence id="315">It was probably worth it. </sentence><sentence id="316">It was good food. </sentence><sentence id="317">They didn't eat too bad. </sentence><sentence id="318">They got pretty decent food. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="348">Q: Was there a real uniformity of cruelty among the guards or were any of them kind at all to you? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="350">A: There was one sergeant, who the rumor had it later on that he was a spy for the British, he seemed to be more of a... I wouldn't want to call him humane, but had a better sense of humor. </sentence><sentence id="351">And some individual guards were exceedingly cruel and would use any excuse to either kick you or club you with a rifle or shoot you, shoot at you. </sentence><sentence id="352">There was one incident that I recall where one of the guards was giving one of the men, this was in the woods, gave him hell. </sentence><sentence id="353">And he responded in Dutch, "Man, you're crazy." </sentence><sentence id="354">And it turned out to be a Dutchman, the SS guy was a Dutchman, and boy did he beat the living daylights out of him, out of the prisoner. </sentence><sentence id="355">And then when we came back that evening, the sergeant was there and he, we all had to stand at attention. </sentence><sentence id="356">And he demanded to know if anything had happened and this turkey said, "Yes sergeant, this man said I'm crazy." </sentence><sentence id="357">The sergeant said, "That man was right, detail dismissed." </sentence><sentence id="358">We got sent on. </sentence><sentence id="359">But it varied. </sentence><sentence id="360">Some of them would turn their back and just did their job. </sentence><sentence id="361">But they constantly changed. </sentence><sentence id="362">You never knew. </sentence><sentence id="363">You never spoke to any of them. </sentence><sentence id="364">Some of them would drop a cigarette butt and walk away. </sentence><sentence id="365">Others would drop the cigarette butt and wait for you to, try to pick it up and then step on your fingers. </sentence><sentence id="366">You never knew. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="384">Q: What about friendships in Belsen? </sentence><sentence id="385">Did you, was it still pretty much each one for his own? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="388">A: Yeah, you didn't have time for friendships. </sentence><sentence id="389">You tried to sleep as long as you could in the mornings. </sentence><sentence id="390">You had a few minutes to wash your face and get dressed and stand at reveille, that's not the right word. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="394">Q: Roll call? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="396">A: Roll call, thank you. </sentence><sentence id="397">Until they got done, depends on how they felt whether they got done or not. </sentence><sentence id="398">And then you went to wherever your work assignment was and then when you came back at night, there could have been another roll call before or after and you may have got something to eat and you went straight to bed. </sentence><sentence id="399">There was never any time to talk to anybody, unless somebody you worked with, the guard had a back turned you could talk to each other. </sentence><sentence id="400">But most of the time you couldn't. </sentence><sentence id="401">They wouldn't let you. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="408">Q: So was it seven days a week, every day the same? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="410">A: Oh yes, pretty much so. </sentence><sentence id="411">Except they got better food on Sundays. </sentence><sentence id="412">They got three cans instead of two. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="416">Q: Did you have any sense of time or way to keep track of time? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="418">A: Yeah, you knew pretty much what day of the week it was, what time of day it was, I'm not sure. </sentence><sentence id="419">I don't think anybody had watches. </sentence><sentence id="420">Because at noon time they would bring the food out to 7 This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="421">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="422"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection USHMM Archives RG-50.549.05*0012 8 where you were working. </sentence><sentence id="423">We may get five or ten minutes to eat and that was it. </sentence><sentence id="424">And sunrise and sunset, but other than that whether it was ten of eleven or ten of twelve, nobody cared whether you knew it or not. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="433">Q: You mentioned that you were transferred after you were chopping the stumps into the detail that was meeting the rail cars as they were coming in, and you said something about the Libyan Jews. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="435">I was wondering if you, were you there when the French women prisoners were coming in? </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="436">A: No, I think they were already in the camp. </sentence><sentence id="437">Trains came and went all the time, not only with prisoners, but also soldiers. </sentence><sentence id="438">They used the same railroad station. </sentence><sentence id="439">Occasionally we would meet POW's. </sentence><sentence id="440">The Americans always were good. </sentence><sentence id="441">They would throw us packs of Camels where we could get them. </sentence><sentence id="442">But I don't remember when the French women came. </sentence><sentence id="443">There were only two hundred of them, so they may have come in a group with others. </sentence><sentence id="444">Probably since very few of them died, I would think they probably came fairly late. </sentence><sentence id="445">But I just don't remember. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="480">A: Yeah, later on they brought in women from Auschwitz. </sentence><sentence id="481">And I have to back up here a minute. </sentence><sentence id="482">There was an area where they had a huge circus tent, was set up. </sentence><sentence id="483">That's where they had the shoes. </sentence><sentence id="484">Apparently, I don't know over how long or what, the Germans had collected shoes for recycling or for donations or whatever the reason they gave to collect them. </sentence><sentence id="485">And then also there were a lot of military boots in there since many of them had bullet holes in them or shrapnel holes apparently from either wounded or dead soldiers. </sentence><sentence id="486">And what one of the big, quote, "industries" was, was separating the upper leather from the soles and heels and then separate the leather from the rubber heels and/or soles. </sentence><sentence id="487">And that was done in that big tent. </sentence><sentence id="488">And then there was a... the leather soles, I guess, was what they couldn't reuse. </sentence><sentence id="489">And so they were stacked up in a humongous pile that was on the main drag and kept getting higher and higher. </sentence><sentence id="490">People, that was my first assignment was working on that. </sentence><sentence id="491">You had a wheelbarrow hauling those, and then you had to stack them so the whole thing wouldn't just fall over. </sentence><sentence id="492">And they emptied that, emptied that tent of all the shoes, and they started to bring in women and they established a separate woman's camp. </sentence><sentence id="493">And it turned out that one of the first groups in there included the wife, who had been with us, of a fellow. </sentence><sentence id="494">She had worked in the kitchen and she got caught taking some food to try to give to her husband. </sentence><sentence id="495">And first they shipped her to, I guess to Liineburg, to jail. </sentence><sentence id="496">And she was there in jail for a while and the police apparently were trying to protect her from the Gestapo, but couldn't. </sentence><sentence id="497">And ultimately she was shipped to Auschwitz. </sentence><sentence id="498">But the police had warned her about Auschwitz and so as she arrived she managed to walk from the incoming group to an outgoing group which happened to come to Belsen. </sentence><sentence id="499">And so she was back and she was in that group. </sentence><sentence id="500">And she went to the fence and hollered at somebody to tell her husband that she was back by way of Auschwitz. </sentence><sentence id="501">That's how we knew that group had come from Auschwitz. </sentence><sentence id="502">You could talk to them usually across the fence as long as you didn't get too close to the fence. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="526">Q: Were you mostly speaking in German while you lived in Belsen? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="528">A: Dutch. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="530">Q: Did you use your German in speaking with any of the camp guards? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="532">A: No, you never spoke to the camp guards. </sentence><sentence id="533">And I'm not so sure I still could speak German back then. </sentence><sentence id="534">But no. </sentence><sentence id="535">They may give you an order, but that was it. </sentence><sentence id="536">You never talked to them. </sentence><sentence id="537">There was no conversation at all. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="544">Q: Okay, moving to the time when you were, when you were shipped out of Belsen again, you described that time in the first interview and how you had kind of gone on a two-week tour of Germany. </sentence><sentence id="545">And seen Berlin completely destroyed. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="556">Q: I thought maybe we could just pick up with that time. </sentence><sentence id="557">And I wondered if you could tell a little bit more about, well the time of liberation, encountering the Russian soldiers. </sentence><sentence id="558">And you mentioned how they were sharing bread and so forth. </sentence><sentence id="559">Were they, the Russians have... had a reputation for being sometimes vicious even with the people that they liberated. </sentence><sentence id="560">Did you witness any of that? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="566">A: No. </sentence><sentence id="567">Initially we woke up because of... we were on the train still and the train was stopped. </sentence><sentence id="568">And all kinds of noises, and here were the Russian Cossacks just the way they were pictured, you know, in their furs and horseback and rifles slung over their shoulders. </sentence><sentence id="569">And we had learned, like you said, the one word in Russian, chleb (ph), which is bread. </sentence><sentence id="570">And they let us off, and so we went on into town. </sentence><sentence id="571">Then there must have been some discussion about where to go and whoever, they told us just to go and if you need to, throw the Germans out. </sentence><sentence id="572">And we happened to go into a fairly large house along with some others, who... the woman claimed they were in the Nazis, but her husband was a minister. </sentence><sentence id="573">And he sure was in the SS. </sentence><sentence id="574">And so we didn't have any compunction about bullying them. </sentence><sentence id="575">Somebody, apparently there must have been some people who spoke Yiddish or either the Russian soldiers spoke Yiddish or they spoke Russian. </sentence><sentence id="576">I remember somebody said something about food, and so one of the Russians just pulled out a gun and shot a cow and said help yourself. </sentence><sentence id="577">One of the French women recognized the opportunity and went with the frontline unit. </sentence><sentence id="578">And of course, that morning crossed the Elbe River into the American part of Germany and managed to get back to Paris, which of course had been liberated the year before. </sentence><sentence id="579">And put an ad in the Paris paper, those who were looking for their wives, and I don't know whether she mentioned names or it was a specific group. </sentence><sentence id="580">And they responded. </sentence><sentence id="581">Many of them were of course in the French Army. </sentence><sentence id="582">And so they got the American Army to send two of those two and a half ton trucks over to come and get them. </sentence><sentence id="583">And of course, everybody wanted to go. </sentence><sentence id="584">And they promised they'd be back and they did. </sentence><sentence id="585">I guess in the euphoria, you know, the war was over by that time. </sentence><sentence id="586">I think we were in Tribitz (ph) for about six weeks. </sentence><sentence id="587">All of the people that were still alive from that train, there were about a thousand of them, were evacuated by the Americans and taken to Leipzig, where they had a DP camp. </sentence><sentence id="588">And the Russians let the trucks come in and get them. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="612">Q: What kind of condition were you in at the time of liberation? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="614">A: Barely alive if you can even count that. </sentence><sentence id="615">We had to be very careful. </sentence><sentence id="616">Many people died because they ate things that they couldn't digest. </sentence><sentence id="617">Their digestive system was so severely weakened or disturbed that a glass of milk would kill you. </sentence><sentence id="618">You just couldn't tolerate that sort of thing. </sentence><sentence id="619">You had to be very careful that you ate only a little bit and a little bit. </sentence><sentence id="620">And of course a little bit was always more than what we had had for a long time. </sentence><sentence id="621">So that was important that you didn't... I remember getting a hold, we heard that nearby was a Army depot, food depot, and we went there. </sentence><sentence id="622">And sure enough there was. </sentence><sentence id="623">And I got some... I'm not sure I got cans or an open bucket of condensed milk, you know, had a lot of sugar in it. </sentence><sentence id="624">And we just couldn't eat it, not for a while. </sentence><sentence id="625">Because we couldn't digest it, it was that rich. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="648">Q: I think you mentioned how much you weighed, did you? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="650">A: Well when I got back to Amsterdam I weighed 78 pounds. </sentence><sentence id="651">So I don't know how much I weighed then, maybe fifty or sixty, strictly skin over bones. </sentence><sentence id="652">If I would have gotten a haircut, I would have taken a pound off.

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="658">Q: They didn't shave your head while you were in Belsen? </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="676">Q: Was that a particularly emotionally charged...? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="678">A: Oh sure. </sentence><sentence id="679">Oh absolutely, joyous. </sentence><sentence id="680">Now you had an opportunity, you might live. </sentence><sentence id="681">Might actually see 1946. </sentence><sentence id="682">Definitely. </sentence><sentence id="683">Yeah, everybody... I'm digressing, but I didn't know anybody on that train. </sentence><sentence id="684">I had never run into anybody who was, for that matter, never ran into anybody who was at Belsen. </sentence><sentence id="685">And I guess it's three years ago now. </sentence><sentence id="686">We were, we took a trip, first grand circle tour we ever took. </sentence><sentence id="687">It was a river cruise from Vienna to Amsterdam. </sentence><sentence id="688">It was the first time that I was back in Germany and I wasn't sure whether I could tolerate it or not. </sentence><sentence id="689">We decided on this trip because I could just stay on the boat. </sentence><sentence id="690">Didn't have to go on land where I would have to be in contact with any Germans. </sentence><sentence id="691">But one night we're having dinner with two ladies. </sentence><sentence id="692">One of whom, very interesting woman--she was the one who introduced the Lamaze method to the United States-- and her cousin. </sentence><sentence id="693">And somehow the other woman was telling us that her daughter was taking her daughter, the woman's grandchild, to Europe, Amsterdam. </sentence><sentence id="694">They had discussed Anne Frank in class and she wanted to see the Anne Frank house. </sentence><sentence id="695">And she said, "I told my daughter there's always long lines at the Anne Frank house and if you can't get in, go next door, that's where your father was hidden during the war." </sentence><sentence id="696">And I said to her, "Oh, were you in Amsterdam during the war?" </sentence><sentence id="697">And she said yes she was, but her two sisters both got found out. </sentence><sentence id="698">They all had gone into hiding. </sentence><sentence id="699">And they ended up in Belsen. </sentence><sentence id="700">I said, "Oh, that's where I was. </sentence><sentence id="701">I never met anybody from Belsen." </sentence><sentence id="702">I said, "Are they still alive?" </sentence><sentence id="703">And she said yeah, the one sister was. </sentence><sentence id="704">But the other sister and her husband died after they were liberated. </sentence><sentence id="705">They were hauled by train. " </sentence><sentence id="706">Oh," I said, "to Tribitz?" </sentence><sentence id="707">And she said "Yes, how do you know?" </sentence><sentence id="708">And I said, "I was on that train also." </sentence><sentence id="709">And so that's as close as I ever came to meeting anybody or knowing anybody. </sentence><sentence id="710">But the irony, irony, small world: the sister who was still alive lived next door to my mother's closest friend in New York. </sentence><sentence id="711">So you never know. </sentence><sentence id="712">But no, I didn't know anybody and outside of that incident I have never talked to anybody who was there. </sentence><sentence id="713">As a matter of fact, my brother is very active. </sentence><sentence id="714">He's on the Board of Directors of the Anne Frank house. </sentence><sentence id="715">And I happened to be talking to him about a year or so ago and he told me, and I didn't realize, I went to school with Anne Frank. </sentence><sentence id="716">I was in the same class, but I don't remember her at all. </sentence><sentence id="717">And I got to wondering if there is a class 11 This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="718">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="719"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection USHMM Archives RG-50.549.05*0012 12 picture that exists. </sentence><sentence id="720">I'll have to ask him of the grade school. </sentence><sentence id="721">Because we both should be in it. </sentence><sentence id="722">Just curious. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="769">Q: There is another woman that we interviewed last year or so, who went to school with Anne Frank as well. </sentence><sentence id="770">I don't recall her maiden name, but her married name was Barbara Rodbell. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="773">A: There is somebody and my brother knows about it, her, that is apparently active in the Anne Frank House Foundation and goes around speaking. </sentence><sentence id="774">I'm not sure if it's the same woman or not. </sentence><sentence id="775">But somebody that was either a friend of Anne Frank or knew her. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="781">Her sister especially. </sentence><sentence id="782">But they might have lived nearby. </sentence><sentence id="783">So, you're with your family and you're returning to Amsterdam, and you described some, in the first interview, some of that... you were housed first in the DP camp in Leipzig? </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="784">A: First in Leipzig. </sentence><sentence id="785">Essentially what it was, was a military barracks that was used. </sentence><sentence id="786">We could come and go. </sentence><sentence id="787">We were not prisoners. </sentence><sentence id="788">They let us come and go. </sentence><sentence id="789">Matter of fact, very grateful about many things. </sentence><sentence id="790">De-lousing with DDT. </sentence><sentence id="791">They sprayed us from head to toe with DDT. </sentence><sentence id="792">Think how environmentally unacceptable that is today. </sentence><sentence id="793">And I'm still alive in spite of it. </sentence><sentence id="794">But it got rid of the fleas and in particular the lice which was so important. </sentence><sentence id="795">But we could come and go as we pleased. </sentence><sentence id="796">And I don't remember it was with my brother or some other boys, anyway, young men, we would get on the trolley and the conductor trying to collect money from us and we told him what he could do, or what we would do. </sentence><sentence id="797">We were pretty nasty. </sentence><sentence id="798">So they left us pretty much alone. </sentence><sentence id="799">And then we weren't there all that long. </sentence><sentence id="800">And then when they were told, they're going to take us back to Holland, it was on a Red Cross train. </sentence><sentence id="801">We wouldn't go onto the beds because they were absolutely starched, bleached, perfectly white sheets. </sentence><sentence id="802">And here we were, in spite of getting regular baths, pretty filthy. </sentence><sentence id="803">We only had one set of clothes and shoes. </sentence><sentence id="804">I'm sure we had shoes. </sentence><sentence id="805">I had a woman's blouse, because I remember it, Army blouse, because it buttoned the wrong way. </sentence><sentence id="806">But they weren't even able to fit, not small enough. </sentence><sentence id="807">They insisted we get in the beds and don't worry about getting them dirty. </sentence><sentence id="808">And then they brought us bread that was as white as the sheets were. </sentence><sentence id="809">Couldn't believe that. </sentence><sentence id="810">But anyway they took us back to Holland and they put us ina convent in southern Holland, where the Dutch then sorted things out. </sentence><sentence id="811">And you had to have a place to stay before they'd send you back to Amsterdam. </sentence><sentence id="812">And that was taken care of. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="842">Q: While you were still in Germany did you witness anybody, any of the former prisoners taking revenge on Germans or did you desire that yourself? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="844">A: No. </sentence><sentence id="845">Well, I suppose if you would have known somebody or run into somebody that you knew had been a, recognized a prison guard, I don't think he would have survived. </sentence><sentence id="846">But that would have been such a chance encounter. </sentence><sentence id="847">No. </sentence><sentence id="848">Well, for one thing we were wearing what looked like American Army uniforms because that's the only clothing, I guess, that we were given. </sentence><sentence id="849">I'm not sure what else the Red Cross had that they gave us. </sentence><sentence id="850">So that the Germans gave us a pretty wide berth. </sentence><sentence id="851">Because they didn't have anything to do anyway. </sentence><sentence id="852">Things were pretty chaotic. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="895">Q: What about your, when you returned to Amsterdam and just adjusting to daily life again? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="897">A: Well, initially of course, I think we were all spread out. </sentence><sentence id="898">I stayed with one family who was a friend of my parents. </sentence><sentence id="899">My brother stayed with a friend of his. </sentence><sentence id="900">His closest friend was an American. </sentence><sentence id="901">His father was the distributor for Holland and Belgium of RKO, the movies. </sentence><sentence id="902">And I think he stayed with them. </sentence><sentence id="903">And my parents stayed with, I don't even remember who it was. </sentence><sentence id="904">Somebody. </sentence><sentence id="905">So we were in different locations. </sentence><sentence id="906">We weren't really, and this was like, talking the summer of "45. </sentence><sentence id="907">There really wasn't much going on. </sentence><sentence id="908">Trying to see about getting back into school. </sentence><sentence id="909">My high school class had graduated. </sentence><sentence id="910">I think we may have actually been back in Amsterdam when the graduation was, but of course they wouldn't give me my diploma. </sentence><sentence id="911">Hadn't been there in four years. </sentence><sentence id="912">Four out of six wasn't good enough. </sentence><sentence id="913">And so my mother was making arrangements to see what the school about me trying out, well both of us, trying to get back into school in the Fall. </sentence><sentence id="914">What the requirements would be, and trying to line up a tutor and a place to live. </sentence><sentence id="915">And I think, somebody... the Dutch did things fairly reasonably. </sentence><sentence id="916">The person that was living in our house had gotten there in good faith. </sentence><sentence id="917">He did not know, or they did not know that was the property or the residence of deported Jews. </sentence><sentence id="918">And so what they did, if the person had something in good faith, so you don't have, just transfer the victim from one person to another. </sentence><sentence id="919">They could stay there. </sentence><sentence id="920">So my parents found a place to live. </sentence><sentence id="921">And I don't know where the furniture came from, whether that was, whether those were donations or purchases or whether they had given some of that furniture to somebody to hide. </sentence><sentence id="922">But anyway we ultimately had an apartment where we lived. </sentence><sentence id="923">And then school started pretty soon. </sentence><sentence id="924">We had a tutor trying to get us up to speed, because I was allowed into the senior class on the condition that if I didn't measure up, that the school would have the right not to let me take the comprehensive exams at the end of the year. </sentence><sentence id="925">Well that's the deal they made with my parents, obviously. </sentence><sentence id="926">Apparently I did all right because... and I do remember having to go to a couple of teachers after classes for additional instruction. </sentence><sentence id="927">It's kind of tough to pick up solid geometry if you haven't had trigonometry. </sentence><sentence id="928">So, trying to catch up. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="961">Q: Was it easy for you to focus on studies after what you had been through? </sentence><sentence id="962">Was that a challenge at all? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="965">A: I never thought of it in those terms, but I suppose so because that's the only thing we did, was to go to school. </sentence><sentence id="966">And you come home, and you may have had to stay after class for additional instruction. </sentence><sentence id="967">And depending on--I'm not sure whether you're familiar with the European system--it's not ten minutes worth of homework. </sentence><sentence id="968">You spent every night doing homework, and 13 This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="969">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="970"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection USHMM Archives RG-50.549.05*0012 14 we went to school on Saturdays half a day. </sentence><sentence id="971">And so maybe we were allowed to go and play for ten minutes before dinner. </sentence><sentence id="972">Or if we happened to get done by eight o'clock, the homework, we could play for a half hour before going to bed. </sentence><sentence id="973">But it, it was all-consuming, essentially, except maybe for the weekends. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="984">Q: So you didn't, you weren't necessarily ever... was there a point were you remember you started really reflecting on what had happened to you? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="986">A: No, not really. </sentence><sentence id="987">It really would have been pointless anyway. </sentence><sentence id="988">The Dutch had been exceedingly helpful, and trying to shield people. </sentence><sentence id="989">And not personally, but from others that they tried to hide an awful lot of Jews. </sentence><sentence id="990">The population as a whole, with minor exceptions, had always been very supportive. </sentence><sentence id="991">And now you're back after the war and you're no longer wearing the star, you're no longer distinguishable from the rest of the population. </sentence><sentence id="992">And so there was no need for anybody to either bend over backwards or kick you in the shins. </sentence><sentence id="993">So, no, I don't think, as a matter of fact, I really haven't dwelled on it much all my life. </sentence><sentence id="994">I have a cousin who was a professional Holocaust survivor and I always detested that. </sentence><sentence id="995">It was one of those things that happened, nothing you can do about it. </sentence><sentence id="996">I'm not ashamed of it certainly. </sentence><sentence id="997">I'm not proud of it. </sentence><sentence id="998">I mean, nothing you can do about it. </sentence><sentence id="999">I suppose like most unpleasant things, you try and put them out of your mind. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1014">Q: This maybe is kind of a digression, going out of the chronology, but was there a point where you really felt compelled personally to talk about your experiences to anyone? </sentence><sentence id="1015">Like that would help you or help other people to...? </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1076">Q: Okay, we have another minute or so on this tape. </sentence><sentence id="1077">Well, that's interesting. </sentence><sentence id="1078">Your brother has, it sounds like, taken kind of an active role in something that's related to being a Holocaust survivor. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1082">A: Yeah. </sentence><sentence id="1083">And that came about because he saw an article in a paper about the Anne Frank Foundation and somebody's name who was, I guess the Chairman of the Board, who lived near where he lived in Vermont. </sentence><sentence id="1084">And he had never heard of the man before and he called him to meet him, just out of curiosity. </sentence><sentence id="1085">And apparently they got friendly and he got him involved in the Anne Frank Foundation and he's on the Board of Directors now, has been for a few years. </sentence><sentence id="1086">And he goes around the country every so often making speeches and fundraising and that sort of thing. </sentence><sentence id="1087">And I'm not sure whether he knew, because looking at his tape, I'm not sure whether he mentioned the name of the school that we went to or not. </sentence><sentence id="1088">Anyway I don't remember what it is. </sentence><sentence id="1089">But it was obviously the same school that Anne Frank went to. </sentence><sentence id="1090">The only thing I remember about that school is we made honey in the Fall. </sentence><sentence id="1091">They had bee hives on the roof. </sentence><sentence id="1092">I was thinking about that earlier, I don't know why. </sentence><sentence id="1093">Whenever it was ready we would go upstairs and they would take the hives, the honeycombs out and put them in a centrifuge and we made honey. </sentence><sentence id="1094">And I guess carved up the combs and sold it with the wax and the honey. </sentence><sentence id="1095">That's about the only thing I remember.

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1125">Q: This is tape number two, side A. And would you say a little bit more about that? </sentence><sentence id="1126">I was wondering about, continuing in this same vein of digression, I was wondering about your feeling as a Holocaust survivor, whether you feel that there's any benefit to be derived from identifying yourself that way? </sentence><sentence id="1127">With the work that your brother... (Rosenberg bursts out laughing) ...it's a strange way of putting the question, isn't it? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1131">A: No, I tell you reason I am laughing is I suppose if you look for sympathy it would be. </sentence><sentence id="1132">But no, I don't. </sentence><sentence id="1133">I've never found any benefit to either, occasionally if I get pushed I will mention it. </sentence><sentence id="1134">I normally don't as a matter of conversation. </sentence><sentence id="1135">We were in Spain and there was a couple in that group that we were with, who were Germans, who had retired. </sentence><sentence id="1136">He had worked for General Motors and they lived in Windsor, across in Canada. </sentence><sentence id="1137">And they had invited a friend of theirs from Germany to come down and join us. </sentence><sentence id="1138">We were on the trip up to Granada to see the Alhambra. </sentence><sentence id="1139">And on the way back we were sitting at a table and this man came wandering in by himself. </sentence><sentence id="1140">I said to him in German, "How are you doing?" </sentence><sentence id="1141">He complained, "Not very well." </sentence><sentence id="1142">He didn't speak English, and so unless his friends were around... blah, blah, blah. </sentence><sentence id="1143">And then on a stop on the way back, we were standing in line together and he said, "How come you speak German so well?" </sentence><sentence id="1144">And I was debating what to say. </sentence><sentence id="1145">I just said, "I was in a concentration camp." </sentence><sentence id="1146">And I totally devastated that man. </sentence><sentence id="1147">And that evening he sought me out in the bar and came to apologize. </sentence><sentence id="1148">I said, "Hey, it's not your fault, you were too young." </sentence><sentence id="1149">This man was in his fifties, he may have been a child at the time. " </sentence><sentence id="1150">Oh, please come to Germany," he would host us, et cetera, et cetera. </sentence><sentence id="1151">So I'm always very careful because there's no need to upset people that have no, you know, no responsibility. </sentence><sentence id="1152">I'm not looking for an advantage. </sentence><sentence id="1153">So no, I rarely volunteer the information. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1183">A: Well, it's the neo-Nazism that says it never happened. </sentence><sentence id="1184">And I think there needs to be as much evidence as possible to show that it really did happen. </sentence><sentence id="1185">And that those many of us who survived are perfectly normal people. </sentence><sentence id="1186">Or what passes for normal, at least I think so.

I've been wanting to go and visit my grandparent's grave. </sentence><sentence id="1191">I just couldn't bring myself the thought of going to Germany. </sentence><sentence id="1192">One, because it's Germany; and two, that I wasn't sure whether I could control my temper if somebody were to say something to me that would set me off. </sentence><sentence id="1193">And so we decided on a trial and that was we went to Switzerland for a week with day trips out of Lucerne. </sentence><sentence id="1194">And the first trip was to the Black Forest. </sentence><sentence id="1195">You get out of it for lunch and you get back on the bus. </sentence><sentence id="1196">The bus was the safe haven. </sentence><sentence id="1197">And then another day for a couple of hours. </sentence><sentence id="1198">And it went all right. </sentence><sentence id="1199">I didn't feel particularly bad or tense. </sentence><sentence id="1200">But on that boat trip, after Cologne it got to me suddenly, and I had to get out of there. </sentence><sentence id="1201">And | actually during dinner, got up, went up on top of the boat, on the top deck, to make sure we passed that border back into Holland. </sentence><sentence id="1202">Because I just got obsessed all of a sudden, panicky. </sentence><sentence id="1203">And haven't been back since. </sentence><sentence id="1204">16 This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="1205">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="1206"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection USHMM Archives RG-50.549.05*0012 17 </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1231">Q: What about your children? </sentence><sentence id="1232">Have you... people who are as far as can be from Neo-Nazis: do you feel like it's important to you to leave them some kind of information or some kind of knowledge about your life and your experiences? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1235">A: Well, they know about it, of course. </sentence><sentence id="1236">At least one daughter, I think has... no, I think they all have copies of the tape of the interview. </sentence><sentence id="1237">The tape that one of my... it's really my father's cousin that was much more informative than mine or, for that matter, my brother's. </sentence><sentence id="1238">This fellow got to Belsen the day before the liberation or two days before the liberation. </sentence><sentence id="1239">The Swedes took him out, sent him to Sweden. </sentence><sentence id="1240">He was in a Swedish hospital for a year. </sentence><sentence id="1241">But he decided to use that year to write down everything he could remember. </sentence><sentence id="1242">And then spend the rest of his life filling in the details that he didn't remember, and try and get the... and he wrote a book. </sentence><sentence id="1243">The original was published in German and just before he died, supposedly it was published, finally got published in English. </sentence><sentence id="1244">And I never did get a copy of it. </sentence><sentence id="1245">I'll have to ask my cousin for it. </sentence><sentence id="1246">But I got a copy of his tape. </sentence><sentence id="1247">But he remembers names and dates and... and he went from one labor camp to another labor camp, and the name of the commander of the camp and all that kind of stuff that I have no idea about and really, don't really care. </sentence><sentence id="1248">And yeah, my kids know, but they also really have no relation to it. </sentence><sentence id="1249">My youngest daughter couldn't, when I said something to her about the Vietnam War, she says, "But Dad I was only six then." </sentence><sentence id="1250">You know, so it's all ancient history. </sentence><sentence id="1251">Just like World War One is ancient history to me. </sentence><sentence id="1252">I know about it. </sentence><sentence id="1253">I'm a bit of a history buff and I wanted to see the Bosporus. </sentence><sentence id="1254">That's a World War One site. </sentence><sentence id="1255">The British took one hell of a beating there. </sentence><sentence id="1256">That was Churchill's doing. </sentence><sentence id="1257">And went to Yalta, wanted to see that. </sentence><sentence id="1258">But no, they're not really interested. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1291">A: I'm not sure. </sentence><sentence id="1292">My wife may have told them something or my mother may have. </sentence><sentence id="1293">It may have come out, a comment here or there or something that occurred that made me bring it up or a program that I watched. </sentence><sentence id="1294">Spielberg had a program, was it last week or week before last, it was on HBO. </sentence><sentence id="1295">I was going to tape it, but I don't have HBO. </sentence><sentence id="1296">When there's something on the Holocaust I usually tape it. </sentence><sentence id="1297">More for my information than to show others. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1370">A: Oh, I am saying it jokingly and seriously. </sentence><sentence id="1371">My wife is Episcopalian. </sentence><sentence id="1372">Our children were baptized in the Episcopalian church, but are not particularly religious. </sentence><sentence id="1373">My youngest daughter was married in the Catholic church and now her children were just baptized in the last month, because they want... the older one now is going to first grade. </sentence><sentence id="1374">And with the public schools here in Louisville in such a mess, they want to put the boy into parochial school. </sentence><sentence id="1375">And they belong to a parish and apparently they are now going to church regularly, which is fine. </sentence><sentence id="1376">I have no problem with it one way or the other. </sentence><sentence id="1377">Our oldest daughter was married for the first time in the Episcopal cathedral in Lexington, which as you may know is so orthodox that the mass was in Latin. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1430">A: Well it's really more ethnic than a religion. </sentence><sentence id="1431">Did you by chance see that program on trying to find the lost tribes a few weeks ago on PBS? </sentence><sentence id="1432">Fascinating program. </sentence><sentence id="1433">To some people being Jewish is a religion, obviously, Sammy Davis Jr. is probably the...

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2518">A: Yeah, I mean the thing is, painful and the thing is that the Saint Louis had roughly nine hundred passengers and I don't think two dozen survived. </sentence><sentence id="2519">It's incredible that the things that the U.S.government could have done, should have done and never did do. </sentence><sentence id="2520">It's that kind of malfeasance that really upset me, particularly in that context. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2525">Q: Related to that, I'm interested in something you said in your last interview, which was a piece of advice that you were giving to other Holocaust survivors. </sentence><sentence id="2526">That many have met with very good fortune in their post-war lives and that they ought to do what they can to give something back to the community. </sentence><sentence id="2527">And so on the one hand you have that compulsion or that desire and on the other hand, you have this knowledge of the shortcomings of this government and the ways that they have, have really not served the... and in particular in the couple of instances you just brought up, Holocaust survivors. </sentence><sentence id="2528">How do you reconcile those two? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2533">A: Well, those are, in my opinion, two totally separate issues. </sentence><sentence id="2534">Maybe they are related, and that is by giving back to the community, by helping people that are in need of help. </sentence><sentence id="2535">Maybe because the government should and isn't, that you're overcoming the shortcomings of our government. </sentence><sentence id="2536">Even though I don't take that into consideration. </sentence><sentence id="2537">There are two ways that one can give back, one is financially and that's the easy way out that most of us take, is to make contributions to a variety of charitable organizations, or non-profit organizations. </sentence><sentence id="2538">But then the more important one is to give of your time and help people. </sentence><sentence id="2539">I'm sure the same thing holds true for Lexington, in Louisville there is a shortage, an incredible shortage of volunteers. </sentence><sentence id="2540">And all of us retirees who have spare time, and we should have spare time, should donate some of that time to some of these organizations. </sentence><sentence id="2541">Whether it's Dare to Care to sort out cans of food, or work at the Wayside Christian Mission as an example, any of these shelters, and dish out food for people in need. </sentence><sentence id="2542">Or 32 This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="2543">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="2544"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection USHMM Archives RG-50.549.05*0012 33 I work in the tax program, in fact I have somebody come in who needs help with their taxes. </sentence><sentence id="2545">One of the great organizations in general of a variety of needs is Catholic Charities. </sentence><sentence id="2546">And they're desperate for volunteers. </sentence><sentence id="2547">Obviously: they asked me to help.

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2623">A: Oh yes, well, no I think or it appears at least that more recently that the antagonism toward Louisville, Louisville versus the rest of Kentucky, seems to be diminishing. </sentence><sentence id="2624">But that is, you know the large city versus the rest of the state. </sentence><sentence id="2625">Look at New York and New York City, Georgia and Atlanta and you know, you can go on. </sentence><sentence id="2626">I think it's probably true of most states that the large cities are thought to be representative and they're not. </sentence><sentence id="2627">Even though they contain most of the population. </sentence><sentence id="2628">And I can understand that. </sentence><sentence id="2629">And the interests of Kentucky in particularly are so diverse, from Appalachia with its problems, and Western Kentucky with some of the same problems and some totally different problems. </sentence><sentence id="2630">And Louisville, of course, for painfully obvious reasons having totally different problems that people in Appalachia couldn't care less about. </sentence><sentence id="2631">But that's true everywhere. </sentence><sentence id="2632">And it's amazing, the thing that I thought that the United States was unique, unfortunately, in its race relations problems. </sentence><sentence id="2633">They're not. </sentence><sentence id="2634">It's the same everywhere. </sentence><sentence id="2635">It doesn't matter what country you go to, it may not be like we have, black and white. </sentence><sentence id="2636">But we were in New Zealand and there was a big ruckus and the Royal Commission on Race Relations or whatever it was, got involved, refused to get involved in it. </sentence><sentence id="2637">Well, the mere fact that they have a 33 This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="2638">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="2639"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection USHMM Archives RG-50.549.05*0012 34 Royal Commission on Race Relations says there's a problem there. </sentence><sentence id="2640">And it's the Maoris, which are no longer in existence. </sentence><sentence id="2641">The purest Maori is one-eighth Maori and seven-eighths white. </sentence><sentence id="2642">And in Australia it's the indigenous people versus the settlers. </sentence><sentence id="2643">And then of course among the settlers you get the same ethnic divisions that you get everywhere else. </sentence><sentence id="2644">Look right now, Fiji, the Solomon Islands, the whole world is erupting in ethnic and race problems. </sentence><sentence id="2645">Africa is just a terrible situation. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2675">A: No, not really. </sentence><sentence id="2676">I read about it and I heard about it and was only peripherally affected by it. </sentence><sentence id="2677">But in the early fifties, while I was in Durham, the mayor of Durham was Jewish. </sentence><sentence id="2678">Why I don't know. </sentence><sentence id="2679">There's a fairly good sized, there was a--there may still be--a good-sized Jewish community in Durham because of the tobacco industry. </sentence><sentence id="2680">Apparently they brought the Jews down in order to make cigars, like they did in Tampa with the Cubans. </sentence><sentence id="2681">And then, I still remember the man's name, Bishop Waters was the Catholic Bishop for North Carolina. </sentence><sentence id="2682">The little town of Washington, North Carolina was two parishes, a black and a white. </sentence><sentence id="2683">Neither one of them could support a priest, and he ordered them integrated. </sentence><sentence id="2684">Boy was there ever a stink, but it worked. </sentence><sentence id="2685">Wasn't... no more than two months and they essentially had ninety percent attendance of the two parishes in one church building. </sentence><sentence id="2686">It was unheard of. </sentence><sentence id="2687">Of course the press would claim race relations are only bad in the South. </sentence><sentence id="2688">Well, they're probably a lot better in the South than they were elsewhere. </sentence><sentence id="2689">But yeah, I certainly was keenly aware of it, and cautious. </sentence><sentence id="2690">Before I bought a house in Houston, this was in the late fifties, I consulted with a local friend to say "Hey, so that I don't stub my toe, is there anyplace that I cannot go? </sentence><sentence id="2691">Where I would be refused because I am Jewish?" </sentence><sentence id="2692">And he said, "Yes. </sentence><sentence id="2693">Don't go to Oak Forest," or Forest Oaks, whatever it was called, which I couldn't anyway, that was the rich neighborhood. </sentence><sentence id="2694">But you learned to do those things. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2717">A: No, I can't really think of much. </sentence><sentence id="2718">I don't know whether this gets perpetuated or not, but I certainly would urge, not just Holocaust survivors, but all retirees to think about give something back to the community. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2725">A: Yeah, I think so. </sentence><sentence id="2726">There's such a terrible need. </sentence><sentence id="2727">And what makes me particularly, actually angry... I have two or three acquaintances who are retired, who went back to work on a part-time basis, because they don't know what to do with themselves. </sentence><sentence id="2728">They're bored. </sentence><sentence id="2729">This is utterly ridiculous. </sentence><sentence id="2730">And I keep trying to get them enrolled in some activity and they just won't do it. </sentence><sentence id="2731">But there's just too many people that need help, who cannot help themselves. </sentence><sentence id="2732">And throwing money at the problem is not necessarily the solution. </sentence><sentence id="2733">It isn't that it can't be done without money, but it's the personal help that's required. </sentence><sentence id="2734">And here in Louisville, we are blessed with a number of things. </sentence><sentence id="2735">We have here three groups that make recordings for the blind. </sentence><sentence id="2736">The Recordings for the Blind, the Audio Studio, and there's a third one. </sentence><sentence id="2737">There isn't another city in this country that does that. </sentence><sentence id="2738">We have three public radio stations. </sentence><sentence id="2739">There is not, even New York only has one. </sentence><sentence id="2740">There are 34 This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="2741">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="2742"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection USHMM Archives RG-50.549.05*0012 35 a lot of things that are good things, matter of fact I don't brag about Louisville, keep down the population influx.

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2768">A: We have it very good here in Kentucky, and particularly in Louisville, and of course, Lexington in many ways, much more dynamic than Louisville is, for one thing they've got the city-county government, which we won't get. </sentence><sentence id="2769">It's up for voting on election day, you can bet money on it, it won't happen. </sentence><sentence id="2770">The race relations right now are just so terrible. </sentence><sentence id="2771">All you have to do is look at other communities and other cities and that's not just... take this house here as an example, which you can buy similar house here for depending on the condition and age, but let's say 150 to 250. </sentence><sentence id="2772">Go to Silicon Valley you couldn't touch it for two and a half million dollars. </sentence><sentence id="2773">In other areas, yeah you may be able to get for less, but most areas you can't touch it for twice the amount of money. </sentence><sentence id="2774">Matter of fact, most retirees moving out of California, sell their houses and live happily ever after, because they can buy another house somewhere else in Arizona or in Florida for a fraction of what it's worth in California. </sentence><sentence id="2775">Our food prices are reasonable, with the exception of gasoline in Jefferson County. </sentence><sentence id="2776">I went to Shelbyville last night and paid 40 cents a gallon less than what it is in Louisville. </sentence><sentence id="2777">I mean that's ridiculous. </sentence><sentence id="2778">Could have gone as far as Simpsonville, that's only ten miles, 25 cents a gallon. </sentence><sentence id="2779">But outside of these temporary distortions, Louisville has grown up a lot in the last 15, 20 years. </sentence><sentence id="2780">I used to get all my bread from Chicago, now there's a grocery store over on Taylorsville Road that carries it and I can go get it there. </sentence><sentence id="2781">We used to go to Cincinnati to get a three month supply of cold cuts, now I can buy almost all of it here. </sentence><sentence id="2782">And so on and so forth. </sentence><sentence id="2783">We're blessed here with, within two miles or three, excellent bakeries and different bakeries. </sentence><sentence id="2784">If you want a certain thing you get it here. </sentence><sentence id="2785">How many communities can you say that? </sentence><sentence id="2786">In 20 minutes I'm at the airport. </sentence></p></dialogue>
