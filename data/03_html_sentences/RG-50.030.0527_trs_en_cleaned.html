<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3282">Q: Something -- something jiggled your memory. </sentence><sentence id="3283">But we'll come back to her. </sentence><sentence id="3284">I want to go back to the other question that I had when I asked you how did you identify yourself, because I had a follow-up question, and that is -- </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3285">A: Now, I would say I -- I identified myself Lithuanian. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3287">Q: When you saw -- when you saw the chaos in Vilnius and you saw Jews being expelled from their apartments and Poles standing on the street and making fun, and the Lithuanian collaborators who were there, who were part of this expulsion, not doing it -- I mean actually doing it, not seeming to care very much, did any feelings go through you? </sentence><sentence id="3288">Did you ever think to yourself, how could they do such a thing? </sentence><sentence id="3289">Do they not see what's going on? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3293">A: 1-- I don't think this was -- this was less because of religion or nationality. </sentence><sentence id="3294">I think that would be for a person unbelievable to watch from a point of human attitude. </sentence><sentence id="3295">You didn't have to be a Jew or a Czech or a French, just to be treated like that. </sentence><sentence id="3296">I mean, it was a double -- you know, it was a double, the way I was brought up, in a humane way, to watch that was beyond your understanding. </sentence><sentence id="3297">It's not just that because the people were Jewish, because they were people. </sentence><sentence id="3298">They were not cattle, they were not animals, they were people. </sentence><sentence id="3299">To watch people doing that to people, that was very difficult to watch. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3307">Q: I know. </sentence><sentence id="3308">But earlier you said, when we were talking about what befell people when the Soviets came in and what befell people when the Germans came in, you were explaining that there was this hatred Jews because there had been some on the streets waving red flags. </sentence><sentence id="3309">And as a -- as an explanation as to why there was anti-Semitism, as an explanation as to why there was hatred, and for many people who were not there, who did not live through these times, that kind of explanation seems to hold very little water, exactly for the reason you just said right now. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3313">A: Well, that was po-political, I would say. </sentence><sentence id="3314">You see, we didn't see the night deportations. </sentence><sentence id="3315">Whatever we heard after mostly was that Russian soldiers were correct. </sentence><sentence id="3316">The ones that came and told people pack up your stuff and go into the truck. </sentence><sentence id="3317">What we knew, what was going on in the building of KGB, that people were tortured, and they found later the traces of it -- </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3323">Q: But wa -- again, I go back to, why would that be, if the soldiers were correct, then why would this kind of hatred, why would this kind of -- of anger be directed at a Jewish population? </sentence><sentence id="3324">And I mean in the sense of explanations later, when people are explaining things to themselves -- you're sitting in Vilnius and you're seeing the chaos of what's happening, and you weren't saying to yourself, oh it's because they waved red flags when the Soviets were coming in, you were seeing people being dehumanized. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3327">A: This is one thing, but the cooperation didn't have to be so voluntarily. </sentence><sentence id="3328">The cooperation was a -- would say a result of the red flags, of the heads of political personnel -- </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3329">Q: Whose cooperation? </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3330">A: Lithuanian. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="5099">He wanted to prolong -- you see, the front was moving slowly. </sentence><sentence id="5100">It wasn't as rosy for the Germans as it used to be in deg41. </sentence><sentence id="5101">In deg43 the situation in the front was already different. </sentence><sentence id="5102">He was hoping against hope that maybe somehow, if he drags the people longer, like in Kloge where my uncle died, the Russians were right there. </sentence><sentence id="5103">They came in, the timber was still burning, you see? </sentence><sentence id="5104">So he -- he just thought that maybe, maybe, if we don't provoke the Germans, if they leave us alone and let us live the way we are, work, work, work, work, nevermind work, but work, maybe we'll expect -- you know, maybe our expectations will take place. </sentence><sentence id="5105">Maybe it'l] happen. </sentence><sentence id="5106">Maybe the Russian army will come closer. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="5139">Q: You say that he was very careful to not talk to you about something that could eventually hurt you and hurt others, were you caught, where you would be forced to talk. </sentence></p></dialogue>
