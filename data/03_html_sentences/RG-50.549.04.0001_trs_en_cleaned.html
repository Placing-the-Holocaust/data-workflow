So all of our family has always looked up to Uncle Miles and his activities as exemplars of -- of what one could in reference to remembering or commemorating the Holocaust. </sentence><sentence id="190">But that doesn't in any way mean that I wish to give short shrift to the concerns and activities, both of his wife and of my mother and her oldest sister, who live in Toronto. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="972">A: Yes, in-indeed, I-I think our greatest hope is -- is that our children would grow up to be both literate and concerned beings. </sentence><sentence id="973">Aside from formal education, which [ll discuss in a minute, I think a very unique portion of -- of Max's upbringing, meaning our older son's upbringing was the fact that during his formative years, Cheryl] was a senior staff member at New York City ballet. </sentence><sentence id="974">And at that time we lived directly across the street, literally a 15 second commute from her office in the New York State Theater at Lincoln Center. </sentence><sentence id="975">Max grew up basically as the New York City Ballet Company mascot. </sentence><sentence id="976">He and I were there every day because my wife worked evenings and we would go to say hello to her, but not only to her, to all of her staff members and to the many members of the orchestra, and the dance company, with whom we became friends over the years. </sentence><sentence id="977">And she was there from 1985 to "95, and Max was born, as I said, in January of "89. </sentence><sentence id="978">So he had his first six years at the ballet, backstage, in the orchestra pit, in the flies, playing hockey in the   ontectnetonancedjusetneey for tarher biormatoerabouttfisestecion Interview with Harry Gelb %8 December 13, 2001 back hallways. </sentence><sentence id="979">Hanging out at the dance bar and making believe he was -- he was a little nutcracker prince with some of the world famous prima ballerinas. </sentence><sentence id="980">It was a most unusual thing for a child to be exposed to this quantity of the performing arts on a day to day basis. </sentence><sentence id="981">The funny thing is that nowadays he enjoys going to these things very much, and is even actually -- last night he said to me, hey Dad, we've gotta go see The Nutcracker. </sentence><sentence id="982">Because that's -- that's a performance that he adored as a child. </sentence><sentence id="983">But he is not willing to perform. </sentence><sentence id="984">He doesn't feel that he has any talents either in music or in dance. </sentence><sentence id="985">However, on the other hand, he's a phenomenal athlete and he's discovered in himself talents which I know I never had, and perhaps he inherited somehow from his Uncle Paul. </sentence><sentence id="986">But my -- my older son is physically gifted, and he plays league sports i-in -- in many different areas and is particularly good in the hockey sports. </sentence><sentence id="987">And he plays league ice hockey, league roller hockey, he's just a -- a phenomenal athlete. </sentence><sentence id="988">And he's -- he's very proud of himself and he'1l never fail to tell you, I'm -- you know, proud papas tal -- talk this way all the time. </sentence><sentence id="989">But he -- he"! </sentence><sentence id="990">remind you of that as well. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1310">Q: What about you? </sentence><sentence id="1311">I mean, I know it's not an easy question, but if you kind of, you know, thought about it for a minute, what do you think the impact of the Holocaust was on you, however directly or indirectly? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1314">A: I think that in many ways, I mean, directly, and I -- I suppose it's easy to say that -- that it -- it -- it awakened a degree of social consciousness in me. </sentence><sentence id="1315">But I think o0-o- other people are motivated by other things and arrive at -- at the same place where I find myself, but perhaps -- for me this is -- this is what -- what does it. </sentence><sentence id="1316">I think it uncanny that I met and then married someone who is the -- like me, a -- a -- a child of -- of survivors. </sentence><sentence id="1317">Yeah, I don't know whether that is good or bad, I think it's a very unique bond. </sentence><sentence id="1318">I -- I found in my office, and now I'm -- I'm a supervisor in -- in -- in our Bronx office, and through conversation after being there a year, I found out that one of my co-workers, who is significantly younger than me is also the child of a survivor who was a hidden child. </sentence><sentence id="1319">And he was hidden as a very, very -- he's even younger -- he was born sometime in the 1930's and waited a while to have children after coming here and marrying, so this co-worker of mine 1-is significantly younger. </sentence><sentence id="1320">And yet, I know that -- that she and I feel an -- an -- sort of there's an unusual kinship or bond there, even though his -- his, meaning her father's   http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection Interview with Harry Gelb degdeg December 13, 2001 experience, wartime experiences, and my mother's were -- were quite dissimilar. </sentence><sentence id="1321">But i-i-it's an unusual bond. </sentence><sentence id="1322">I am sure that other people who share similar traumatic experiences in their family histories probably feel a similar bond as well, but this is what our family feels, and this is what Laura's family feels. </sentence><sentence id="1323">And I'm sure that -- you know, and my wife and her sister and all of my cousins, we all feel the same. </sentence><sentence id="1324">It's just an unusual way to identify -- I think that there are many Jews who identify as being Jews in large part due to the persecution of the Jews during the Holocaust somehow awakening a Jewish identity in them. </sentence><sentence id="1325">I suppose religious motivation comes from many different things in one's upbringing. </sentence><sentence id="1326">So in mine, obviously, it must come in large part due to the fact that my mother herself is a survivor. </sentence><sentence id="1327">Never -- nevertheless, i-it ca -- her experiences cannot but have a-affected my outlook on the world, on religion, on my social values and morals, and by the way I raise my family. </sentence><sentence id="1328">And the fact that my wife is also a survivor's child will only magnify the impact -- or whatever impact it does have on our children. </sentence></p></dialogue>
