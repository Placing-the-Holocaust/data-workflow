<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="189">A: She wa -- she still wasn't Jewish, and -- and -- and the ridiculous part is that my grandmother Lenneberg, she was a total agnostic, she didn't keep any of the Jewish holidays, and they were totally assimilated. </sentence><sentence id="190">But the idea that her son, her favorite son would marry a goyte, didn't quite go down well. </sentence><sentence id="191">Then her oldest son, Erich, who was really like a black sheep in the family, not a very good person, and who she didn't like, but he married later. </sentence><sentence id="192">He met a Catholic woman who was a very good person, Erich was not. </sentence><sentence id="193">And she was a very strict Catholic, and she became pregnant before they got married. </sentence><sentence id="194">And don't you know that my mother -- my grandmother Lenneberg opened her arms to this Catholic woman, even though she got pregnant before they got married. </sentence><sentence id="195">And totally ignored all what she believed before, when her younger son married Lina Schneider. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="398">A: That was a grade school, and -- and talking about remembering, somehow I do remember I had two very good friends. </sentence><sentence id="399">Now, I was about seven years old, and one was the daughter of the principal of a school, and one was a daughter of a local physician. </sentence><sentence id="400">And after the Nazis took over, and I don't recall exactly how soon, but within a relatively short time period -- we used to run to each other's houses and play, and I came to their house one day and they informed me, these two girls, that they couldn't play with me any more because I was a Jew. </sentence><sentence id="401">Now that I remember, because it made such an impression on me, and I didn't make -- I -- I didn't understand it. </sentence><sentence id="402">And I think I asked my parents, and I do not remember what their answer was, but somehow it was an experience that I still remember, that all of a sudden I lost my friends. </sentence><sentence id="403">I couldn't play with these two girls. </sentence><sentence id="404">I still have pictures of these two girls with me, and I wouldn't have had those pictures, but the non-Jewish relatives -- whatever I have, after I came back, was on account of my aunts, or I wouldn't have a thing. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="412">Q: Do you remember if these kids were angry, did they yell at you, or did they say it quietly -- </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="413">A: That I don't remember. </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="414">Q: -- you don't remember. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="416">A: I think they just said you can't come here any more, we -- yeah, they said you -- we can't play with you any more because you are a Jew. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="418">Q: And the friends that you had were a mixture of friends, Jewish and Christian friend, I gather? </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="422">Q: A -- yes. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="462">Q: Mm-hm. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="464">A: One doesn't appreciate it when one is eight, nine or 10 years old. </sentence><sentence id="465">And -- and the way he cared for us in Terezin. </sentence><sentence id="466">There was only one theme, when this murderer is gone, and we get back with your mommy, you know. </sentence><sentence id="467">And there was th -- he talked about my mother every day. </sentence><sentence id="468">So even though we were separated, that was the f -- the foremost thing on his mind, was my mother. </sentence><sentence id="469">When we were in Terezin, and my -- my brother was Bar-mitzvah'd in Terezin, and my father was an agnostic. </sentence><sentence id="470">But there is something about agnostic Jews, and I don't know what it is. </sentence><sentence id="471">There is a Jewishness that -- that you -- you might be an agnostic, but there is something more than the religion. </sentence><sentence id="472">And maybe it was also because we were in Terezin that the Bar-mitzvah of my brother meant so much to us. </sentence><sentence id="473">It might -- might not have meant as much to us if we would have not had the -- Hitler's ca -- catastrophe. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="773">Q: I see. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="775">A: To everybody. </sentence><sentence id="776">And so, my mother coming back and trying to get -- make some connections to earn a living, di -- it was a failure. </sentence><sentence id="777">And she was very disheartened. </sentence><sentence id="778">And then she -- and I don't know how she got to the Schreyecks, that I don't know. </sentence><sentence id="779">She might have told me, I don't remember that. </sentence><sentence id="780">She became a forelady in a leather belt factory which was owned by the Schreyeck family. </sentence><sentence id="781">And they were the most decent, wonderful people on this earth. </sentence><sentence id="782">And they protected her, and I -- they s -- I-I don't want to jump ahead, I think I'll let you ask the questions, </sentence></p><p><sentence id="783"> but they were very vital later on in -- in protecting my mother when we were deported, and the secret police, Herr Puetz, would not let my mother to go with us. </sentence><sentence id="784">So, they're wonder -- </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="785">Q: And you think that had something to do with these people? </sentence><sentence id="786">The fact that she was not allowed to go? </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="787">A: I don't think so. </sentence><sentence id="788">I think -- what had to do with him not wanting my mother to go with us was strictly he hated her because he -- she got notification a few times, that I remember, to present herself at the office of Herr Puetz, he was the head of the Gestapo. </sentence><sentence id="789">And he belabored her to leave my father. </sentence><sentence id="790">And she made it very clear she would never leave my father, she rather die. </sentence><sentence id="791">And he then would not allow her to go with us -- we -- to the, in quote, labor camp. </sentence><sentence id="792">And she worked for the Schreyecks. </sentence><sentence id="793">So as soon as we were gone, this guy Puetz came, I think on a weekly basis, to interview her, and to interview the Schreyecks, and to make it very, very difficult, to make her feel very threatened, to the point where Mr. Schreyeck one day said to my mother, "Caroline, this guy is after you. </sentence><sentence id="794">He will get to you whether it's next week or the week after. </sentence><sentence id="795">You have to leave. </sentence><sentence id="796">I have a brother, as you know, in Vienna, and he has a leather factory. </sentence><sentence id="797">I'm going to get in touch with my brother and I think he will agree to shield you, and you work for my brother." </sentence><sentence id="798">That wasn't easy, because when you lee -- left a town, and I think it's probably still so in Germany, you had to go to the police, you had to fill out papers that you were leaving such and such a residence, and you were going to such and such a town, where you were going to live in such and such a place. </sentence><sentence id="799">Then when you got, let's say, to Vienna, you were supposed to go to the Viennese police and start papers that you were a new resident. </sentence><sentence id="800">Now, what they took upon themselves -- this is why I said to you before, these people did things that I am not sure I would have the guts to do for anybody. </sentence><sentence id="801">They provided food for my mother, so she wouldn't have -- because she was not registered, she wouldn't get food stamps. </sentence><sentence id="802">They provided a place for her to </sentence></p><p><sentence id="803"> live with a family where she had a room. </sentence><sentence id="804">And she was not registered with the police, and the Germans had no idea where she went. </sentence><sentence id="805">And Puetz came, she found out later, to Schreyeck in Diisseldorf, and said where -- they want to talk to her. </sentence><sentence id="806">And Mr. Schreyeck said, "I have no idea where she went. </sentence><sentence id="807">I hope she isn't going to take her life, because she was talking about killing herself," and stuff like that. </sentence><sentence id="808">And she stayed with the Schreyecks in Vienna for quite a long time, and -- you know, there's so many bad things happened to my mother, but this is almost unreal. </sentence><sentence id="809">I think she had the flu, or something, but sh -- anyway, my mother wasn't one to stay home if she just had a little cold, but she was sick.

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1749">Q: And who beat you up? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1751">A: Well, bunch of kids who came out of school, and many of them in uniform. </sentence><sentence id="1752">The Hitler youth and the BDM, I mean they were uniformed, and you know some people have made the connection, oh they are like -- they were like the boy scouts, and the girl scouts, well they were not. </sentence><sentence id="1753">They were indoctrinated. </sentence><sentence id="1754">They had leaders who actually told their -- the young people under them that it was their duty as good Germans -- and I'm talking now about Germans, not about Jews, to listen to their fathers, and -- to their father and mother and grandparents and family, and if they heard anything in the house, that anybody in their family said something derogatory about the Fiihrer, it was their duty to tell him. </sentence><sentence id="1755">This was the -- the leader, the boy scout le -- the youth leader. </sentence><sentence id="1756">And there were many people who found themselves in trouble because their own children denounced them. </sentence><sentence id="1757">And these were the kids who were made to feel like heroes if they di -- did that. </sentence><sentence id="1758">And their leaders were usually young guys in their late teens, who were good scouts, very good hikers, you know, like -- like the boy scouts. </sentence><sentence id="1759">And -- somebody they could look up to. </sentence><sentence id="1760">They wanted to be as good as climbing mountains and -- and swimming and all this kind of thing. </sentence><sentence id="1761">And they were much more impressionable when these young people talked to them, and told them was to do, than their parents, which is a normal thing even in a normal society. </sentence><sentence id="1762">And that's what happened. </sentence><sentence id="1763">And then if -- especially after we wore the star, there were bunch of kids, they had these meetings almost on a nightly basis, where they were indoctrinated, they sang the Hitler songs. </sentence><sentence id="1764">And they came out of these meetings, and if they saw a Jew, they would beat him up. </sentence><sentence id="1765">And it's mu -- it's much easier for 10 kids to do it than for one. </sentence><sentence id="1766">One would start, oh, there's a Jew, come on. </sentence><sentence id="1767">And then they would start saying, Jude ist signate spitze augen ecke, arschloch dreckig, which is -- it's very vulgar, you know, I translated it in my book, but the Jew with the -- with the pointy nose, and a dirty asshole, and you know, things like that. </sentence><sentence id="1768">And that's what we were subjected to every day when we were out. </sentence><sentence id="1769">I hated to go out any more. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1802">Q: So were you hurt? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1804">A: No, I was never hurt. </sentence><sentence id="1805">I was pushed against the wall a coup -- people were hurt, I knew people who were hurt, but I was never hurt. </sentence><sentence id="1806">And my parents asked me couldn't I do my shopping and    </sentence></p><p><sentence id="1807"> stuff at a certain time, and don't go out in the late afternoon, and then pretty soon it was resolved, we weren't allowed to go out at dusk any more anyway. </sentence><sentence id="1808">So -- </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1809">Q: So in July of 1942, you get a notice to go to Terezin. </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1810">A: Yeah, I was the f -- </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1811">Q: And on -- and only you. </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1812">A: Only I, I was the first one to get that notice. </sentence><sentence id="1813">And my parents -- which again, you know, I was a young girl, I didn't quite a -- quite appreciate what my parents must have gone through. </sentence><sentence id="1814">And I remember their discussions, what are they going to do. </sentence><sentence id="1815">They would refer to me as a child, even though, you know, by -- by that time, in f -- in 42 -- </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1816">Q: You're 16. </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1817">A: Iwas 16. </sentence><sentence id="1818">They can't let their child go alone. </sentence><sentence id="1819">And then they also, rightly so felt, well now, she's going to go now to a labor camp. </sentence><sentence id="1820">Nobody knew about concentration camps. </sentence><sentence id="1821">Extermination camps, nobody had -- could even imagine. </sentence><sentence id="1822">Excuse me. </sentence><sentence id="1823">Now then, she's going to go to one labor camp, and then maybe next month Biibchen, my brother would be sent to another labor camp, and my father -- we would all be separated. </sentence><sentence id="1824">So I know they went through a terrible time, trying to figure out what to do. </sentence><sentence id="1825">The conclusion they made was wrong, they should have let me go alone, but they didn't, and they all volunteered to go with me. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1835">Q: Including your mother? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1837">A: Including my mother. </sentence><sentence id="1838">And I had -- believe I had mentioned before that Puetz, who was the head of the Gestapo, hated my mother. </sentence><sentence id="1839">And I'm sure it was just to hurt her, certainly no -- he knew where we were going, but certainly not out of compassion that he wasn't going to let her go with us. </sentence><sentence id="1840">And he probably felt because I say this since he pursued my mother at the factory where she was working, at the Schreyeck's, almost on a weekly basis, he probably felt that if he couldn't have her, if -- he was going to trap her, and she was going to -- to get to what the Germans used to call numero sicher, number secure, which was a camouflage word for sending people to prison. </sentence><sentence id="1841">So then he said she couldn't go with us, and she appealed, and no way was he going to allow her to go with us. </sentence><sentence id="1842">So my brother and my father and I, we were deported. </sentence><sentence id="1843">And in Diisseldorf they had a wonderful place to deport Jews from, which was a Diisseldorf slaughterhouse, the Schlachthof. </sentence><sentence id="1844">The reason was probably partially vicious and partially convenience, because the Schlachthof had a lot of train rails, so they could divert trains to the Schlachthof without having a spectacle at the main train station deporting the Jews. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1854">Q: Do you think this guy Puetz wanted to have a relationship with your mother? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1856">A: Oh, I'm sure of it. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1858">Q: You're sure of that. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1860">A: I'm sure of it not just from my mother, but I'm sure of it from things my father said, and what the Schreyecks have said. </sentence><sentence id="1861">Because even under the circumstances my mother was racially not a Jew. </sentence><sentence id="1862">And this was a racial thing, and after he had made sure she couldn't go with us to the camp, he still pursued her, you know, which was somewhat unusual. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1866">Q: Right. </sentence><sentence id="1867">At the time -- w-were you included in the conversation about what to do, whether they all should go, or you should go alone? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1870">A: Not directly. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1872">Q: Not directly. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1874">A: No. </sentence><sentence id="1875">I was included, of course, when we had to make a similar decision in Terezin. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1878">Q: Right. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1880">A: But at that time it was mostly my parents. </sentence><sentence id="1881">And I know that they didn't get any sleep, that they were constantly throwing it back and forth. </sentence><sentence id="1882">And I would have to make it up, and I don't do that. </sentence><sentence id="1883">I try to be as truthful to my memory as I can. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1888">Q: Right. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1890">A: Whether I said something, I can go alone, which is probably -- it's most likely I said it, but I can't remember that. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1892">Q: Right, right. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1894">A: So I don't want to say that. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1896">Q: Do you have any recollection of feeling relieved that you weren't going alone? </sentence><sentence id="1897">Do you have any recollection of what it felt like once the decision was made? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1900">A: I don't think -- </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1901">Q: Cause you may not. </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1902">A: -- I don't think I remember having that kind of reaction. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1904">Q: Uh-huh, right. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1906">A: I think it was a terrible trauma for me, for my father, which I sensed. </sentence><sentence id="1907">I mean, even though he tried to have a stiff upper lip, but that he wasn't able to do any more. </sentence><sentence id="1908">I was getting older, and I knew my father. </sentence><sentence id="1909">And this separation from my mother was very, very difficult for him. </sentence><sentence id="1910">And times were so uncertain. </sentence><sentence id="1911">But yeah, I can't really -- </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1912">Q: So are you folks hearing any rumors in 1942 about what happened when the Nazis go into Russia? </sentence><sentence id="1913">When World War II fully starts in 1941? </sentence><sentence id="1914">You don't hear anything? </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1915">A: No, we only hear what the Nazis told us in their propaganda. </sentence><sentence id="1916">We heard through my father's communist friend in the same building, and when my father listened to also, which was British news, what was happening in the world, in the war. </sentence><sentence id="1917">And it didn't sound very good at that time, as you know. </sentence><sentence id="1918">But nobody that I know of ever made any -- gave any explanation to what happened in the camps. </sentence><sentence id="1919">And as you know, that even when people managed to escape some of the camps, and try to bring it to the attention of the American government, which I didn't know, we -- we only learned that, you know, after the war, nobody wanted to listen, nobody wanted to -- to believe it. </sentence><sentence id="1920">And what I have to say to you is had I not been in Auschwitz, had I not been a witness, had not -- had I not seen what I have seen, I'm not sure I could believe it. </sentence><sentence id="1921">A teacher at one of the high schools was very upset with two students. </sentence><sentence id="1922">It's a very large high school in a working class area in -- in New Jersey, and in New Jersey it's compulsory to teach about the Holocaust. </sentence><sentence id="1923">And these kids, at least one of them claimed, and maybe the other one agreed then, that this was all made up, this never happened, and when she said, "Well, we're going to have a speaker who was there," they made fun of that. </sentence><sentence id="1924">So when I came to this high school with ha -- which has two and a half thousand students, I was told that these two guys will be put right in the front in the auditorium. </sentence><sentence id="1925">And their attitude was such I knew this meant trouble. </sentence><sentence id="1926">So I made eye contact with them, and I said, "I understand that there are some people here who believe and are convinced that this never happened." </sentence><sentence id="1927">And they were, you know, they were perking up. </sentence><sentence id="1928">And then I said, "Well, I can understand it. </sentence><sentence id="1929">If I hadn't been there, I wouldn't believe it either." </sentence><sentence id="1930">And from then on, I had no more problem with them. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1950">A: You know, it disarmed them. </sentence><sentence id="1951">But I didn't say this t -- just to calm them down, I really mean that. </sentence><sentence id="1952">This is totally, totally incomprehensible to any normal human being, what I saw. </sentence><sentence id="1953">Totally. </sentence><sentence id="1954">And so | -- I -- I really think it's beyond a civilized person's comprehension. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2120">A: It was extremely hot, and we -- we -- when we arrived by train in Baushowiczy, which was Bauschowitz, because there was no train station, no rails to Terezin, they were only built later for the sole purpose of transporting Jews from Terezin to the east. </sentence><sentence id="2121">But we arrived in Bauschowitz, and there were trucks there with Czechs who had been in Terezin since "41, and some of them had striped uniforms on, which also was not continued, you know, after more and more transport arrived, they did not give uniforms to inmates any more. </sentence><sentence id="2122">And they had to -- they worked for the Nazis to -- to take all the luggage out of the luggage cars, and put them on trucks. </sentence><sentence id="2123">And of course, they were then transported back to Germany. </sentence><sentence id="2124">We were given some clothing later on in Terezin, which -- what transport they came from I don't know, but they were pretty bad clothing. </sentence><sentence id="2125">But as far -- y -- one thing I do remember, that my mother insisted that we wear our coats. </sentence><sentence id="2126">Now why she insisted that, I don't know, but it was something we did not put in our luggage. </sentence><sentence id="2127">We either had it on our arm, and so we did have our coats. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2137">Q: Uh-huh. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2139">A: And these coats, I remember these coats, and my mother reminded me many times, because she had a German tailor who was an anti-Nazi and was very good to -- to her, and he -- she got some material and he made these coats for us. </sentence><sentence id="2140">So they were supposed to also take us to America. </sentence><sentence id="2141">So my brother -- and I remember the coat too, because I blamed the coat very much on the fact that my -- my brother was selected immediately to be -- to be killed. </sentence><sentence id="2142">You know, he was 13 years old, and he was of average height for his age. </sentence><sentence id="2143">He had a very young face, and he had this coat, which he had outgrown. </sentence><sentence id="2144">And a boy with a coat, with a gray coat -- and you know with a -- half the arms are -- are showing, it makes a young child even look younger. </sentence><sentence id="2145">So, you know, you can argue. </sentence><sentence id="2146">I went through this in my mind, you know, how big was he, because there were some kids they were 14, by some -- somehow they managed to survive, but my brother didn't. </sentence><sentence id="2147">He looked like a -- a young kid. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2853">Q: I see. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2855">A: Yeah. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2857">Q: But it couldn't have been so easy to become friends if there was no language, or am I wrong? </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2865">Q: But that's all you had. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2867">A: Yes, but I can understand them better, because when I came out of the camps, I spoke English very well, and I had to speak German to my mother, and to my family. </sentence><sentence id="2868">And my mother learned English very fast here. </sentence><sentence id="2869">But if I could avoid German -- th-the language itself just grated me, you know, it brought back so much, and I hated everything German. </sentence><sentence id="2870">And I think Hans helped me a lot. </sentence><sentence id="2871">I mean, I wouldn't go as far as the Israelis who were trying to shake, you know, to -- to be aggressive to a pianist who is playing German music, but I couldn't stand anything German, either. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2898">Q: But your brother wanted to do this? </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2916">Q: Yeah, cause this is September "43, and you're deported in October, you know. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2918">A: Not "43. </sentence><sentence id="2919">We were deported i-in deg44. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2928">A: Yeah, but still, you know, there -- so many things happened, it -- it seemed a short time. </sentence><sentence id="2929">Maybe it was a year, but I don't remember exactly. </sentence><sentence id="2930">Maybe I wasn't totally with it. </sentence><sentence id="2931">And I don't remember who the instigator was. </sentence><sentence id="2932">I can't believe it was Louis, who was in charge of his room, because Louis was an agnostic too. </sentence><sentence id="2933">But somebody must have persuaded him he should make his Bar-mitzvah. </sentence><sentence id="2934">And my father was in a room on a -- in a different street, in a different house, with a couple of guys who were quite Orthodox [indecipherable]. </sentence><sentence id="2935">So whether they had an influence, they probably had an influence. </sentence><sentence id="2936">But I can't recall that. </sentence><sentence id="2937">I don't want to claim anything I can't be -- yeah. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2948">Q: Right, right. </sentence><sentence id="2949">Maybe ritual counts in those times, even if you don't have a belief. </sentence><sentence id="2950">Maybe. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2954">A: I think that it -- th-that's what it was to a large degree. </sentence><sentence id="2955">I mean, I started to learn [indecipherable] in Israel. </sentence><sentence id="2956">I mean the -- in -- in Terezin. </sentence><sentence id="2957">I really wanted to go, if we would get out of this mess, I wanted to eventually go to Palestine. </sentence><sentence id="2958">There was no Israel then. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2964">Q: Right. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2966">A: And I really wonder if I would have ended up in -- in Palestine if my mother hadn't survived. </sentence><sentence id="2967">But I found -- I felt that it was just too much to ask my mother to go to th -- what was then Palestine, the conditions, and for her to learn Ivrith would have been a lot harder than to -- you know, she knew a little English. </sentence><sentence id="2968">I think the idea probably wo -- came to me because when you have been persecuted, you just wonder whether you can exist among non-Jews. </sentence><sentence id="2969">You feel so vulnerable, the idea that there could be a country where people are of your make-up, and wouldn't persecute you because you are a Jew. </sentence><sentence id="2970">There is something attractive to that. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2976">Q: Right. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2978">A: Yeah. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2982">A: Oh, maybe that's why I don't remember the Bar-mitzvah too well. </sentence><sentence id="2983">Yeah, sure. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2986">Q: Cause this is November deg43, right? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2988">A: Mm-hm, yeah, that was the worst day I ever experienced in Terezin. </sentence><sentence id="2989">One day we were all herded into the Bauschowitz basin. </sentence><sentence id="2990">And the reason for that was given by the commandant of the SS, that th-the elder had not given the right numbers of inmates. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2994">Q: This is Edelstein? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2996">A: Yeah. </sentence><sentence id="2997">And then I think he just had some venom against Edelstein, who was a wonderful man, and he also, if I remember it correctly, I think accused Edelstein of using his bicycle and riding beyond the borders of was permitted in the ghetto. </sentence><sentence id="2998">And they herded us into the Bauschowitz basin. </sentence><sentence id="2999">And it was a very drizzly day. </sentence><sentence id="3000">Young and old, and some of these old people were in such decrepit condition, and we were supposed to be counted, because the count didn't jive, as far as the SS was concerned. </sentence><sentence id="3001">And we had to stand there at attention for hours and hours and hours with the rain coming down. </sentence><sentence id="3002">And SS were stationed -- the basin was like a flat area, and it was surrounded by a dirt wall, and they were positioned on the dirt wall with machine guns, etcetera. </sentence><sentence id="3003">And we were sure we're all going to be murdered right there on that -- in that basin. </sentence><sentence id="3004">And you know, they -- they were beating people up, and they were screaming and they had their guns drawn, they were very intimidating, and it was just horrible. </sentence><sentence id="3005">And everybody thought this is it, we're going to be executed. </sentence><sentence id="3006">And then eventually, was already beyond dusk, I don't remember, was very, very late, we were all herded back into the ghetto. </sentence><sentence id="3007">And I don't remember how many people were in Terezin at the time, but the ghetto was very full of people. </sentence><sentence id="3008">What -- I've to -- forget what the height of the population was, 40,000 or something like that. </sentence><sentence id="3009">And that was about it, because after we came back, shortly after, there were lots of transports going east out of Terezin. </sentence><sentence id="3010">And while we were in the Bauschowitz basin, the SS searched the -- the houses, the youth homes. </sentence><sentence id="3011">They ripped out mattresses and I don't know what all, they were looking for valuables. </sentence><sentence id="3012">Then they had the excuse that somebody had hidden valuables and money, because you were not supposed to keep any of that. </sentence><sentence id="3013">And actually, I understood -- I was not a witness to that, that in fact in one place in our building, that they found some money somewhere, and that that person was taken into the Kleine Festung, which was a notorious prison. </sentence><sentence id="3014">But I -- I was not an -- an eyewitness to that, I was an eyewitness to when we came back and everything was torn apart. </sentence><sentence id="3015">Yeah, that was a very scary time. </sentence><sentence id="3016">It was -- it was awful. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3039">Q: Now, you mentioned that Edelstein was a wonderful man. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3041">A: Yes. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3043">Q: Ho -- do -- is this by reputation that you say this? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3045">A: Yes, and I met him a few times, not that he had any interest in Uschi Pawel -- Uschi Lenneberg, but there were occasions that he came to the youth home and stuff, and I thought he was a very nice, mild mannered man. </sentence><sentence id="3046">Not everybody in the Judenrat had the same reputation. </sentence><sentence id="3047">Murmelstein had a terrible reputation. </sentence><sentence id="3048">And you see, that is the justice of the world. </sentence><sentence id="3049">Who survived? </sentence><sentence id="3050">Rabbi Murmelstein. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3057">Q: Right. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3059">A: And he had the reputation among us that he was hand in glove with the SS. </sentence><sentence id="3060">And Edelstein was deported to Auschwitz, and so were many of the others. </sentence><sentence id="3061">And one of the people on the Judenrat, Zucker, was on our transport, and also sent right into the gas. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3229">A: Kurt Gerron was a filmmaker from Holland, and he was rounded up by the Nazis, and he was brought to Terezin. </sentence><sentence id="3230">And Kurt, I don't know whether he originally came from Holland, but Iam quite sure I remember that he was -- he was arrested in Holland. </sentence><sentence id="3231">At least that's what I was told. </sentence><sentence id="3232">I see him with -- this reminds me -- of course, this was 1944, of all his equipment, making this film. </sentence><sentence id="3233">And, you know, as I said before, we were a stage, we were the actors. </sentence><sentence id="3234">My kids were -- were in the films. </sentence><sentence id="3235">And as soon as Kurt Gerron had finished the film, he was put into a transport to Auschwitz, and perished. </sentence><sentence id="3236">So yes, I will never forget that. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3284">Q: A few months later your father gets a deportation. </sentence><sentence id="3285">It -- it seems, a -- at least according to your book, that there's a notice that comes to your father about being deported. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3288">A: Yeah, I happened to be in his room --    </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3290">Q: When he got it? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3292">A: Yeah, and he got it, it wasn't sent by mail. </sentence><sentence id="3293">These notices were given to the elders, they were either the room elders or the house elders. </sentence><sentence id="3294">My father was in Q 600 dreizehn, I think it was, 613 in a -- it was like a private home originally. </sentence><sentence id="3295">And the elder -- I was visiting my father in his room, and the elder comes in and hands him the summons from the SS that he has to present himself on such and such a date, and he changed color. </sentence><sentence id="3296">And I never forget that. </sentence><sentence id="3297">And then we had a big struggle, and -- and it was my fault, and -- and it haunted me for years and years. </sentence><sentence id="3298">And I pressed him that we should join him. </sentence><sentence id="3299">And I should have never done that, and he fought me tooth and nail. </sentence><sentence id="3300">And I said to him, "Well, what was the purpose of you and Biibchen going with me? </sentence><sentence id="3301">And then now we're going to be separated again. </sentence><sentence id="3302">I mean, the idea was that we were going to stay together." </sentence><sentence id="3303">So I decided that Papi is going next week, and I am going the week after, and Biibchen is going to be all by himself. </sentence><sentence id="3304">So we went with him, supposedly to a labor camp near Dresden. </sentence><sentence id="3305">See, that was the terrible thing, and they say that Murmelstein knew where we were going, and -- and he helped the Nazis by facilitating, you know, their mirage, we were going to a labor camp. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3320">Q: Now, but you think at this point that your father knows what's going on, because -- </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3321">A: I don't know, he -- all I can tell you is that when he came back from Zossen, which is near Berlin -- </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3322">Q: Right. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3324">A: -- where he worked in Tiefbau supposedly, what was it, for the bunker -- </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3325">Q: Right. </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3326">A: -- that Hitler's bunker, and he came in touch with a lot of other workers from different camps, he seemed like a changed person. </sentence><sentence id="3327">But he also knew that transports were leaving Terezin on a daily -- on a daily is too much, but at -- on a weekly, or sometimes daily basis, to in quote, other labor camps. </sentence><sentence id="3328">So maybe he also felt that we are all going to be getting out of here sooner or later, and now we at least know where we are going, and I can't recall at all, I might have it in my book, what the name of the labor camp was that we were supposed to go to. </sentence><sentence id="3329">It was near Dresden, and my father was familiar with the name, and that sounded pretty good. </sentence><sentence id="3330">And this -- we were told that by the -- by the elder, by Murmelstein, that our transport was going to that place. </sentence><sentence id="3331">And I remember when we were on the train, which eventually ended up in Auschwitz, my father and some of his friends were looking through, you know, it's trying to see where they were, which wasn't always possible, and they f -- one of them said, "Otto," to my father, "we're not going," -- it'll come to me, the name of that place, "where we can't possibly go there, we're alya -- already east of Dresden." </sentence><sentence id="3332">And that's when he changed color, and when it probably sank in, we're not going to a labor camp, we're going east of Dresden, we're going to go to one of the camps in Poland, and I think that -- this is conjecture, I have no proof of that -- I think that maybe he did meet up with people. </sentence><sentence id="3333">He told me that there were people from different -- different ghettos, or whatever he said, who were working with him on the bunker. </sentence><sentence id="3334">And so I think that he got a good idea what was going on in some of the eastern camps. </sentence><sentence id="3335">But I really feel that he believed that our transport was going to a labor camp near Dresden. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3347">Q: But nevertheless, you had to fight with him about going? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3349">A: Yes, I did, and he didn't want me to go. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3351">Q: Right. </sentence><sentence id="3352">And you won. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3355">A: But -- I won, unfortunately, and believe me, it's laid on me -- </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3356">Q: Yeah. </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3357">A: -- for -- it still does to this day. </sentence><sentence id="3358">Because then I figured if we hadn't gone, because there were - - we were not the last transport to leave Terezin, as you know, but maybe we would have had enough of a respite that we would have stayed. </sentence><sentence id="3359">And my father was such a strong, healthy man, that maybe he would have had a chance to survive. </sentence><sentence id="3360">What I really think happened -- and this again, is conjecture -- when we got to Auschwitz, of course you know women and men had -- were separated, and my father was with my brother, and my brother was in his winter coat, it was Poland, and it was October, and you know, that he had outgrown, and he didn't look like a -- you know, very big teenager, and I think Mengele, who happened to select us, probably put my brother on one side, and my father on the other, but my father, I'm sure, would not have let his son go alone, and maybe said can't I go with my son, not knowing where he was going. </sentence><sentence id="3361">Maybe even if he had known where he was going, he wouldn't have let my brother go alone. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3368">Q: Was this at the begin -- do you remember if it was the beginning of October? </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3376">A: Yes. </sentence><sentence id="3377">It was at the beginning of October, yeah. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3380">Q: Well, you know, you couldn't have known either. </sentence><sentence id="3381">You didn't know. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3384">A: No, I -- believe me, it's been on -- it's been -- and you know, I want to tell you something, I never discussed this too much with my mother. </sentence><sentence id="3385">She asked me questions and I told her the truth. </sentence><sentence id="3386">And I don't know, maybe I camouflaged it a little bit, but I couldn't even talk about it, because I really felt that burden for such -- for the rest of my life. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3390">Q: And you still feel it. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3398">Q: You didn't kill them. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3400">A: But it was the wrong thing to do. </sentence><sentence id="3401">Was absolutely the wrong thing to do, cause he really didn't want us to go with him. </sentence><sentence id="3402">Of course, we didn't know that we were fairly close towards the end of the war. </sentence><sentence id="3403">We didn't get -- you know, that's been -- so many times there were hopeful news, that oh, the allies are here, and there, and the Russians are very close, and -- and it never materialized. </sentence><sentence id="3404">So we really didn't know. </sentence><sentence id="3405">But it's -- it's done, you know, it's a long time. </sentence><sentence id="3406">Ma -- ma -- as you get older and you have sons like I do, who are now -- my oldest son is the same age that my father was when he was killed. </sentence><sentence id="3407">You know, I mean, you -- you get from his history, he was a strapping man, he was -- he could do anything, whether it was carpentry or -- or digging ditches, or what. </sentence><sentence id="3408">Physical work -- not everybody was able to do that. </sentence><sentence id="3409">People collapsed, people gave up because they couldn't do it. </sentence><sentence id="3410">Well, he could. </sentence><sentence id="3411">But we came to the point, and I think I had a part in it where you couldn't -- there's nothing you could do. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3424">Q: But you -- you probably need to remember that the family made a decision early on to join you. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3434">Q: So you are separated from your brother and your father, and -- </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3435">A: Right, right. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3437">Q: -- do you know that they were killed immediately? </sentence><sentence id="3438">Is that what you think, or you don't know? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3441">A: Well, I'll tell you how I found out that they were killed. </sentence><sentence id="3442">You know, we got off the train, and we had to form in fives, and I remember trying to look back to see my father and my brother. </sentence><sentence id="3443">This was a huge, huge transport, enormous. </sentence><sentence id="3444">All I could see is a sea of people. </sentence><sentence id="3445">And then looking down towards the camps, all I could see is high tension wires, and barrack after barrack after barrack. </sentence><sentence id="3446">And then we were pushed again to walk past this elegant looking SS officer with shiny boots and leather gloves, either pointing to the left, or to -- pointing to the right. </sentence><sentence id="3447">I didn't -- I didn't know what that meant. </sentence><sentence id="3448">I followed where he pointed to. </sentence><sentence id="3449">And then we had to form in fives again, and there was an SS man to the left of me, and he pushed us into this muddy road, which was snaking between camps. </sentence><sentence id="3450">And whenever a transport arrived in Auschwitz, nobody was allowed to get out of the barrack. </sentence><sentence id="3451">But somehow a woman was outside of the barrack, very close to the electric wire, and recognized somebody in our transport, and screamed out a name, and cried. </sentence><sentence id="3452">And this SS man, who was next to me, fairly young, maybe 18, something like that, with his rifle drawn, screamed at her, "Get in or I'Il shoot you." </sentence><sentence id="3453">And with that he shot her. </sentence><sentence id="3454">And she screamed, and she was lying there, literally in the mud, pooled in her own blood, and I was convinced then I would never get out of there alive. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3469">Q: And that's the first time you thought that? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3471">A: [have ne -- had never seen a person being shot. </sentence><sentence id="3472">There were people being killed in Terezin in the Kleine Festung, but I was not witness to it. </sentence><sentence id="3473">And apparently there were some people shot in the basin when we had the counting, but I didn't -- nobody close to me. </sentence><sentence id="3474">That was the first time I ever saw a person being shot point blank. </sentence><sentence id="3475">And that is something I will never erase out of my mind. </sentence><sentence id="3476">And I think this is when I decided, not consciously, to just not even see what was going on around me. </sentence><sentence id="3477">And then we were, as you know, we're put into a s -- brought into a sauna and </sentence></p><p><sentence id="3478"> stripped of everything. </sentence><sentence id="3479">Our hair was shorn, our body hair was shorn and w-we were screamed at. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="3480">I never forget that sauna for the rest of my life. </sentence><sentence id="3481">It was a very large room, it was a brick building, and there were SS lined -- male SS lined on both sides of the walls, making dirty jokes. </sentence><sentence id="3482">You know, we were all naked while we were being shaved. </sentence><sentence id="3483">And that is too much for anybody to even think reasonably. </sentence><sentence id="3484">I mean -- </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3485">Q: Prisoners shaved you, yes? </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3486">A: Prisoners shaved us. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3488">Q: Did they talk to you at all? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3490">A: No, they were too busy. </sentence><sentence id="3491">And -- and they couldn't even tattoo us any more because by that time they -- they couldn't -- they had so many transports coming in, they weren't tattooing any more. </sentence><sentence id="3492">They did these idiotic things. </sentence><sentence id="3493">They gave us dirty dresses, no underwear, no socks, just wooden clogs and a dirty dress, and this is the -- Poland, the winter, in October. </sentence><sentence id="3494">And then we had to get past another prisoner who had a -- a can of red paint, and put a stripe of glossy red paint on this black, lousy rags that I had on. </sentence><sentence id="3495">I mean, really idiotic things. </sentence><sentence id="3496">And then they pushed that into the muddy road again, it was still raining, and that's when we ended up in Birkenau in one of the -- the barracks. </sentence><sentence id="3497">And they couldn't cope with all the people they had. </sentence><sentence id="3498">Buschi claims we were eight on a cot, Zdena says we were seven on a cot. </sentence><sentence id="3499">It doesn't matter. </sentence><sentence id="3500">We could -- nobody could turn without everybody else turning. </sentence><sentence id="3501">And we never saw utensils. </sentence><sentence id="3502">We -- there was one dirty blanket to cover all of us, and it was so filthy it was horrible. </sentence><sentence id="3503">And then the next morning, people came in to -- or the next day some time, they brought in some soup, some -- you know, in -- ina big canister, and they dished it out into metal dishes, and each plank bed got one metal dish, and we had to use our hands to eat, and it was quite liquid, that stuff. </sentence><sentence id="3504">And whoever could shovel it the faster -- in the fastest got the most. </sentence><sentence id="3505">But I don't remember whether it was the same day, I think </sentence></p><p><sentence id="3506"> it was the following day, that there were a few people who threw themselves against the electric wire. </sentence><sentence id="3507">And men came in to pick up the dead, and -- with pushcarts. </sentence><sentence id="3508">And one of the men was a friend of mine, and he knew my father, too, he was in our transport. </sentence><sentence id="3509">And he -- his wife was also in my camp, and he whispered to his wife, "Tell Uschi that Walter and Otto didn't make it." </sentence><sentence id="3510">And she told me that. </sentence><sentence id="3511">And from that day on, I never had any hope that my father or my brother had survived. </sentence><sentence id="3512">And then, years later, the Holocaust museum, my brother and my father's names are right there. </sentence><sentence id="3513">The wonderful Nazi records -- </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3514">Q: Of who they killed. </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3515">A: Of -- they were killed that same day. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3538">A: No, I don't. </sentence><sentence id="3539">I think I was too occupied with myself. </sentence><sentence id="3540">I was too new in -- in Auschwitz. </sentence><sentence id="3541">I didn't know people well enough. </sentence><sentence id="3542">The only thing that is really imprinted on my memory is this incident, I don't know if -- if you read it in my book, when we had selection and the Hungarian girl fled into our barrack. </sentence><sentence id="3543">I don't -- and I also learned from other prisoners, and I really didn't believe it, that they were doing experiments on people, and I didn't believe that either. </sentence><sentence id="3544">I just -- I mean, I just could not comprehend some of the things that I heard. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3552">Q: So, did you not believe they were gassing people? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3554">A: No, that I believed. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3556">Q: You believed it. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3558">A: I believed that, and I -- and I know that my friends from Terezin, the Hirschfeld's wouldn't have told me that my father and my brother didn't make it into the camp, that was right after I arrived. </sentence><sentence id="3559">And I learned from others in the camp that people were being gassed, and that -- that this -- there was a horrible smell in Auschwitz, too. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3562">Q: I was going to ask you. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3564">A: But I think I experienced that more when I was selected for work. </sentence><sentence id="3565">Well, before I was selected for work, we had this horrendous experience with the Hungarians girls. </sentence><sentence id="3566">They were fairly young girls, and there was as -- some of these people who had been in Auschwitz for any length of time, they didn't look like human beings any more. </sentence><sentence id="3567">They're called the musselmen, a -- I don't know where the heck that came from, but they were really walking skeletons. </sentence><sentence id="3568">And their skin, and the expressions on their faces, and their eyes, th -- cannot be described. </sentence><sentence id="3569">And next to our barrack was a barrack that housed Hungarian women. </sentence><sentence id="3570">A lot of young women, who had been there a relatively long time for Auschwitz, you know, a number of months, and they have been through I think what -- two selections before, so there were no older people left in that barrack, they were all younger pl -- people. </sentence><sentence id="3571">But they were coming closer di -- to the description of these musselmen. </sentence><sentence id="3572">They were in terrible shape. </sentence><sentence id="3573">And they had a selektion, and of course, I did -- never heard of a selektion, we had only been in these barracks for a relatively short time, and they were shooting, and we thought this is it, they're going to just shoot everybody around. </sentence><sentence id="3574">And then one of the girls managed to get into our barrack. </sentence><sentence id="3575">And apparently another girl was killed, was shot by the SS, but our elder, our block elder knew this girl, and they had been in Auschwitz for a long time, and apparently she has -- had escaped selektions a number of times. </sentence><sentence id="3576">And here we were fairly new, and all this was -- we were being told all these horrors that I couldn't digest. </sentence><sentence id="3577">And here, I will never forget this girl, she's standing there at the end of the barrack, and the block elder, who seemed like a pretty brutal woman herself, was shielding her. </sentence><sentence id="3578">And she told us that she'd been there for such and such a time, she'd been selected a few times, and that people were being selected after they were not physically strong any more, and they were being gassed. </sentence><sentence id="3579">And she gave such a vivid description and she told us about how many of her friends had been -- had been gassed, that it finally dawned on me, ma -- maybe this is true. </sentence><sentence id="3580">Maybe this is so. </sentence><sentence id="3581">It wasn't just when you come there that they select you like Mengele, but they select you afterwards. </sentence><sentence id="3582">Now that was -- that wa -- made a terrible impression on me. </sentence><sentence id="3583">And then shortly after that, we had a selektion for work. </sentence><sentence id="3584">And it was a fairly large table outside, and it was pretty cold, and we had to all strip naked again, and walk in front of this table. </sentence><sentence id="3585">And there was a man, a representative from industry at one end, and two SS officers at that table. </sentence><sentence id="3586">And he selected very few people. </sentence><sentence id="3587">And we were kind of standing in line, naked. </sentence><sentence id="3588">And when I got to this man from industry, he asked me to show him my hands, which I did. </sentence><sentence id="3589">I -- I don't have a very small, fancy hand. </sentence><sentence id="3590">And then h-he motioned obviously that he was going to take me for work at the factory he represented. </sentence><sentence id="3591">And the people selected for work, as I said before, were a relatively small number. </sentence><sentence id="3592">And we were then pushed into the road again, and you know, we had -- we could put a -- we only had a dress anyway, put our dress on, was pushed into the road. </sentence><sentence id="3593">And we were put into a s -- we were in front of another sauna, a bath house, and by that time, I believe that people were being gassed, because we could smell the burning flesh, really. </sentence><sentence id="3594">And when the SS guard told us that we had to strip naked before we even got into the shower house, the sauna, I really thought that was it, because I also had learned that people were gassed in a sauna, that the gas came through the shower heads. </sentence><sentence id="3595">So it was welcome when we felt the ice cold water dripping on our skin. </sentence><sentence id="3596">And we again just got a shift, and no underwear, no socks. </sentence><sentence id="3597">And we were pushed into the road and we ended up in a women's camp, which had mostly non-Jews in it. </sentence><sentence id="3598">I believe they were all Polish, at least the ones I saw. </sentence><sentence id="3599">The elder was a Pole. </sentence><sentence id="3600">And they had different insignias, which I learned there designated whether they were political prisoners or murderers. </sentence><sentence id="3601">And I understood from people there that the block elder was a murderer, that this particular triangle or whatever she wore, represented the identification of a murderess. </sentence><sentence id="3602">And she was very brutal, and horrible, and she beat people very readily. </sentence><sentence id="3603">And she s -- put -- she gave us different chores to do, and one of the chores that she dished out for me, was to carry the feces to the latrines during the night, with another woman, and accompanied by a Nazi guard. </sentence><sentence id="3604">You know, the women were not SS, they were Nazi guards in uniform. </sentence><sentence id="3605">And I shall never forget that night. </sentence><sentence id="3606">It was a very dark night, and there was a horrible    smell, and the whole sky was bright red. </sentence><sentence id="3607">And these very tall chimneys were spewing particles into the air. </sentence><sentence id="3608">And the woman who carried the buckets with me, who had been in Auschwitz a lot longer than I had, she said, "Another transport must have arrived. </sentence><sentence id="3609">These are our people going through the chimney." </sentence><sentence id="3610">You know, a normal person would have collapsed right there and there, and I don't think things really penetrated. </sentence><sentence id="3611">We had much better bedding and plank beds. </sentence><sentence id="3612">They were the same size, but instead of, you know, eight people, or whatever, or seven or whatever we were on one, there were three of us. </sentence><sentence id="3613">One was Zdena from Prague, and one was Buschi from Amsterdam. </sentence><sentence id="3614">And we became friends for life. </sentence><sentence id="3615">And one day we were told to get ready for work and we were marched to the railroad trestle, and we were put into a transport. </sentence><sentence id="3616">And I cannot recall how long we were on transport, but then the trains stopped eventually -- because we were in cattle cars, and there was really no way -- you know, some cattle cars were older, and they were - - you -- you had an idea, looking through some of the little spaces, but there weren't too many spaces to be found. </sentence><sentence id="3617">And we ended up in a place called Kudowa-Sackisch. </sentence><sentence id="3618">In other words, we had been going west, not east. </sentence><sentence id="3619">This was an airplane factory, and the man who had selected me worked -- was a representative of that airplane factory. </sentence><sentence id="3620">And I never forget that night. </sentence><sentence id="3621">We were so happy. </sentence><sentence id="3622">The beds were better, the blankets were wonderful, the food was better. </sentence><sentence id="3623">And, for the first time, we had shower, a hot shower, and we got a piece of soap. </sentence><sentence id="3624">And then the next morning we had to form a circle in the factory yard, and the German foreman stepped into the middle of that circle, and he looked around, and he decided he didn't like anybody to work for him in the factory who wore eyeglasses. </sentence><sentence id="3625">I wore glasses and Zdena wore glasses, Buschi did not. </sentence><sentence id="3626">And he -- we stepped forward. </sentence><sentence id="3627">At first I didn't want to step forward. </sentence><sentence id="3628">And Buschi said to me, "Haven't we played enough fate?" </sentence><sentence id="3629">You know, and she was referring to my volunteering to go with my father, and my father and my brother going with me, and I put my glasses back on. </sentence><sentence id="3630">And of course he selected me to step forward, and Zdena step forward. </sentence><sentence id="3631">And then for some reason, he told Buschi to step forward. </sentence><sentence id="3632">And you know, either Zdena or I said to her, "But you don't wear glasses." </sentence><sentence id="3633">So, I never forget Buschi's words. </sentence><sentence id="3634">She said, "That's fate. </sentence><sentence id="3635">It's supposed to be that way." " </sentence><sentence id="3636">Das ist das Schicksal. </sentence><sentence id="3637">Es soll so sein." </sentence><sentence id="3638">And there were six of us, and he called us garbage, rejects, who were not going to work in his factory, and we were going to be sent back to Auschwitz. </sentence><sentence id="3639">And we were rounded up by a woman, a Nazi guard, but she was different from any of the guards that we had encountered. </sentence><sentence id="3640">She didn't scream at us, she was kind of nice, she ki -- she somehow behaved as if she didn't belong there. </sentence><sentence id="3641">Now, I don't know what her history was, whether she wad -- was drafted into that, who knows? </sentence><sentence id="3642">But she -- she took us to the railroad trestle, and then I did something I felt terrible about for a long, long time. </sentence><sentence id="3643">And Buschi and Hannah and Zdena were very upset with me, because they felt very strongly that I had saved their lives. </sentence><sentence id="3644">It wasn't just -- there was one other woman. </sentence><sentence id="3645">There were two other women who felt the same way, but we kind of lost contact after liberation. </sentence><sentence id="3646">And I pleaded with this guard, and I told you she seemed more accessible, because I would have never dreamt to do this in Auschwitz with any guard. </sentence><sentence id="3647">And I pleaded for my life, and I told her that I shouldn't be there. </sentence><sentence id="3648">I was really not Jewish. </sentence><sentence id="3649">My mother was a Christian and I -- I shouldn't be here. </sentence><sentence id="3650">And she answered in a way like somebody would who really felt badly about it. </sentence><sentence id="3651">And she said, "But there's nothing I can do about it." " </sentence><sentence id="3652">Kann nicht sta fur mat -- kann nicht daran tun." </sentence><sentence id="3653">And then she left us, asked us to -- first she asked us to stay together, there were six, we didn't know the others. </sentence><sentence id="3654">And she was flirting with two German soldiers who were accompanying the train. </sentence><sentence id="3655">In the meantime we realized that there was one other German woman, she had lived in Prague. </sentence><sentence id="3656">We never got too close with her, she was much older than most of us. </sentence><sentence id="3657">And there was another Czech woman, Hanka, she was a communist, through and through. </sentence><sentence id="3658">And I can say that I never felt a relationship with Hanka. </sentence><sentence id="3659">I mean, we all helped each other, but it wasn't the same relationship I felt with Buschi and Hannah and Zdena. </sentence><sentence id="3660">And there was one woman, Hannah, and we three became very close friends. </sentence><sentence id="3661">And then one of the soldiers came to us. </sentence><sentence id="3662">In the meantime -- I must say this first, there were hundreds of inmates on the railroad trestle. </sentence><sentence id="3663">They were Hungarian workers who had worked in the factory, and who -- they had worked these women practically to death. </sentence><sentence id="3664">They could hardly stand, they had open sores, impetigo, whatever it was, they were in horrible shape. </sentence><sentence id="3665">And they had been pushed by the SS into cattle cars until the cattle cars were full to the brim, and then they locked the cattle cars. </sentence><sentence id="3666">And our guard had stayed with us in the meantime, and then had gone over to the soldiers, and the SS had left. </sentence><sentence id="3667">Because I think that we were the responsibility of that Nazi guard. </sentence><sentence id="3668">And then one of the soldiers came over and told us to follow him and he put us into the last cattle car. </sentence><sentence id="3669">And we were the only six in this huge cattle car, and then he locked the cattle car. </sentence><sentence id="3670">And I have no idea any more, and I'm not sure even would have had an idea when we came -- when we finally ended up in Merzdorf, how long we had been in the cattle car. </sentence><sentence id="3671">But the soldiers finally opened the door and joined us in the cattle car. </sentence><sentence id="3672">One was relatively young, and you know, the -- Hannah thinks this guy was this old, I don't remember. </sentence><sentence id="3673">And the younger of the soldiers cried, and he told his buddy that if his people did that to human beings, he didn't want to live any more. </sentence><sentence id="3674">And they gave us bread, they gave us cheese, they gave us privacy. </sentence><sentence id="3675">I mean, we hadn't seen white bread for years, and cheese. </sentence><sentence id="3676">And they gave us privacy to use a bucket. </sentence><sentence id="3677">And we sat in this huge cattle car in one corner, and deciding what are we going to do when we return to Auschwitz. </sentence><sentence id="3678">And the only language that Hannah, Zdena, and the -- and the other Czech girl, and I and the -- the -- the German girl we didn't have too much close relationship with, spoke, was German, because they were all educated people, and this -- most of the Czechs spoke German, and of course the Dutch do. </sentence><sentence id="3679">And Buschi's family originally came from Germany anyway, so I don't remember whether she had some German grandparents or what. </sentence><sentence id="3680">And Buschi and I decided that we were going to throw each -- ourselves against the electric wire instead of being gassed. </sentence><sentence id="3681">And the German soldiers heard that, you know, we spoke their language. </sentence><sentence id="3682">And the train came to a standstill. </sentence><sentence id="3683">| have no idea what they did while we were in the cattle car before the train left Auschwitz -- left the labor camp that we had been in before. </sentence><sentence id="3684">They must have spoken to the engineer of the train. </sentence><sentence id="3685">They must have coordinated it somehow. </sentence><sentence id="3686">But on the other hand, you have to realize that this was the very beginning of 1945, and things weren't looking too great for the Germans. </sentence><sentence id="3687">So they told us to jump out of the cattle car and follow them. </sentence><sentence id="3688">And when we got onto the platform, we realized it said Merzdorf, it did not say Auschwitz. </sentence><sentence id="3689">And we followed them through the small village of Merzdorf. </sentence><sentence id="3690">It's a very mountainous region. </sentence><sentence id="3691">It's a beautiful region. </sentence><sentence id="3692">It was very cold. </sentence><sentence id="3693">It was probably the very beginning of January, with snow and ice on the road. </sentence><sentence id="3694">And here are these decrepit looking women, with a thin shift, and wooden clogs, no hair, following uniformed German soldiers through the village of Merzdorf. </sentence><sentence id="3695">And the villagers were coming out of their doors look -- staring after us. </sentence><sentence id="3696">And we went through a big gate, into a work camp. </sentence><sentence id="3697">It said, "Kamsta, Mettner and Frahne," it was a factory. </sentence><sentence id="3698">They made linens there, which we later found out, from the original raw material of flax. </sentence><sentence id="3699">And they told us to wait, and then they went to see the commander of the camp, who was a woman. </sentence><sentence id="3700">The most vulgar looking woman I've ever seen in my life, Anna Rinke. </sentence><sentence id="3701">She might only have weighed 300 pounds, I remember her weighing 400 pounds. </sentence><sentence id="3702">She was tall and big. </sentence><sentence id="3703">She was bursting out of her Nazi uniform. </sentence><sentence id="3704">And she stood in front of these soldiers, quite a ways from us. </sentence><sentence id="3705">We were on one side of this very big area, within the factory buildings -- yard, and -- and they had to get into her place on the other side. </sentence><sentence id="3706">And all I remember her coming out and screaming at them, "I don't want them here, get them out of here, send them back to Auschwitz. </sentence><sentence id="3707">That's it." </sentence><sentence id="3708">And they stood in front of her, they gave the Nazi salute, they clicked their heels, they left us there, they never looked back. </sentence><sentence id="3709">So, with all my hatred for Germans, we owe our lives to these soldiers. </sentence><sentence id="3710">And not a letter or a telephone call for many years, whether it was from Hannah, or Zdena, or Buschi, without questioning if we only would know the names or where these people are, they saved our lives, I'm sure at a considerable risk to themselves. </sentence><sentence id="3711">But again, they probably couldn't have taken that risk if we would have come there much earlier than we did. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3867">Q: So she let you in? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3869">A: She had no choice. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3871">Q: She had no choice because you were standing there. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3873">A: The train was gone, we had no choice, I guess. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3875">Q: I want to ask you two sort of si -- simple questions. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3877">A: Yeah. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3879">Q: Ho -- how did you know it was Mengele in Auschwitz? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3881">A: I was told that in the camp by some of the people who had been in the camp longer than we were, and especially by the Hungarian girl. </sentence><sentence id="3882">And they described him to me, and I remember him. </sentence><sentence id="3883">I certainly wouldn't have recognized his features. </sentence><sentence id="3884">I don't think I would have had the guts to look in his face. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3889">Q: Right. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3891">A: And I only later learned that there were other physicians or SS who were selecting. </sentence><sentence id="3892">But I was told, and I took this, that they knew what they were talking about, that these transports were selected by Mengele. </sentence><sentence id="3893">And I was told then, for the first time, that -- by is -- people, you know, in the camp, who had been in Auschwitz much longer, that they were doing experiments on people, which also didn't penetrate my he -- my brain. </sentence><sentence id="3894">I mean, I -- I didn't know what they were talking about. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3899">Q: The other question is, how in heaven's name were you able to keep your glasses? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3901">A: Well, that I don't know. </sentence><sentence id="3902">You tell me. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3905">Q: Well, I don't know. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3907">A: I don't know. </sentence><sentence id="3908">I had a pair of glasses, they had a pearl matte frame, and I had them when I left Diisseldorf. </sentence><sentence id="3909">I was very careful with my glasses because my vision was very poor since my birth. </sentence><sentence id="3910">And I can't comprehend it, because here I'm in this country with wonderful technology, and it wasn't too long ago, with a different pair of glasses than these that I was accompanying a friend to the hospital and the lens fell out on the floor. </sentence><sentence id="3911">And these glasses lasted. </sentence><sentence id="3912">I think they were thicker glasses in those days, the frames were thicker, I don't know. </sentence><sentence id="3913">I was very careful with them because they were part of my life. </sentence><sentence id="3914">I can't see without glasses. </sentence><sentence id="3915">When I was in Terezin, I had a special place for them on my bunkbed, and the girls would never go into my bunkbed, that was my bunkbed. </sentence><sentence id="3916">When I was in Auschwitz, I didn't take them off at all, ever. </sentence><sentence id="3917">When I came into the next camp, where I've met Buschi and Zdena, I also kept them on the bunkbed, or on my nose. </sentence><sentence id="3918">And the same in Merzdorf. </sentence><sentence id="3919">And believe me, I was really frightened that something could happen to them. </sentence><sentence id="3920">But I wasn't beaten up ever, which would have caused them to be thrown on the floor, so they somehow survived. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3935">Q: I was actually more curious in Auschwitz, even though you weren't tattooed, you were shaved, and you went through the sauna. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3937">A: Yeah. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3939">Q: So did you hold them in your hand? </sentence><sentence id="3940">Did you hide them from people? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3943">A: That I don't remember. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3945">Q: Because they took things away from everybody. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3947">A: Yeah, but they -- </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3949">Q: They didn't touch you? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3951">A: 1 -- [kept my glasses. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3953">Q: It's interesting. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3955">A: They must have been on my nose, because if I had them -- I don't recall putting them in my -- but the same thing with Zdena. </sentence><sentence id="3956">Zdena came from the sa -- it was a ta -- same transport as I, and Zdena wore glasses, and they didn't take her glasses either. </sentence><sentence id="3957">They took the glasses, of course, of people who were gassed. </sentence><sentence id="3958">So, whether they took glasses routinely of people they were sending to work, would it make sense to take glasses away from people you want to work -- for -- who -- who have to work for you? </sentence><sentence id="3959">I don't know. </sentence><sentence id="3960">But of our six, Zdena and I were the only ones who wore glasses, I think. </sentence><sentence id="3961">Hannah doesn't wear glasses. </sentence><sentence id="3962">So while the others were -- he probably didn't like them. </sentence><sentence id="3963">One of them was pretty short. </sentence><sentence id="3964">I don't know. </sentence><sentence id="3965">It's -- it's -- it's, you know -- I have -- </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3966">Q: It's a mystery. </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3967">A: It's a mystery. </sentence><sentence id="3968">It's -- it's -- it's an absolute mystery. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3971">Q: Right, right. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3973">A: No, I have no clue. </sentence><sentence id="3974">And I was very -- I was very much aware of the necessity of guarding my glasses, yeah. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3977">Q: Okay, we have to change the tape. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3996">Q: Hilde is Buschi. </sentence><sentence id="3997">Oh, okay. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="4000">A: Right, that was her nickname. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="4002">Q: Okay. </sentence><sentence id="4003">Did you meet in Auschwitz? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="4006">A: Yes, we met in that women's camp, which was mostly all -- not all of them, only Buschi and - - and Zdena and I, and then we met the other ones when we were round -- when we were rounded up in Kudowa, and we were rejects. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="4008">Q: Uh-huh. </sentence><sentence id="4009">Yes. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="4012">A: But only -- only Zdena and -- and Buschi and I met in Auschwitz. </sentence><sentence id="4013">And Hannah and -- and the others two, we met when we are all rejected. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="4016">Q: Right. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="4018">A: Yeah. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="4020">Q: And what was it about all of you that you think brought you together and allowed you to be so good for each other? </sentence><sentence id="4021">Do you have any idea? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="4024">A: Well, I think that Hanka, who -- just to differentiate her from Hannah, she was Czech, and sh -- ""m sure she was a communist. </sentence><sentence id="4025">I mean, we all knew she was a communist. </sentence><sentence id="4026">I -- I had nothing to do with her -- with her communism, but her whole manner and all this, I'm not sure that if it would just -- just been Hanka, that we would have become very good friends, okay? </sentence><sentence id="4027">But we were the six who were selected to be sent back to Auschwitz. </sentence><sentence id="4028">And so we really stuck together. </sentence><sentence id="4029">My closest friends were Buschi and Zdena and Hannah. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="4036">Q: So ha -- </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="4037">A: And the other two, Hanka and I forget the other name, the -- the other German woman, she had lived in Prague for awhile, she was considerably older, and I was the youngest of the whole group. </sentence><sentence id="4038">They called me das Kind. </sentence><sentence id="4039">And Hannah, when they used to call home, and Hans would talk to -- they would never talk to each other that how is Uschi, [indecipherable] macht das Kind, you know. </sentence><sentence id="4040">The Czechs speak some German too, but the -- my husband very seldom spoke German, but it was always when they referred to me as th -- some Kind, you know? </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="4041">Q: Right. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="4043">A: And -- and Hannah is still kidding about it, yeah. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="4045">Q: So this was -- this became another family for you. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="4047">A: It became a family. </sentence><sentence id="4048">Zdena and Buschi and I worked outdoors in transport, and the other girls worked in the factory and I don't think that we three could have survived without the girls in the factory, because they stole flax and -- and yarn, and we made warmers to put in our wooden clogs, on our head, and chest warmers, and I think that was a horrible winter in those mountains, and I don't think we could have survived. </sentence><sentence id="4049">We supported each other constantly. </sentence><sentence id="4050">We more often found something in the garbage at the railroad station because we had to unload coal cars, and flax cars, than they did. </sentence><sentence id="4051">They had no way to get anything. </sentence><sentence id="4052">And anything we found we would    carry back to the camp and divide it between the six of us, we would never eat it alone. </sentence><sentence id="4053">If somebody was sick, we supported them. </sentence><sentence id="4054">We -- it was taking your life into your own hands if you -- if you even went to the so-called doctor, who happened to be a -- a dentist. </sentence><sentence id="4055">There were no medicines anyway, and I never was sick except for one day when I'm sure I had a fever and I was ready to topple over, and Sunday were wonderful days in Merzdorf for Anna Rinke, she would torture us standing for hours and hours. </sentence><sentence id="4056">It was very cold, and I was ready to pass out. </sentence><sentence id="4057">And both Zdena and Buschi were much taller than I was, especially Zdena was very tall. </sentence><sentence id="4058">And sh -- Zdena stood in front, and Buschi in back and they literally supported me. </sentence><sentence id="4059">Because to -- to -- in those -- at that time still, if you told them you were sick, I mean, there was always a danger they could transport you back to an extermination camp. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="4074">Q: Did -- could you notice, or did you notice that other women in the camp were doing something similar, or was -- were -- the working of your group was unusual? </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="4078">Q: It was unique. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="4080">A: I think we were unique, and then we were the last ones to arrive in Merzdorf, and there was a large cons -- contingent of Hungarian women there, who were constantly fighting which is -- which -- with each other, or cooking together, you know, imaginary cooking. </sentence><sentence id="4081">And they were -- there was -- there were a few Germans -- German Jews, but the rest of them were all Poles, Polish Jews. </sentence><sentence id="4082">And they didn't want to have anything to do with us, especially the Polish Jews, who had been there much longer than any one of us, so any new person who arrived was just -- they probably felt depriving them of food and so -- you know, it's -- it's very hard to understand, we were all Jews, but we -- we were not supportive of each other. </sentence><sentence id="4083">I hate to say this, but that's -- that's the way it was. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="4088">Q: So you saw a lot of conflict? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="4090">A: I saw conflict, and I didn't -- I did not see a group that stuck together the way we did. </sentence><sentence id="4091">And some of the Polish Jews who had been there for a much longer time, some of them had better positions, some of them worked in th -- in the kitchens, and they knew each other, and they would give food to -- to others, you know, who came from similar background. </sentence><sentence id="4092">But relatively speaking, we were not in aush -- i-in Merzdorf that long. </sentence><sentence id="4093">From January to liberation, which seemed like a lifetime, but without that friendship, you know -- and I was very lucky that I was asked to spread salt, rock salt on the scales. </sentence><sentence id="4094">The s -- some of the stuff coming in had to be weighed, and the scales were all frozen, they weren't working, so I was given the job of spreading rock salt. </sentence><sentence id="4095">So I reasoned, if cattle can eat rock salt, why can't we? </sentence><sentence id="4096">And the camp had run out of salt for months. </sentence><sentence id="4097">And that is very weakening whe -- when you have to work. </sentence><sentence id="4098">So I stuffed my pockets full of rock salt, and the six of us lived off that rock salt until liberation. </sentence><sentence id="4099">And we -- we dug up horse -- we f -- I found -- I don't know if I found, or Buschi, or one of us found a horseradish patch, which we dug up. </sentence><sentence id="4100">And I think the Nazi guard probably realized we were doing it. </sentence><sentence id="4101">And it was coming towards the end of the war, and one of the worst guards ever, we called her Pigface -- and I knew there was hope one day when I was coming up the stairs onto our dormitory and the SS were a fl -- a flight above, and she was coming down the stairs, Pigface. </sentence><sentence id="4102">She looked like a pig. </sentence><sentence id="4103">She was very brutal and horrible, and she had this porcelain dish, which had sauerkraut and mashed potatoes, that's all I remember, there might have been something else on it. </sentence><sentence id="4104">She shoved that onto me, and she said, "Friss." </sentence><sentence id="4105">Now friss is -- is a word that is not used for human beings, that shows you what she thought of us. </sentence><sentence id="4106">You only talk frisson about pigs, about animals. </sentence><sentence id="4107">There is a big distinction in the German language. </sentence><sentence id="4108">So I was on the level of an animal, but at least something was in the wind. </sentence><sentence id="4109">Pigface was giving me her dish with food, and I was delighted, and I carried it up to the dorm, and of course we all shared it. </sentence><sentence id="4110">And we thought this was a good omen. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="4133">Q: What was your physical condition? </sentence><sentence id="4134">Had you deteriorated a great deal, or -- </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="4135">A: I was very, very thin, but I think I was relatively healthy. </sentence><sentence id="4136">I -- I th -- I think -- I know that Buschi and Zdena and I were healthier than the other three girls, and -- and I believe that it was the fresh air, and the physical work, even though we got very little to eat, | mean, watery soup. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="4139">But we did find some discarded carrots in the garbage, and we found some turnips in the garbage, and we ate grass. </sentence><sentence id="4140">So that somehow -- actually, I was stronger, and Buschi too, even though she was quite a bit older than I was, even than Zdena. </sentence><sentence id="4141">Because after liberation, they all -- w-we got these six bikes from the Russian officer, and we were all going to bike to Prague, and the girls couldn't do it. </sentence><sentence id="4142">Only Buschi and I. Even Zdena got weak, but Buschi and I were able to do it. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="4200">A: I think the Russians were coming in too fast, because the -- the German soldier opened the door, and the -- I think the Russians were coming in the afternoon. </sentence><sentence id="4201">And the first Russian soldier was on a bicycle, believe it or not. </sentence><sentence id="4202">And he -- you know, he was just trying to find out what was going on, and -- and he later identified himself as Jewish. </sentence><sentence id="4203">But a lot of these Russian Jews, they weren't very Jewish, you know, they -- but he said he was really born a Jew, too. </sentence></p></dialogue>
