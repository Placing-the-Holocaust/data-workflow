established that no gentile had...be permitted to come into that area and no Jew is permitted to go out. </sentence><sentence id="149">It was difficult to reinforce this because the borders of that ghetto were quite uh loose, so it happened that these Jews were able to communicate with the farmers. </sentence><sentence id="150">Having done commerce and business with them for so many years, they knew each other and uh life was naturally easier than in the bigger cities. </sentence><sentence id="151">Uh we had problems with food. </sentence><sentence id="152">I saw immediately that uh uh I
