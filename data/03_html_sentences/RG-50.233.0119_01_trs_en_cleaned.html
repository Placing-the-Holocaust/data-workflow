<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="138">Q: So he went to public school and also to.....? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="140">A: Yes, he went to public school and after public school he went to cheder, to a Jewish school, like everybody else. </sentence><sentence id="141">From eight to twelve or one, we went to public school. </sentence><sentence id="142">Then in the afternoon, from two on, I think we went to cheder. </sentence><sentence id="143">And when the war broke out there was nothing left anymore, what else, there is nothing. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="148">Q: Did he ever help on the work detail? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="150">A: Well, when he started, when he was twelve years old, he was sent out like everybody else, work details. </sentence><sentence id="151">It was arranged by the Judenrat, by the Jewish Council for the Germans to come and grab people from the streets, their houses, so it was arranged how many was in the work force from the ghetto, so everybody got a card that this and this day he has to report to work. </sentence><sentence id="152">They worked, they sent them out, since he became 12, he worked, came out two or three times a week to go to work, in the winter mostly by snow and the summer on the roads and other things. </sentence><sentence id="153">And we lived together because in the ghetto we moved in the apartment where Leibush lived; so happens that this apartment was in the place where the part of the ghetto was at. </sentence><sentence id="154">And we got the room and we worked together, we lived together. </sentence><sentence id="155">He wasn't, it wasn't so bad because my brother he was a member of the Judenrat, the first Judenrat and he was selected by the about which we will talk later and then later he was arrested but, in the book it's written how he was released because only three Jews were released from jail, the rest were killed, the whole Judenrat. </sentence><sentence id="156">Leibush's father is still in the ghetto, he had his store because this was the place that he was not thrown out. </sentence><sentence id="157">So, how much he could buy and market things and this way he was not bad off in the ghetto. </sentence><sentence id="158">They had enough, everything. </sentence><sentence id="159">Until it was the transport to J and J to Belges and then they were killed. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="171">Q: So they lived in an apartment, that's what they had? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="173">A: Well, they had an apartment, the apartment was of two large rooms and a large kitchen, so when we moved into the ghetto we took over the large kitchen, I say we, I mean my father, my mother, and I and two sisters. </sentence><sentence id="174">So we had the kitchen, and he with his three children had the bedroom, so we lived together what we used the same kitchen and they had this one room. </sentence><sentence id="175">But he also had, in the basement, he had the store still, there was not too much merchandise, but how much he could buy from black marketeeers, so he had, and he was busy in the store. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="179">Q: So he lived above the store? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="181">A: He lived above the basement, yeah, and we lived in the same.....and he was lucky in this time that his apartment, his store was in the ghetto. </sentence><sentence id="182">Like for us, they threw us out from our house and to go into the ghetto, but he was there, so we came to live with him. </sentence><sentence id="183">Now, if we wouldn't live from him there would be other people, but this way when we took it over, so nobody else came in the house. </sentence><sentence id="184">But the main thing is from Shulim, also here you have written down 1945, Shulim was born the same year as Richard, my older brother's son, but Richard was born in America. </sentence><sentence id="185">My brother had moved there after a pogrom in our town in 1919. </sentence><sentence id="186">I always think of these two, Richard now a doctor in America, Shulim killed in Poland at 13, not 13 but 12. </sentence><sentence id="187">See the people are so stupid, they know by he was born in 1930 and he was killed in 1942, but here they mark down 13. </sentence><sentence id="188">So he was born when he was 12 years old. </sentence><sentence id="189">So this, I think, this is a very nice sentence, that to compare those two, Richard now a doctor in America and Shulim killed in   Poland at the age of twelve. </sentence><sentence id="190">So, what you can write too much, but I think what you have is enough material. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="202">Q: Anything distinguishing about his mother that you remember? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="204">A: Well, his mother was a housewife and she took care of -- nothing distinguished. </sentence><sentence id="205">She took care on the house and Leibush took care on the store, but nothing special. </sentence><sentence id="206">But maybe to mark down that Leibush survived the war. </sentence><sentence id="207">That Leibush survived the war with me in the woods and died in America in 1960. </sentence><sentence id="208">Okay, now we have this, we have this and they will be the same kind of passports, the new ones? </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="347">Q: Not just coffee, everything? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="349">A: Everything, they took everything, they took even personal things, everything because they said that he ---. </sentence><sentence id="350">They took away everything, we had a lot of merchandise because this merchandise could be sold and we could have money, but they took away everything. </sentence><sentence id="351">My father ran away, and then because he was afraid that they will arrest him, I run away and this time I run away to Russia, which later I came back. </sentence><sentence id="352">And he, and this man wanted to become the president because the Germans said you have to organize a Jewish council, but the Jews knew if he would become council, it would be very bad for the Jews because he was, like I said. </sentence><sentence id="353">Before the war everybody knew somebody wanted to have a witness in court, if there was a court case and they needed a witness, he would always be a witness for money, naturally. </sentence><sentence id="354">So even there was here in America there are sayings if I speak to some people from Kolbuszowa and I ask them something and they don't want to tell me a lie, so they said, what do you think, I am this and this? </sentence><sentence id="355">I don't want to mention his name because he has his family. </sentence><sentence id="356">So they say, what do you think I am him? </sentence><sentence id="357">He was known that he is -- for money he can be a witness. </sentence><sentence id="358">So then we Jews knew that if he would become the president it would be bad for Jews because he would collaborate with the Germans. </sentence><sentence id="359">So the Jews started to speak to prominent Polish Catholics, especially to the mayor, who we told him that we are very concerned that he would become the president, not only this, because if he will be president he will pick out members, his friends, his like, and then it will be bad. </sentence><sentence id="360">We the Jews, I say we, I say the Jews themselves, say the only one who could actually be stronger than him is Dr. Anderman, he didn't look Jewish, I mean he didn't have a beard, most of the Jews had beards and he spoke beautiful German because he started in Vienna and he was a proud man and he would never -- he would be able to protect the Jews. </sentence><sentence id="361">A group of Jewish people went to him and they said to him he should become so he said, I was never involved with Jewish things, I am a doctor. </sentence><sentence id="362">I don't want to be a politician, and I don't want to have a job like this. </sentence><sentence id="363">The Jews begged him, they told him, look if you don't do it, you are the only one, can protect us from this man and he knew that this man is no good for the Jews. </sentence><sentence id="364">Well, anyway, after a few times. </sentence><sentence id="365">I remember my father went to him and others, he said all right, I will do it against my judgment, I will do it, only on one condition. </sentence><sentence id="366">If I will -- he had to pick out ten or twelve members of the council, -- only if I can pick out the people I want. </sentence><sentence id="367">So, he made the list and he picked out mostly younger people, mostly people without beards, and that shouldn't be, again, the Germans shouldn't dislike them and also, people who were in the Jewish community leaders before the war. </sentence><sentence id="368">They were people, respected citizens, and people who were quite well off and he picked out this Jewish council which included my brother Leibush, and my brother-in-law Sh , well younger people. </sentence><sentence id="369">He organized the Jewish council which was a blessing for Kolbuszowa because before the Germans used to grab people from the streets from their houses for work. </sentence><sentence id="370">He organized and made lists,   and everything that had to be done was done through the organization. </sentence><sentence id="371">If you want more details, in the book I have more details about Anderman. </sentence></p></dialogue>
