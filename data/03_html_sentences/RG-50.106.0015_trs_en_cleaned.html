<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="161">A: Yes, but there's a big event before that. </sentence><sentence id="162">My father had lung cancer. </sentence><sentence id="163">And he died in 1936, when | was 16 years old. </sentence><sentence id="164">And that was very hard on me because | was very close to my father, much more so than to my mother. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="169">Q: And how did that change your life and your mother's life? </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="207">A: Well, we knew quite a bit. </sentence><sentence id="208">Perhaps not I, but my mother had a very close friend in Germany, in Oldham (ph). </sentence><sentence id="209">And this woman came to us once a year, usually, and my mother went to visit her. </sentence><sentence id="210">And she smuggled out some money from Germany before they immigrated to Argentina. </sentence><sentence id="211">So we knew what was going on there. </sentence><sentence id="212">And then, also, Hitler occupied Austria in 1938 and one of my mother's brothers lived in Vienna. </sentence><sentence id="213">So they all immigrated first to Czechoslovakia to Berdenau (ph) before they attempted to get a visa to someplace else. </sentence><sentence id="214">And they did eventually go to France and from France to unoccupied France. </sentence><sentence id="215">And they got to America maybe 1940, 1939 or "40. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="225">Q: Do you remember being particularly frightened in 1938? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="227">A: Not really. </sentence><sentence id="228">But that was perhaps because | was so naive, you know? </sentence><sentence id="229">| grew up in a very protected way. </sentence><sentence id="230">And | was rather childish at that age. </sentence><sentence id="231">And my mother used to  ontactrefieannedjustanmiang er hither btemelortabnattfiexaliaton Doris Rauch 8 July 7, 1995 Page 8 say, "Nothing will happen to us. </sentence><sentence id="232">I'm happy here as long as | have a roof over my head." </sentence><sentence id="233">That was her constant saying. </sentence><sentence id="234">| would have liked to immigrate, but it wasn't easy because we didn't have any money out anywhere. </sentence><sentence id="235">And it was very difficult to get a visa to anyplace. </sentence><sentence id="236">But some of my friends succeeded, but we didn't. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="247">Q: Alright. </sentence><sentence id="248">And now it's 1938. </sentence><sentence id="249">Any other changes that you can recall? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="253">A: Yes. </sentence><sentence id="254">Of course, | graduated from gymnasium in 1938. </sentence><sentence id="255">But | could no longer go to a university. </sentence><sentence id="256">That was 193--. </sentence><sentence id="257">You know, | don't remember how that was. </sentence><sentence id="258">Anyhow, | could not study. </sentence><sentence id="259">And my mother said -- </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="260">Q: Why could you not study? </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="261">A: Because they didn't admit Jews. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="267">A: | don't remember. </sentence><sentence id="268">Probably not very well. </sentence><sentence id="269">But | was not -- as | said, | was very naive. </sentence><sentence id="270">And all this didn't touch me somehow. </sentence><sentence id="271">And my mother decided | should attend a class in a Czech -- that's what it was. </sentence><sentence id="272">We were not admitted to German-speaking universities. </sentence><sentence id="273">Maybe still to Czech, | don't know. </sentence><sentence id="274">But | went to a Czech, you would call it maybe post-graduate textile school because Berdenau was full of textile factories. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="275">And the so-called English cloth that was so famous really came from Berdenau and was treated in England. </sentence><sentence id="276">You know, they had a special process they treated it with. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="277">But it was woven in Berdenau. </sentence><sentence id="278">So she send me to a textile school which did not interest me at all. </sentence><sentence id="279">| mean, we had to learn all about textile machinery and -- well, there was a possibility that perhaps | could become a designer. </sentence><sentence id="280">My mother still saw that we could live a normal life. </sentence><sentence id="281">But it was a wasted year so far as my future -- </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="282">Q: So you did go and study textiles. </sentence><sentence id="283"> ontactrefieannedjustanmiang er hither btemelortabnattfiexaliaton Doris Rauch 9 July 7, 1995 Page 9 </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="284">A: | did go. </sentence><sentence id="285">| graduated from there. </sentence><sentence id="286">It was a lot of fun because we were only two girls and the rest were all young boys. </sentence><sentence id="287">So we had a good time, not knowing what was waiting for us. </sentence><sentence id="288">So | graduated from there in June of 1939 and we were already occupied by Hitler. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="294">Q: How had your life changed when you became occupied. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="296">A: Well, it all came very gradually. </sentence><sentence id="297">First, we had to wear yellow stars. </sentence><sentence id="298">And then we had a curfew. </sentence><sentence id="299">We couldn't go into the street | think it was seven or eight o'clock in the evening. </sentence><sentence id="300">We had to stay at home. </sentence><sentence id="301">Then we were concentrated into certain streets of the city, which meant that my mother -- because we lived on such a street, we got, so to speak, renters into the apartment. </sentence><sentence id="302">There were several -- there were two families in addition to us in the apartment that was only a three-room apartment with one bathroom. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="312">A: Well, it was, what is the English word? </sentence><sentence id="313">It was not pleasant. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="316">Q: Upsetting? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="318">A: lt was upsetting and it was -- what is the word? -- </sentence><sentence id="319">It was -- well, you know. </sentence><sentence id="320">It made you feel that people were looking down on you. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="324">Q: Demeaning? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="326">A: Demeaning. </sentence><sentence id="327">That was the word | was looking for. </sentence><sentence id="328">So we had all those people in the apartment, which -- for me, it was not so bad because | liked all the people. </sentence><sentence id="329">And | don't know how it was for my mother. </sentence><sentence id="330">But there was nothing we could do against it. </sentence><sentence id="331">And my favorite aunt, who was the only one of her family that left behind, had to move  ontactrefieannedjustanmiang er hither btemelortabnattfiexaliaton Doris Rauch 10 July 7, 1995 Page 10 to -- had a villa in the suburbs, but her husband was gone. </sentence><sentence id="332">Her three daughters were gone. </sentence><sentence id="333">And she had to move into our neighborhood. </sentence><sentence id="334">That made me very happy. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="344">Q: Were these restrictions frightening to you? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="346">A: Yes. </sentence><sentence id="347">And it became more frightening as time went on. </sentence><sentence id="348">But in the meantime, after graduating from the textile school, | got a job, an unpaid job, in a textile factory out in the country. </sentence><sentence id="349">And | lived there five and a half days of the week and came home for the weekend. </sentence><sentence id="350">And | worked then all phases of the textile industry. </sentence><sentence id="351">The factory still belonged to a Jewish firm. </sentence><sentence id="352">That's, | suppose, how | got the job, although it was unpaid. </sentence><sentence id="353">But it was good training for me had | ever gone into that field, which | don't think | would have under normal circumstances. </sentence><sentence id="354">So | was home only over the weekend. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="364">Q: Were there any anti-Semitic incidents that you were aware of, particular to you, at that time besides the general restrictions? </sentence><sentence id="365">The non-Jews that you came in contact with were still pleasant to you? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="368">A: No, they were nothing at all. </sentence><sentence id="369">You know, they did not -- they were not in touch with me. </sentence><sentence id="370">Like my school friends. </sentence><sentence id="371">| never heard from them. </sentence><sentence id="372">And we were forbidden to have telephones, so we could telephone only from a neighboring store that had a telephone, but only at certain hours. </sentence><sentence id="373">Because Jews were not allowed to go into those shops, except from 2:00 to 3:00, or whatever it was. </sentence><sentence id="374">So if you had to make a telephone call, you had to make it during those certain hours. </sentence><sentence id="375">And | remember meeting one of my classmates in such a store and being afraid what she would do or say. </sentence><sentence id="376">But she didn't do or say anything. </sentence><sentence id="377">She just make-believe she didn't see me. </sentence></p></dialogue>
