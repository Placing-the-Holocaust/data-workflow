<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="7">Q: And where and when were you born? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="9">A: I was born in Amsterdam, Ist of May in 1930. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="11">Q: Tell me about your family? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="13">A: My family was an everyday family. </sentence><sentence id="14">Middle class. </sentence><sentence id="15">I would say lower middle class and we were just an average household in a suburb part, southern part of Amsterdam and later on we moved to a part of Amsterdam that's more towards the ghetto and uh my father had a business, and we had the business in our house and we lived upstairs on the second floor and downstairs, the first floor, was our factory. </sentence><sentence id="16">And we had a very comfortable life, at least I remember that everything went always fine and uh for my parents, I was an only child and my parents were very kind and we went to grandparents, to uncles, aunts - I had some cousins and we just had a very comfortable life. </sentence><sentence id="17">And I think that my parents knew that something was brewing in the background but Holland being neutral uh was not prepared to fight the Germans, so even though many people most likely thought something might happen, it was a big shock when the Germans invaded Holland. </sentence><sentence id="18">And I was only ten at the time. </sentence><sentence id="19">I had just had my tenth birthday, and I don't remember that I knew how critical it all was, but I remember that Rotterdam was bombed. </sentence><sentence id="20">I remember that they bombed part of Amsterdam, the oil co...the containers where they kept the oil at the harbor, and it was terrible fires there. </sentence><sentence id="21">And I remember that they prepared the hospital across the street from where we lived for wounded soldiers but before everything was really settled in our mind that this was war, the war was over and the Germans had taken over Holland. </sentence><sentence id="22">And uh nothing serious happened in the beginning. </sentence><sentence id="23">It went oh I would say like the average life, it went on and then when we uh.... </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="35">Q: Tell me, tell me what, tell me what an average life was? </sentence><sentence id="36">What did you do during the day? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="39">A: Well, I went I went to school. </sentence><sentence id="40">In the summer we used to go out sometimes for months and uh my father stayed and came only for the weekends, and Holland not being so large we went to the ocean. </sentence><sentence id="41">We went to the beach. </sentence><sentence id="42">And my mother usually rented a room in a pension or somebody's house, and we stayed there, sometimes with friends. </sentence><sentence id="43">Sometimes family came over. </sentence><sentence id="44">Usually for a month, and that went on. </sentence><sentence id="45">I mean there was nothing that pointed to the fact that we couldn't do that anymore but I don't know exactly when it happened, they started to register people. </sentence><sentence id="46">And but me being very little and being not always informed of all the hardships that were going on, | really didn't know much about it, especially because I was only ten or eleven and uh I didn't have to register. </sentence><sentence id="47">It was only for people who were older and  at that time we got like ration cards and we got like a personal sort of passport but me being small, didn't own one, and uh so everything sort of went along and then at a certain point there were Dutch collaborators, NSB" they called them. </sentence><sentence id="48">And they had fights with Jews in the Jewish part of town. </sentence><sentence id="49">That's the old part of Amsterdam. </sentence><sentence id="50">And that most likely was provoked. </sentence><sentence id="51">I think that was just a set-up and that was the beginning of the final solution. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="65">Q: What happened to you during this time? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="67">A: I just went to school, but when I was in fifth grade with, I was about eleven and a half I think, we were told that we couldn't go to the regular public school anymore, even though there were lots of Jewish children in the public school and especially in the neighborhood where I lived and lived lots of Jews in Amsterdam, so we were pushed to a school in uh sort of very poor neighborhood, and the standards of that school were so much lower than the school that I was used to go to. </sentence><sentence id="68">I was sort of in a preparatory school for high school, and uh wasn't a uh no no special school, but you know, there were grades and and levels and so that school really was not for me. </sentence><sentence id="69">I was, not that I was the brightest but I uh was just a middle, average student, but that school was just only so boring for me, so my parents decided that I was going to go to a better school, so I ended up going to the south part of Amsterdam where there was a school where they accepted me. </sentence><sentence id="70">Also only for Jewish children of course. </sentence><sentence id="71">Cause I was a pariah I couldn't go to a regular school anymore. </sentence><sentence id="72">Jewish teachers, Jewish teachers were one of the first steps the Germans took to kick them out of the public school, and so we got our own Jewish teachers back and uh I had to walk to school then, very far because I wasn't allowed on the public transportation and we were not allowed to have bicycles being Jews. </sentence><sentence id="73">The non-Jews could have their bicycles, although it was very hard to obtain one and to keep the tires and things like that because everything sort of vanished. </sentence><sentence id="74">There was very little food, and everything was rationed. </sentence><sentence id="75">The clothes was rationed, shoes, name it - everything was rationed but the Jews uh were outcasts. </sentence><sentence id="76">We had to deliver our copper. </sentence><sentence id="77">We had to bring in our radios. </sentence><sentence id="78">In "42 somebody who my father knew walked in and said, Mr.d'Ancona, this is it. </sentence><sentence id="79">Goodbye. </sentence><sentence id="80">And my father had to leave his own business and the Germans took over our business. </sentence><sentence id="81">Not long after that they dismantled the whole thing and there were like maybe eight or ten sewing machines and a machine that they used for cutting and they dismantled it all. </sentence><sentence id="82">And the machine they used for cutting, my father had sort of made himself, so my father helped them dismantle it knowing that they never were able to put it together again. </sentence><sentence id="83">And all that went to Germany. </sentence><sentence id="84">Everything went to Germany from Holland, and uh so that too. </sentence><sentence id="85">And my father went to an organization in Amsterdam that provided jobs and things, not because my father needed the money that desperately at that time, but being without a job was dangerous. </sentence><sentence id="86">Everybody who didn't have a job was for sure picked up. </sentence><sentence id="87">And my father became a teacher for quite a while. </sentence><sentence id="88">First, out in the country in a Jewish school, and later he was a teacher in high schools in Amsterdam. </sentence><sentence id="89">In the meantime, more people were picked up. </sentence><sentence id="90">First that started with the provocative work from the NSB that they you know they had like fights in town and then they picked up the Jewish man and then in retaliation they started "National Socialistische Beweging. </sentence><sentence id="91">Nazi movement in The Netherlands. </sentence><sentence id="92"> picking up very young men, sixteen, eighteen years old, and those were the first who went to Mauthausen, I think, or Buchenwald and nobody ever heard from them again. </sentence><sentence id="93">They might have sent a card that they were fine, that they were working, and that was it. </sentence><sentence id="94">My parents kept all the information they had from us. </sentence><sentence id="95">I didn't know anything. </sentence><sentence id="96">I knew it was bad. </sentence><sentence id="97">We all had a bag at home with clothes and I think some food but uh we, I really didn't know exactly what was going on and I still wonder till today if anybody really knew what was waiting. </sentence><sentence id="98">I don't think that anybody realized how bad it was. </sentence><sentence id="99">Of course it was when when they kept on picking up people and they pushed people to certain neighborhoods. </sentence><sentence id="100">They were kicked out of their houses and they had to move, and they picked them up there. </sentence><sentence id="101">My uncle had to go to work in Germany, my mother's brother, and we never heard from him again. </sentence><sentence id="102">And I don't know who really knew what was on the other side of the border, but I never knew that they were really killing the people there like they did, and uh it was every time uh as the the years went by, as the months went by, it was tighter and tighter. </sentence><sentence id="103">And there were people who had like exemptions. </sentence><sentence id="104">Exemptions because they quote "bought their freedom with diamonds." </sentence><sentence id="105">People who were wealthy or for the Germans needed industrial diamonds and there were people who did certain jobs so they had a certain exemption, and we had an exemption because we were Sephardic and my father worked on that with lawyers and we had to go for pictures and uh they could prove the Germans thought that being Marranos we uh were really not Jews. </sentence><sentence id="106">And we went digging in our roots for hundreds of years. </sentence><sentence id="107">And after the war we found out that if we had had one or two more relatives who we would have known for sure were not Jewish, we would have made it. </sentence><sentence id="108">We would have been declared, gentile. </sentence><sentence id="109">But at that time we didn't know that. </sentence><sentence id="110">So we didn't make it. </sentence><sentence id="111">And at some point in time then all my relatives were gone. </sentence><sentence id="112">My grandparents were picked up. </sentence><sentence id="113">All my friends were picked up. </sentence><sentence id="114">All my uncles and aunts were gone, and we were really the only ones left, practically. </sentence><sentence id="115">He decided that it was time to go. </sentence><sentence id="116">Now before that I had finished school and I had to go to high school, you know, Jewish high school. </sentence><sentence id="117">There were hardly any children left in Amsterdam at that time. </sentence><sentence id="118">That was in "42, in the summer of "42, so I went to school, a mid...a middle school you can say where I did some work, school work. </sentence><sentence id="119">Most of the time we were busy sending packages to the camp, the camp in Holland for everyday some of the children were picked up and when we found out, we sent packages to Westerbork to help them with whatever they needed. </sentence><sentence id="120">So school was sort of a crazy thing. </sentence><sentence id="121">There was not much schooling going on. </sentence><sentence id="122">Teachers left. </sentence><sentence id="123">Teachers never showed up the next day. </sentence><sentence id="124">You know, it was a big chaotic mess, so we, I had private lessons at the very end. </sentence><sentence id="125">That's how late we left home. </sentence><sentence id="126">I had a private tutor with a few more children and who taught us from math to languages to geography, history, name it, uh but that ended, of course when, I left in October of "43. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="189">Q: Tell us about that time. </sentence><sentence id="190">Uh what you had told me before, your father was in the underground. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="193">Tell us about that? </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="194">A: Well, our house was sort of on the border, really on the outside of the Jewish quarter. </sentence><sentence id="195">Amsterdam uh had an old Jewish quarter and the Germans put fences sort of around it and when you entered it, it said Juden fer tal, only for Jews. </sentence><sentence id="196">Couldn't go in there. </sentence><sentence id="197">There was stores that only for Jews and gentiles couldn't go to that part of the city and so we were really outcasts and separated from the rest of the world. </sentence><sentence id="198">And we lived just outside of that part  of Amsterdam, so we were a little easier uh to reach, and from the outside uh we could get company, non-Jewish company. </sentence><sentence id="199">It was a little dangerous for them because they really shouldn't be seen in Jewish homes, but it was not as impossible because in the Jewish quarter it was dangerous for a person who didn't wear a star uh to show his face. </sentence><sentence id="200">So, since we lived where we lived, my father was involved with uh now regular daily, but then it was the underground newspaper and we got like forty or fifty uh when they came off the press, and then they were put into envelopes and I went to the post box around the corner and mailed them. </sentence><sentence id="201">I don't even know that at that time I knew what was in there, but I took like two or three and I mailed them in the mail box and uh everybody took a few and so it was the underground news sent around. </sentence><sentence id="202">And we uh, my father did during his hiding period, he made staff cards for the English army and put it to charts all the little rivers and all the little details of the part of the country where he lived so that when they came that they knew every house and that they could identify every place. </sentence><sentence id="203">And we had people sometimes staying in our house overnight, when they didn't have a place to go, and my parents weren't too scared. </sentence><sentence id="204">They figured they didn't have a lot to lose I think and uh so they tried to help other people, Jewish people. </sentence><sentence id="205">We had a person staying with us for quite a while uh when they first started to transfer the Jewish teachers out of the public schools because since my mother was a teacher originally, she was still involved with the union, the teachers union, and the head of the teachers union really spoke out against the Germans and tried to protect his Jewish teachers, so when he was that out-spoken, he was looked for by the Germans. </sentence><sentence id="206">They didn't condone that, so they were after him and he came and stayed with us for a long time, because I think they didn't expect him to stay with Jews. </sentence><sentence id="207">So, he survived the war, I guess, that uh sort of they forgot about it and I think he went back home after a couple of months, but he stayed with us for quite a while. </sentence><sentence id="208">He was a very nice interesting old man uh not being Jewish but really loving all his Jewish teachers and his colleagues. </sentence><sentence id="209">He really spoke up and that was at the very beginning when things started rolling and it was so well orchestrated by the Germans. </sentence><sentence id="210">It was a plan that was put little by little by little into place and we were all pushed together in the end. </sentence><sentence id="211">There was no escape. </sentence><sentence id="212">There was no escape. </sentence><sentence id="213">And you had to leave your house and people thought well, you know, so we leave it and live in another neighborhood. </sentence><sentence id="214">They really didn't think much of it, but once they all were gathered in that neighborhood, one day they had a big ring of Germans around that neighborhood, then they picked up everybody and shipped them off cause even though we had many times that people were picked up at night at home when they did like street or they did like a little neighborhood, they uh had this plan of eliminating the Jews out of the Netherlands I think. </sentence><sentence id="215">And uh they had like little, little occurrences of picking up here and picking up there, but there were really two big razzias in Amsterdam with razzias, big uh where they picked up the Jews. </sentence><sentence id="216">I don't know what the English word is for that. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="240">Q: Round-up probably. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="242">A: Round-up, yeah. </sentence><sentence id="243">And one was in the southern part of Amsterdam, and one was in the center of Amsterdam which was the Jewish neighborhood, and ... </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="246">Q: Let's hold it for one minute please. </sentence><sentence id="247"> TECHNICAL CONVERSATION </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="248">Q: You were talking about the round-up. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="250">A: OK. </sentence><sentence id="251">So the the people in the southern part of Amsterdam were rounded up, and that was I think in the early part of "43. </sentence><sentence id="252">And then later on in the center part of Amsterdam which was more like the Jewish neighborhood, and we were also picked up at that time and of course it was like a whole city affair, and so they came to our house and they picked us up. </sentence><sentence id="253">They went house to house, and you had to show your Ausweis, your identification cards, and Jews had a J on theirs, so everybody who was Jewish had to come along. </sentence><sentence id="254">And since we had this special exemption for being Sephardic, we were put in a special part of the holding pen you can say. </sentence><sentence id="255">All the other people were shipped to trains and were sent to Auschwitz, or first to Westerbork and from there on to wherever, but we were put in Amsterdam in a sort of a playground outside. </sentence><sentence id="256">It's near where the old synagogues are now and the uh museum and there we had to stay all day, and the head of the Germans came. </sentence><sentence id="257">I still see him in my mind, and with a whole range of (ph) ladies he had with him, and so he came and we had to present ourselves, family for family, and we had to show our papers. </sentence><sentence id="258">Now I was too young to have my own papers, but my parents had papers, and so he told us we could go home because we had this special exemption. </sentence><sentence id="259">So walking after eight o'clock at night, which was the time that we Jews couldn't walk in the street anymore, was was very scary. </sentence><sentence id="260">And then to have to go home and everybody looking at you. </sentence><sentence id="261">We were so scared that the Germans at the corner of the street were going to pick us up again. </sentence><sentence id="262">Somehow we made it home and then we lived home still for a couple of months. </sentence><sentence id="263">At that time my father's brother's daughter lived with us, so she went as my sister, because she being a little younger uh didn't have papers either. </sentence><sentence id="264">So she lived with us at that time and she went through that day of being caught and she made it through, too, because we couldn't show that she wasn't, was not our family so that was fine. </sentence><sentence id="265">She however ended up going to her mother who was hidden. </sentence><sentence id="266">They were caught and they never survived the war. </sentence><sentence id="267">It was very sad of course, because we were very close at that point. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="286">Q: You had another friend who you grew up with? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="288">A: I grew up with a friend uh since birth. </sentence><sentence id="289">We played together in the playpen. </sentence><sentence id="290">We went together to kindergarten. </sentence><sentence id="291">We went together to first grade. </sentence><sentence id="292">Then we moved and to another part of the city. </sentence><sentence id="293">Wasn't so far, and we still stayed very best friends until the day that she was caught, we were together. </sentence><sentence id="294">We did everything together. </sentence><sentence id="295">We went on vacation together. </sentence><sentence id="296">We played together. </sentence><sentence id="297">We, whatever we undertook uh we were always together. </sentence><sentence id="298">People thought we really were sisters I think. </sentence><sentence id="299">And she went to another school, sort of a more orthodox high school cause she came from an orthodox home, and I went to a public school even though it was a Jewish school it was still a public school. </sentence><sentence id="300">And uh she was was brilliant. </sentence><sentence id="301">She was beautiful girl. </sentence><sentence id="302">She was very very smart. </sentence><sentence id="303">She was, everything she could do. </sentence><sentence id="304">She was good in languages. </sentence><sentence id="305">She was terrific. </sentence><sentence id="306">She could play piano beautifully and one day the Germans came and the family was picked up and never heard of again. </sentence><sentence id="307">Her father survived which in a way is so hard. </sentence><sentence id="308">When you lose everybody that was around you all your life. </sentence><sentence id="309">His wife, his daughter, his  son - they were caught. </sentence><sentence id="310">And some people at a point like that just gave up and also went to the camps. </sentence><sentence id="311">And they just volunteered to go with their families. </sentence><sentence id="312">Some people did that but never saw their families anyhow because by the time they reached the Dutch concentration camp, Westerbork, their family already was gone over the border. </sentence><sentence id="313">We were very scarce of information. </sentence><sentence id="314">We really didn't know, I think, what was hanging over our heads even though we all had packed suitcase ready to go, uh with most needed items, | still think that a lot of people thought they were going to work. </sentence><sentence id="315">And a certain extent the younger people were put to work. </sentence><sentence id="316">But nobody knew how. </sentence><sentence id="317">I don't think anybody knew. </sentence><sentence id="318">My father knew a little more what was going on because he had traveled to Germany before the war, and not looking very Jewish, he walked in the streets and saw what they did to the Jews, and he would have liked to leave. </sentence><sentence id="319">We didn't, were not of any means. </sentence><sentence id="320">My father had a good living. </sentence><sentence id="321">I mean not fantastic but we never went hungry, but he figured it was time to leave, but we had no chance. </sentence><sentence id="322">I don't know why we couldn't go to England. </sentence><sentence id="323">I don't know why we couldn't go anywhere else in the world but apparently that wasn't available. </sentence><sentence id="324">I know we had a number. </sentence><sentence id="325">We had an affidavit for the United States. </sentence><sentence id="326">But our number wasn't up yet, so we had no choice. </sentence><sentence id="327">The second or the third day that the war broke out, that they were fighting in Holland, we tried to leave. </sentence><sentence id="328">We rented a car and we tried to leave then by boat, fishing boat or so, but there was no way. </sentence><sentence id="329">There was no way. </sentence><sentence id="330">Lots of Jews committed suicide. </sentence><sentence id="331">So I have an idea that lots of people did know that it was going to be very bad for the Jews. </sentence><sentence id="332">But me being only ten when the war broke out, I really didn't know much. </sentence><sentence id="333">But then after we came back home in May, after that big razia, and there were very few people left in Amsterdam, we tried very hard to find out if the Germans really thought that we were Marranos or the percentage of our Jewishness was so low that they would declare us non-Jews, and at one day my father decided that we better leave, because there were practically no Jews left in Amsterdam. </sentence><sentence id="334">We were really very late in leaving home and the Germans did come a week after we had left home, so whatever was left of our possessions of course they took. </sentence><sentence id="335">We just left. </sentence><sentence id="336">I left home myself without anything. </sentence><sentence id="337">I just walked out of the house, and a lady came to pick me up, and I had nothing with me when I left. </sentence><sentence id="338">And much much later I got some of my clothes, but very little. </sentence><sentence id="339">But it's impossible for people to understand how hard it is to just leave your home, your parents, and know that you most likely never see your parents again. </sentence><sentence id="340">Leave everything that was everything to you, just behind, just close the door behind you. </sentence><sentence id="341">There's an, it's hard to explain how difficult that was, and being a parent myself now, I don't know how my parents could have done it. </sentence><sentence id="342">It's so painful. </sentence><sentence id="343">It's so painful to say goodbye to your one and only child, and don't know where she is going to. </sentence><sentence id="344">My parents didn't know where I was going. </sentence><sentence id="345">They had this connection with the man who I later found out saved two hundred and fifty Jewish children, and who perished himself in Bergen-Belsen. </sentence><sentence id="346">He was caught at the end of the war and he perished himself, not being a Jew, but being treated as a Jew because he helped the Jews. </sentence><sentence id="347">And he found a place for me all the way at the other side of the country...uh I'll see. </sentence><sentence id="348">Showed my parents the picture of a lady who's going to come the next morning to take me away. </sentence><sentence id="349">And [had to take all the stars off my clothes like and this stuff was very yellow, and very poor quality. </sentence><sentence id="350">Was no quality. </sentence><sentence id="351">You can't even call that quality, and it ran through all your clothes. </sentence><sentence id="352">So you had to be very very careful that people couldn't see that a star had been on my coat and a star had been on my dress, and uh had to brush it off very carefully, so when I left the house early in the morning, I was scared to death of course that my neighbors were going to  see me leave the house - I don't know how I made it to the, to the tram because we went on the tram to the railroad station. </sentence><sentence id="353">And there she handed me over to a young man in his very early twenties and with this young man was a young boy, maybe eleven, ten, something like that, and the two of us went on the train. </sentence><sentence id="354">Uh it was awesome. </sentence><sentence id="355">It was very scary because I had no name. </sentence><sentence id="356">I had no papers. </sentence><sentence id="357">I didn't know who I was. </sentence><sentence id="358">I didn't know who the man was that was taking me. </sentence><sentence id="359">I didn't know the child that was with me. </sentence><sentence id="360">I didn't know anything. </sentence><sentence id="361">I was a nobody. </sentence><sentence id="362">And Germans are always all over, so if they had come to me and asked me who I was, I wouldn't have been able to answer the man. </sentence><sentence id="363">And it uh it's a trip I think that might have taken two or three hours on the train, but in my mind it took like, like forever. </sentence><sentence id="364">We had to change trains at a certain point, and low and behold I bumped into a lady I knew. </sentence><sentence id="365">She was an aunt of my father, not Jewish, who was going to visit her grandchildren who were hidden. </sentence><sentence id="366">But when I said to this young man that was my guide, uh oh, this is my aunt, he right away pushed me in the train. </sentence><sentence id="367">I mean we were going first class the rest of the way uh to where we were going, because he didn't want us to meet of course. </sentence><sentence id="368">So at a little town that I had never heard of, the train stopped. </sentence><sentence id="369">And we got out. </sentence><sentence id="370">It was on the Dutch side of the river Maas near Venlow, right near the German border, in the southern part of Holland. </sentence><sentence id="371">And the young man told me to stand there and wait till he came back. </sentence><sentence id="372">And he took this young child, this boy, with him and well, maybe he was back in an hour, I don't know, but that lasted forever for here I was, all on my own. </sentence><sentence id="373">| didn't know where I was going. </sentence><sentence id="374">I didn't know where I came from. </sentence><sentence id="375">I had no idea. </sentence><sentence id="376">I was so scared. </sentence><sentence id="377">And then he came back, maybe an hour later but to me it like, like days later, and he took me on the back of the bike that he had picked up at the place where he had dropped off this boy. </sentence><sentence id="378">And he took me like for ten minutes on the back of the bike to the people that hid me. </sentence><sentence id="379">There was a mother and some children, and they were very, very kind to me. </sentence><sentence id="380">But I blew it the first second, because there was a visitor and I was supposed to be a relative from Rotterdam, but I didn't know the people of course, so I acted very strange and I said yes sir and no sir and yes ma'am and no ma'am and so the visitor of course understood that I wasn't just some relative. </sentence><sentence id="381">But they kept quiet. </sentence><sentence id="382">I stayed with those people for nearly two years. </sentence><sentence id="383">And they, they risked their life. </sentence><sentence id="384">They risked their whole livelihood. </sentence><sentence id="385">They took me because they felt they had to save my life, and they were very orthodox Protestant Christians. </sentence><sentence id="386">And they figured God had sent me and they had no choice, and they were very brave and uh the man was a repair man at the, at the Dutch railroad. </sentence><sentence id="387">He repaired cars, and they were very blue-collar family, but they're very, very neat family, very fine, fine people. </sentence><sentence id="388">They took me in, no rewards. </sentence><sentence id="389">And I mean from the small income they had it was very hard to feed another mouth. </sentence><sentence id="390">And we had like coupon cards for rationing, but since I didn't have any papers I didn't get any of those cards either. </sentence><sentence id="391">And the underground provided us with that. </sentence><sentence id="392">Once a month they came, usually, and then they brought me a card, but sometimes they didn't have them. </sentence><sentence id="393">They were stolen. </sentence><sentence id="394">And they were, they had to risk their own life of course too, to get all this, and having to take care of all those children, which I didn't know at that time, uh they they had an enormous job, so sometimes they brought me cards, and the family that I lived with had to have some help because we had no food. </sentence><sentence id="395">There was very little food at that time. </sentence><sentence id="396">The place, the spot of the country there was sort of well-provided with vegetables and fruit and most of the people did have a little more. </sentence><sentence id="397">Maybe because we were Protestant in a predominantly Roman Catholic part of the country, my step-parents weren't as well liked and they didn't have anything in common with those people. </sentence><sentence id="398">They were sort of strangers in town, so for us it  was even harder than for many other people to get extra food. </sentence><sentence id="399">We got very little from the farmers that were around us, so they needed my coupons very badly, but they didn't always come. </sentence><sentence id="400">I stayed there of course much too long for the neighbors and the friends to be the relative from the city. </sentence><sentence id="401">They understood that there was something more, and in many of the Protestant homes in this town, there were Jewish children hidden. </sentence><sentence id="402">The, I guess the church had something to do with that and uh we went through terrible times there. </sentence><sentence id="403">Being at the border we were nearly bombed every night. </sentence><sentence id="404">The, right over the border was a big German airfield, and practically every night the bomb...bombers, coming back from Germany, dropped a few bombs at the airport. </sentence><sentence id="405">We gave them nicknames but it wasn't so funny for every night we were up and we were in shelters. </sentence><sentence id="406">Now one of our neighbors had a shelter that was outside which was supposed to be safer. </sentence><sentence id="407">They build that themselves. </sentence><sentence id="408">And so everybody from the neighborhood, from our little street went there at night when the alarm sounded. </sentence><sentence id="409">But after the war they told me that the man who owned the shelter had told my neighbor that he didn't like this Jewish girl in his shelter anymore and they never told me that until after the war of course, but my step-parents were a little worried because if word was going around that I was Jewish the Germans would come. </sentence><sentence id="410">My step-father for sure would have been picked up. </sentence><sentence id="411">His older son would have been picked up and the family would have been in shambles. </sentence><sentence id="412">They would of course have picked me up. </sentence><sentence id="413">I mean I was the Jew, but they uh they decided that it was not safe anymore to go to those people, so when there was alarm at night we stayed in our own shelter. </sentence><sentence id="414">Uh the man who told that to my step-parents, my war parents, uh was a marshall. </sentence><sentence id="415">Say you can compare that with the Coast Guard. </sentence><sentence id="416">And uh was an officer and uh most of the people at the border control were of course with the Germans. </sentence><sentence id="417">They, but this man was definitely not. </sentence><sentence id="418">He was a real good Dutch citizen and he sheltered me. </sentence><sentence id="419">He told the man that if he didn't keep his mouth shut about me that he wouldn't keep his mouth shut about this man who had this outside shelter because he did a lot of things that apparently were not right according to the Germans, so he shut him up. </sentence><sentence id="420">But my step-parents didn't like to go there anymore anyhow. </sentence><sentence id="421">So, in the end of the war we were at the part where many troops were dropped for the Battle of Arnheim, when the really dirty end of the war sort of set in. </sentence><sentence id="422">And uh we saw them coming over and they didn't really come in our town but they came near, and from that time on the war really came as the war, the fighting part of the war came close to us. </sentence><sentence id="423">And the Germans were in our in our neighborhood and they were, out of our neighborhood you saw lots of troop movements and we heard of lots of shooting and and bombings. </sentence><sentence id="424">When they came very close to us, we even had Germans live in our house and that was extremely scary because my step-mother was in the field reaping some potatoes most like cause everything was cut off. </sentence><sentence id="425">We had nothing to eat. </sentence><sentence id="426">We had no water. </sentence><sentence id="427">We only had to drink well water and so she went to the fields to find potatoes. </sentence><sentence id="428">The men couldn't show their faces anymore because they would be rounded up and shipped to Germany. </sentence><sentence id="429">My little step-sister went with her mother and I was home alone with two men who couldn't show their faces to the Germans because my step-father, working for the Dutch railroad, was on strike. </sentence><sentence id="430">In September of "44 the Dutch government in England decided that the Dutch railroad had to go on strike in order to help the invading troops, and to make sure that the Germans didn't have much transportation, so my step-father was quote "sick in bed" and the son was, I think he must have hidden himself in the house, so when the Germans came in the house I was the one who had to talk to them. </sentence><sentence id="431">So they looked through the house and they decided that  they were going to take this room and this room and this room and they were going to come back that night. </sentence><sentence id="432">So at night I had to go. </sentence><sentence id="433">I mean, they, my my uh family didn't feel it was safe for me to sit there and discuss the war with the Germans for one moment they could say, oh maybe this girl is Jewish and that would have been the end. </sentence><sentence id="434">So they made some sort of a story up that I was very tired, not being used to working so hard, and I went to bed, and I was, every night I was gone when they came. </sentence><sentence id="435">They stayed for about two weeks in our house. </sentence><sentence id="436">It was very very tense, but everything was tense. </sentence><sentence id="437">I mean the fighting got closer and the uh and then they, they had so many things going in the house that were against the rules of the Germans that uh you know anyth...any moment something could happen to us. </sentence><sentence id="438">Very close to our liberation the Germans decided that all the inhabitants had to leave the town. </sentence><sentence id="439">And since we were on the Dutch side of the river uh they wanted us to go to Germany, and they evacuated everybody. </sentence><sentence id="440">At that point the family that I stayed with was worried that if they were going to ask for my papers that they couldn't show anything and uh saying well it's got lost, that was just not good enough. </sentence><sentence id="441">So they decided that the whole family was going to go under since we felt that any moment we could be liberated, so we ended up in a bombed-out house and the basement was still intact. </sentence><sentence id="442">There was some sort of a roof still over the basement, so and we knew in that house there was food, so the neighbors, the border guard family and us, we went to this bombed-out house and we stayed there for about three, four days. </sentence><sentence id="443">Uh that's where we were liberated. </sentence><sentence id="444">All the other people who had left town were on the wrong side of the river. </sentence><sentence id="445">They had to wait another half a year. </sentence><sentence id="446">However when we came back to our house, now the English and the Americans didn't want us to stay in our house because they weren't going to cross the river at that point and they didn't want all those civilians around, so we were all evacuated into a place that was away from the fighting. </sentence><sentence id="447">And there we stayed for couple of months, in a room somewhere in somebody's house. </sentence><sentence id="448">I think at that time there was some sort of a newspaper being printed already. </sentence><sentence id="449">It was like free country, and we had nothing. </sentence><sentence id="450">We uh were very poor. </sentence><sentence id="451">We had no clothes. </sentence><sentence id="452">We had no shoes. </sentence><sentence id="453">We had no food. </sentence><sentence id="454">It was still, everything was very scarce but there was some sort of free press of things like that going and apparently in one of those newspapers that my family got hold of, they asked about Jewish survivors, and so over the time of maybe two weeks or so they asked me questions, and I never under...never got a feel of what they were doing. </sentence><sentence id="455">You know, I was sort of innocent. </sentence><sentence id="456">One day they asked me what was your mother's name and the next day they asked what was the street you lived in, and so they got my family's history on paper and they supplied that to a Jewish organization. </sentence><sentence id="457">My step-parents apparently had found out that my mother was caught and they never told me. </sentence><sentence id="458">But not knowing where my father was, they decided that they were going to stay with me, that I could stay with them as long as more details were going to be available. </sentence><sentence id="459">And so I stayed with those people for all those months while we were evacuated, but they gave the details of my family to this Jewish organization and they apparently compiled a list of people who survived so we went back to our house which was damaged and empty. </sentence><sentence id="460">Everything was stolen in the meantime. </sentence><sentence id="461">We had nothing. </sentence><sentence id="462">Uh in, then the war was finished in May and very soon after, somehow, my father came to pick me up. </sentence><sentence id="463">When he was liberated he saw my name, number one on the list, being a little d and a capital A, in Dutch it means that I'm on the top, that they discard the d and the van and so Ancona, so I was number one on the list and when my father walked out of jail, he nearly fainted I guess when he found out I was still around. </sentence><sentence id="464">So he came on a bicycle without tires,  0 all the way from the northern, most northern part of Holland to practically the most southern part of Holland. </sentence><sentence id="465">Fought his way through all sorts of check points and he crossed the bridges that were absolutely not passable but he talked his way through, also with papers from the underground, being able to show that he had worked in the underground. </sentence><sentence id="466">And he came to get me. </sentence><sentence id="467">So in I guess in the middle of May I went with him back to the northern part of Holland because we really didn't know what we were going to do. </sentence><sentence id="468">And then about a month later, we got a telephone call, not that there were telephones at that point, but somehow we got a telephone call through the post office in this little town where my father was, that my mother had appeared in Amsterdam, which was absolutely a miracle. </sentence><sentence id="469">But she's the only one who came back. </sentence><sentence id="470">No uncles, no aunts, no cousins, no grandparents, no friends from our friends, circle of friends. </sentence><sentence id="471">From my family, my mother was the only one who came back. </sentence><sentence id="472">And that was only due to the fact that she went late. </sentence><sentence id="473">She didn't go, she didn't leave Holland until the summer of "44 and she started out in Theresienstadt, which was bad, but not as bad as the rest of course. </sentence><sentence id="474">So she could hold on and she was strong and young, but she nearly didn't make it of course. </sentence><sentence id="475">She she, there were hundreds of miracles that made her survive. </sentence><sentence id="476">So after the war, our family was back intact. </sentence><sentence id="477">But we had nothing. </sentence><sentence id="478">We had nothing. </sentence><sentence id="479">We had no, no living. </sentence><sentence id="480">The factory was gone. </sentence><sentence id="481">All our belongings were gone, and what lot's of people don't realize is that the Germans took our bank accounts, they took hold of that. </sentence><sentence id="482">My father was born in just in the other century, so he was like 42 or so. </sentence><sentence id="483">They took away his life insurance. </sentence><sentence id="484">They cashed in on everything that was worth something. </sentence><sentence id="485">So when he came back in his 40's, in his middle 40's, he had to start all over again with nothing, absolutely nothing. </sentence><sentence id="486">And not the support of a family. </sentence><sentence id="487">I mean he used to do business. </sentence><sentence id="488">His oldest brother was his accountant and his other brother was an advisor and here he had to start all over with nothing. </sentence><sentence id="489">No advice. </sentence><sentence id="490">Nobody was there, and there was nothing really to start a business with. </sentence><sentence id="491">It was very, very difficult. </sentence><sentence id="492">But somehow he had to, and he did it. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="698">Q: When did you, how long were you in Holland? </sentence><sentence id="699">Where did you stay? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="702">A: I stayed in after the war. </sentence><sentence id="703">11 went to, I went back to school which was impossible. </sentence><sentence id="704">I had wasted more than three years and I guess the effect of the war was such that when I was fifteen and I had to start where other children are when they're twelve, it was not that I was so sophisticated. </sentence><sentence id="705">I I can't compare myself with children at this time of age, being fifteen years old I was very innocent and I was still a little girl, a fifteen year old girl now is not a little girl anymore, but uh the war had taken its toll I think. </sentence><sentence id="706">I just didn't have the, the courage to go school, college. </sentence><sentence id="707">I went for three years to high school. </sentence><sentence id="708">Had to start all over again of course and I called it quits, and when I was eighteen I went to work. </sentence><sentence id="709">And it was very hard to be Jewish in Holland where there was nobody there. </sentence><sentence id="710">You had no relatives. </sentence><sentence id="711">All my old friends were gone, and even though I came from an absolute non-observant family, I was always as a little child already drawn to being more Jewish. </sentence><sentence id="712">So uh most of the people my age group didn't survive. </sentence><sentence id="713">There were very few young children and I had a very hard time. </sentence><sentence id="714">I had a very difficult time and I felt that I owed it to my, my people. </sentence><sentence id="715">My uh future was going, only going to be right if | was going to marry a Jew. </sentence><sentence id="716">I had feeling that was the only thing I could do for myself to stay sane and not having the chance to meet that many Jewish people. </sentence><sentence id="717">You know, there some few. </sentence><sentence id="718">There were a few groups in Holland who, who got together. </sentence><sentence id="719">I waited  1 till, I waited. </sentence><sentence id="720">I I was engaged when I was twenty-five but that didn't work out, so I waited a longer time so I left in 32 to get married. </sentence><sentence id="721">I was married in Holland and I came to the United States where my husband worked in the United States, so it took a while to find the right person. </sentence><sentence id="722">And I'm not sorry but that's how it went. </sentence><sentence id="723">There were very, very few Jewish girls who married Jewish boys, and the ones, there were just a lot of inter-marriage at that time and I wasn't ready for that. </sentence><sentence id="724">I couldn't do it, so to find the right husband was not the easiest task. </sentence></p></dialogue>
