<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="8">Q: Tell me a little bit about your, about your friends, growing up? </sentence><sentence id="9">What was school like? </sentence><sentence id="10">What kind of schools did you go to? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="14">A: I have attended a number of different schools, probably because my mother and father were looking at what was the best educational outlet rather than a particular school. </sentence><sentence id="15">I went to a Hebrew school uh which I didn't like terribly much. </sentence><sentence id="16">and them my sister and I spent about a year or two in Catholic school. </sentence><sentence id="17">There were only five or six children and we had, strangely enough for Poland at that time, uh Hebrew instructions. </sentence><sentence id="18">But there was an excellent private school and then after that I attended a gymnasium (ph) and my formal education per se actually was abruptly stopped in my fifth grade level. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="24">Q: What about friends? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="26">A: Well, I was - my sister was a great hot-head (ph). </sentence><sentence id="27">She was a champion - champion skater, champion swimmer. </sentence><sentence id="28">She was very musical - played a number of instruments. </sentence><sentence id="29">I was given piano lessons, ballet lessons. </sentence><sentence id="30">I was particularly interested in the theater. </sentence><sentence id="31">And during the Russian occupation from 1939 to 1941, uh the Russian authorities go after talent and recognize it or want to recognize it at a rather early stage. </sentence><sentence id="32">So they said to my parents, we're not interested in how well she will do academically. </sentence><sentence id="33">We have discovered that she has a very lovely voice and she's very musical and she dances well and she does very on stage - we are going to overlook her theatrical career. </sentence><sentence id="34">And so I sang as a soloist at the age of ten with all the major choirs. </sentence><sentence id="35">I designed and choreographed some ballet without knowing anything about it. </sentence><sentence id="36">It was just a natural outlet, you know. </sentence><sentence id="37">Uh I played with a lot of my friends. </sentence><sentence id="38">We would invent some wonderful plays. </sentence><sentence id="39">It wasn't a store-bought toy. </sentence><sentence id="40">We would play house. </sentence><sentence id="41">We would play uh I remember reading a great deal in addition to Pushkin and in addition to the other authors a lot of the movie magazines, and so we pretended that I was greta Garbo and my friend would be Marlena Dietrich and we would just go on that way and get some carrots and potatoes from our kitchens and pretend that we were homemakers and children and all that. </sentence><sentence id="42">So we really had a very kind of a free, delightful uh existence, in spite of the fact that the anti- Semitic climate was very strong, very strong, and I was, we were all rather blue-eyed, blonde, fair-hair, so that no, people who didn't know that I belonged to a synagogue, that my parents did, that I was Jewish. </sentence><sentence id="43">But there were pogroms, quite a few of them, and I kept asking why, what's what what's going on? </sentence><sentence id="44">It's very hard for parents to explain because we believe in a different religion or we belong to a to a synagogue rather than a church that  people don't like you. </sentence><sentence id="45">And so I grew up both on one level uh happily because I was loved and protected and got the best possible education that I could through my parents, and family life was very important and | imagine that kind of upbringing and that kind of rooted embedded uh understanding of my parents that they gave to both my sister and myself, probably helped me a great deal later on to have that base, that strength of knowing who you are. </sentence><sentence id="46">Without understanding it, without going into other philosophical discussions about that. </sentence><sentence id="47">And so that I grew up like I suppose like I - we did not live in a ghetto. </sentence><sentence id="48">We lived ina perfectly beautiful apartment near the river Niemen (ph). </sentence><sentence id="49">Uh my mother was more religious than my father and we were religious I suppose like everyone else without being fanatic about it. </sentence><sentence id="50">And my childhood was really quite free of any worries except for the fact that I started to recognize that there were stones being thrown at our windows towards 1938, 1939, and uh I was also told that on Passover which was very beautiful in our home, and my father would, I'm sure to the dismay of my mother invited half of the people who had nowheres to go to our home so they could share that special evening with us, that the Christian children were told that the Jews drink the blood of Christian children during the Passover Seder. </sentence><sentence id="51">And it was just something that a child, even as an adult I cannot quite comprehend. </sentence><sentence id="52">But that's the kink for archaic teaching that essentially, eventually with ignorance led to the disaster of the catastrophe of the Holocaust. </sentence><sentence id="53">So when you ask me what was my childhood I can describe it in terms by saying that it was a pleasant, delightful, carefree surrounded by a lot of love and a lot of attention and the hand-writing, even as a child without understanding, were already lingering in the in the background. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="82">Q: When did this change? </sentence><sentence id="83">When the Russians came, what else happened to you, to your life in addition to the special school? </sentence><sentence id="84">Were there any other changes from "39 to "41 that you noticed? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="88">A: Yes, as a matter of fact not understanding what Stalin stood for, not understanding political uh politics per se, I loved being there at that time because the pogroms have stopped. </sentence><sentence id="89">I was indited into what they called the Pioneer, the Young Pioneers Group. </sentence><sentence id="90">They showered a great deal of attention on the children because that's the way they get them. </sentence><sentence id="91">My parents probably were dismayed and couldn't do anything about that. </sentence><sentence id="92">My father I believe was imprisoned for about three or four months because he must, he was, he must have said - I didn't really know why, but it was obviously for political reasons. </sentence><sentence id="93">He may have said something that did not please the Communist in.. uh people. </sentence><sentence id="94">Now you have to understand Grodno is about, I'm not sure that I'm being accurate, but it's about sixty miles from the Lithuanian border, or maybe less. </sentence><sentence id="95">So that entire area uh was a changeable area geographically. </sentence><sentence id="96">It was first, my parents were born there or close by and then it was Russia. </sentence><sentence id="97">When I was born it Poland, and in 1944 it was Russia again, and it is Russia now. </sentence><sentence id="98">So that uh I did not speak Russian until 1939. </sentence><sentence id="99">I speak Poli... spoke Polish. </sentence><sentence id="100">We did speak Yiddish but my Yiddish was not terribly good. </sentence><sentence id="101">We spoke basically Polish and when my mother didn't want me to understand something, my sister and I would go get furious about that, and she would speak Russian or French to each other. </sentence><sentence id="102">And of course at that time I still didn't speak either one of those languages. </sentence><sentence id="103">Well, uh Russia, the Soviet Union occupied that part of, well, Germany in 1939 as we know, Germany, Poland was divided. </sentence><sentence id="104">Half of it went to the Nazis and the other half, the eastern, the traditional  northeastern part went to the Russians. </sentence><sentence id="105">And Balystok and Grodno and that entire areas became Russian. </sentence><sentence id="106">I went to school. </sentence><sentence id="107">I loved it. </sentence><sentence id="108">I learned White Russian because that is really Bieloruss and Russian and did a lot of dancing, a lot of uh gymnastics. </sentence><sentence id="109">My sister was the one who really was known gymnast and I had won quite a few competitions in singing and dancing and they encouraged that sort of thing. </sentence><sentence id="110">And life seemed perfectly alright. </sentence><sentence id="111">And then in September of 1941, uh everything broke and we were hiding in the bonders because the air the air raids were pretty severe. </sentence><sentence id="112">And uh very shortly the following day somebody walked up out of the compound and said we've just seen German tanks. </sentence><sentence id="113">Now again, you have to understand I did not understand the idea what German tanks, what kind of ominous clouds that would sweep around Europe and what it would mean, that the German tanks are in front of your door. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="140">Q: What did you do when you heard German tanks, when your family heard German tanks? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="142">What did you and your family do? </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="143">A: They were very frightened. </sentence><sentence id="144">They recognized because we had known, we did hear terrible stories coming out from the other part of Poland, people who may, who escaped uh what was happening to the Jewish community. </sentence><sentence id="145">But again I must say that maybe because I was playing with dolls one day, and the next day I was asked to be a grown-up, it hadn't quite sunk in, what the tragedy of the entire period meant. </sentence><sentence id="146">I could only reflect today as I have post- Holocaust. </sentence><sentence id="147">When I was in it I didn't really know what was going on. </sentence><sentence id="148">I was we were ina vacuum. </sentence><sentence id="149">I was in a vacuum. </sentence><sentence id="150">I can only speak for myself. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="159">Q: That's what we want to talk about, of course, is what you did and thought then rather than now. </sentence><sentence id="160">Then what did you do? </sentence><sentence id="161">Did school continue for example? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="165">A: No, no. </sentence><sentence id="166">Not in'41. </sentence><sentence id="167">Right. </sentence><sentence id="168">In 1941 school did not continue. </sentence><sentence id="169">It was actually not even the beginning of the school semester. </sentence><sentence id="170">Very shortly after, uh we were still in our apartment, within a matter of a few months if I remember correctly, they had two ghettos in Grodno. </sentence><sentence id="171">The upper ghetto and the ghetto in, not very far from where we lived. </sentence><sentence id="172">And very shortly the entire the entire Jewish population of Grodno was being uprooted from their home and that I remember very distinctly and with great pain. </sentence><sentence id="173">We had some beautiful china. </sentence><sentence id="174">We had a very lovely home. </sentence><sentence id="175">Wasn't rich but it was beautiful. </sentence><sentence id="176">The Germans would come in and simply at the whim of a wisp, just like that (fingers snap), remove the most beautiful china and just throw it against a wall to break it, for fun, and started to taunt and tease. </sentence><sentence id="177">And you didn't really have to be all that young to recognize that this was the devil in the flesh. </sentence><sentence id="178">We were evacuated to a to the ghetto uptown, my both my father and my mother and my sister and I. Uh my mother was one of three sisters. </sentence><sentence id="179">One had come to this country and the other was married to a prominent professor with three children. </sentence><sentence id="180">One of my cousins was a uh young man who I believe was only 23 but he was considered to be a genius, so much so, electronic, that the Germans used him for two years as what they called a Einutzliger Jude (ph), a useful Jew, and when they have extracted what they needed, they killed him. </sentence><sentence id="181">His older sister, my other cousin, was a, completed the Warsaw Conservatoire and was a concert pianist and somehow managed to escape to uh to Alma Ata in Russia [NB: Kazakhstan]. </sentence><sentence id="182">The younger of the three  cousins uh stayed with her mother. </sentence><sentence id="183">Because my uncle was considered in High Intelligentsia they have, they rounded them up and they killed them. </sentence><sentence id="184">When were in the second ghetto, I believe my cousins, my cousin, just my aunt and my, my and her younger daughter were with us. </sentence><sentence id="185">We had improvised schools meaning that we still believed that the world may not have gone altogether and that we will need an education, and so we continued with our studies on an improvised basis by having the teachers who were there get the children and get them together. </sentence><sentence id="186">Uh I'll tell you something rather interesting. </sentence><sentence id="187">My father worked as a forester. </sentence><sentence id="188">That means that he was a specialist in wood and primarily worked with peasants. </sentence><sentence id="189">Poland is known for beautiful woods. </sentence><sentence id="190">He was extremely well liked. </sentence><sentence id="191">He was, I remember my father more often on a horse in a leather cap in a leather jacket and leather boots riding on either - we had two horses, a white one and a grey one. </sentence><sentence id="192">My father came home on day and said that some peasant families said let me have your children for you. </sentence><sentence id="193">They are both very light. </sentence><sentence id="194">They don't look Jewish. </sentence><sentence id="195">Why don't you let us have them. </sentence><sentence id="196">We will hide them for you. </sentence><sentence id="197">And I remember having a little conference and both my sister and I said no. </sentence><sentence id="198">If we cannot be together then we're not going to be without you. </sentence><sentence id="199">In November of 1942 the second ghetto where I was with my family got split up. </sentence><sentence id="200">They were obviously starting the evacuation process to the many camps that we didn't know anything about. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="237">Q: Can we hold it for one minute, (Sure) and I'd like you to describe the life in the first ghetto. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="239">What was your daily life like? </sentence><sentence id="240">You mentioned school. </sentence><sentence id="241">What else was going? </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="242">A: With all due respect I cannot be absolutely clear and remember it to that extent except that it was bearable. </sentence><sentence id="243">It was bearable to the fact that my parents were with me. </sentence><sentence id="244">My sister was with me. </sentence><sentence id="245">We tried to improvise and play. </sentence><sentence id="246">I had no idea. </sentence><sentence id="247">I'm sure my parents felt differently because I was so young. </sentence><sentence id="248">And because I was so young I didn't stop to think what is going on except that somehow we were not at home. </sentence><sentence id="249">We shared a room with many other people. </sentence><sentence id="250">Uh life was no normal, but we were still a family. </sentence><sentence id="251">And then very abruptly, as they usually do those things, and for me - I don't know what go what went on with the with the other ghetto where they the first ghetto - as I said we were in the second ghetto - they probably started to, in fact I'm sure they started to evacuate because this was already in 1942. </sentence><sentence id="252">No doubt that the Jews who were in the German part of Poland had already been evacuated. </sentence><sentence id="253">But this is the eastern part and they you know they had to start a whole new program. </sentence><sentence id="254">Excuse me. </sentence><sentence id="255">Uh they rounded us up. </sentence><sentence id="256">We had no idea why. </sentence><sentence id="257">I had no idea why. </sentence><sentence id="258">Maybe the others did. </sentence><sentence id="259">My parents and I, my sister and I and my parents were separated. </sentence><sentence id="260">My sister and I were taken to, by trucks to ghetto number one. </sentence><sentence id="261">We had no idea what happened to our parents. </sentence><sentence id="262">I had subsequently learned that the transport, that was, went to Auschwitz and they were in a way entered the camp as most of them of course did not. </sentence><sentence id="263">My sister and I remained in the first ghetto. </sentence><sentence id="264">That was already very difficult. </sentence><sentence id="265">It was it was wintertime. </sentence><sentence id="266">The selections were, in other words the evacuation process began quite earnestly. </sentence><sentence id="267">We work in a in a tobacco factory. </sentence><sentence id="268">My sister and I would share a kind of little cot in somebody's house and ____ the house the house belonged to a friend of mine who, they were no longer there, and we were, we managed to hide every time, like maybe three or four selec..-uh not selections because they weren't all called selections but the raids - in other words to find the Jews to send them to wherever they were sending them - we didn't know where - we managed to escape. </sentence><sentence id="269">And we  continued to give ourselves some kind of moral support by saying look, we'll probably leave here and I'm sure we'll be with our parents again. </sentence><sentence id="270">But, on January probably the 18th or 20th, somewheres around there, 1943, we hid behind very heavy snow behind the synagogue which is where they would run, round everybody up and we could no longer hide. </sentence><sentence id="271">We were found and walked to the to the to the station and what was so dreadful and I remember that - I did not see Shoah but the told me about that. </sentence><sentence id="272">The people were standing and watching as the people, as their neighbors - I don't know, I didn't recognize anyone but were being obviously dragged without too much clothes, without any necessarily private possessions, to the train station. </sentence><sentence id="273">And then we saw the cattle cars. </sentence><sentence id="274">And that's when the reality set in but I still had no idea that a place like Auschwitz existed. </sentence><sentence id="275">That they were still doing the actually burning people. </sentence><sentence id="276">We didn't know that. </sentence><sentence id="277">My sister gave me my mother's coat. </sentence><sentence id="278">A long coat, and I think that coat may have been responsible for my going into the camp rather than to the crematory right away. </sentence><sentence id="279">My sister was very bright. </sentence><sentence id="280">She was very cleaver. </sentence><sentence id="281">She was absolutely wonderful, tremendously liked. </sentence><sentence id="282">Her name was Sala (ph) and the train ride was probably one of the worst things that I can possibly remember. </sentence><sentence id="283">The train ride was utterly horrendous. </sentence><sentence id="284">People died. </sentence><sentence id="285">There was no water. </sentence><sentence id="286">There were no sanitary facilities. </sentence><sentence id="287">There was no food. </sentence><sentence id="288">Whatever was had gone very quickly. </sentence><sentence id="289">It was about three and a half days. </sentence><sentence id="290">And then we stopped and we saw Auschwitz. </sentence><sentence id="291">And we said I bet you we're going to meet our parents. </sentence><sentence id="292">Well, we were right to some extent, except that we didn't meet them. </sentence><sentence id="293">During the time that we were that we came down, in other words we were at disembarked or let from the train, Sala said to me, don't speak, don't move, let me think for a moment. </sentence><sentence id="294">We were about twenty-five hundred people. </sentence><sentence id="295">I have a book by the way, from somebody from Grodno who had just published the entire history of the Jews of Grodno and it's the most incredible thing is that even my number is mentioned there, so that I learned something about - I mean as I said, there are (ph) these are documentations that are there because there was a trial of the Nazis of Grodno. </sentence><sentence id="296">Maybe I was very dumb or just very young, but I didn't understand or knew as much as many other people did. </sentence><sentence id="297">When we embarked my sister noticed that the majority of the people from the train were being pushed to one side and a rather small group was being pushed to one side, both men and women. </sentence><sentence id="298">She said don't ask any questions, just walk over to that small group, and she followed me. </sentence><sentence id="299">And the guard the guard said, Genoch. </sentence><sentence id="300">There were eight-five women and a hundred and twenty men out of something like twenty-five hundred who were then brought into Auschwitz. </sentence><sentence id="301">The rest went directly to the crematorium. </sentence><sentence id="302">Now we didn't know about that. </sentence><sentence id="303">But after one day you did know because the, at that time uh when I came to Auschwitz which was January, January 24th, 1943, the chimneys were very high and the smell of flesh was very prominent, and you no longer could pretent that this is the place where we're going to meet our parents. </sentence><sentence id="304">So this was my introduction to Auschwitz. </sentence><sentence id="305">And I suppose you want to know what happened and I will tell you briefly... </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="370">Q: Let's slow down a little. ( </sentence><sentence id="371">Alright.) </sentence><sentence id="372">Uh tell me when you arrived into the camp, where were you taken and what did you do? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="376">A: I was taken, we were taken to a block, I don't know exactly where. </sentence><sentence id="377">We then were asked to undress completely. </sentence><sentence id="378">Naked. </sentence><sentence id="379">I had some photographs of my family which were torn to shreds. </sentence><sentence id="380">Hair was completely shaved. </sentence><sentence id="381">And a rather painful tatoo was put on my left forearm. </sentence><sentence id="382">My  sister knew my terrible fear of doctors as a child, I don't know why, and she kept whispering to me, be brave. </sentence><sentence id="383">And my number was 31386, and her number was 31387 and in those days they gave the numbers smack in the front of the left forearm, not inside. </sentence><sentence id="384">I think they ran out of space or ran out of numbers or maybe they recognized that perhaps it is not such a good idea to be quite so prominent about that. </sentence><sentence id="385">For your information I had it plasmically removed uh in London. </sentence><sentence id="386">Not because I don't want to remember but because I don't always wish to talk about it, or to talk about it perhaps in an interview such as this where it has meaning and it has a realistic archival uh value for the future. </sentence><sentence id="387">Alright so we were stripped and the hair was shaven and the number was tattooed and we were given clothing of uh dead prison...uh Russian prisoners of war and taken to some block and that was the beginning of two years. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="400">Q: Tell me, who was... </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="402">A: I have no idea. </sentence><sentence id="403">They were speaking all different languages. </sentence><sentence id="404">I did not know German. </sentence><sentence id="405">I did not know Hungarian. </sentence><sentence id="406">Actually the Hungarians came later. </sentence><sentence id="407">Mainly I think the people at that time were from Poland. </sentence><sentence id="408">Polish Jews. </sentence><sentence id="409">Uh possibly Czechoslovakian but I really am not totally sure so I can't tell you. </sentence><sentence id="410">Of course later on you know, day and night became, time had no meaning at that point. </sentence><sentence id="411">But it was dreadfully hard because the winters are very difficult. </sentence><sentence id="412">Uh the mud - when it rained it was just muddy. </sentence><sentence id="413">Uh food was unbearable if you were - you eventually learned to eat that but it was uneatable really. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="428">A: I think, you know the fact is and I, my sister and I used to joke because my mother and my father would make me eat like so many parents you know, drink your milk. </sentence><sentence id="429">You know, here's a piece of chocolate. </sentence><sentence id="430">Uh I'll take you here. </sentence><sentence id="431">The bribery aspects because I was very thin. </sentence><sentence id="432">In fact I was the youngest of everyone and the mo..the sickliest of everyone. </sentence><sentence id="433">Finally they thought I had some kind of a heart condition which may not have been true but my parents were very protective of my health so I wasn't allowed to plant trees which I wanted to do and all that sort of thing. </sentence><sentence id="434">And this is the irony that I am the one who survived and my sister who was never sick in her life died three months later. </sentence><sentence id="435">Uh and I was glad that she died. </sentence><sentence id="436">And I will tell you in a minute why I say that in such candor. </sentence><sentence id="437">Uh we were going to work - these were probably the most horrendously difficult months, the first three months. </sentence><sentence id="438">If you survived the first day, maybe you survived a second. </sentence><sentence id="439">If you made it through the week, chances are you might make it to the second week. </sentence><sentence id="440">Time had no meaning. </sentence><sentence id="441">We were very shortly put to work outside the camp, carrying very heavy stones. </sentence><sentence id="442">But the most horrendous part of it all, there was a man in Auschwitz who name was Tauber (ph) and I eventually asked uh Wiesenthal whether he knew what happened to this pretention of a man. </sentence><sentence id="443">And finally he was caught and or he died anyway. </sentence><sentence id="444">But I remember him very well. </sentence><sentence id="445">He was in charge of the selections as people would come back from a very long and a very difficult and a very hungry day. </sentence><sentence id="446">You were made to jump five feet over a ditch if you, and many didn't. </sentence><sentence id="447">It you made, if you were able to jump across, about five feet or maybe more, I don't know, then you were OK. </sentence><sentence id="448">If you didn't then you never went back to the camp. </sentence><sentence id="449">I mean this was a little play. </sentence><sentence id="450">Cruelty in its most perfect form. </sentence><sentence id="451">And that went on for quite some time. </sentence><sentence id="452">During that  time my sister once put her hand in her pocket because it was freezing, and I never will forget that. </sentence><sentence id="453">I heard the tremendous slam of a whip on her back. </sentence><sentence id="454">Uh the officer, uh one of the guards said don't you every do that again. </sentence><sentence id="455">In other words you're not allowed to put you hands because you were frozen to death in your packet. </sentence><sentence id="456">Uh Sala one day complained of not feeling very well, and she says I don't think I can get out. </sentence><sentence id="457">It was a Friday, and I said I don't care whether you can get up - you've got to get up, because if you don't they will take you to Block 25. </sentence><sentence id="458">You know, you become very wise very quickly and you learn to know what Black 25 is because when you would pass by you would see dead bodies. </sentence><sentence id="459">That was a daily sight. </sentence><sentence id="460">Nobody you know, you don't even cry anymore. </sentence><sentence id="461">There are no tears left. ( </sentence><sentence id="462">Cough) Excuse me. </sentence><sentence id="463">But Sala couldn't go to work. </sentence><sentence id="464">She probably had typhoid. </sentence><sentence id="465">We don't know. </sentence><sentence id="466">I mean it took - Sunday night she was dead. </sentence><sentence id="467">She didn't go to work on Friday. </sentence><sentence id="468">I went to see her in this Block 25 or hospital - whatever that was, sad as it was - on Saturday. </sentence><sentence id="469">On Sunday I came to see her. </sentence><sentence id="470">That was April the 10th. </sentence><sentence id="471">So here is a beautiful, brilliant, talented, healthy, athletic eighteen year old girl, delirious...with fever looking at me and she says I have to get up because tomorrow is the birthday of my sister and I didn't get her anything and I held her in my arms and she died in my arms. </sentence><sentence id="472">Watching this incredible drama was I woman that I did not know she...came up to me and she said in German, which I did not understand very well then - she said I don't have any children. </sentence><sentence id="473">I'm not married, but if I had a little girl, I would like her to look just like you and be just like you. </sentence><sentence id="474">Come. </sentence><sentence id="475">Martha had been in Auschwitz three months before we had arrived there. </sentence><sentence id="476">She was a nurse by profession, an operating room nurse, but in Auschwitz at that time she was carrying dead corpses which was - she witnessed this incredible little drama and she said (ph) - don't worry little girl. </sentence><sentence id="477">I will take care of you. </sentence><sentence id="478">Martha was about twenty years older than I was. </sentence><sentence id="479">And take care of me she did. </sentence><sentence id="480">She saved my life about four or five times. </sentence><sentence id="481">Four from the crematoria and others when I was deathly ill with typhoid or God knows that else, and she would steal injections and save me that way. </sentence><sentence id="482">So Sala died and I cried very bitterly that day. </sentence><sentence id="483">And then years came and went by before I cried again. </sentence><sentence id="484">I just did not cry. </sentence><sentence id="485">I couldn't. </sentence><sentence id="486">Once you let your defenses down, you're done. </sentence><sentence id="487">People say you know, you're very strong and I said that's bull. </sentence><sentence id="488">What does it mean?How do you practice the art of survival anyway? </sentence><sentence id="489">It's not a question of strength. </sentence><sentence id="490">You don't even know what's happening to you. </sentence><sentence id="491">What it is a sort of self, self-discipline by saying if I'm going to make it, I'm going to retreat from all that and emerge in a way into my own fantasy world. </sentence><sentence id="492">And it's very healthy. </sentence><sentence id="493">I have subsequently done quite a bit of reading in my studies, in my undergraduate and master's programs in various psychology books, a lot of which by the way I do not agree with, and Bruno Betelheim idea was something that I really could not agree with. </sentence><sentence id="494">The survival, the guilt of survivors - I don't have guilt for surviving. </sentence><sentence id="495">I was guilty - I said why am I the only one but can one question God or nature or fate? </sentence><sentence id="496">I don't know but this whole idea that one is guilty because one survived - it's not guilt - it is something else, and I don't think it's guilt at all. </sentence><sentence id="497">But the idea of fantasy is a very healthy idea, even today when things become a bit difficult and I am alone - I am at home everywhere, and I'm home nowheres. </sentence><sentence id="498">It's my, my life has been so totally uprooted at such an early stage that I have never been able to say this is the only place I feel home. </sentence><sentence id="499">I can feel home everywhere, or make my home anywhere and be perfectly comfortable about it. </sentence><sentence id="500">But to come back to your original question, uh Sala's death was very painful because she was a tremendous moral support for me. </sentence><sentence id="501">She was my older sister. </sentence><sentence id="502">She and I recognized that we will never see our  parents again and I knew exactly what happened to my parents and I still am to this day don't want to know or think that hopefully they were not conscious when they were thrown into the crematoria. </sentence><sentence id="503">And I had worked there for three months uh sorting the clothes of those who went there. </sentence><sentence id="504">Uh I continued to work and then eventually uh I don't know how - I really can't tell you - I transferred to another camp. </sentence><sentence id="505">It was, this was Birkenau. </sentence><sentence id="506">When I talked about Auschwitz, Auschwitz is Birkenau the way we know it. </sentence><sentence id="507">Auschwitz is a town where some of the medical experimentations were done etc. </sentence><sentence id="508">but the camp where or where, I don't know, I think two and one half million Jews were slaughtered, some were Christians, but for different reasons - and that's just as terrible. </sentence><sentence id="509">I was transferred I think to Lager C and then I was made what they call an . </sentence><sentence id="510">There were no children in Auschwitz by the way when I was there. </sentence><sentence id="511">There were I think five children because they only took the healthy, like say from eighteen to about thirty-five and so on, and I was really not. </sentence><sentence id="512">As again how I made it I don't know. </sentence><sentence id="513">That's something I can never understand. </sentence><sentence id="514">When I was in selections, which were all the time, and Mengele looked at me because I was so very fair, but anyone who came from the north whether you were Swedish or whether you were Norwegian or Polish, if you just happened to be light then you were light whether you were Jewish, Christian or anything else. </sentence><sentence id="515">He looked at me and I remember his face. </sentence><sentence id="516">He ways are you Jewish? </sentence><sentence id="517">And I said yes. </sentence><sentence id="518">What, first of all, not only my number but I had a little triangle that indicated that was even, you know, put salt on the open would. </sentence><sentence id="519">Were your parents Jewish? </sentence><sentence id="520">Yes. </sentence><sentence id="521">I says Umeglish (ph).Someone said shut up. </sentence><sentence id="522">Don't you know this guy conducts experimentation of all kinds, experiments of all kinds of things. </sentence><sentence id="523">He may want to do something to find out what, whether your blood is different from that of a Christian child. </sentence><sentence id="524">I didn't ... but I was exposed to a great many and again without having any kind of understanding whatsoever why I was spared, I don't know. </sentence><sentence id="525">On on four occasions I was not. </sentence><sentence id="526">But I was very very ill. </sentence><sentence id="527">I couldn't walk and I was hidden. </sentence><sentence id="528">And again uh Martha uh smuggled me into the Christian hospital - when I say hospital I mean the block where only the Christians were - the Jews and the Christians were often not together. </sentence><sentence id="529">And put about seventy-five different dresses on me because they all worked in the cre...you know in the crematoria where you could get those things. </sentence><sentence id="530">But I couldn't walk because I had probably typhoid or whatever, and they would inject me with glucose or whatever else they could their hands on to keep my strength up. </sentence><sentence id="531">I was fourteen by then, look like ten, and one day kline (ph), Dr. Kliner or whoever else was there came in, took down my number. </sentence><sentence id="532">Now we knew, we knew that once your number had been taken - that's the kiss of death. </sentence><sentence id="533">And there wasn't even a question of crying - you sort of accepted the fact that you are going to die. </sentence><sentence id="534">And you lived with that death. </sentence><sentence id="535">I have to interject something right here. </sentence><sentence id="536">Later on in my professional life as a singer, I studied for one of my concerts a beautiful song by Franz Schubert (ph) to the poetry by (ph) Klaudius called (ph), death and the girl. </sentence><sentence id="537">When death appears as friend, he says come, give me your hand, you sweet and lovely maiden - don't be afraid. </sentence><sentence id="538">I am your friend and I will take care of you. </sentence><sentence id="539">Well, later on when I studied that song it became extremely meaningful because I was praying for that kind ofa friend. </sentence><sentence id="540">During one of these, during that time when I knew that I was not going to be here tomorrow, the woman who was in the next bed was a student of Sigmund Fraud, somebody who was a well-known psychiatrist and she was also a she died... </sentence></p></dialogue>

( </sentence><sentence id="659">Thank you.) </sentence><sentence id="660">Alright. </sentence><sentence id="661">And I went to sleep. </sentence><sentence id="662">And I dreamt something quite incredible. </sentence><sentence id="663">And I told her about that later. </sentence><sentence id="664">I dreamt that I was walking on a very high precipice. </sentence><sentence id="665">I had very long blonde hair that mother used to do like you know Shirley Temple style and I was wearing a white and pink dress that was that was like a it was purely, it was a dream - I was walking and it was kind of moving around and I knew I knew that when I would that I was walking towards the end and there was nothing there. </sentence><sentence id="666">I would have to fall and die. </sentence><sentence id="667">And I kept going anyway. </sentence><sentence id="668">Now I couldn't walk in those days mind you, but I was sort of running. </sentence><sentence id="669">And as I approached that enormously steep precipice somebody jolted me and I woke up and there was Martha standing in front of me with tears in her eyes and she said my Kindchen (ph), little girl - a miracle just happened. </sentence><sentence id="670">We have been able to erase your number from Kline's list and you are not going to the crematorium. </sentence><sentence id="671">I told it I mean I didn't understand what psychology was. </sentence><sentence id="672">I had no idea who Freud was you know I mean. </sentence><sentence id="673">Uh I thought reading Anna Karenina under the table was something forbidden you know because uh and she said that was a very revealing dream. </sentence><sentence id="674">She says you are you have predicted your own future without even knowing it at that time. </sentence><sentence id="675">That happened a few times. </sentence><sentence id="676">I was made ______ meaning messenger. </sentence><sentence id="677">And because of that, because I was young and because at that point you sort of I don't know - they just accepted me there I guess... </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="678">Q: We are now back in Lager C... </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="680">A: Oh, we were in Lager C all the time, but there were different aspects of the "life", quote, unquote, in Lager C. During Lager C times there was a woman by the name of Irma Grese who was very frightening to be around. </sentence><sentence id="681">She was extremely beautiful, dressed as cleanly as you can possibly, you can see you could see your face in her boots. </sentence><sentence id="682">She was always with an enormous German Shepherd and a whip. </sentence><sentence id="683">And I was really very frightened of her. </sentence><sentence id="684">Everybody was. </sentence><sentence id="685">She would sick her dog on a poor inmate for no reason at all. </sentence><sentence id="686">And the dog would just about demolish that person. </sentence><sentence id="687">Very peculiar things kept happening to me. </sentence><sentence id="688">One evening, well evening - I don't know - one late afternoon after, we were never allowed you know we had our great big meal - stale bread and maybe a piece of salami and some horrible smelling coffee, then you could not go out. </sentence><sentence id="689">That was curfew. </sentence><sentence id="690">Someone, the head of the block. </sentence><sentence id="691">of the woman who was in charge of our barrack who was always an inmate, came up and she said uh Grese wants to see you. </sentence><sentence id="692">Now I did not know that and I didn't even know what homosexuality was but apparently she was a lesbian and because almost everyone there was five or six or seven years older than I was, and she and people said, oh boy, shall we kiss you goodbye you know. </sentence><sentence id="693">God knows what is what it is that she wants to do. </sentence><sentence id="694">I walked into the that little office and there was this Irma Grese standing in civilian clothes and I must tell you she looked like a vision out of another world. </sentence><sentence id="695">She was wearing a yellow coat. </sentence><sentence id="696">Her hair was blonde and usually she was it was always very tightly pulled back. </sentence><sentence id="697">Her hair was long, let loose. </sentence><sentence id="698">She wore perhaps a little lipstick - I don't remember. </sentence><sentence id="699">But she was wearing a yellow coat and she smiled at me. </sentence><sentence id="700">Imagine! </sentence><sentence id="701">I was frightened to death, and she looked at me and she said, I'll never forget that conversation - you know, I have forgotten a great deal purposefully because you can't live with all the memories, but there are some things that kind of stand out - and she said uh, come her, come here. </sentence><sentence id="702">She took my little cheek and she said, ah ha. </sentence><sentence id="703">She  said they tell me that you look a lot like I, and I wanted to be sure that was really true. </sentence><sentence id="704">And I in my total naivest said, oh I said, I don't think there's any, I've never seen anyone more beautiful, and I meant it. </sentence><sentence id="705">I mean she was like a vision. </sentence><sentence id="706">You know, you have to understand we haven't seen anything like that. </sentence><sentence id="707">The woman took a liking to me. </sentence><sentence id="708">Thank God she never did abuse me, but she made me stand guard in front of the barracks while she would make love to the most beautiful Jewish girls there. </sentence><sentence id="709">She also gave me an extra piece of salami and made me uh do her boots or something like that. </sentence><sentence id="710">In other words, she sort of took a slight liking. </sentence><sentence id="711">I then found out to my horror when I was already in London and bought the book called "The Belsen Trials," which is really the Auschwitz trials, Kramer and Hoess, that she was one of the five people who were actually executed for her crimes. </sentence><sentence id="712">She was twenty-three years old. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="858">A: Yes. </sentence><sentence id="859">What was so striking and in fact everything that I'm saying to you today is sort of in retrospect how weird those events were. </sentence><sentence id="860">Mengele never raised his voice. </sentence><sentence id="861">He would simply stand there with this finger, and this meant one thing and this meant another thing, and he says, you know you've really lived long enough. </sentence><sentence id="862">I think its time to go on. </sentence><sentence id="863">In that kind ofa manner. </sentence><sentence id="864">I never heard him raise his voice. </sentence><sentence id="865">He didn't have to. </sentence><sentence id="866">He relished and enjoyed every moment of his glorious power. </sentence><sentence id="867">So you see, when you think of Mengele, which is unbelievable, this is a monster. </sentence><sentence id="868">This is a medical doctor. </sentence><sentence id="869">When you think of Kline (ph), when yu think of the great minds in a sense, educated people, the crematoria as I've mentioned in some of my speeches when I, the few times that I do speak subjectively, and this is one of the few times that I do, the crematoria were built, were designed and built not by idiots, not by people who didn't know what they were doing. </sentence><sentence id="870">But by highly educated, trained Ph. </sentence><sentence id="871">D."s who knew exactly what they were doing. </sentence><sentence id="872">And they designed that whole "Dant'es Inferno" -  you know, there's a line in "Dante's Inferno" that says Lachate Oni Speranze Voiche (ph), that means abandon hope all ye who enter here. </sentence><sentence id="873">Now when Dante wrote this in his inferno, he must have been thinking about Auschwitz or places like Auschwitz. </sentence><sentence id="874">Or people like Mengele or like Kramer, like Hoess, like Grese and like so many other whose names I don't exactly remember - we were not formally introduced. </sentence><sentence id="875">The other thing about Auschwitz that I remember that helped me is to have a sense of humor. </sentence><sentence id="876">Some people say how can you do that? </sentence><sentence id="877">If you cannot laugh at yourself, you die. </sentence><sentence id="878">By the way, that's true of today too. </sentence><sentence id="879">People who take themselves very seriously are bores (ph), but when you have to, when you do not have a sense of humor during that time, and you really recognize the depth of the tragedy around you, you can't make it. </sentence><sentence id="880">You see the mind can still function. </sentence><sentence id="881">It can overcome all kinds of extraordinary circumstances. </sentence><sentence id="882">So say, he, I'll see you tomorrow on the soap board. </sentence><sentence id="883">And that sounds horrible doesn't it? </sentence><sentence id="884">But the truth is that as you know, they would make all kinds of, I mean the Germans, the Nazis I should say, were very cleaver as to what they were doing. </sentence><sentence id="885">They wast...wasted nothing. </sentence><sentence id="886">Everything was a must for fortunes of war, and the fat would be used for certain productions including soap. </sentence><sentence id="887">Now it sounds horrible today. </sentence><sentence id="888">It sounds depraved. </sentence><sentence id="889">But at that time it was a way of saying we know what's going to go on. </sentence><sentence id="890">There's nothing we can do about it. </sentence><sentence id="891">So let's laugh. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="941">A: Yes. </sentence><sentence id="942">Well I was first in the Jewish hospital. </sentence><sentence id="943">Well, I, the hos...the word hospital is incorrect. </sentence><sentence id="944">It's fallacious. </sentence><sentence id="945">There were no hospitals. </sentence><sentence id="946">There was a block where you went if you were sick and if you were Jewish which that means you never came out of there. </sentence><sentence id="947">Martha worked with the doctors because she was a nurse and somehow she was able to man...to get medicine, injections which she uh was able to administer to me which kept me alive. </sentence><sentence id="948">Uh the Christian inmates in the in the Christian hospital were allowed to get packages from home and would share some of the goodies from home with me because I was the child you see. </sentence><sentence id="949">I was that little girls. </sentence><sentence id="950">Uh and then on a few occasions Martha actually was able with the help of someone else to remove the number that was written down for me to go pastures is the only way you can put it. </sentence><sentence id="951">Uh something that the normal mind and I say, when I say normal mind I mean people who thank goodness, thank God have not experienced my adolescent years, would find it extremely difficult to grasp. </sentence><sentence id="952">Maybe people who were in Viet Nam might to some extent understand that when you walked out in the morning for the roll call, you would literally see hundreds of emaciated bodies still warm, piled up in front of the barracks, and you didn't cry. </sentence><sentence id="953">That was it. </sentence><sentence id="954">It was like you are in hell, and that's part of hell. </sentence><sentence id="955">When I think about it today I said how is it possible. </sentence><sentence id="956">It's beyond me. </sentence><sentence id="957">It is a question, when people say how did you survive, I haven't got the foggiest idea. </sentence><sentence id="958">There is no earthly reason in the world why I was chosen to talk to you today. </sentence><sentence id="959">I don't know. </sentence><sentence id="960">Maybe there is some plan that the heavens, God, whatever, that I'm here. </sentence><sentence id="961">Maybe to bear witness, and that is why I have set my own feelings aside, which is not easy, to uh to share with you some of my own remembrances so that perhaps those, the people or the children or whoever is going to perhaps hear what I have to say today, will recognize that the madness that is in our society today Neo-Nazis who say that the Holocaust never happened, that this is the pure imagination of the Jewish community, will know that uh theirs is a dangerous pack, and the Holocaust did not only happen but it's a very living reality. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="983">Q: I there anything else about Auschwitz, before we move on, anything more Auschwitz, that you want to add or to tell us? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="985">A: The only way I can describe Auschwitz is it wa the de...de...de...deepest dissension of what we considered in our wildest imagination, for hell to be. </sentence><sentence id="986">Auschwitz was the final the final apocalypse. </sentence><sentence id="987">It cannot be described really. </sentence><sentence id="988">Even I who was there for twenty-four months, have difficulty, and I'm sure that I have deliberately forgotten quite a great deal. </sentence><sentence id="989">I don't think I could function as a as a human being and be as an accomplished in many way and continue on with life if I had to live and remember what happened to me there. </sentence><sentence id="990">And I think again here the mind works some miracles. </sentence><sentence id="991">It was, you remember what is essential, but you sort of forget all the other - it's like having a baby - you remember the beauty but you don't remember the  pain, because other wise no woman would ever have a baby. </sentence><sentence id="992">Uh and Auschwitz was something, it was the cradle of death. </sentence><sentence id="993">It gave people who were deranged the absolute perfect opportunity to exercise their wildest macabre behavior. </sentence></p></dialogue>

( </sentence><sentence id="1020">Thank you.) </sentence><sentence id="1021">And I have primarily spoken to Christian groups in my short few years that I have decided that I had a responsibility. </sentence><sentence id="1022">I wanted to speak to the Christian community, to make them understand that. </sentence><sentence id="1023">Now, I left, or I would say I didn't leave - I was evacuated from Auschwitz on January 24th, - I came to Auschwitz, excuse me, I came to Auschwitz on January 24th, 1941, and evacuated on January 18th, 1945. </sentence><sentence id="1024">That was another terrible time. </sentence><sentence id="1025">We actually went through Berlin and saw a leveled city. </sentence><sentence id="1026">By that time I spoke fluent German, fluent -you see I did go to school there - fluent German, fluent Hungarian, fluent Czechoslovakian, and fluent Italian I mean - there were so many people from all over the world, and I wound up in a dreadful place called Ravensbruck. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1051">A: By train, I don't know how many days it took but counting was not one of those things that we did there. </sentence><sentence id="1052">It was by that time the end of January, maybe two weeks later, maybe ten days after - I really don't know, but it was in January. </sentence><sentence id="1053">Ravensbruck was built for x amount, like maybe thirty-five hundred people, and at that time we were there were something like fifteen thousand people. </sentence><sentence id="1054">It was dreadful, horrible, and extraordinarily - I met Martha there, and she said to me at that time, if anything happens and either one of us is alive, I want you to meet me in such and such a city after the war. </sentence><sentence id="1055">And she's still alive. </sentence><sentence id="1056">She's in Brazil, and I went to see her in Brazil. </sentence><sentence id="1057">She's quite ill. </sentence><sentence id="1058">She has never recovered from Auschwitz. </sentence><sentence id="1059">I guess she must be about seventy-five now perhaps - I don't really know. </sentence><sentence id="1060">Uh but anyway after Ravensbruck of which I have a blur because it was terrible, and like typical Martha, she shared her slice of bread with me and still reprimanded me because I, I mean she sort of imagined herself that I was her little girl, and then... </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1061">Q: Do, don't don't go by Ravensbruck even if its a blur quite so quickly. </sentence><sentence id="1062">How long were you there? </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1063">A: I would say about three weeks. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1065">Q: What, through the blur, can you remember, of the camp? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1067">A: Masses of people, death, terrible starvation, no work. </sentence><sentence id="1068">We didn't work there. </sentence><sentence id="1069">It was, there was there was some chaos at that point, and don't forget this is January "45 and I think Auschwitz in fact had already been liberated by the Russians, and we were just, kept going on. </sentence><sentence id="1070">I can't tell you too much about it because as I said I remember being uh praying let's get this out, I don't want to live anymore. </sentence><sentence id="1071">I mean, you know, you can't go on like that. </sentence><sentence id="1072">I knew there was no one left as far as my family was concerned. </sentence><sentence id="1073">I knew there was no way. </sentence><sentence id="1074">Uh I don't know what happened to Martha after that because we were separated. </sentence><sentence id="1075">And then again we were put on trains and ridden further into what was still the remaining of the Third Reich. </sentence><sentence id="1076">And I wound up in a camp called Retzof-am-Richlin (ph), which was apparently not originally a concentration camp. </sentence><sentence id="1077">It was a camp that was built for the men or the women who worked adjoining uh there was a very large factory where they I was told they manufacture the uh the missiles that eventually devastated London, and so that it was a much more relaxed camp. </sentence><sentence id="1078">There were no crematoria. </sentence><sentence id="1079">Uh it was already confusion. </sentence><sentence id="1080">I mean this was already like you know beginning of February, end of January, February, March, April - I was there actually until, perhaps I was in Ravensbruck longer than that because I think I was in Retzof for about three and a half months. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1095">Q: Can you describe the camp for us? </sentence><sentence id="1096">Where were you taken first? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1099">A: I don't remember. </sentence><sentence id="1100">It was not the same procedure that was both either at Auschwitz or Ravensbruck. </sentence><sentence id="1101">Uh we were brought on trucks in fact, not on a train, to my knowledge. </sentence><sentence id="1102">We were on trucks and we were quite sure they were going to shoot us because Retzof is surrounded by many woods. </sentence><sentence id="1103">Uh what struck me about that camp was that it was relatively nice, meaning that it was not, the barracks were different. </sentence><sentence id="1104">They were much more, they were much bigger. </sentence><sentence id="1105">Uh it was smaller. </sentence><sentence id="1106">There may have been maybe two thousand, twenty-five hundred people, mainly women. </sentence><sentence id="1107">I don't remember seeing men there. </sentence><sentence id="1108">It was much looser in discipline. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1123">A: How do you mean? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1125">Q: You say it was looser in discipline. </sentence><sentence id="1126">What did that mean? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1129">A: It meant that uh they'd fill up, the behavior of the guards was not as obnoxious and as scary. </sentence><sentence id="1130">They were primarily men, German soldiers, rather than women. </sentence><sentence id="1131">Women could be terrible, by the way. </sentence><sentence id="1132">The women in Auschwitz were horrendous, the German women. </sentence><sentence id="1133">There were to my  recollection no women. </sentence><sentence id="1134">There was a women's camp, but there were mainly men who were the guards. </sentence><sentence id="1135">The commandant was not as scary as I remember say Hoess Ora Kramer. </sentence><sentence id="1136">The majority of the pe...the workforce, we worked in the woods where we would uh chop wood for the war production because again this was around the woods and we never felt by the way that we would get out of there. </sentence><sentence id="1137">Never. </sentence><sentence id="1138">We were quite sure that we were going to be shot, that they could not let, not everyone had a number - not that many were out of Auschwitz, but some of us were. </sentence><sentence id="1139">In fact the majority really. </sentence><sentence id="1140">There really are not that many who have that kind of a number as I do because uh - don't ask me why. </sentence><sentence id="1141">Providence. </sentence><sentence id="1142">Je ne sais pas. </sentence><sentence id="1143">I don't know. </sentence><sentence id="1144">So that Retzof particularly after Ravensbruck was heaven. </sentence><sentence id="1145">I mean you could, and again they asked me what did I do - I mean what, everybody sort of did something if you survived that long, my God, you know, what did you do? </sentence><sentence id="1146">Said I was a loifering (ph). </sentence><sentence id="1147">Oh good, we need a loifering (ph) here. </sentence><sentence id="1148">So immediately they gave me that bandanna with the gothic letters and I became a loifering (ph). </sentence><sentence id="1149">That means that I could go to the kitchen and sometimes they, the German woman in charge would throw me an extra piece of bread. </sentence><sentence id="1150">I didn't need very much in those days. </sentence><sentence id="1151">I think that may have also, I really think that may have contributed somewhat to my survival. </sentence><sentence id="1152">As a child I didn't need much food. </sentence><sentence id="1153">I didn't, I did not eat very much there, and so much so that when I eventually came to this country and my aunt was very concerned because I could go three days without eating, and she took me to the Valley Hospital for some tests. </sentence><sentence id="1154">They found that my stomach had shrunk very considerably. </sentence><sentence id="1155">I simply was not accustomed to sitting down and eating a normal meal. </sentence><sentence id="1156">I still can't do seven courses in on in one evening. </sentence><sentence id="1157">I have tried to justified, to justify why I and why not somebody else, and it's not the guilt in me. </sentence><sentence id="1158">It's the questioning, why, and I have no idea. </sentence><sentence id="1159">I don't know. </sentence><sentence id="1160">It is absolutely against all odds. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1193">Q: Can you tell me, what did you do in Retzof? </sentence><sentence id="1194">Did you work and what was your work in addition to being a loifering? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1197">A: Primarily I was a loifering which means that I stood in front, inside the gates of the camp, and be ready to be at any body's beck and call from the main Block Fuhrerstube (ph) or the guards who needed something, or bring their supper or whatever. </sentence><sentence id="1198">And then I worked for a while in the woods with the other kommando chopping woods which was a little heavy work, and that's basically what was going on there. </sentence><sentence id="1199">There was, there were other things there. </sentence><sentence id="1200">There were mis...uh seamstress who were doing some clothes correction I remember. </sentence><sentence id="1201">As I said this camp had different things but you have to understand again, I wish I could be more descriptive to you as to what, how and when, but I really can't because I can only tell you from my memory what I did when. </sentence><sentence id="1202">I really don't know - there were so many other aspects. </sentence><sentence id="1203">And we didn't exactly share the information on what was going on five blocks away, so that a great deal of my information about, not about my own subjective experience, but about the entire tragedy of the catastrophe I learned by reading about other peoples" accounts and by reading historical and documentation of that nature. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1211">Q: We of course are going to focus here on you. ( </sentence><sentence id="1212">Right.) </sentence><sentence id="1213">Uh, can you tell us of uh, do certain things that went on in the camp or in your experience, stand out in your memory? </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1214">A: Yes, It does. </sentence><sentence id="1215">In fact, what stands out in my memory even in Auschwitz, was that humanity was not lost among the among the survivors, among - I shouldn't say survivors, among the inmates. </sentence><sentence id="1216">People did care for each other. </sentence><sentence id="1217">People did give each other moral support. </sentence><sentence id="1218">People did commensurate with each other and tried to help. </sentence><sentence id="1219">There was very little because people were dying and the suffering was so intense that it was very difficult to give strength to someone else, but Martha is a perfect example. </sentence><sentence id="1220">There were a few others who extended a helping hand. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="1228">But the one incident that comes about me is a very unusual one. </sentence><sentence id="1229">and a very far-out sort of an incident because it came from a German soldier in Retzof-am-Richlin. </sentence><sentence id="1230">There was a young nineteen year old guard who very shortly after I arrived there, started look at me very differently, and I didn't know why. </sentence><sentence id="1231">He, eventually we spoke, we met. </sentence><sentence id="1232">He was actually from Luxembourg. </sentence><sentence id="1233">He was a medical student. </sentence><sentence id="1234">He was brought in there. </sentence><sentence id="1235">He said to me, what are you doing here, the first time I saw him. </sentence><sentence id="1236">He was a guard standing on this scaffold with a gun, and I was down here standing and he started to sing me a little, a little German song. </sentence><sentence id="1237">And I thought boy, this guy has a real sense of humor, you know. </sentence><sentence id="1238">And he said listen, what are you going here? </sentence><sentence id="1239">And he didn't say it in an angry way. </sentence><sentence id="1240">And I thought to myself, he's crazy. </sentence><sentence id="1241">I said, well, Iam Jewish. </sentence><sentence id="1242">And he apologized and he said, he was obviously very green. </sentence><sentence id="1243">He didn't realize it. </sentence><sentence id="1244">He said look, I knew what was going to the, I knew what was going on in Germany with the Jewish community, but I am, I was a medical student until just a few months ago, and I had no idea to what extent the brutality went on. </sentence><sentence id="1245">I am only now learning from the older guards who talk about it with relish, and I go out and I vomit. </sentence><sentence id="1246">This young nineteen year old medical student, SS guard because they needed new people to they brought anyone in, Rumanians, Bulgarians, eventually within a few months, was willing to risk his life by saying to me, you are not going to survive because they will kill you. </sentence><sentence id="1247">This, the rumor goes around that they will shoot everybody here. </sentence><sentence id="1248">They can't, they don't want to whatever is left, they can't let, leave that much evidence. </sentence><sentence id="1249">I have contacted a woman in the village who lost her husband and two sons and is very bitter, told her about you. </sentence><sentence id="1250">She says she will give me civilian clothes and | will take you there when there is a break. </sentence><sentence id="1251">I promise you. </sentence><sentence id="1252">And I said why are you doing it. </sentence><sentence id="1253">He said because I love you. </sentence><sentence id="1254">Now you have to understand that here was a Jewish girl, sixteen years old, speaking to a German, to a man wearing a German uniform saying I love you and I'm not going to let you die. </sentence><sentence id="1255">I'm going to help you. </sentence><sentence id="1256">I said we can both hang for it. </sentence><sentence id="1257">Don't say a word to anyone. </sentence><sentence id="1258">It's a long story which I will not go into now, but I was Very... </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1529">A: Through the American Joint Distribution Committee the with the with the orphans uh program, and | uh instead of spending a year in London or six months which they told me you don't know English - I think it's a good idea that yu go there before you go to the States because you're under Polish visa or quota uh, why don't you go to London and you can at least learn a little bit of English. </sentence><sentence id="1530">And I said well, very well and I knew three words in English at that time, thank you and peace. </sentence><sentence id="1531">And it turned out to e four years. </sentence><sentence id="1532">And I loved it. </sentence><sentence id="1533">Uh and so I came from Breslau to Prague, from Prague to London, from London to New York, etc. </sentence><sentence id="1534">etc. </sentence><sentence id="1535">and now I'm in Washington. </sentence></p></dialogue>
