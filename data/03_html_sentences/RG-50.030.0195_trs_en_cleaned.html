<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="54">A: Well, we were three children and I was the oldest this and they called me Shari at the time. </sentence><sentence id="55">Yaffa is my new name in Hebrew and my sister who is fifteen months younger, Eva, and my brother was five years younger than me, was named Kalman Yoszef. </sentence><sentence id="56">We were children in the usual sense. </sentence><sentence id="57">We had a home, a small home. </sentence><sentence id="58">We were not very rich but we were comfortable. </sentence><sentence id="59">My mother was a very beautiful, immaculate woman, household. </sentence><sentence id="60">01:03:  The children...very strict. </sentence><sentence id="61">They were very disciplinarian for the children. </sentence><sentence id="62">I remember hearing my mother say to her friend, you can't show children too much love because then you won't be able to discipline them. </sentence><sentence id="63">That's was the style at the time. </sentence><sentence id="64">We had to listen to our parents . </sentence><sentence id="65">My father, as I said, worked for the Czechoslovakian government. </sentence><sentence id="66">He also had parts in a butcher shop or he went to the cattle markets to help buy the cattle and by our home we had a yard with geese and chickens and a vegetable garden. </sentence><sentence id="67">As I remember the town was divided. </sentence><sentence id="68">The lower part was where the river was. </sentence><sentence id="69">Then was the middle part and then was up, the upper part where the Okno ??_, </sentence><sentence id="70">where the mines...there were salt mines in that town. </sentence><sentence id="71">We lived in the middle of the town. </sentence><sentence id="72">Slatina, the part that I knew and most Jews know was the main street with main stores and they were mostly Jewish. </sentence><sentence id="73">We hardly knew the Christians because they didn't live between us. </sentence><sentence id="74">We really separated ourselves. </sentence><sentence id="75">It was not a shtetle atmosphere. </sentence><sentence id="76">It was more because of the border town, was more sophisticated, let's say than the shtetl. </sentence><sentence id="77">However we Jews did stick together and we lived together and we were separated from the other people. </sentence><sentence id="78">My grandmother lived in... remember my grandmother. </sentence><sentence id="79">She made a living off making popcorn over flames and selling (it in) newspapers made into cones. </sentence><sentence id="80">Our family lived in that town for many...for quite a few generations. </sentence><sentence id="81">Naturally it was not the same nationality because the place changed hands and not the town </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="110">Q: What about school? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="112">A: We went to public school. </sentence><sentence id="113">Under Czechoslovakian government every...all children went to school. </sentence><sentence id="114">However, let's say gymnasium, high school and things, that was percentages for Jews. </sentence><sentence id="115">The numerus clausus. </sentence><sentence id="116">Not all Jews could go because there was only certain percentage that could go...even under the democratic Czechoslovakians it existed. </sentence><sentence id="117">So we all, all of us children did go to school, public school. </sentence><sentence id="118">01:06: We were mixed with Christian children, but there was never closeness with the Christian children and our Jewish children in our town. </sentence><sentence id="119">There was a beautiful park that we used to go to because it was salt mines in town, and salt baths, you know, for health purposes they had baths. </sentence><sentence id="120">They had beautiful parks where we went sometimes to listen to music, but not always did we dare go because there were always bad times for Jews. </sentence><sentence id="121">I do remember as a young girl the Czechoslovakians had a sport complex called Sokol and they played tennis there and I just drooled. </sentence><sentence id="122">I wanted to play so terribly, and naturally I wouldn't have been accepted and we don't even try. </sentence><sentence id="123">I'm making up for it now. </sentence><sentence id="124">Again my father knew many Czechoslovakians because he worked with them and the only intermingled my father used to go in once in a while in the billiard clubs. </sentence><sentence id="125">At the time they played billiards, and he used to know a lot of people. </sentence><sentence id="126">I remember one...my parent's anniversary was on Purim, the holiday, and he got drunk once a little and he ran into the mayor of the city and we ran after him. </sentence><sentence id="127">We were kids. </sentence><sentence id="128">We didn't want him to because we were afraid, but he said, what is it you want from us Jews? </sentence><sentence id="129">What did we do to you? </sentence><sentence id="130">That was one occasion that sticks in my mind, but he was kind of a little fighter, my father, and that is  how we lived until 1938. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="151">Q: What happened in "38? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="153">A: In 1938...I don't know the dates or so...but the Czechs left. </sentence><sentence id="154">I remember they had colonies of beautiful homes, the Czechoslovakian people, up on the upper part of town and they left and the Ukrainians took over and I remember it only because we had to change schools. </sentence><sentence id="155">I mean the place was the same, but the language we had to change. </sentence><sentence id="156">We studied up till now in schools Czech, and we had some good teachers, some not so good teachers, like every place else I would say. </sentence><sentence id="157">Now the __ were the Ukrainian fasc...uh fascists, like the SS the German, the _ the Hungarian, the ___ was the Ukrainian uh fascist organization, but in school we started learning the alphabet. </sentence><sentence id="158">That's what Ukrainian use. </sentence><sentence id="159">We learned their anthem, their national anthem, , which J still remember, and uh but they...Ukrainian hated the Jews more than the Czechoslovaks. </sentence><sentence id="160">There was lots of fear and panic and sometimes they picked up some men and we never saw them again. </sentence><sentence id="161">And uh I only remember vaguely that there was a lot of panic around. </sentence><sentence id="162">Supposedly there was a list of about three hundred Jews, maybe not all in our town or the surrounding area, to be killed. </sentence><sentence id="163">Just a list of Jews to be killed. </sentence><sentence id="164">But it seems to me that as of the same time when the Jews were supposed to be killed, the Hungarians came in and took over and we were very happy that the Hungarians came in naturally. </sentence><sentence id="165">At least for a day or two we were happy, but then the atrocities started with the Hungarian army. </sentence><sentence id="166">Generally, it was accepted that armies marching in will commit atrocities. </sentence><sentence id="167">Ol:11: As kids we only heard that there were rapes and women tortured, breasts cut off...as children we heard those things happening. </sentence><sentence id="168">However we kind of for a while felt comfortable because they didn't kill all those Jews with the list and the Ukrainians were gone. </sentence><sentence id="169">Naturally my father didn't have a job by then because the Czechoslovakian government wasn't there and they put him to work in the mines, in the salt mines, down deep in the mines. </sentence><sentence id="170">And we became very poor. </sentence><sentence id="171">However we were kind of proud people, my family. </sentence><sentence id="172">And I remember on Friday nights for the Sabbath that my mother covered empty pots on the stove so we don't show anybody that we have nothing to eat, and that we have nothing to cook with, but all in all, my grandmother was making her popcorn and she then she moved in with us, and somehow we survived that part too. </sentence><sentence id="173">And there were a lot of beatings from the Hungarians. </sentence><sentence id="174">Sometimes they went around the streets, the Hungarians, all the villagers together which were not pure Hungarians...they were mixed Romanians, Hungarians, Slaves, Ukrainians, even Shobs (ph) were around in the area and whoever was in their way or whatever they felt like attacking, they attacked and they hurt and they killed and  01:13: they took what they wanted. </sentence><sentence id="175">My father worked in the mines and he also tried to go to the cattle markets to see if he can do some business because people still ate. </sentence><sentence id="176">There were still a lot of butchers around and cattle and many times he came home beaten up and in the spring or early summer of 1941, while my father was away in a market, the gendarme or whatever...I don't remember anymore what they were calling the police...came with an order to tell my mother that in a week, in a week we will be taken away, that we are not Hungarian citizens and we will be taken away someplace else, to someplace where there is work, in work camps. </sentence><sentence id="177">Now as I say, my father was not home then. </sentence><sentence id="178">What my mother did at first is what every Jew, good Jew will do...take the children and go to the temple and open the Torahs (ph) and cry and beg. ..... </sentence><sentence id="179">Excuse me. </sentence><sentence id="180">01:15: And we went home and that evening when we came back from the temple, there was a cart with horses in front of the house. </sentence><sentence id="181">My father was brought home beaten very severely and we took him in the house. </sentence><sentence id="182">We did to him what we can and when my mother told him that we'll be taken away, she suggested we hide out and go to another place Sziget or wherever and hide out, not to go. </sentence><sentence id="183">But my father felt it can't be any worse than it is. </sentence><sentence id="184">Let's go. </sentence><sentence id="185">So we went. </sentence><sentence id="186">In a week's time everybody got a bundle. </sentence><sentence id="187">We took what we can. </sentence><sentence id="188">We were not allowed to take anything else except what we can carry. </sentence><sentence id="189">We went to the train station. </sentence><sentence id="190">They packed us into in cattle cars. </sentence><sentence id="191">I don't know if there were seventy or a hundred or how many. </sentence><sentence id="192">I know there was no place to sit. </sentence><sentence id="193">We were able to somehow stand and I also cannot tell you how long we were in those cattle cars. </sentence><sentence id="194">They were not fast, and they took us...we don't know how we traveled...the geography of it. </sentence><sentence id="195">I can look at some names on the maps and remember where we were, but I don't know how we traveled with the trains and where the trains existed. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="241">Q: Can you tell us about that ride? </sentence><sentence id="242">What was it like inside the cattle car? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="245">A: Yes. </sentence><sentence id="246">It was hot and crowded. </sentence><sentence id="247">No water. </sentence><sentence id="248">No hygiene. </sentence><sentence id="249">No toilets. </sentence><sentence id="250">They didn't open the doors for two, three days at a time. </sentence><sentence id="251">We had dead people in with us and when they stopped maybe every every three days when they stopped, we handed out the dead. </sentence><sentence id="252">They didn't let us do any hygiene or wash our clothes or anything. </sentence><sentence id="253">If you had some food with you, you ate something but you shared with your people that you were around, but there was no place to move. </sentence><sentence id="254">We kind of sat down everybody and where you could, but we really couldn't move. </sentence><sentence id="255">We stayed in the same place, night and day. </sentence><sentence id="256">Hygiene or not. </sentence><sentence id="257">Went on for I think about a week or so, because I think the trains were put on side lines and we stayed standing still. </sentence><sentence id="258">We were not always traveling. </sentence><sentence id="259">I don't know if they had a name where to bring us or not, but we were definitely standing still for many hours and hours and hours. </sentence><sentence id="260">The heat and the smell were... a young girl...in 1941 I was twelve going on thirteen, I think...I can't count now. </sentence><sentence id="261">I just remember the terrible smells and the terrible situation that it was. </sentence><sentence id="262">But we arrived...I think the place was called Yassinga (ph) in the Ukrainian. </sentence><sentence id="263">We  got out from the train. </sentence><sentence id="264">01:19: I don't know how many died on the way, how many we handed out. </sentence><sentence id="265">Most of the older people did go. </sentence><sentence id="266">Our grandmother stayed home. </sentence><sentence id="267">It was my family, my father, mother and the three children that were taken. </sentence><sentence id="268">In Yassina they put us on trucks, also piled very close on and drove and I think they dropped us off in Kolomeia, I think. </sentence><sentence id="269">I'm not sure of the names and the route. </sentence><sentence id="270">And we were still with the Hungarian guards when they dropped us off, and they said in the middle of a highway they dropped us, you cannot come back. </sentence><sentence id="271">We will shoot you. </sentence><sentence id="272">You can only go inside, but from the inside Ukrainian guards came with rifles and said to us, you can't go this way. </sentence><sentence id="273">You can only go back. </sentence><sentence id="274">We were on this on the middle of the road and the Ukrainian shot started shooting and people were killed and I remember one of the men. </sentence><sentence id="275">His arms were shot off but it was hanging and bleeding and we were still in the middle of the road and we walked away to the side of the road and most of the people sat down. </sentence><sentence id="276">Now we were a big group of people, because wasn't only from our town but it was from other towns doing the same thing, but the man that had his arm hanging begged, shoot me please. </sentence><sentence id="277">Please shoot me. </sentence><sentence id="278">At that time they didn't. </sentence><sentence id="279">They just let him stand and walk around with the families crying and begging. </sentence><sentence id="280">After a time...I don't know how much time. </sentence><sentence id="281">I don't know. </sentence><sentence id="282">I can't say. </sentence><sentence id="283">They let us walk towards inside Galacia (ph) and but before that the man with the hanging arm was taken away and we heard the shots and the family dug a grave at that time and they buried him. </sentence><sentence id="284">I don't know where it is, but there in that area we also met people from Bukovina that came at that time. </sentence><sentence id="285">Now they did not have places where to take us. </sentence><sentence id="286">We only walked. </sentence><sentence id="287">Not in towns. </sentence><sentence id="288">Outside of the towns by the fields and we kept on walking, day in and day out. </sentence><sentence id="289">No food. </sentence><sentence id="290">No water. </sentence><sentence id="291">No hygiene. </sentence><sentence id="292">Nothing. </sentence><sentence id="293">If we were lucky enough to be by a field that was growing something that we could eat and we can take it, we tried to do that. </sentence><sentence id="294">The shooting was very easy. </sentence><sentence id="295">Anything they didn't like...that was the Ukrainian . </sentence><sentence id="296">Anything they didn't like or if they were annoyed they just take out the rifle or they hit with the rifle or they shoot with the rifle. </sentence><sentence id="297">They gave us rest maybe once or twice a day, and we walked. </sentence><sentence id="298">I don't know if it was twenty, twenty-five kilometers daily, children and older people. </sentence><sentence id="299">I remember there was a boy that walked next to us. </sentence><sentence id="300">It was a big transport by then...a few thousand people. </sentence><sentence id="301">He carried his sick old mother whose legs were very swollen, on his shoulder. </sentence><sentence id="302">He was young, about fifteen, sixteen year old boy...for a long time. </sentence><sentence id="303">Each time we rested he took her off the shoulder, put her down to rest. </sentence><sentence id="304">Then he got up, took her on the shoulder and carried her further and one day he didn't do it fast enough. </sentence><sentence id="305">They killed the mother right then and there, by the side. </sentence><sentence id="306">They wouldn't even give him time to bury her. </sentence><sentence id="307">01:24:  We had to go on. </sentence><sentence id="308">The , they were very primitive people, very religious Catholics but very primitive. </sentence><sentence id="309">Very hateful towards us Jews. </sentence><sentence id="310">Some of them were happy to kill us and hit us and do the worst that they can do to people. </sentence><sentence id="311">Now at this time I only remember the walking and incidents that stand out. </sentence><sentence id="312">We came to a place, a small town that there was a well. </sentence><sentence id="313">I see it in the middle like. </sentence><sentence id="314">I don't know where it was and what but it was a well and we were like around the whole transport and the __ were standing close to the well. </sentence><sentence id="315">A little boy...to me he looked very little... went over to him. </sentence><sentence id="316">Said can I have water. </sentence><sentence id="317">He said you want water, and the boy says please, water. </sentence><sentence id="318">He could hardly speak. </sentence><sentence id="319">And he took his rifle and shot him right there, next to him by his feet, because the boy wanted water. </sentence><sentence id="320">And that picture is with me through the years. </sentence><sentence id="321">I I live with it. </sentence><sentence id="322">I mean I don't think about it all the time but it's there. </sentence><sentence id="323">Sometimes when we rested like next to the Dnjestr, the River Dnjestr, we rested and there was a little girl from Bukovina with her brother, with a big tall brother and a girl about...I don't know...she was older than me. </sentence><sentence id="324">She was beautiful with gold earrings, big black braids she had and they dunked in the Dnjestr, held her down. </sentence><sentence id="325">The two braids were on top of the water. </sentence><sentence id="326">They dunked her down into the water and held her and then they pulled her up and they did that a few times and then they brought her out. </sentence><sentence id="327">Same day they picked out when we were resting at night by the side of the road, they picked out men. </sentence><sentence id="328">They took them away. </sentence><sentence id="329">I remember it well because we lay on my father. </sentence><sentence id="330">We covered him, the children and my mother covered my father so they don't see him, so they don't take him away. </sentence><sentence id="331">They took...picked out ten, fifteen, twenty men, almost every day. </sentence><sentence id="332">We never heard from them again. </sentence><sentence id="333">We never saw them again. </sentence><sentence id="334">They were killed. </sentence><sentence id="335">They were killed like there is no consideration at all. </sentence><sentence id="336">In transport after transport, wherever we went...killing old men in all way. </sentence><sentence id="337">And we walked that way until we came to Kamenitz- Podolsk. </sentence><sentence id="338">Kamenitz-Podolsk was like a farm, enclosed with barbed wire and we saw machine guns around the whole farm, with the barbed wire around and machine guns and as we entered in that corral a Wehrmacht officer said to my mother and father, if you don't run away you'll be dead. </sentence><sentence id="339">A Wehrmacht officer. </sentence><sentence id="340">So as we came in, there was a farm house and most people from the big transport, many thousands of people came in and we slowly sneaked into that farm in a very little room, like a two by two size room. </sentence><sentence id="341">My family of five. </sentence><sentence id="342">Some other people that we were twenty-two together, children and adults together, and we closed the door...no windows or nothing, and we just sat there and we we wanted to get out because we believed the Wehrmacht officer that we will be killed. </sentence><sentence id="343">We saw their machine guns. </sentence><sentence id="344">I don't know how and why they searched. </sentence><sentence id="345">We heard them search upstairs, next to us, below us, every corner that you can imagine we heard them. </sentence><sentence id="346">We don't know how long we sat there. </sentence><sentence id="347">It seemed to us like a very long time. </sentence><sentence id="348">And the children didn't cry and my brother was younger with five years and there were younger children even. </sentence><sentence id="349">We just sat, bundled all of us in that two by two cell until it got dark outside, and they didn't find us. </sentence><sentence id="350">And somehow...the fence, the wire fence somehow didn't reach that house and at night we we went out through that house. </sentence><sentence id="351">Out, and we ran away there, the twenty-two people. </sentence><sentence id="352">We heard later that they did kill most of the people because we know somebody that came out from under the dead, but I don't know if you want to hear this now or shall I go into this later. </sentence><sentence id="353">When my sister went to Israel and she jumped from the ship so they don't take her away to Cypress, a person that we were very friendly with, that was supposed to be killed in Kamenitz-Podolsk saved her. </sentence><sentence id="354">She cannot swim. </sentence><sentence id="355"> Saved her in the sea in Israel and she didn't know if she's alive or she is dead, that she sees somebody what she thought was dead and he said no, I am alive. </sentence><sentence id="356">Not only dead, under the dead, as he moved to get out after waiting a long time, he heard somebody else moving and his own son somehow did not get the bullets and they came out from under the dead. </sentence><sentence id="357">That was in Kamenitz-Podolsk. </sentence><sentence id="358">We heard that everybody was killed, not on all those machine guns andthe _ helped. </sentence><sentence id="359">We slowly walked back and we walked back...I have on the map marked out the towns that we passed like Chortkov, some other towns on the way. </sentence><sentence id="360">We arrived in Stanislav, one of the towns. </sentence><sentence id="361">I can give you the exact location...but I have it marked out here, and Stanislav...and we went into the Jewish ghetto. </sentence><sentence id="362">There were still the Jews...in 1941 was fairly early. </sentence><sentence id="363">They didn't have the camps at the time. </sentence><sentence id="364">I think the camps started in 1942. </sentence><sentence id="365">And in the ghetto my sister was very out- going and very smart, very talented, what she knew how to speak to people. </sentence><sentence id="366">Let's say she had a way, as a little girl, and a German officer gave us food from the officer's kitchen. </sentence><sentence id="367">For about three weeks we rested in Stanislav. </sentence><sentence id="368">Once or twice a day they gave us food from the kitchen. </sentence><sentence id="369">And that was lucky. </sentence><sentence id="370">We kind of rested and built up some strength and then we went on to Nadvorna, another town on the way and in Nadvorna we were invited to some Jewish family's also in the ghetto. </sentence><sentence id="371">These were all in Ukraine naturally and we found in Nadvornia a beggar that used to cross the Carpethian Mountains to beg and he for jewelry that we had left was willing to take us across the Carpethian Mountains back to Hungary, and he said it will take us two days from Nadvornia walking and we started out. </sentence><sentence id="372">It was late autumn by that time, because it was before the Jewish holidays and however the two days turned into eight days. </sentence><sentence id="373">We got lost, with the guide together. </sentence><sentence id="374">I remember Yom Kippur. </sentence><sentence id="375">My mother left burning candles in the forest in there, just covered up for Yom Kippur. </sentence><sentence id="376">We still believed that we _. </sentence><sentence id="377">We still had to fast and we were still good Jews to observe what we can observe. </sentence><sentence id="378">We had no food. </sentence><sentence id="379">We had some...my mother had left had some ground like coffee with some sugar that she mixed together and gave the kids a teaspoonful every few hours or so. </sentence><sentence id="380">Water we found once in a while in the forest in the little streams. </sentence><sentence id="381">We found...it was cold. </sentence><sentence id="382">We were almost naked. </sentence><sentence id="383">No clothes. </sentence><sentence id="384">And we found blueberries, frozen blueberries. </sentence><sentence id="385">That kept us alive. </sentence><sentence id="386">We picked the frozen blueberries. </sentence><sentence id="387">They kept us alive. </sentence><sentence id="388">One day we were walking in the forest and all of a sudden my mother looked like she fell into something. </sentence><sentence id="389">It looked like it was a well and it was not closed up. </sentence><sentence id="390">It was just like one piece of wood across the well, and that one piece of wood saved my mother from falling into that well, and we helped her up and we continued walking and we arrived in someplace in Hungary across the mountains. </sentence><sentence id="391">I don't know the town. </sentence><sentence id="392">I know there were Jewish people there. </sentence><sentence id="393">I'm sad to say they wouldn't let us sleep in the barn. </sentence><sentence id="394">They said they're not Jews. </sentence><sentence id="395">01:36: They're Hungarians. </sentence><sentence id="396">And they wouldn't give us the help. </sentence><sentence id="397">They were afraid. </sentence><sentence id="398">The fear, the  fear was terrible. </sentence><sentence id="399">They were afraid that if they let us stay out they will be taken away from their home. </sentence><sentence id="400">Somehow we arrived very late autumn back in Slatina where we lived, but we couldn't stay there. </sentence><sentence id="401">They would have taken us away again. </sentence><sentence id="402">So I went to Nojvarod which is in Transylvania to my uncle. </sentence><sentence

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="639">Q: What was Budapest like then? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="641">A: At the time uh Budapest in "42 and "43...there was anti-Semitism and there was hatred for the Jews. </sentence><sentence id="642">However, you somehow could still work and live. </sentence><sentence id="643">You didn't need to be ina ghetto at the time either. </sentence><sentence id="644">And you didn't have the yellow star at the time yet either. </sentence><sentence id="645">Later  on it came. </sentence><sentence id="646">We lived and mixed with Christians and non-Christians, but the minute they found out that you're Jewish, they did not care very much. </sentence><sentence id="647">The majority of people. </sentence><sentence id="648">Now I can't say that everybody was, but the majority of people did not like the Jews 10:41: and they didn't want to have anything to do with the Jews, but we were kids, young people. </sentence><sentence id="649">And we didn't feel...as a matter of fact I was going out with somebody that was non- Jewish. </sentence><sentence id="650">He wrote poetry to me that I still remember by heart in Hungarian.(in Hungarian) . </sentence><sentence id="651">What it says that you are a prisoner. </sentence><sentence id="652">He wrote it for me, that you are a prisoner in your dream, but don't dream so much because when you wake up, you have to face reality. </sentence><sentence id="653">Yeah. </sentence><sentence id="654">So it it was, you know, you went to a movie. </sentence><sentence id="655">You ate. </sentence><sentence id="656">You clothed.(dressed?) </sentence><sentence id="657">01:42 You did the usual things that when we went to the synagogue to meet other Jewish young people, that's what we did. </sentence><sentence id="658">This went on till 1944. </sentence><sentence id="659">October of 1944 there was a coup against Hitler. </sentence><sentence id="660">It was a happy day at the time. </sentence><sentence id="661">I'm sorry to say nothing happened to it. </sentence><sentence id="662">After that though we had to start wearing Jewish stars and we moved away from the place where we had a bed only. </sentence><sentence id="663">At this time we already had some money from working, many hours of very hard work, but we worked and we had some money. </sentence><sentence id="664">I lived for about two years on bread and jelly. </sentence><sentence id="665">It was OK. </sentence><sentence id="666">I didn't mind it. </sentence><sentence id="667">We moved away to a better place we lived. </sentence><sentence id="668">I lived as a matter of fact in a what is called Okatsvo ? </sentence><sentence id="669">Utca. ( </sentence><sentence id="670">It's a...well, later it became the ghetto for the...I don't know whether for the towns the numbers it became.???) </sentence><sentence id="671">That's how it went on till 1944. </sentence><sentence id="672">My sister lived someplace else from me and the real serious trouble with ghettos and everything started in Hungary. </sentence><sentence id="673">You couldn't go to work anymore. </sentence><sentence id="674">You had to wear your stars. </sentence><sentence id="675">You couldn't go any place. </sentence><sentence id="676">After a certain hour you had to be back in the ghetto. </sentence><sentence id="677">You you couldn't go out of the ghetto and it was very, very, very hard because nobody was prepared for that. </sentence><sentence id="678">You had to get out of your own apartments and move in the ghetto part. </sentence><sentence id="679">In late 1944... think in the middle of the summer of 1944 all the Jews had to go toa raceway in Budapest. </sentence><sentence id="680">I don't know if you ever heard about that gathering of the Jews on the raceway in Budapest. </sentence><sentence id="681">And from there... </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="724">Q: Tell us about it. </sentence><sentence id="725">Excuse me...tell me what happened at the gathering. </sentence><sentence id="726">What was it like? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="730">A: In the raceway...it was just people. </sentence><sentence id="731">Just more and more people coming into the raceway because they were gathering all the Jews from there. </sentence><sentence id="732">I haven't got a clear picture of it. </sentence><sentence id="733">I just know that we were put in certain transports, groups of people, and they started marching us towards the border to Germany, which naturally we don't...at this time I didn't even know that we're not bordering Germany...we approach Austria, and we marched in groups, but it seems to me that there were a lot of young people, because I remember I had experience from 1941 that I tried to gather young people and we sing  songs, most Hungarian, because Hungarian Jews didn't know any other language. </sentence><sentence id="734">I was lucky. </sentence><sentence id="735">I knew other languages, but Hungarian Jews knew only Hungarian. </sentence><sentence id="736">That's it. </sentence><sentence id="737">And we Started singing songs. </sentence><sentence id="738">It somehow kept the spirits going. </sentence><sentence id="739">I didn't think of it consciously at the time, but that's what was happening. </sentence><sentence id="740">And we walked and walked, but one good thing...in Hungary the villagers and the people, they're not as bad and as cruel as in Galicia. </sentence><sentence id="741">In Hungary we sometimes, we were cute little girls, you know, go to a fence and they will give us a bread or something to eat. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="742"> It was very bad. </sentence><sentence id="743">It was for them too very bad. </sentence><sentence id="744">It was towards the end of the war. </sentence><sentence id="745">There wasn't much left there either. </sentence><sentence id="746">But they once in a while did reach out and gave us some food and we came to a place called close to or ...1 can't even pronounce it. </sentence><sentence id="747">I have it marked out on the Hungarian map. </sentence><sentence id="748">There were boats on the Danube and they...we settled in on those boats on the Danube because they said that's where we have to wait for transportation to go to Germany. </sentence><sentence id="749">Dysentery broke out. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="750">Diarrhea and stomach upset for the people. </sentence><sentence id="751">It was very bad. </sentence><sentence id="752">Again, no hygiene. </sentence><sentence id="753">And I don't know how we survived and how we were on those boats. </sentence><sentence id="754">We were there about two, three weeks and there I heard that there was ..I don't think it was an order or a request...that children under thirteen should be returned to Budapest, and by that time I was about close to sixteen, seventeen, and I said to my friend Francesca, who was with me at the time...now and again my sister lived in Budapest but she had Christian papers in her own name made. </sentence><sentence id="755">I don't know to whom or who did it. </sentence><sentence id="756">It could have been Wallenberg or not, I don't know. </sentence><sentence id="757">She had in her own name, Eva Joszef, Christian papers, and she lived out of the ghetto. </sentence><sentence id="758">She didn't go to the raceway. </sentence><sentence id="759">She stayed out. </sentence><sentence id="760">In between I tried to study in one of the basements Catholic religion. </sentence><sentence id="761">They said that if you became Catholic, they will keep you alive. </sentence><sentence id="762">They will not take you away, so I studied the Catholic religion and then I found out it wasn't true. </sentence><sentence id="763">I did not take on another religion. </sentence><sentence id="764">I stayed Jewish. </sentence><sentence id="765">So my sister was in Budapest someplace. </sentence><sentence id="766">I don't know where she was...safe supposedly with Christian papers. </sentence><sentence id="767">I was with Francesca, my girlfriend, Francesca Nemeth, and I said let's go back. </sentence><sentence id="768">I don't want to go to Germany. </sentence><sentence id="769">I know what they do to people there, and she didn't want. </sentence><sentence id="770">She was afraid and I begged her and kind of coerced her. </sentence><sentence id="771">I said you carry on, put your hair in braids and uh let's try and let's try and we we succeeded. </sentence><sentence id="772">We walked back to Budapest. </sentence><sentence id="773">I called Francesca. </sentence><sentence id="774">She lives in Ohio, Cleveland, Ohio. </sentence><sentence id="775">I wondered if she remembers names or something. </sentence><sentence id="776">She does not remember anything, but she was just thanking me for keeping her alive, because she says that if not you, I wouldn't have been alive today. </sentence><sentence id="777">But at the time I just felt that this is our way of surviving, to go back to Budapest. </sentence><sentence id="778">We walked again back to Budapest. </sentence><sentence id="779">I don't know how many kilometers, how we did it. </sentence><sentence id="780">We were a small transport of children and we walked but while we were still on ship, on boats, we got some of the Hungarian village people to gave us geese. </sentence><sentence id="781">We cooked the geese and we gave the soup for the dysentery sick people, the soup, and we handed out meats for the children to eat, for the young children to eat. </sentence><sentence id="782">I remember I was very involved in that and many people  ...I don't know where they went from there, but some died. </sentence><sentence id="783">Some got better. </sentence><sentence id="784">I don't know if it was from the soup or not, but that's the way it was. </sentence><sentence id="785">We went back to Budapest and we went into the ghetto, into a Red Cross. </sentence><sentence id="786">I don't know if it was a Swedish or a Swiss Red Cross. </sentence><sentence id="787">I don't know. </sentence><sentence id="788">Supposedly a safe building in Budapest, on Okativo ? </sentence><sentence id="789">Utca. </sentence><sentence id="790">It was the same street I lived, but further down. </sentence><sentence id="791">We were there...it was across the street from an electric I think public electrics or something like that and they had anti-aircraft guns on the same street right across from the building that we were in. </sentence><sentence id="792">Budapest was at that time being bombed from the Russians. </sentence><sentence id="793">Constant bombing. </sentence><sentence id="794">Terrible bombing. </sentence><sentence id="795">All that time we were in that house. </sentence><sentence id="796">I was on the fourth floor with helping mentally disturbed people in the ghetto, as a result from the war. </sentence><sentence id="797">They were all lying on floors. </sentence><sentence id="798">No medication. </sentence><sentence id="799">No food. </sentence><sentence id="800">No hygiene. </sentence><sentence id="801">Some I remember they bring in people who got hurt from the bombs, you know, from shrapnel, they brought them in. </sentence><sentence id="802">It was terrible conditions. </sentence><sentence id="803">Some of them lay there for weeks. </sentence><sentence id="804">The the meat was rotting away from their bodies. </sentence><sentence id="805">The smell...it was horrific. </sentence><sentence id="806">The dead people were taken out to the streets. </sentence><sentence id="807">It was winter. </sentence><sentence id="808">They were piled like wood logs piled, cross-wise. </sentence><sentence id="809">One on top of the other, the dead people, and I know only about the Jews because that's where we were. </sentence><sentence id="810">We were in the ghetto, but I know it was not very good in the rest of Budapest either, but we were there. </sentence><sentence id="811">To that to the bombing and everything else, the Nilosz (ph) which was like the SS in Germany, came in many times to safe houses or basements to people and started killing and letting their angers and fear go to the Jewish people. </sentence><sentence id="812">We being Red Cross used to go out and help save whoever we could save at the time. </sentence><sentence id="813">We walked even while they were bombing. </sentence><sentence id="814">We walked in the streets and go into buildings and see if we can help as much as we could with just get living out from under the dead or whatever we can do. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="815">I was sick. </sentence><sentence id="816">I had a bladder infection. </sentence><sentence id="817">We had no sulfa or anything like that. </sentence><sentence id="818">I remember somebody handed me a little...an old sock with sand. </sentence><sentence id="819">They said heat it someplace and put it and try to make yourself comfortable. </sentence><sentence id="820">I survived it. </sentence><sentence id="821">I don't know how and when I'm OK, but this is...I'm bring it up only as to show you what it was like in Budapest until of January of 1945. </sentence><sentence id="822">I never went down in the basement with the bombings. </sentence><sentence id="823">I was at the stage where I didn't care if something gets me, if I stay alive or not. </sentence><sentence id="824">At that stage I didn't care, and one morning I looked down from the fourth floor and there was the Russian army, and being that I speak other languages, some Czech, some Yiddish...there was a Jewish officer in the Russian army. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="825"> He came from Lvow and he said you're free. </sentence><sentence id="826">I said what! </sentence><sentence id="827">He said you're free. </sentence><sentence id="828">And he came out with breads, loaves of breads. </sentence><sentence id="829">There were very few people left alive, but whoever was we all went down in the yard where he was with the bread. </sentence><sentence id="830">That's how that's how we freed, and that was in January of 1945 in Budapest. </sentence><sentence id="831">Do you want me to go on anyplace. </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="832">Q:

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="842">A: OK. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="844">Q: I'd like to go back to the safe house, and would you...would you tell me more, as much as you can remember about the people in there? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="846">A: It's very unclear about the people. </sentence><sentence id="847">I do not...1 cannot pinpoint an organization, if there was one. </sentence><sentence id="848">I just know that the house had a sign, a Red Cross sign out. </sentence><sentence id="849">I know it was a foreign Red Cross, Swede or Swiss Red Cross. </sentence><sentence id="850">It keeps in mind more Swiss than Swedish Red Cross. </sentence><sentence id="851">I don't know. </sentence><sentence id="852">The people whenever they picked up people in the ghetto streets that had no place to go and we brought them in, not that there was place but we just put them down next to somebody else. </sentence><sentence id="853">After bombing, people were injured. </sentence><sentence id="854">If they were injured we brought them in. </sentence><sentence id="855">If the horses were killed, we used the meat. </sentence><sentence id="856">That's what kept us going. </sentence><sentence id="857">It was winter, so even the horse laid in the streets for many days, we used it, kind of gave us some food. </sentence><sentence id="858">I don't remember people themselves, if there was anybody to instruct us. </sentence><sentence id="859">I know that there was some sick people that turned to me. </sentence><sentence id="860">I was working. </sentence><sentence id="861">I was healthier. </sentence><sentence id="862">I was around. </sentence><sentence id="863">My friend Francesca was there on a different floor, and we tried to do best we could. </sentence><sentence id="864">There was nothing to work with or help with. </sentence><sentence id="865">I remember one young man. </sentence><sentence id="866">He had internal injuries. </sentence><sentence id="867">There was one doctor there. </sentence><sentence id="868">I can't remember his name. </sentence><sentence id="869">But he said he has internal injuries. </sentence><sentence id="870">He will go. </sentence><sentence id="871">But he was young. </sentence><sentence id="872">He was twenty...I don't know...to me he looked young at the time, and I remember holding him and he says, just stay. </sentence><sentence id="873">Just stay. </sentence><sentence id="874">Just stay with me. </sentence><sentence id="875">I tried as long as I could. </sentence><sentence id="876">When the sirens went on, the majority of people that could move went down in the basement to protect themselves from the bombing. </sentence><sentence id="877">I never went down to the basement. </sentence><sentence id="878">I picked...I didn't care if I live or die at that time. </sentence><sentence id="879">We were at the state of non-caring and that is the worst human state that you can imagine. </sentence><sentence id="880">Nobody should go to that state, but we were. </sentence><sentence id="881">I can't clearly bring up people to remember them or or names or anything like that. </sentence><sentence id="882">01:03: I haven't got them. </sentence><sentence id="883">I just know that one day in 1945 we looked down in the yard and there were the Russians. </sentence><sentence id="884">And we couldn't care less who it was. </sentence><sentence id="885">They brought us bread and water. </sentence><sentence id="886">We had no water. </sentence><sentence id="887">No heat. </sentence><sentence id="888">No hygiene. </sentence><sentence id="889">Nothing. </sentence><sentence id="890">For weeks on and weeks on we had nothing. </sentence><sentence id="891">I don't know how it was in the rest of Budapest, but in the ghetto it was inhuman. </sentence><sentence id="892">Inhuman state of...I don't even remember how we dispersed from that safe home very fast because we were afraid that the Hungarians will come back or the Germans will come in. </sentence><sentence id="893">So we ran from Budapest. </sentence><sentence id="894">I ran from Budapest, but I wanted to  find my sister. </sentence><sentence id="895">She was in Budapest but not in the ghetto and I was going from street to street at the time the Russians freedom, it was kind of open. </sentence><sentence id="896">It was snow all around and I was walking towards where we used to live before and I see a black coat with a white fur cap and I started screaming Eva, Eva. </sentence><sentence id="897">It was my sister. </sentence><sentence id="898">That's how I found my sister in Budapest, right after we were freed by the Russians. </sentence><sentence id="899">It looked that she was searching for me and I was searching for her, and we walked 01:05 somehow going towards the same direction, and with all those people and all the war and everything, somehow we kind of ran into each other and I can't tell you that feeling to be able to see my sister and her black coat that I remembered with the white fur around her head and find my sister there. </sentence><sentence id="900">We started back. </sentence><sentence id="901">We were...today they call it hitchhiking I think. </sentence><sentence id="902">Whatever transportation we could find...we wanted to get out of Budapest the worst, the worst way because we were afraid that the Nazis might come back in any way. </sentence><sentence id="903">I remember we were on trains. </sentence><sentence id="904">There was no organized trains or anything. </sentence><sentence id="905">Whatever came along and went someplace, we hopped on and we went. </sentence><sentence id="906">We also had to kind of at that time worry a little bit about the Russians not grabbing young girls. </sentence><sentence id="907">They grabbed other people. </sentence><sentence id="908">I know they grabbed many watches and an army, as an army and any army that comes in first, you're better off not to encounter with them, but somehow we made it to Debrecen, and stayed for a few weeks with a Jewish family in Debrecen. </sentence><sentence id="909">And then we went on further and I went, I went towards home. </sentence><sentence id="910">I don't know where my sister went, but she wound up in Bucharest. </sentence><sentence id="911">We young girls we were not very close. </sentence><sentence id="912">Sibling rivalry. </sentence><sentence id="913">We're very close in age...fifteen months apart. </sentence><sentence id="914">She's younger...fifteen months. </sentence><sentence id="915">We went our different ways, but she went to Bucharest. </sentence><sentence id="916">I went home and as I said before that I think I mentioned it to you privately that uh when I saw the house...it might have been a lot of things together... found __ high temperature. </sentence><sentence id="917">The house was ripped...the windows were ripped out of the house. </sentence><sentence id="918">The doors were gone. </sentence><sentence id="919">The roof was gone. </sentence><sentence id="920">Papers thrown everyplace. </sentence><sentence id="921">Nothing...I collapsed and they took me into Sziget to a hospital and they took my tonsils out or whatever they did for me, and when I got better I went to Bucharest to see my sister. </sentence><sentence id="922">We traveled all over and when I came back...then I went back to Budapest. </sentence><sentence id="923">Another thing...in every terrible thing there is something that happens that can give you hope in life. </sentence><sentence id="924">I heard that my mother was in Budapest and when we came to Budapest, you know, if you went you...in certain centers they gave you disinfection, DDT, and shower treatments for the people that came out from ghettos and camps and...and they also gave you some money. </sentence><sentence id="925">The Americans at that time were there. </sentence><sentence id="926">They gave you some money to help you over...peanut butter and some food and things like that and we kids went in for that to help us travel around. </sentence><sentence id="927">And I went into one of the schools where they did it, and in the foyer I hear Sharika, Sharika. </sentence><sentence id="928">My mother was in that school. </sentence><sentence id="929">She came from Bergen- Belsen and she came into Budapest and she was there in transfer in a school, in Elizabeth School it was called. </sentence><sentence id="930">Ersebet School. </sentence><sentence id="931">And I ran into her like that in that school. </sentence><sentence id="932">We just couldn't believe that that what we ran into. </sentence><sentence id="933">As I say, there is always some kind of hope that gives you a will to go on. </sentence><sentence id="934">I found my mother. </sentence><sentence id="935">She wasn't the same person anymore but I found my mother. </sentence><sentence id="936">My mother lost her will to live. </sentence><sentence id="937">However, we were together for a  while and we went to...we had an uncle in Galanta and we went there. </sentence><sentence id="938">Later on uh my mother married that uncle. </sentence><sentence id="939">It was...let me see...my father's sister's husband who never came back and my father never came back. </sentence><sentence id="940">That was a year or two later after the war and they married and they went to Israel, but they went to Germany camps to wait, waiting camps until they were transferred to Israel. </sentence><sentence id="941">01:10 I joined in Budapest the Zionist organization and we traveled around to Vienna and for a while I worked in Vienna in the hospital. </sentence><sentence id="942">The transient people from camps and I worked in the lab. </sentence><sentence id="943">They called it a clinic where the doctors examined and I was kind of an assistant in there for a few weeks. </sentence><sentence id="944">Then I went back to Budapest with the Zionist organization. </sentence><sentence id="945">Dror Habonim was the name of the organization, and for a while I still helped out with the Brichah to transfer people over the borders. </sentence><sentence id="946">They were in transferring the people to Slovakia and then transferring them back to towards Vienna where there was a transient camp and then toward Italy and then from Italy the boats, whatever boats can
