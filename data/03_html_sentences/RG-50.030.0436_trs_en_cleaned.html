<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="169">A: People went to school and Jewish businesses were taken away, all businesses were taken away but the difference was that the Christians who had businesses could, under the pack that Hitler and Stalin had, could say that they are false Germans, which means that their ancestors were of German background and therefore they were not arrested. </sentence><sentence id="170">They had the right to be resettled into Germany and while the Soviets took away their houses in Sattagura(ph) or in one of those towns, when they were resettled, they got an, an equivalent house or apartment in Germany. </sentence><sentence id="171">And I even know about one man who was taken the same night as my father, who was a Christian and who was a merchant, a businessman. </sentence><sentence id="172">He, he dealt with, he sold ham and, and kielbasa and had pigs and made them, made, made these foods at home and then sold them. </sentence><sentence id="173">Well he was regarded a Capitalist. </sentence><sentence id="174">He was taken the same night, but he said that he was a false Deutschner(ph), he was not, he was actually a half Polish, half-Ukrainian Christian. </sentence><sentence id="175">Well he was taken out of the prison and sent to Germany. </sentence><sentence id="176">And he escaped, my father didn't. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1942">A: Yes. </sentence><sentence id="1943">We didn't call it a concentration camp, but it was a concentration camp. </sentence><sentence id="1944">Only the fact that Sam was used in a certain profession and I was used as his assistant and that we were taken every morning and brought back every evening, maybe it made it a little easier, you know, but it also This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="1945">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="1946"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection 5 made it a little more dangerous, because every time Sam would have made a mistake on one of the soldiers or officers, that would have been the end of him. </sentence><sentence id="1947">So, so he was in very big danger and I call that a concentration camp, even though it was called a ghetto. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1954">Q: That's, I guess that was maybe what was confusing me. </sentence><sentence id="1955">I want to ask you to talk about one other thing which I know is not easy, but it's very, very telling. </sentence><sentence id="1956">And that is, you know, we talked earlier about how as people get older, a lot of these memories flood back and I know your husband hasn't been well lately. </sentence><sentence id="1957">Can you talk about that a little? </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1972">Q: But can you describe how when his mind is not clearly grounded in the present, what happens? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1974">A: He talks about, as though he were back in the concentration camp and he gets, he could be in, among 20 people, like in that senior care center and he'll take off his shirt and start scratching and the doctor asked him, "Sam don't do it." </sentence><sentence id="1975">And he'll say, "I have to do it, I have all these lice." </sentence><sentence id="1976">And the doctor said, "You don't' have any lice." </sentence><sentence id="1977">And he says, "Yes I do, yes I do and we always have them in the camp." </sentence><sentence id="1978">So I know that he's there and this doctor tells me that there's no use that I should try to convince him that he's not there because he believes so in it. </sentence><sentence id="1979">And this has happened a number of times. </sentence></p></dialogue>
