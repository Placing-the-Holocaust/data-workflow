<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="6">Q: OK. </sentence><sentence id="7">Norbert, where we left off, we were talking about Auschwitz and you had been describing its . </sentence><sentence id="8">There were some stories about Auschwitz that you had wanted to share with me in particular. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="12">A: Yeah. </sentence><sentence id="13">I think in in connection with the with the daily question we were confronted with...how do we survive, because once a asked me I should tell him something about the art of survival, and the answer is their is no art, so I will...in Auschwitz it was an accident, or a chance. </sentence><sentence id="14">Uh certainly you had to have the the will to survive and I must say after the first couple of weeks or months, where very often I was confronted with the question, will I be able to make it, or should I rather uh uh uh put an end to my life in order to be liberated from the misery, but then after one year or so when I got the better job and could work as a welder, and also was able to uh to uh get some additional food here and there for certain activities, for instance, when I was was uh appointed a bed-maker and and also when I was appointed to be the secretary of the block in order to keep the records, that gave me a chance uh then to to uh somehow keep myself cleaner and and uh also to...my my I would say was was strengthened by by by that... </sentence></p></dialogue>

id="23">A: Well, uh because I II helped out to a certain extent to uh to uh to uh...for instance, when there was...when food was distributed, you know, there was a certain order had to had to be established. </sentence><sentence id="24">I was able with my school French, for instance, to speak to the Greek prisoners, people from Greek who spoke only Greek and French. </sentence><sentence id="25">That was...or or or Latino (ph). </sentence><sentence id="26">Latino certainly I didn't know, but my French was good enough to communicate with them, or also with the people from other countries in order so that that uh ___I_ was trying to help and then obviously the secretary uh uh who was doing the work before left, so I was asked to do it and and I accepted it gladly because uh I didn't become an officer of the of the barrack, but at least it gave me a certain chance to to to improve, which was...improve, you know, and and and and uh whatever improve means, you know...conditions somehow. </sentence><sentence id="27">Uh so therefore as I say, the the the uh the chance to to survive, the chance that, call it that on the morning you didn't know if the evening would be yours or in the evening when you went to bed, not to be sure that the next morning you were still alive...somehow turned more into the positive angle. </sentence><sentence id="28">You wanted to survive. </sentence><sentence id="29">You wanted uh to to to survive and and reach a normal world again, at least that was my feeling to, as formulated it once, to tell the tale, to tell the world this is...and and and beware of it that it should never happen again, and there were many, many facets of that. </sentence><sentence id="30">I think I told you last time, for instance, about the role the British prisoners of war played to help to strengthen our morale uh and when they came, they gave us courage. </sentence><sentence id="31">Uh uh I had...I think this we covered already...I had the good fortune to begin...to become their friends, so they shared the news with me which they got illegally with their receiver, so we knew that certainly the war for Germany was lost and especially after the second front had been established in France, that it was only a matter of time, and the question only was, would we be able to hold out that long and certainly we knew that the Germans This

http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection uh were were loosing at the eastern front and every day was another step uh uh uh and one day hopefully the eastern front would would reach us, because we were in the eastern part of...located in the eastern part of Europe. </sentence><sentence id="34">Uh the...that was one of the things in which the British were so helpful, and also to provide food and and support directly uh and I was also the beneficiary of many of their good deeds and I'll never forget about it. </sentence><sentence id="35">One of the things which interesting was that one day a fellow who came...he was from India because his father was a sheriff in India in the British administration. </sentence><sentence id="36">He had never seen England and when we talked, I could tell him a little bit about my experience in London and so we exchanged views and so we became friends. </sentence><sentence id="37">And he told me then one day...and then as...since our life was such a peculiar kind of life, without papers, without books, without...with hungry for for for some spiritual food also. </sentence><sentence id="38">Uh he told me somehow that he has gotten something from I don't which...an organization in Boston, and I asked him, do you have contact with Boston. </sentence><sentence id="39">He said sure, through my military mail I have. </sentence><sentence id="40">He said I have an idea. </sentence><sentence id="41">Could you eventually try to establish contact for me with my friend...with friends I have in America, in the United States. </sentence><sentence id="42">The address I knew by heart...you know, we had no address book anymore, but my memory, thank God, was good enough. </sentence><sentence id="43">He said sure I will, so I formulated for him a letter in which he said I met Norbert here. </sentence><sentence id="44">He is alright. </sentence><sentence id="45">He is fine. </sentence><sentence id="46">He doesn't know anything. </sentence><sentence id="47">He doesn't know where his family is right now. </sentence><sentence id="48">I mean we had to be very careful and he hopes one day to be able to see you again, so this letter he sent out, and it reached my friends, probably after months or so and uh in the closing days of Auschwitz...I think it was already in December when when most of the industrial area was was badly, badly smashed and destroyed...he was...all of a sudden came running and he said I have good news for you. </sentence><sentence id="49">I said what was it, another uh big uh big uh victory on the on the western or eastern front. </sentence><sentence id="50">He said no, but believe it or not I got a letter back from your friends. </sentence><sentence id="51">Now this was something which Auschwitz hadn't seen before, and I couldn't believe it so I was so This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="52">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="53"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection excited I I ran to the toilet house in in the area where we were working. </sentence><sentence id="54">Uh the man who was in charge of that was also an inmate and I said, listen, close all the doors and I give you...I don't know how much I have or not have...I have to read this letter. </sentence><sentence id="55">And I read from my friends who obviously did not quite understand what was going on. </sentence><sentence id="56">How could they? </sentence><sentence id="57">Uh said well, I'm glad to hear about Norbert. </sentence><sentence id="58">Just assure him when you see him again that we are the same friends we were, because we were friends from the youth movement, that when the war is over, he should come and be with us and and and and and uh uh he uh he should be of good..good courage and so on. </sentence><sentence id="59">So when I told this my very close friends, nobody could believe it, so I had the fortitude to bring this letter and to smuggle this letter with me into the camp, which was terribly dangerous certainly, but I wanted to show them also to give them some kind of courage. </sentence><sentence id="60">There is still...you see, can see even from Auschwitz, from behind the barbed wire, there is a connection you can establish with people in America, and uh then I came to this count...to America in "46 on a visit. </sentence><sentence id="61">Uh I saw my friends in Decateur (ph), Michigan. </sentence><sentence id="62">They had a farm there and uh uh I asked for that letter because I wanted to to make it part of my museum, and they said uh no, they will never give it away, because...but what they...at this time when they got the letter, they were completely puzzled. </sentence><sentence id="63">They said, for goodness sake how can he be...they didn't certainly know which location it was because it was a military number under which it was sent...how could it be he is a British prisoner of war. </sentence><sentence id="64">What happened to him, so they were completely flabbergasted until I explained it to him, to them and they they they got aware uh that actually that this was something in which a British prisoner of war became call it the conduit for a message to America, and I must say this gave me a tremendous lift up and and and and and uh I told some of my friends. </sentence><sentence id="65">Uh he could hardly believe it, but this is what you could do with the British because there was this solidarity of man. </sentence><sentence id="66">They understood you. </sentence><sentence id="67">And they didn't accept any kind of anti-Semitism or racism amongst them, because for them the Nazis This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence

information about this collection were not only enemies on a military uh basis but also certainly on a political and moral basis I would say. </sentence><sentence id="70">That was one of the things uh I certainly have never forgotten. </sentence><sentence id="71">There was also...I want to emphasize, there were other ways of spiritual resistance, to uh to uh nourish us spiritually. </sentence><sentence id="72">I think I talked about the service. </sentence><sentence id="73">But uh a typical example uh how how how spi...spiritual resistance can work is this example which I've cited very often. </sentence><sentence id="74">I met in Auschwitz uh very early at my arrival, an elderly man. </sentence><sentence id="75">He originated from somewhere in Galatia (ph), had served during World War I in the Austrian army, and uh after the war, after World War I, he had made his way to Berlin, had established some existence as a cobbler, had married, uh had a nice family, and with a so-called Polish ar...with a Polish accent, in September 1939 and he had been taken a prisoner and and and was shifted from Buchenwald to Saxonhausen, from Saxonhausen to Auschwitz, and so so he had, when I met him, already he had spent quite some years behind the barbed wire. </sentence><sentence id="76">He was a won...a simple man, uh a pious man, very religious in spite of everything, in spite of everything, and he said his his prayers every day and he always when when things were were difficult, he gave us certain quotations from whatever he had to to say well, uh they cannot succeed. </sentence><sentence id="77">Uh we were stronger in spirit than they. </sentence><sentence id="78">One day...it was uh uh in fall I think of "44...whenever it was, the weather was terrible. </sentence><sentence id="79">There was...it was a rainy day and the winds come blowing down from the Mountains and we were standing for a roll call uh and it lasted and lasted because something was...went wrong, had gone wrong with the figures, and the the people there were not too good with figures, but if it didn't tie in properly they...you, you couldn't couldn't be released so we were standing there and and and it was...really, it was horror. </sentence><sentence id="80">People fainted and and and couldn't take it but nevertheless uh it went on so uh the the the moments in your life and I would seconds are minutes and minutes are hours and hours are years, and I was standing in my formation, you know, at fives, next to this friend and I noticed that he was praying and asked him, I said __, what are This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="81">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="82"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection you doing. </sentence><sentence id="83">He said as you can see I'm praying. </sentence><sentence id="84">I said but I'm certain you said your morning prayers and for the (cough) evening prayers, I said it's too early, so uh what are you praying for. </sentence><sentence id="85">He said, well, I'm not praying not the morning prayers, not the afternoon, not the evening prayers. </sentence><sentence id="86">I'll sing a special prayer to God. </sentence><sentence id="87">I said what are your praying for. </sentence><sentence id="88">He said I'm thanking God, and I always was bewildered. </sentence><sentence id="89">I said __, thanking for what, for that misery we are in, for the for the terrible situation, for being forsaken here by God. </sentence><sentence id="90">He said you don't understand. </sentence><sentence id="91">I am thanking for God, God for one thing...that he didn't make me like them, the murderers around me. </sentence><sentence id="92">Uh and interesting enough, a couple of months later uh we had to undergo one of these infamous uh selections. </sentence><sentence id="93">That means when there were too many people especially in the uh in the in the hospital, uh then the ____ and the SS came to the conclusion that they should uh uh...that those who cannot or were were too long in the hospital just should be exterminated, because they they were not worth uh uh to be fed anymore and and they had become, in their opinion, a nuisance. </sentence><sentence id="94">So uh this friend of mine certainly was an elderly man and had grey hair, hair...you can about grayish...and we were afraid that uh the selection would have would would would uh be his end, so two or three friends...I was already a schriber (ph), a secretary...uh came to the conclusion something has to be done. </sentence><sentence id="95">Now in connection with that selection I also, since I was the secretary I changed the dates, the birth dates, because there was not...we didn't have any ink, just pencils, so pencil you can erase easily so I changed some of the dates, especially of elderly people, hopefully to to save them, so and the selections happened in this way that you have to line up in a...and and people have to pass an SS man and he would then say, like like Mengele...left, right, left, right. </sentence><sentence id="96">In other words, to die or to live, to continue to live. </sentence><sentence id="97">And in order to save this man from this from this experience, we came to the conclusion that there was only one way out...that means to hide him in these straw sacks which were also called mattresses, even if there was a danger that he would suffocate but at least it was This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="98">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="99"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection seen the only way to do it, and he was an an old uh camp man and he knew all the tricks and so he said yes, I I'm willing to undergo this risk, so that's what we did. </sentence><sentence id="100">We put him into the the mattress, covered him with straw and when the selection went on, somebody else went from for him and uh uh when they also checked the the the barracks, didn't find him in the in the in the mattress, so he luckily survived and he survived also the the end of the war and just two or three years ago he uh he uh died in New York at the blessed age of ninety-two. </sentence><sentence id="101">There's another interesting uh uh facet of this which uh has also uh described in his book, --__.~;Uh it was I think already I think in the fall of 1944. </sentence><sentence id="102">We all had the feeling it's a matter of time because we were aware of the events, the the military events and uh the the second front had been established and the the Allied troops were already deep in France, so three of our uh uh our comrades who were old-timers, who were already there for years, had come to the conclusion that since you never know what would they let us...would they let us live to see the day of liberation or not, had uh decided they want to try to escape, which was not an easy task because uh first of all so many barbed wires around the camp but also uh you can never...could never be sure of the population uh around Auschwitz, whether they wanted to cooperate with the Germans or not, but they said we'll risk our lives. </sentence><sentence id="103">We never know what what the end will be, and obviously uh in the middle of their preparations, uh somebody had discovered that. </sentence><sentence id="104">Up to now we don't know exactly who it was, and uh uh certainly the uh the uh the uh the uh punishment and the penalty for that was death. </sentence><sentence id="105">Now the SS gangsters in Auschwitz as in any other concentration camp, made a cruel spectacle out of that because they executed people by hanging in public, and we all had to stand there and watch and at the end we had to to uh march by and and and see that that this was uh the..that was the penalty meted out for anybody who would dare to escape, so one...and we didn't know for many many weeks, we didn't know what would the destiny be, because many attempts were made to to save them, but uh uh uh Berlin...1 mean the This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="106">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="107"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection death sentence was usually confirmed by by ___, by the by the Gestapo, by the uh uh by Himmler's (ph) office in in Berlin, and then one day when we mar...came back from work, we saw the gallows uh uh erected at the square where we had our our our roll call, and we knew that uh that uh...we didn't know exactly what we saw...three gallows awaiting there, and then we got aware that these were these three friends who uh who uh obviously uh uh the order was...who who could not be saved and uh we all had to stand there at attention and the atmosphere was terribly tense because most of us knew them, appreciated them, loved them, knew about their courage and their dedication for fellow, for fellow inmates, so we were absolutely down and depressed, and then the spectacle began. </sentence><sentence id="108">They were led to the gallows and then one of the SS gangsters read the so-called death sentence, which was confirmed by Berlin that because of their attempt to flee they have been...the Reichsfuhrer (ph) Himmler has decided that they should be put to death, and when they were under the gallows and the ropes already around them, one of the three...by the way uh uh one of them is the brother of our friend Freddie who is very active in our affairs in in California. </sentence><sentence id="109">One of them all of a sudden penetrated this deadly silence with a voice which could be heard all over the the place and he said it in German. </sentence><sentence id="110">I will translate it ina moment. </sentence><sentence id="111">He said to...or he he cried out uh , which means, comrades, keep your highs heads...keep your heads high. </sentence><sentence id="112">We will be the last, which means let uh...liberation is on the march, and certainly we will not live to see the day of liberation anymore but you will. </sentence><sentence id="113">And for a moment when this happened we thought that the SS uh standing on their towers, on the watch towers with machine guns and so on, the other guards uh armed to their teeth, would open a blood bath and so but this didn't happen, but you could see that they didn't feel good about it but it had a tremendous effect on all of us, and though it is now uh uh more than uh uh forty-five years after that, we are still speaking about it, still uh uh asking ourselves the question what gave them this strength, knowing that they would meet their maker in in This is a

hopefully the other world waiting beyond the the barbed wire. </sentence><sentence id="116">So uh uh you see, and this this is this is this is uh just amongst the many things we we know from that time, proof that uh phys...spiritual resistance had remained in spite of the fact, and I can say for myself also personally, to say that well, they tried to make us a number but they will never convert us into a number. </sentence><sentence id="117">So this this this was, as I say, it was already at a time when when when when uh the air, the political air was was so different. </sentence><sentence id="118">People still died uh daily. </sentence><sentence id="119">There was still enough victims unfortunately, but when it came uh to this time, uh uh uh there...it it...the whole, the whole atmosphere had changed when particularly when certainly was that you could feel slowly also the military effect of the advances of the of the advance of the Allies in the east and the west. </sentence><sentence id="120">In uh...I think it was in in August, early in August, we saw from from our places in the factory and the camp, we saw our first major attack by the American air force uh uh stationed at this time in Italy, coming from Italy. </sentence><sentence id="121">They had attained almost completely already supremacy in the air and they uh uh...I think it was early in August attacked arefineryin__I think is the name, and for days we saw the black smoke covering the whole area, so we we thought for ourselves, well one day they must come and and also try to hit this factory which did not produce yet but was very close to completion and sure enough, on on August 20th, 1944...it was a Sunday...the American air force uh to attack the --------suh_-uh combine...uh area in Auschwitz. </sentence><sentence id="122">Uh J at this time...at this day was working in the camp to to do some some uh uh paperwork, but I knew that many of my friends were outside in the factory and were certainly concerned. </sentence><sentence id="123">Uh it was an attack which lasted fifteen or twenty minutes and uh what they did, they they hit the the factory uh uh to such an extent that that uh it threw them back for years in our opinion, but also we lost on that day approximately eighty people of our own uh which we said well, this is the price we have to pay, or as the French would say, la guerre comme a la guerre This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="124">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or

id="126">Uh one bomb, interesting enough, also by mistake uh uh went down in our own camp, which is outside of the factory...which was outside of the factory. </sentence><sentence id="127">Didn't do any damage, but another bomb by mistake hit the British prisoners of war. </sentence><sentence id="128">They were sitting outside of some kind of a trench and uh uh forty of of those people were killed. </sentence><sentence id="129">They were playing gramophone (ph) music because they liked it so much to see the the the __ but then the bomb unfortunately hit, and amongst them was also a nice friend of mine, a man whom I befriended who who originated from London, but also the British said well, that's it. </sentence><sentence id="130">That's the price we have to pay. </sentence><sentence id="131">Uh this is when we...when we went into action in Africa. </sentence><sentence id="132">We knew that that something like this could happen so that was it. </sentence><sentence id="133">What we...what what uh we thought after this, after this experience was why don't they come also to to uh hit the railways leading to Auschwitz. </sentence><sentence id="134">We didn't know at this time that, for instance, Jewish leaders were storming the chancellories in London and in Washington uh uh to do something like that and certainly we we didn't know that there was a letter then written...I think under the signature of the then Assistant Secretary of the Army John McL___, saying that uh uh the uh governments have to concentrate on the completion of the war and also they are afraid and this is the the wording, that if something would be done in the interest of the prisoners, the Nazis could become more vindi...vindictive towards the prisoners. </sentence><sentence id="135">Well uh uh... </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="259">Q: How did you feel when day by day went by and they did not bomb the railroad lines? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="261">A: I couldn't understand that. </sentence><sentence id="262">I couldn't understand that. </sentence><sentence id="263">Uh as I say, this question came up more after the war when I asked the people what...we we...on the other hand, peculiar as it may sound, we were so glad to see them because we were...when the attack came, for instance, , the only protection we had was outside in trenches where you could see these hundreds This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="264">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="265"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection 1 and hundreds of fortresses, of flying fortresses, coming and and and and there was hardly any anti- craft fire from from the Germans. </sentence><sentence id="266">Certainly our people, many of our people were were crying and so and and praying, and my reaction was, I said be happy uh to see them because you might have relatives sitting in the cockpit, you know, and and doing this work in our interest, and certainly you had to reckon that you could be also amongst the targets, but this is...in war, you know, you you you unfortunately you don't know where it hits. </sentence><sentence id="267">Uh so after the first event in August, after that very effective attack, we were put to work immediately to try to uh undo the damage, because they wanted...they had a certain date... don't know which...to uh to uh uh not to start production but to uh to also to get into production somehow, and I think the day before the deadline, the the bombers came again with another attack and then uh the next uh day, the next target to to have the repair, the damage repaired was I think the day after Christmas, and sure enough on Christmas they came again, and they smashed the factory to smitherings and to such extent that nothing could be done anymore and there was...then the the morale I would say broke in this respect that they said there's nothing to be done anymore, so we were just trying to play around and play for time if possible. </sentence><sentence id="268">Also uh then realizing especially in December that the Russian front had become very close. </sentence><sentence id="269">We knew that__ had been taken and that that certainly that they came pretty close, the Russian army close to Krackow, and uh then uh uh in the course of the military events, in January when the uh Russians started their offensive across the __I think, and uh reached Krackow...Krackow was only, I think, sixty kilometers from Auschwitz in the east, then a day before that uh uh the order came not to wal...not to march out any more to the factory, and the question was what's going to happen, because certainly uh uh without knowing the uh the uh the uh thinking of the of these SS gangsters properly, what are they going to do with us, it was touch and go. </sentence><sentence id="270">Would they dynamite the camp and then blow us up or whatever it is...so we spent that day uh more or less in in tension. </sentence><sentence id="271">This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="272">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="273"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection 2 What I had done in case they they should drive us out, I had put on my my British underwear and my British boots I had kept available in so in case we we were we were driven out, and sure enough... </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="294">A: From my friends, from the British soldiers, you know. </sentence><sentence id="295">They had enough stuff and part of it...as I say I was one of their benefactors and they gave me what...not only certain things I hadn't seen for years like chocolate and once in a while cigarettes which I didn't smoke, but gave away, but they...when I told them that and we talked about...they had wonderful stuff, uh uh which they got from the International Red Cross, that certain underwear and also I had a pair of shoes I I could call it organize from them, and they were very generous and very gracious to me. </sentence><sentence id="296">I might owe the the British treasury something for that. </sentence><sentence id="297">I don't know, but uh anyhow that's what it what it was, and uh yes...on August 18th, uh somehow we heard that the the Russians had uh uh broken through the German lines, had uh entered Krackow. </sentence><sentence id="298">We saw on the on the road adjacent to our camp, we saw already all these trucks, the German military trucks and tanks and so passing by, but in the direction towards the west, so they were fleeing. </sentence><sentence id="299">And uh the question was will the Russians uh liberate us or what's going to happen, and then uh on August 18th, uh in the middle of the day, the order came that we had to

the remnants of the German army, also trying to make their way to the north, and refugees obviously coming from Berlin with all kinds of vehicles, fire trucks, hearses, milk trucks...whatever moved, they had used, and sometimes put together because they didn't have enough gasoline anymore, so they had tied...had tied these together, and we then said well, probably the safest is to mix with these

dawning slightly and uh somehow...I don't know whether in my...I couldn't sleep and you walk, but I was dozing somehow...all of a sudden sudden a friend next to me said to me, Norbert, isn't that the

crowns of the of the of the trees, and uh with the with the uh headlights of the jeep...it was showing that this is now American-occupied territory and this is where uh the American army had stopped, because what we didn't know was that uh the 8th Division of the American army had been lent to Montgomery to cut off the northern uh uh Germans from the southern Germans....from northern Germany from

</sentence><sentence id="589">Uh uh...just to repeat this...this flag was and is and remains for me the symbol of life. </sentence><sentence id="590">When I see, for instance, on the Day of

but it was a very loose, loose uh uh...from the front line, so we walked a few...a few hundred yards and all of a sudden we saw, uh on that road, an American officer, obviously, and when we approached him, he directed his pistol at us. </sentence><sentence id="591">After all, he didn't know who we were. </sentence><sentence id="592">And thank God my school English and the English which I had

</sentence><sentence id="595">Now you have to understand, those German soldiers who were reaching the line, had to leave all their packages, all their cars, everything...they were just driven to a big field nearby and then the soldiers are looking if there was ammunition or dynamite, whatever it is, and then they tell to the soldiers to assemble somewhere to take them into custody as prisoners of

information about this collection 1 and there was also something else which L...and it's the last I want to say about him. </sentence><sentence id="1514">In uh in writings, especially also in the book of ____ about the banality of evil, there were very unfair text against him, against Leo Beck, based on a story which I consider a historic lie. </sentence><sentence id="1515">In 1945 a man who had entered Germany with the American army and who wanted to make probably a quick buck, wrote stories of survivors uh under the title "We Have Survived." </sentence><sentence id="1516">And he published one story which he published in such a way as if it was the writing by Leo Beck, but anybody who was familiar with the writings of Leo Beck could see immediately that it was not his writing. </sentence><sentence id="1517">And he told of the story that Leo Beck had been advised in 1944 by somebody who had escaped Auschwitz successfully, who had come to Theresienstadt to advise him that in Auschwitz people are being gassed, and he kept it as a secret and did not make it known to the people around him. </sentence><sentence id="1518">I personally consider this as a I say, a historical lie. </sentence><sentence id="1519">First of all, the number of people who succ...Jewish people who successfully uh escaped Auschwitz, you can count on one or two hands of your of your of your two fingers of your hand, but number two that a man would have the folly to escape as a Jew successfully from Auschwitz, make his way into Theresienstadt, penetrate the the wires or the walls or whatever it is, to look up especially Leo Beck and tell him, listen, 1 want you to know they are gassing in Auschwitz. </sentence><sentence id="1520">It's so absurd. </sentence><sentence id="1521">I asked especially in the work I did for the...with the...after the ____, I went...I was...I met hundreds and thousands of fellow survivors, if that fellow heard about somebody who had come from from Auschwitz and gone to Theresienstadt. </sentence><sentence id="1522">They never heard about it because it's absurd. </sentence><sentence id="1523">It's abso...not only absurd. </sentence><sentence id="1524">I would say it's obscene, but picked it up and and and it is sticking in her book. </sentence><sentence id="1525">I think somebody else also were picking it up, but I consider it as...Leo Beck would not defend himself. </sentence><sentence id="1526">He would not say a word about it. </sentence><sentence id="1527">That was not his system. </sentence><sentence id="1528">Personal attacks he would ignore, because he knew who he was and he then...he knew that others would speak for him. </sentence><sentence id="1529">That's he agreed for _, but that he would say This is a verbatim

http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection 2 and I'll write an article and make a statement and so and he wouldn't do it. </sentence><sentence id="1532">And I say I I...he was he was he was absolutely he was he was a great man. </sentence><sentence id="1533">Unfortunately uh uh his...you know, because he lived at a time which was a terrible time, he could not live up to his full potential, you know, as a as a spiritual leader, but whatever...whatever he wrote after...it's interesting. </sentence><sentence id="1534">When we took I remember, people told me when he came to London, and for the first time they asked him to speak to the people and there was an overcrowded hall and they thought he would talk about something about Theresienstadt. </sentence><sentence id="1535">Not a word. </sentence><sentence id="1536">He talked about _, about Moses Mendelson (ph), about about whoever he wanted to, but not about Theresienstadt, because he doesn't...didn't want to be want to be to give even the appearance of a hero who is a survivor. </sentence><sentence id="1537">So may I say...may I close with with this remark...everybody is reacting to this chapter differently, and and and and I'm glad that I had the opportunity to to tell you. </sentence><sentence id="1538">Probably I could cover hours and hours more of that, but it's my belief that what what you are doing here and what the the Holocaust Museum is doing by putting the archives together together is of tremendous importance and of tremendous value, irrespective of the revisionists uh telling us Auschwitz was a hoax or like in that book of uh David Irvin (ph) with pages and pages just tried to prove that Hitler did...never knew about the Holocaust. </sentence><sentence id="1539">It was only...it was only Himmler and the others, or the attempts to say just uh Hitler and Himmler and are guilty, but all the others are...] never believed in collective guilt, and we never spoke about it, not even in Belsen after the war, but I also never believed in in collective innocence. </sentence><sentence id="1540">That means that we all have to try to learn a lesson. </sentence><sentence id="1541">The Holocaust happened, unfortunately. </sentence><sentence id="1542">What could come out is that the world and especially those who luckily were safe from it, have to speak out and have to to to to teach what can happen if human beings become become...or forget the concepts of morale, of ethics, and especially that...and I think this is one of the tasks of that museum and of that of that of that of your archives...to say to the world, look at what can happen. </sentence><sentence id="1543">Therefore This is a verbatim
