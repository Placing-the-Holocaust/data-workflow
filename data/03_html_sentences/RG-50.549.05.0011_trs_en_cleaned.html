<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3500">Q: So it wasn't so much a part of cultural life in Israel then to even talk about it, even though it's a society mostly composed of Jews? </sentence><sentence id="3501">People weren't, the children weren't being taught necessarily about what had happened in Europe with the Nazis" extermination of Jews? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3504">A: Well, I, I cannot agree with this what you ask for. </sentence><sentence id="3505">My culture life in Israel was very, very developed. </sentence><sentence id="3506">First of all in the professional way because I was very active in my profession and I studied a lot. </sentence><sentence id="3507">And except of which I went to concert and I went to theater, all Jewish theater, I mean Hebrew theater. </sentence><sentence id="3508">I understood and I could take it. </sentence><sentence id="3509">And then I had a very rich library in Hebrew language and I was reading in Hebrew and for me Hebrew became my, really to say, my first, or my second language if I would say the truth, because the first always remains the Polish language which you have your basic education. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3516">Q: My question was more about whether your son, your son was... or even in this, I would maybe have guessed that in the schools he would have been taught about the Holocaust because he's living in Israel. </sentence><sentence id="3517">But from what you're saying it sounds as if there was not very much talk about the Holocaust. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3520">A: You are right. </sentence><sentence id="3521">In the first maybe ten years there was no talk about the Holocaust. </sentence><sentence id="3522">Later on bit by bit it came out and they start to open more the world and exchange of knowledge of the world, with all other countries in Europe and the United States. </sentence><sentence id="3523">And the Jews from the United States, tourists used to come, family members looking, searching for family and some of them finding. </sentence><sentence id="3524">And there was always exposed to the Israeli informations in the papers and everywhere that was always the comer, the sensitive corner of Jewish life, to find families, far families and families and friends from shtetl. </sentence><sentence id="3525">Here they found a sister, here they found a brother after not knowing that they survived, because they disappeared and they went to different corners of the world, to Australia or to New Zealand and to Africa and wherever you want, you have everywhere people in the world. </sentence><sentence id="3526">So when they start to come somehow together it was more exposed in the reality of course, with this knowledge it came always a history and development of knowledge about Holocaust, how it came to it, and this opened the door to more knowledge about the Holocaust. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="4239">A: Well, I feel it, I feel it maybe personally, but I don't blame them. </sentence><sentence id="4240">Maybe they were expecting more involvement from my side in their community life, which I couldn't do, first of my age, secondly my language is not good enough to expose my... it is maybe improved already, but in the beginning my English was good to read, to understand. </sentence><sentence id="4241">But to speak with my accent, to talk about my experience and to be active in their community, it wasn't easy. </sentence><sentence id="4242">It was maybe difficult. </sentence><sentence id="4243">I even proposed and asked the Rabbi I can help him with the Hebrew lessons in the Sunday school maybe. </sentence><sentence id="4244">But he never asked me. </sentence><sentence id="4245">And nobody did ask me to give a hand to something like that. </sentence><sentence id="4246">Maybe to a money drive, maybe they will ask me to do it, but that's not my specialty. </sentence><sentence id="4247">I will not do it. </sentence><sentence id="4248">And that's one thing. </sentence><sentence id="4249">The other thing is, which one influential person told me, that they feel humiliated in my company. </sentence><sentence id="4250">That I am too special for them, so therefore they are hesitating approach me. </sentence><sentence id="4251">Well, I don't know what is true, what the reason is, but this is the reality what I told you. </sentence><sentence id="4252">Iam a stranger for them and I will remain always to them a stranger. </sentence><sentence id="4253">However they are friendly. </sentence><sentence id="4254">If I approach them they answer my questions, but that's all, that's all. </sentence><sentence id="4255">What can you do? </sentence><sentence id="4256">That's the reality. </sentence><sentence id="4257">And you have to live with it and we take it. </sentence><sentence id="4258">And we learn after so many years of life, you learn to live with the reality, with each reality. </sentence><sentence id="4259">This is the main source of our strength, to take the everyday reality in our life as custom life. </sentence><sentence id="4260">And that's it. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="4283">Q: Last time after we finished our interview you mentioned off tape, something about the "business" of the Holocaust or the business that the Holocaust has become and I wonder if you would say something about that. </sentence><sentence id="4284">Does it bother you or do you feel that the Holocaust has been overly commercialized? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="4287"> 47    USHMM Archives RG-50.549.05*0011 48 </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="4288">A: Again, I don't know who will hear this tape, but in the meantime there will be more business in this field. </sentence><sentence id="4289">You know, each community tries to make a museum, a Holocaust museum, which in itself is maybe a nice deed. </sentence><sentence id="4290">But who will come to this museum? </sentence><sentence id="4291">I think the Holocaust museum which is in Washington is the one which was a necessity, very important. </sentence><sentence id="4292">And it fills all the spectrum of Holocaust and of Jewish life, before the war, in the war and after the war. </sentence><sentence id="4293">Maybe there are some nuances which come out which are not of value. </sentence><sentence id="4294">But to make so many, I think people will not be interested to go to the main museum where they have everything. </sentence><sentence id="4295">And this happens because of the way how Jewish society is built in the United States. </sentence><sentence id="4296">It has to be a society, it has to be a president, it has to be a vice-president, it has to be a secretary, it has to be members of the board and so forth and so forth. </sentence><sentence id="4297">Maybe in itself it is as a social thing, maybe it is good, maybe. </sentence><sentence id="4298">But I think a majority of the raised funds goes to administrative use, the paperwork and to expenses which are not profit of the social needs of people who really needs the help. </sentence><sentence id="4299">That is what I think. </sentence><sentence id="4300">And about commercializing the Holocaust, I think when you take thousand books and you put them in a computer and you take the essence, I think from these thousands you will make one book which includes everything. </sentence><sentence id="4301">So there is no need, in my opinion, for so many editions, for so many work with it in... I don't know, I don't know. </sentence><sentence id="4302">Of course, you can see a lot of people who became very famous because of the Holocaust, very famous. </sentence><sentence id="4303">But I don't want to criticize them. </sentence><sentence id="4304">I don't want to criticize nobody. </sentence><sentence id="4305">But I think it is a crime if somebody makes it only for the business. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="4324">Q: I'm coming to the end of my questions. </sentence><sentence id="4325">Is there something that we haven't talked about that you'd like to talk about? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="4328">A: Well, I gave, I gave a sketch about my experiences and about how I see it. </sentence><sentence id="4329">It doesn't mean that I don't have, in general, what to say about. </sentence><sentence id="4330">And especially to the future generations of Jewish people. </sentence><sentence id="4331">Maybe somebody will listen to it. </sentence><sentence id="4332">Maybe somebody will try to understand my point of view. </sentence><sentence id="4333">But it is in the moment, I am ninety years old and I passed through all kind of Jewish life with joy and suffering. </sentence><sentence id="4334">It is like one Jewish sage said: "It is good to be born a Jew. </sentence><sentence id="4335">It's good to die a Jew, but what do you do in the meantime, this is the problem." </sentence><sentence id="4336">From the beginning until the end, the Jews have a very rich historical experience of life, which many other religion or communities don't have. </sentence><sentence id="4337">Not because they wanted, but the wind of history put the Jews in the center of cultural life. </sentence><sentence id="4338">Even in the world. </sentence><sentence id="4339">Not only in Germany, not only in Poland or in Russia or in Palestine or Spain or in the United States. </sentence><sentence id="4340">Everywhere where the Jews were the center of civilized life, of cultural life was concentrated in the Jewish communities or singles. </sentence><sentence id="4341">Jewish Nobel Prize winners, there were scientists in the United States in medical field, in general science are not compatible to no one other people. </sentence><sentence id="4342">Maybe this is the reason that the jealousy of other people brings them to hatred. </sentence><sentence id="4343">I cannot wish that the Jews wouldn't concentrate of all this progress and culture and civilization. </sentence><sentence id="4344">A country they have to do everything possible what brings progress to the world. </sentence><sentence id="4345">But I am turning to the other point not to cover this with egocentric religious or national use. </sentence><sentence id="4346">To take it more in human general perspective and civilized ways. </sentence><sentence id="4347">This is my advice and this is my way of thinking. </sentence><sentence id="4348">And that, and we will remember this, this can maybe, maybe some day bring to make us even with other nations in civilized world. </sentence><sentence id="4349">That we will not be scapegoats in any way, which we were during all our history from the beginning until today. </sentence><sentence id="4350">To avoid it, listen what I said. </sentence><sentence id="4351">Thank you. </sentence></p></dialogue>
