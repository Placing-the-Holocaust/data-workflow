<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="5">A: My name is Eve Rich. </sentence><sentence id="6">My maiden name was Wagszul. </sentence><sentence id="7">I was born in Kowel, spelled K - O-W-E-Lon the Russian border, very close to the Russian border. </sentence><sentence id="8">My childhood as I remember was very nice. </sentence><sentence id="9">My father was a very, very religious man, came from a poor family but they were all educated. </sentence><sentence id="10">They were rabbis, schokhets (ritual slaughterers) and scholars. </sentence><sentence id="11">My mother was not an educated woman. </sentence><sentence id="12">She came from a family from a village not too far from Kowel. </sentence><sentence id="13">Her father, my grandfather, was a very clever man. </sentence><sentence id="14">As a Jew he could never own any land, but because he was a very good businessman, he leased forests and then they would cut them up for lumber. </sentence><sentence id="15">And he was quite successful, so my mom's family was comfortable. </sentence><sentence id="16">I wouldn't say rich because it would mean a lot, but they were very comfortable, so they insisted that the children, us, that we all went to private schools. </sentence><sentence id="17">They made sure that we didn't have any accents, that we didn't speak Jewish at home, because if you had an accent you couldn't get into a good school. </sentence><sentence id="18">This sometimes did not go over too well with my dad because he was religious, but he could see with anti-Semitism in Poland that it might be to our benefits. </sentence><sentence id="19">I was the youngest of two sisters and a brother. </sentence><sentence id="20">My brother left for Israel right after his bar mitzvah and I barely remembered it. </sentence><sentence id="21">I was very little. </sentence><sentence id="22">I think I was like five years old. </sentence><sentence id="23">And pretty soon after enjoying a good childhood with even help in the house...you know, we always had a maid, a woman. </sentence><sentence id="24">Her name was Katja. </sentence><sentence id="25">I can still remember. </sentence><sentence id="26">and my dad I must say was a lawyer but because he could, as a Jew he couldn't pass the Polish bar 01:03: he became an advocate for the Polish lawyers. </sentence><sentence id="27">It means he would hang around the Polish court, give them advice, but he could never enter, could never be in front of the judge. </sentence><sentence id="28">But he had plenty of business within the Jewish community...fourteen thousand Jews. </sentence><sentence id="29">And we were pretty comfortable. </sentence><sentence id="30">We had everything. </sentence><sentence id="31">We had a nice house. </sentence><sentence id="32">my grandfather bought us a piano. </sentence><sentence id="33">One of my sisters... my mom played the piano. </sentence><sentence id="34">One of my sisters played the piano. </sentence><sentence id="35">You know, I was never much...I played but I wasn't as talented as my sister, and then the Russians came into town and of course things changed and I don't remember much because things didn't change for us economically, you know. </sentence><sentence id="36">My father was very smart. </sentence><sentence id="37">He was afraid that the Russians knowingly would send us probably to Siberia because everybody in town knew that we were Zionists, especially my father. </sentence><sentence id="38">But little did we knew that the Russians started to move back because the Germans came in, and this is when my tragedy started. </sentence><sentence id="39">We were put in a ghetto where life was pretty pretty horrible and soon after they divided like the old town and the new town and for some reason we ended up in the old town because my father wanted to be with his mother, with my grandmother and when the first order was to get the Jews out of town, they didn't tell us they were going to kill them. </sentence><sentence id="40">They told us they were going to  take the men to labor camps and the women were going to go to a different town. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="78">Q: What was the life like in the ghetto? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="80">A: It was bad. </sentence><sentence id="81">There wasn't enough food but I remember because of my grandfather's connection, because he lived in a village, you know, and a lot of people worked for him, he would constantly send a non-Jewish peasant over with food, but there came a time where they wouldn't let him through the ghetto and we were practically starved and there were no facilities to wash, you know. </sentence><sentence id="82">Sometimes they would cut off the water. </sentence><sentence id="83">Things were pretty bad. </sentence><sentence id="84">01:06: A lot of people, the older people started to die because there was no doctors around. </sentence><sentence id="85">The doctors were taken to the camps earlier and we knew that sooner or later they're going to either kill us or take us to labor camps, the younger people, and that one night that I remember so well, we were told to leave the house. </sentence><sentence id="86">For some reason my father wouldn't leave the house. </sentence><sentence id="87">I don't remember why I was in the house, because my mother and my sisters were not and they came in. </sentence><sentence id="88">They broke down the door. </sentence><sentence id="89">The doors were locked. </sentence><sentence id="90">They came in. </sentence><sentence id="91">My father had a talis (prayershawl) on. </sentence><sentence id="92">He prayed. </sentence><sentence id="93">And they killed him in front of my eyes. </sentence><sentence id="94">I really don't remember what went what went through my mind. </sentence><sentence id="95">I didn't cry. </sentence><sentence id="96">I didn't scream. </sentence><sentence id="97">I just ran around the kitchen and I got outside. </sentence><sentence id="98">Outside there were people running and there were several of us young girls and some of the German soldiers that surrounded the ghettos let us go through and I remember one of them gave us a battery, light. </sentence><sentence id="99">I don't know...maybe he meant for us just to run. </sentence><sentence id="100">It was dark and to try to save ourselves and this was like the first time that I realized 01:08: that maybe not all of them are bad, because he he could have killed us. </sentence><sentence id="101">I think there were three or four of us. </sentence><sentence id="102">When I think of that moment I can't understand that I didn't take time to make sure that my father is indeed dead. </sentence><sentence id="103">They could have shot him and he could have been alive and suffering. </sentence><sentence id="104">I just cannot explain that and I have a lot of guilt about it and to this day I think about it and the only explanation that I could give you and I have given maybe to myself is that the will of surviving was so strong that I couldn't think of him. </sentence><sentence id="105">I wanted to live for a better world or to tell the story. </sentence><sentence id="106">I was always afraid that all the suffering would be forgotten and there's nobody going to be there to tell the story, and I started to run. </sentence><sentence id="107">I ran through villages. </sentence><sentence id="108">The forest was our home at night. </sentence><sentence id="109">Some people, peasants, would would give us bread. </sentence><sentence id="110">I don't realize that they knew we were Jews, you know. </sentence><sentence id="111">Some of them had a hard life. </sentence><sentence id="112">They worked in the fields and there were people wandering around. </sentence><sentence id="113">01:10:  Well some of them probably didn't even know about the political situation. </sentence><sentence id="114">I remember going to homes where they wouldn't give us any bread or any water and they would say, you're probably Jews and you're wandering around. </sentence><sentence id="115">And we tried to stay away from better looking homes, worrying that those people were better educated and they might recognize us. </sentence><sentence id="116">I lost track of time. </sentence><sentence id="117">I didn't know where I was at times, you know...what's going to happen to us and there were times that I really didn't want to live because we didn't know what tomorrow's going to be. </sentence><sentence id="118">You know, some people seem kind. </sentence><sentence id="119">Some people would point out to you and say, if you don't get out of town we're going to tell the Germans and they're going to come and get you. </sentence><sentence id="120">And it didn't take long before we were arrested, and we were taken to some...the difference between a labor camp and a concentration camp wasn't much really, because the labor camps kind of kept you a couple of days and they weren't as well organized as a concentration camp, so it was very easy to walk out and to escape. </sentence><sentence id="121">And I remember walking away from the labor camp with some...at that time I called him older man because I was like fourteen or fourteen and a half years old, and they told us that not too far there's some religious installation. </sentence><sentence id="122">It's a convent and they are helping a lot of people and I walked in to this...it didn't...to me it looked like a cemetery because in in the front of this big building...it wasn't actually a big building but there was a like a gate and cemetery, a big cemetery plot and then we noticed nuns dressed in habits 01:12: and we waited until not too many people were around. </sentence><sentence id="123">There were like four of us I believe, and we walked in and we told them that we needed help, that we have no place to go and they asked us if we were Jews and we told them. </sentence><sentence id="124">I mean at that point there was no place of hiding and I had a feeling that if nuns are not going to help us, you know, then there's no sense going on, and they told us they were crowded, that they had a lot of infants. </sentence><sentence id="125">They had a lot of sick people and they indeed did, but this Mother Superior that I called it... Theresa was her name, Mother Theresa. </sentence><sentence id="126">By the way, they were Carmelites, and there were a lot of Volksdeutsche. </sentence><sentence id="127">You know what a Volksdeutsche is? </sentence><sentence id="128">The mother can be Polish and the father can be German. </sentence><sentence id="129">A lot of them were mixed, and they took us in and they told us that we had to be very quiet and it was a basement where they put us and sometimes we did chores for them and they gave us some food and they really didn't know how long we could stay because they were constantly being watched by neighbors, you know, and sometimes they could tell them stories so they could explain what was going on but most of the time they didn't see any of the police, any of the German police and we stayed there for several months and slowly they tried to explain to us that things are getting very bad and they are threatened they would kill them if they would find out how many Jews they had. </sentence><sentence id="130">They had quite a few later on we found out. </sentence><sentence id="131">We heard the babies cry at night. </sentence><sentence id="132">01:14: We saw corpses being taken out of very old people and finally they told us that we have  to go. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="190">Q: Did they give you anything while you were there, any...? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="192">A: Well, they gave us cross and a prayer book. </sentence><sentence id="193">They tried very much to convert us and some of them did. </sentence><sentence id="194">I was kind of scared, you know. </sentence><sentence id="195">I told them that I believe in my God, that I'm Jewish and I was scared that my Jewish...you know, I was a child, you know. </sentence><sentence id="196">I told them in my own words that if I accept your religion my God's going to punish me and I was scared to do it and I said I respect your religion. </sentence><sentence id="197">I would always respect it and if it can save my life I'll wear your cross and I'll treasure that prayer book that I still have and I want the Museum to have. </sentence><sentence id="198">I memorized all the prayers and when we parted they gave me a peasant blouse to wear so I wouldn't look suspicious. </sentence><sentence id="199">I would look like a peasant. </sentence><sentence id="200">And this was a very sad time to part with them because you had like a little security and I remember feeling good. </sentence><sentence id="201">They would take us into the chapel to pray, you know, and they would make us kneel and it just felt good after the prayer. </sentence><sentence id="202">You know, I kept saying to myself, God, there's nobody Jewish to pray with me, therefore I have to pray with them and when we parted it was very sad and it was like dying 01:16: and I even told...there was one nun that took a special liking to me and every time she looked at me she would cry and she wanted me so much to stay there because she kept saying that I looked less Jewish than the others and there's really no such thing as looking Jewish, but because I was a red-head and the Germans believed that every Jew has dark hair and a big nose and dark complexion...it wasn't, it wasn't so at all. </sentence><sentence id="203">My mom had very fair complexion and I was always very fair, and it was very hard for this nun to part with me. </sentence><sentence id="204">She wanted me to stay but they were afraid and they let us go and this is how I ended up in Majdanek. </sentence><sentence id="205">Pretty soon they rounded us up. </sentence><sentence id="206">Majdanek was in the beginning to me...I can't say salvation but it was like a relief. </sentence><sentence id="207">Like I didn't have to run anymore. </sentence><sentence id="208">I knew it's a concentration camp and I saw a pile of dead people outside and I saw conditions and I heard screams but in the beginning I was kind of happy because I knew that tonight I can stay here, that I don't have to run through the woods because there's no one that extended a hand anymore like the nuns did. </sentence><sentence id="209">By the way, I'll go back to the nuns. </sentence><sentence id="210">They were very, very good to me, to us and I want you all to know that they risked their own lives. </sentence><sentence id="211">They didn't have much food and they shared it with us. </sentence><sentence id="212">My... 01:18 </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="236">Q: How did you get from the convent to Majdanek? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="238">A: We were just wandering around... </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="240">Q: In the forest? </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="241">A: In the forest and the villages. </sentence><sentence id="242">I really didn't know where I was. </sentence><sentence id="243">If you asked me where Majdanek was, near what city, I didn't know. </sentence><sentence id="244">It didn't matter. </sentence><sentence id="245">If you saw a crowd of people you kind of turned around because you were afraid. </sentence><sentence id="246">Everyone looked suspicious. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="253">After leaving the convent we weren't dirty because we always had some water facilities you know to wash but when they they rounded us up on the street where they took people from the labor camp and there was no place to run. </sentence><sentence id="254">They took us on the trucks and they took to Majdanek. </sentence><sentence id="255">Majdanek was, turned out to be later on a pretty horrible place to be, especially for a young girl. </sentence><sentence id="256">I...at one point I didn't know that they had younger children than me but later on I found out that they had a lot of infants and nobody could approach that place in Majdanek because apparently they would kill the infants and make lamp shades out of baby skins or soap from baby fat. </sentence><sentence id="257">We could smell it. </sentence><sentence id="258">We heard sometimes screams but we never saw it. </sentence><sentence id="259">Then there was another part of Majdanek that where the windows were always covered with chalk and sometimes we would come back from hard work...we would dig ditches or whatever they would </sentence></p><p><sentence id="260"> 01:20: ask us to do. </sentence><sentence id="261">By the way, this camp had a lot of Russian prisoners and they had high officers that lived separated from everybody else. </sentence><sentence id="262">They were treated much better. </sentence><sentence id="263">They would interrogate them, maybe get some secrets from them, because I noticed that they were bringing them food and a couple of times they sent us to clean their barracks and they had given us food. </sentence><sentence id="264">This is when I realized that they had some important Russian officers there. </sentence><sentence id="265">Then one day, and this is a a very difficult thing for me to talk, but it's history. </sentence><sentence id="266">We were asking a lot of questions. </sentence><sentence id="267">What is in this building? </sentence><sentence id="268">What is in this building? </sentence><sentence id="269">And that building with the chalk kind of interested me because sometimes I would hear screams and I would see German soldiers taking women there, women that were maybe at that time maybe in their twenties or maybe older. </sentence><sentence id="270">They were developed a lot better. </sentence><sentence id="271">They were pretty women and apparently they made some medical experiments, because through one window we peeked and we saw some men naked in big tubs. </sentence><sentence id="272">They were metal tubs, with ice and they would freeze them to a certain temperature and they would let the women undress and I guess they wanted to see the sexual reaction and this was horrible to watch and pretty soon it was the turn for us. ( </sentence><sentence id="273">Pause) (Crying) This is when you . ( </sentence><sentence id="274">Pause) And if you didn't do what they wanted you to do, you'll be beaten up something terrible, or you were put under cold showers. ( </sentence><sentence id="275">Crying) Now I remember the Red Cross at </sentence></p><p><sentence id="276"> 01:23: one time came and we were moved to a different location. </sentence><sentence id="277">And then we heard rumors. </sentence><sentence id="278">A lot of the...there were a lot of Poles, there weren't only Jews...there were some Poles, political prisoners. </sentence><sentence id="279">There were even some Germans that were political opponents and we heard rumors that they were going to take us to Auschwitz and we had ovens. </sentence><sentence id="280">There were ovens in Majdanek but I never got to see them, and we heard screams but we never got to see them, but apparently the ovens weren't big enough... </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="281">Q: Before we move on, let me...can we go back a little bit to what your experiences that you were talking about at Majdanek, what they did? </sentence><sentence id="282">Could you be a little...tell us a little more detail? </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="283">A: I think it was...I think they just wanted to see the men suffer and us suffer but you know, when we saw the women that, you know, when a fourteen or fifteen year old girl that doesn't have to eat, it's rather ugly. </sentence><sentence id="284">Her head shaven looks...some of the women were rather, you know, developed. </sentence><sentence id="285">You know, they were older. </sentence><sentence id="286">I don't even remember having any breasts, you know, and when you saw what they did...they threw them, you know, on top of the men and they wanted to see the reaction and they actually tried to force the man to have sex with them. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="291">Q: What was your experience? </sentence><sentence id="292">Tell what they asked you to do? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="295">A: They asked us to do the similar thing, but most of the time the men were like dead and it was just a horrible thing 01:25: doing that, and the screams and and I remember I asked to be killed. ( </sentence><sentence id="296">Crying) (Pause) I just couldn't go through it. </sentence><sentence id="297">They they stopped it and this was apparently...later on we found out that it was a group of doctors were conducting this experiment for their own selfish maybe... I really can't explain it. </sentence><sentence id="298">I read a book about it, that they were abnormal people, that they just got a kick seeing people suffer like that. </sentence><sentence id="299">Pretty soon when we heard rumors that we're going to Auschwitz, we decided that no matter what, we're not going to go to Auschwitz. </sentence><sentence id="300">We're going to jump the train or we're going to do something. </sentence><sentence id="301">We're going to kill ourselves. </sentence><sentence id="302">We didn't have any weapons and we thought maybe we'll get some poison, you know, and you couldn't really talk, you know. </sentence><sentence id="303">You would gather doing work and you would...somebody would say something, but then one night indeed they took us on a train and this train supposedly was taking us to Auschwitz. </sentence><sentence id="304">And at one point they told us when we tell you to jump the train, you must do it. </sentence><sentence id="305">If not, you're going to go to Auschwitz. </sentence><sentence id="306">You don't want to go. </sentence><sentence id="307">And we jumped the train. </sentence><sentence id="308">I was shot. </sentence><sentence id="309">You can still see a hole, but I...they picked me up. </sentence><sentence id="310">It wasn't too bad, and they put us on a transport...there was so much confusion. </sentence><sentence id="311">There were a lot of people...there were hundreds of people, and they put us on a transport of forced labor that was going into Germany. </sentence><sentence id="312">I don't know if you're familiar with it. </sentence><sentence id="313">They would take a lot of young people...very seldom Jews because Jews were already rounded up and and they were in camps, but there were a lot of Russian, Ukrainians and Polish young people and they forced them to go to Germany so they could work on their fields, because the German soldiers were not home. </sentence><sentence id="314">They were fighting the war, so that's how I got into Germany, with a transport of maybe three hundred people. </sentence><sentence id="315">On that transport only one person knew that I was Jewish. </sentence><sentence id="316">01:28:  A Ukrainian girl. </sentence><sentence id="317">To this day she lives in Canada, and we actually didn't know where the transport is going to take us but she whispered to me, as long as I can I'm going to help you and I'll never tell anyone that you are Jewish. </sentence><sentence id="318">And she did. </sentence><sentence id="319">We got to Bavaria and we ended up on a farm near Stranding (ph). </sentence><sentence id="320">It's in Bavaria. </sentence><sentence id="321">This was pretty close to the war end. </sentence><sentence id="322">We already heard rumors that, you know, the Americans are getting closer and closer. </sentence><sentence id="323">Life on the farm wasn't very pleasant. </sentence><sentence id="324">There wasn't enough food and the farmers were not very nice to us and they were very suspicious of me because most of them were indeed farmers. </sentence><sentence id="325">I wasn't so as a result they would look at my hands and they would say, oh, you must be some Italian, noble girl or something because your hands don't look like our hands. </sentence><sentence id="326">I couldn't milk a cow. </sentence><sentence id="327">I couldn't do a lot of things that they did, but it was still better than being in a concentration camp, but I was very scared. </sentence><sentence id="328">I knew that the war would come to an end and I didn't know how I was going to get out of this group of Poles, you know. </sentence><sentence id="329">How would I join with the liberation forces? </sentence><sentence id="330">This was my biggest concern, and this friend of mine, Natshtca (ph)...the only one that knew I was Jewish...she said, don't worry. </sentence><sentence id="331">It's going to work out. </sentence><sentence id="332">And I remember when we heard over the radio that they liberated a camp not too far from Regensburg. </sentence><sentence id="333">Stranding was maybe like a hundred miles from Regensburg and the farmer got very scared, you know, because he mistreated us. </sentence><sentence id="334">You know, he would beat us once in a while, and he wanted to know if we want to go, and we didn't know where to go so we asked him if he would give us a ride to the nearest town. </sentence><sentence id="335">He give us a ride to Borgenberg (ph), which was a tiny little town and we went to the police, this German police, and we asked him where the Americans are. </sentence><sentence id="336">And they didn't tell us. </sentence><sentence id="337">They didn't know. </sentence><sentence id="338">They were still about 01:31: fifty miles, and pretty soon this Colonel McMann...the one that I showed you the obituary...he liberated a camp and he made an announcement on the radio, so if you have...if you know where Jewish people are, if they're hiding, please come forward. </sentence><sentence id="339">And they sent out American cars and jeeps to get us and they put us in hostels. </sentence><sentence id="340">And this is when they started to interview us, and you know, we were so scared that I was afraid even to speak to Americans. </sentence><sentence id="341">I remember the first interview was a colonel from Philadelphia. </sentence><sentence id="342">He was asking me questions and I didn't trust him, but it took a while for me to gain confidence in them, and we told them about my family and the first concern was do I have somebody living, and I knew...I pretty much gave up on my parents. </sentence><sentence id="343">I knew that if they would be alive, I would have...they would have found me or something, but I knew that my brother's in Israel, that he probably is either in Israel or hiding somewhere else and the American Red Cross found out that he was fighting with the Jewish Brigade in Belgium and it took him a while to find me because he couldn't get away. </sentence><sentence id="344">In the meantime they were questioning me about my relatives in America and I knew names but I didn't...couldn't tell them where they lived or how they lived and there was one 01:33:  American doctor that took a special interest and showed me a movie. </sentence><sentence id="345">They gave us some medication to kind of relax us. </sentence><sentence id="346">There was a group of us. </sentence><sentence id="347">Must have been a couple of hundred Jewish kids, and they showed us a movie of these sights and they asked us, they said if there is a name...you know, they showed us stores with names...if there's a name that makes any sense to you, and I saw a name Friedman, and I said I think I had a cousin by the name of Friedman and they asked me what he did and I really didn't remember. </sentence><sentence id="348">I told them that I think he came from Poland and he became a watchmaker and he put it all with my name and what I told him. </sentence><sentence id="349">He put an ad in the American Jewish Journal or whatever...it's a paper in New York...and a cousin of my grandfather read it and they sent a telegram to America because the other cousin's son, the man that married me, was with the American forces near Munich and within a couple of weeks he came to see me and by then, you know, I had gained weight and they had given me some clothes and this is the picture... </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="410">A: I was living in Stranding, in a German home. </sentence><sentence id="411">This was not a very pleasant story in the beginning because when the Burgermeister brought me there with the Jewish survivors, it became like the head of the Jewish kids to help us out, came to the door and told them the story that she's liberated now. </sentence><sentence id="412">She has no place to go. </sentence><sentence id="413">She says I can't accept her. </sentence><sentence id="414">She's Jewish. </sentence><sentence id="415">And she said my husband is a Nazi and that's why he's in jail, so I did not want to live with them. </sentence><sentence id="416">I was scared. </sentence><sentence id="417">And then we found out that the doctor, Doctor Edlbacher, I remember his name well he was not a Nazi. </sentence><sentence id="418">He joined the Nazi party because he was a hunter and he couldn't get a license. </sentence><sentence id="419">And that night he was freed, and indeed they gave me a place in their home. </sentence><sentence id="420">They tried to be very nice and they came with flowers, and I knew it was temporary because my relatives in America did everything to try to bring me over. </sentence><sentence id="421">In the meantime my brother came, but things were so bad in Israel 01:36: that he knew that I would have to wait a long time to get into Israel because there were just too many people and the British were not willing to do it, so pretty soon I got a visa to come to the States and I came on a military small boat, Marina Fletcher and I have the telegram that was sent to me and I hope the Museum can have them, or wants them. </sentence><sentence id="422">So my story, my very sad story had a good ending. </sentence><sentence id="423">I came to the States. </sentence><sentence id="424">I felt sad that I came alone, that I was pretty much sure that they were dead because I went through a lot of camps looking for for them. </sentence><sentence id="425">I thought maybe I'll find a sister. </sentence><sentence id="426">Maybe I find my mother. </sentence><sentence id="427">I knew about my father, but indeed to this day nobody's alive. </sentence></p></dialogue>
