<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="431">Q: Let's come back to that and first, if you would, tell me how your father was taken away and when? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="433">A: Okay, my father was taken away several times. </sentence><sentence id="434">You know, Hungary was kind of a strange part of that Nazi area because the Hungarians, the Hungarian government has always been in the hands of the aristocracy, Hungarian aristocracy, and the Hungarian aristocracy had no taste for Jews but also had no taste for killing or murdering Jews. </sentence><sentence id="435">They were above this, and so therefore when the dictator of Hungary, Admiral Horthy, had to appoint a government, most of the time that government would not eventually do everything that the Germans wanted them to do. </sentence><sentence id="436">So it was almost like playing musical chairs, I mean, Hungary's a very small country and you don't have that many politicians, aristocrats to go around, but almost the same faces somehow appeared, if not as prime minister then maybe minister of interior, or something. </sentence><sentence id="437">So we really, up until 1944, we had a great deal of anti-Semitism, we had a great deal of persecution of Jews but we were not in fear of our lives. </sentence><sentence id="438">Because somehow that was below the dignity of that class. </sentence><sentence id="439">Not only that, some of those aristocrats were very Anglophiles and had, during the war, connections with the British. </sentence><sentence id="440">And so in between, it depended on which aristocrat was in charge of the country. </sentence><sentence id="441">Some of them were a little bit more German-oriented than others. </sentence><sentence id="442">And when, and more German-oriented came into the picture because the Germans didn't like the one who was in office, then he ordered that so and so is going to go and serve in, these Jews will be taken to the labor battalion. </sentence><sentence id="443">My father was in the labor battalion before he was taken to Yugoslavia but he was inside Hungary so we could visit him, we could take food for him and eventually, when a new prime minister came, he declared that anybody over let's say, forty-five can go home. </sentence><sentence id="444">So there was no fear of being killed just because you are, you're a Jew. </sentence><sentence id="445">Up until 1944, March, when the Germans marched into Hungary. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="459">Q: So when your father was called to be taken away... </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="461">A: To go, yeah, we knew where he was. </sentence><sentence id="462">I remember, he was not far from Budapest for awhile, for a few month, and then almost every weekend we took food down, we talked to him, he was released, we could walk around a little bit. </sentence><sentence id="463">And so it was not the same thing as taken away to a faraway country where we had no idea what would happen to him. </sentence><sentence id="464">Now, there, there, then in 1942, he was taken away for, for good. </sentence><sentence id="465">For some reason, and I cannot really USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0467 &amp; RG-50.549.05*0001 12 remember exactly what happened and why. </sentence><sentence id="466">We had, probably, a more radical prime minister who yielded to the Germans and let this contingent of Jewish labor battalions go outside the country and he was then taken to Yugoslavia. </sentence><sentence id="467">I remember, even then, they, they were told which railroad station are they going to be going through in Budapest and they allowed them to be there I think half an hour or an hour where we had a visit with him so we could talk over a few things. </sentence><sentence id="468">And that was the last I saw him, then, for a couple of years until he came back after the war. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="484">Q: And he, where did he go exactly? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="486">A: He went to, he was in a copper mine in Bor, B, O, R which is I think the nearest is NiS which is Serbia today, the Serb Republic in Yugoslavia. </sentence><sentence id="487">And he was there, he was always telling me about what was, what was interesting, the various people who guarded them. </sentence><sentence id="488">They had Croats, they had German, they was all SS, Croat, Croatian SS, German SS, Hungarian, not SS, but Hungarian, and I think that they had something, I've forgot what, but anyway, various nationalities were guarding them and probably Bosnians. </sentence><sentence id="489">And he mentioned when he came home, interestingly, he said, "Son," he said, "we never, we never really worried too much about anyone else guarding us except the Croatians." </sentence><sentence id="490">He said, "We had never seen such beasts as the Croatian SS was." </sentence><sentence id="491">They called them Usta8as, you know. </sentence><sentence id="492">He was there and I think, I, this is probably much better written than in my memory, | think about one hundred fifty thousand were in this particular area where he was and what happened was when, when the Tito partisans were really pushing them back, The Germans decided to march them back toward Germany and in, in what is northern, what was northern Yugoslavia at that time and previously back before 1918, was southern Hungary, they set up these slaughterhouses, where those who survived the concentration camp were killed and my father was in the last six thousand being marched and they were captured by Tito's partisans. </sentence><sentence id="493">And then he was given a choice whether he could fight with the partisans, he could work for the partisans, or they would allow him to go into an area that was already liberated and live there and they would supply him with enough food to survive until the war is over, they said. </sentence><sentence id="494">And he was a very strong man and very grateful that they saved his life and he volunteered to work. </sentence><sentence id="495">So he worked in a flour mill somewhere around and came home with all kinds of documents and, and little medals that testified to the fact that he was a good worker and did his share. </sentence><sentence id="496">And he was very proud of it, and when Stalin decided to eradicate any of the memories attached to Tito, unfortunately we had to burn everything and we had to throw away his medals because it was very dangerous to be in the possession of anything that connects you to Tito. </sentence><sentence id="497">People were hanged all the time without not much reason, let alone if they find something on you. </sentence><sentence id="498">So, he was very bitter about this, and this turned him against the Russians so in all his life he was very anti-Russian and very pro- Yugoslavian. </sentence><sentence id="499">He would have been heartbroken to see what happened to Yugoslavia had he lived today. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="521">A: Well, of course we were always afraid that he would not survive and we had no doubt that physically he could survive but we were afraid that, that he would get killed. </sentence><sentence id="522">But an interesting episode was that, [cough] excuse me, I asked him after the war, what, why did he survive if so many people died? </sentence><sentence id="523">And he had a little, just a short little anecdote, he said, "Son, there were two kinds of people in the concentration camp. </sentence><sentence id="524">We got a canteen of water every morning. </sentence><sentence id="525">The one group drank the water immediately and the second group, such as myself, drank half of the water during the day and we used the other half to wash ourselves." </sentence><sentence id="526">And I said, "Half a canteen of water would make you clean?" </sentence><sentence id="527">He said, "No, but I felt like a human being, I was still caring about myself." </sentence><sentence id="528">And he said, "And later on I understood a lot more about this whole attitude that I'm not going to lie down here and gulp down everything, I am, even though I am full of lice, I'm still caring about myself." </sentence><sentence id="529">So that, basically, that was the attitude that saved, I'm sure, that was who survived. </sentence><sentence id="530">And of course luck, because even with this attitude somebody could have shot you if they didn't like your face or the way they moved. </sentence><sentence id="531">Yes, we, my mother maintained of course like most wives that he's going to return, and she was right because even though we have not heard from him for a long time, especially the last year when he was there, of course by that time, we couldn't have heard from him because he was already in the liberated area and we were in Hungary still, in the battlefield. </sentence><sentence id="532">It was, however, just that, that deep feeling that he will come home. </sentence><sentence id="533">And he came home in 1945, I remember late spring, it must have been April, May, probably, and he did not just stop by and said, "Here I am." </sentence><sentence id="534">He was afraid that maybe we would faint or something like that. </sentence><sentence id="535">He sent a friend up. </sentence><sentence id="536">A man came up and inquired about my father and very slowly kind of asked, "When did you hear from him?" </sentence><sentence id="537">and all this, and "Do you think he's alive?" </sentence><sentence id="538">and all this, and slowly he said, "Well, I have a feeling that he is alive," and slowly he led us to this. </sentence><sentence id="539">I remember him coming up on the stairs with a rucksack. </sentence><sentence id="540">The rucksack was full of sausage and potatoes. </sentence><sentence id="541">And he knew that we were starving and so that was it. </sentence><sentence id="542">Now, just to describe the situation in Hungary at that time and how you needed to be, to stay a human being, the, we did not live in our apartment, we were moved, because you could not stay in your apartment. </sentence><sentence id="543">You had to move to first, to so-called Jewish houses that had a big star on them and, eventually to the ghetto. </sentence><sentence id="544">And because of the history of this house, we did not move into the ghetto but this house Zichy street One, was designated as a Jewish house first. </sentence><sentence id="545">So, in the meantime, we moved out of, of our apartment in, that was 1944, summer when you had to leave your apartment. </sentence><sentence id="546">We, the neighbors came, some of them, and said "We will keep this for you, and keep this for you," and needless to say, that not one thing eventually survived again. </sentence><sentence id="547">Or resurfaced again. </sentence><sentence id="548">They all, either the Russians took it, or the bombing or everything. </sentence><sentence id="549">It's all disappeared, and what could you do about it?You said okay. </sentence><sentence id="550">But people were in a way like vultures, they were just circling around and see, you know, what they can take. </sentence><sentence id="551">And then the apartment was given, all these Jewish   USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0467 &amp; RG-50.549.05*0001 14 apartments were given to bomb those people whose... Gentiles whose houses were bombed and they couldn't live in anymore. </sentence><sentence id="552">And I had no idea of course what happened to our apartment. </sentence><sentence id="553">We lived in a street called Rottenbiller Street, 66deg, and I, my first thing, we were liberated on January 18 and the first thing I went back to see, what, what happened to our apartment because we left, believe it or not, a few boxes of linen there, just when we left. </sentence><sentence id="554">We just, we couldn't do anything with it, so. </sentence><sentence id="555">And when I came, when I went up there, I had this tremendous chip on my shoulder that I'm going to show these people whoever are there, that within two hours, I said I'm going to give them two hours to get out of here. </sentence><sentence id="556">And here I was a sixteen year old kid, barely sixteen, fifteen really, and telling them, here was a family and I was telling them to get out of here. </sentence><sentence id="557">And the family consisted of a mother, father, a daughter and two sons. </sentence><sentence id="558">And they were tailors. </sentence><sentence id="559">And the old man was quite old, the father, was telling me, he said, "But, but, where can we go?" </sentence><sentence id="560">And I said, "Why did you come here?" </sentence><sentence id="561">And he said, "Well, we have, we have no place. </sentence><sentence id="562">Our, our house was destroyed, and I mean we knew that this is, this was a Jewish apartment, but still it was between this or living in the street, in the cold snowy January," so he said, "Could, could you do something, could, could we somehow come to some kind of an agreement?" </sentence><sentence id="563">And so my mother came up and she said, "Why can't we just divide the place between us?" </sentence><sentence id="564">And here it was a two room apartment with their family, four people, five people in their families and two, my mother and I, and we decided that after looking at them and listening to them and all this, there was just something that all of a sudden hit me. </sentence><sentence id="565">My chip was gone and so we decided that yes, we were going to, we'll, we'll make it. </sentence><sentence id="566">And so we lived there under the same roof and we became very good friends. </sentence><sentence id="567">And when my father came home in late spring, the new government, Democratic government, devised this plan of each block had to elect a kind of a small council and the head of that council was quite powerful in deciding if there was an empty apartment or, almost like a Justice of Peace. </sentence><sentence id="568">They had certain tasks that they can perform, temporarily, they were deputized. </sentence><sentence id="569">And my father was appointed to do this because he was always very much respected by the people there and the fact that he was now good, you know, with the new regime. </sentence><sentence id="570">And next to us, an apartment was full of old, old women who died one after another. </sentence><sentence id="571">It was a, like a Salvation Army place. </sentence><sentence id="572">They, they rented it and it became empty, so my father got the apartment for them and they moved over there so we could get our apartment back, we lived there, but they could never really thank enough and we, we kept this relationship for a long time and I'm sorry I lost contact with them. </sentence><sentence id="573">But then, we had an apartment and then we faced something else because then the Russians were coming around and trying to find places for their soldiers and so they, they got, they got two old Russian soldiers from Siberia who were quartered in, in our apartment because two rooms were too many for three people. </sentence><sentence id="574">So, and I remember, they were very cute old men, we had no, I mean we had sign language, we didn't speak Russian and the only incident I remember is that my mother, of all these sufferings, had one little symbol in her possession: a bottle of very expensive cologne water that she kept. </sentence><sentence id="575">And she said, "I am going to start using this after the war, when we are all together and we live in peace." </sentence><sentence id="576">And so, and she kept it and she had it with her all the time. </sentence><sentence id="577">And so now, when we moved back, she, we got a temporarily, kind of an armoir and she put it way back between sheets. </sentence><sentence id="578">Now one day we &gt;

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="809">A: Then, then, then we used the papers for awhile, but it was a, it was very confusing period when we were moving a lot. </sentence><sentence id="810">First, my wife, my mother and I moved to the, the apartment of one of my father's friends. </sentence><sentence id="811">They were Seventh-Day Adventists. </sentence><sentence id="812">And they offered their place but soon they learned that Seventh-Day Adventists are just in the same danger as Jews so after consultation, we left. </sentence><sentence id="813">Then we were, we went to a, I was always on the street, hearing, feeling, looking, what can happen? </sentence><sentence id="814">Then I took my mother to a Jewish high school which was designated as a clothing supply business for the Hungarian army and it was really a refuge for, for Jews. </sentence><sentence id="815">They were sewing uniforms for the army and it was established by old Hungarian Jewish army officers who wanted to save their skin and their family and hired fake guards in uniform to come in and out of the place, putting on a show and inside they were actually really making, sewing uniforms and delivering it to the army and, and, so I was always, it was just constantly you had to change your position and you had to always look at what seems safe at the moment. </sentence><sentence id="816">And it is possible that something that was safe one week became unsafe the next week because somebody recognized one person in that place when he was walking down the street, going into places, "Here is a Jew, doesn't wear a yellow star, what is he doing?" </sentence><sentence id="817">And so, your life depended on nuances, those days. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="927">A: It was, it was in 1944, [coughs] excuse me. </sentence><sentence id="928">After I finished what would be eighth grade here, it was the fourth grade of middle school and I was supposed to then go to what they call gymnasium, which is high school in Europe. </sentence><sentence id="929">I could not get into a high school and so it was not a long period but between 1944, I have to figure this out. </sentence><sentence id="930">Let's see, 1925, 40, right. </sentence><sentence id="931">So there was a year, "43 because I was, I left the school, "43 so I had one year when actually I didn't do much except odd jobs. </sentence><sentence id="932">My father was away, so, as I mentioned before I delivered, worked for an architectural firm and delivered blueprints, whatever I can find but I could not get into high school. </sentence><sentence id="933">The higher four grades of high school, the gymnasium. </sentence><sentence id="934">And so my mother suggested that we hire a tutor so by the time I would be available for high school, I wouldn't miss much. </sentence><sentence id="935">And this is why I had a private tutor. </sentence><sentence id="936">I was studying especially Latin because everybody suggested that that would probably create a problem when all of a sudden I, war would be over--we were always optimists--and I could go to, instead of the first form to the second form and Latin would create the biggest problem. </sentence><sentence id="937">So for Latin and Algebra, I had a tutor, somebody in, in my mother's distant family, who lived in Budapest. </sentence><sentence id="938">And this is how the year went by. </sentence><sentence id="939">There was really not much else, a little work and a little study. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="953">Q: At that time, was, were you and your mother aware of the so-called Final Solution and what was happening to Jews elsewhere in Europe? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="955">A: Yes. </sentence><sentence id="956">My mother somehow, well, first of all the BBC, of course, unfortunately told us what happened to the Jews who were taken away to concentration camps and death camps but by the that time it was well known in Hungary too, what the deportations, how the deportations end up. </sentence><sentence id="957">So my mother was extremely upset, for understandable reasons and I really had to kind of keep her spirit up and, constantly reminding her that there are certain things we can't change and she still has to live for her own little immediate family. </sentence><sentence id="958">But yes, we were very much aware, very much aware. </sentence><sentence id="959">And even though it was very, very difficult to get BBC and up until 1944, March, or April when the radios had to be turned in, we could still get BBC.And I learned from my father, I was six years old when I learned from my father that there is more to news than just the Hungarian papers and the Hungarian radio. </sentence><sentence id="960">He would close the shutters at certain times, he always changed the times, of course, he would lock the doors and he would listen to BBC. </sentence><sentence id="961">At a very early age and would tell me that this is the truth. </sentence><sentence id="962">Eventually, it became very dangerous because the Germans would have a device that was on top of a car, similar probably to what radar is today, that would circle and try to find people who listened to foreign broadcasts. </sentence><sentence id="963">And it was punishable also by going to concentration camp. </sentence><sentence id="964">  USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0467 &amp; RG-50.549.05*0001 21 </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="978">A: Yes. </sentence><sentence id="979">Yes. [ </sentence><sentence id="980">talkover] Well, I think this is in the Jewish nature, if you consider the fact that people in boxcars going to Auschwitz were still running schools, right? </sentence><sentence id="981">It's just that, this part of the, of the optimism and the fact that you have to learn, learn and learn. </sentence><sentence id="982">That was with us. </sentence><sentence id="983">That kind of a feeling never left us and we never really gave up. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1004">A: No, those who were in the house, they were allowed to stay, which is obvious, I mean, anybody who would have been tossed out would have had to go to the ghetto. </sentence><sentence id="1005">And it was, to most people, it was clear that eventually the ghetto is going to be annihilated. </sentence><sentence id="1006">There was no other way, since Budapest was surrounded by then by the Soviet forces, what else can you do with it? </sentence><sentence id="1007">They built a huge wooden wall around the ghetto and, according to the rumors, they would just detonate the whole thing or burn it down or, but they would not let the Jews survive if the siege had lasted another week or so. </sentence><sentence id="1008">The lucky thing is that they just ran out of time. </sentence><sentence id="1009">I, of course I was never in the ghetto, but no, those who were in the house, they could stay, and a lot of other families moved in, practically all of them connected to famous Hungarian doctors. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1028">Q: And who was living in your aunt's apartment with you? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1030">A: Well, about at least ten other members of our family. </sentence><sentence id="1031">Some other aunts and brothers of my father, my mother, of course, and I. I say, and it was a, about one and a half room apartment USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0467 &amp; RG-50.549.05*0001 22 and there were plenty of people in it. </sentence><sentence id="1032">But that was the, the least of our problems, really, you know. </sentence><sentence id="1033">We could, we could sleep very well. </sentence><sentence id="1034">There were a lot worse arrangements in Budapest at that time. </sentence><sentence id="1035">There were, there were people in Swedish-protected houses in, near the Danube, where, I understand, people couldn't even sleep. </sentence><sentence id="1036">They just were, you know, practically back to back in a room, there were so many people jammed in. </sentence><sentence id="1037">This is the one that Wallen... what was his name, the Swedish diplomat, Wallenberg, the one, that was his little area, Raoul Wallenberg. </sentence><sentence id="1038">But I never, I went a couple of times by, but I never went up but I noticed that there just, there were just lots of lots of people. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1049">Q: And then this house, before it was established as a clinic, were there non-Jews living as well? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1051">A: Yes. </sentence><sentence id="1052">Yes. </sentence><sentence id="1053">And interestingly, I can remember that a couple of non-Jewish families stayed there. </sentence><sentence id="1054">They just stayed there. </sentence><sentence id="1055">By that time, perhaps what went through their mind is, that, since the war inevitably is coming to an end, it's not a bad idea to be here when the Soviet troops come. </sentence><sentence id="1056">So that must have been their reasoning. </sentence><sentence id="1057">And it was not, not impractical, actually. </sentence><sentence id="1058">At the same time, even in the last week, we were in danger of being taken to the Danube, that was the, the most common way of getting rid of Jews who were discovered outside the ghetto, marched down and shot into the river. </sentence><sentence id="1059">It was a cold, bitter, snowy winter and the Danube was red and full of corpses. </sentence><sentence id="1060">But I remember that even the last week, somebody from the neighborhood reported us to the fascist authorities and they came and tried to disarm Jereczian Ara George's own people in the house, the bodyguards. </sentence><sentence id="1061">And he seemed, he almost seemed helpless. </sentence><sentence id="1062">We were already lined up and then he again arrived there, amazingly, he did this more than once, with some paper from a very special higher authority that said, "Clear out of here. </sentence><sentence id="1063">This is a protected territory and we do our job for the government and leave us alone." </sentence><sentence id="1064">We confronted the man after the war. </sentence><sentence id="1065">I know that. </sentence><sentence id="1066">He was caught, the one who reported us because he was stupid enough to show up the last week before Budapest was, Pest was occupied, and pointed fingers. </sentence><sentence id="1067">I also remember another man who was a fascist officer that lived a couple of houses across from us who was also quite antagonistic toward us and we were worried about him. </sentence><sentence id="1068">And also the last week, they brought him in with a head injury. </sentence><sentence id="1069">He was shot in the head in the street fighting. </sentence><sentence id="1070">There was tremendous street fighting and he was just left there to die. </sentence><sentence id="1071">And I don't know, I was just fascinated by, by this man that, that everybody was always afraid of and here he was, basically a nothing anymore, you know. </sentence><sentence id="1072">And in spite of my good judgement, I watched him, kept going back to him, as a young man all night, watch him how he was dying. </sentence><sentence id="1073">And I can't, I still cannot explain this fascination, because ever since I couldn't look at another human being, even an animal that is dying. </sentence><sentence id="1074">But somehow, there was a mixed feeling in me of revenge and satisfaction that this scum is, is not going to be here any longer and I wanted to see how he was going. </sentence><sentence id="1075">And my mother, I remember scolded me for this and constantly was taking me back to our place, where we, our sleeping arrangement was. </sentence><sentence id="1076">But, there, there were incidents like this and it was a very, very strange period for a fifteen-year-old boy. </sentence><sentence id="1077">My job was basically to take legs and arms up that were cut off, operated on in the so-called operating room which was a, a dark part of the basement and kind of arrange them on the, in the courtyard. </sentence><sentence id="1078">And when in, when in January 18", we went up, upstairs, everybody was USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0467 &amp; RG-50.549.05*0001 23 horrified. </sentence><sentence id="1079">There were huge piles of limbs just piled up on the courtyard. </sentence><sentence id="1080">And most of it, I had to pile up because I was the one who was always sent up with these. </sentence><sentence id="1081">The doctors operated without any anesthesis [sic], anything. </sentence><sentence id="1082">There were, there were, there was nothing and it, of course, the survival ratio probably was minimal, you know. </sentence><sentence id="1083">But that, whenever I look into that house, that always comes to my mind, how these houses survive. </sentence><sentence id="1084">We die but they keep their secrets. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1125">Q: Had any of the other people who were living in your aunt's apartment, did they have papers, false papers? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1127">A: I have a feeling that most of them did because my father's brothers wore the uniform of a military police and again, because of their, their origin from this working, workers" neighborhood, they got papers and they got uniforms. </sentence><sentence id="1128">They were supplied with everything, both of them. </sentence><sentence id="1129">So. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1133">Q: Were you using your papers at the time? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1135">A: I was, only when, when on the street, they stopped me and asked for papers. </sentence><sentence id="1136">That was the only time I used mine. </sentence><sentence id="1137">And, by the last, I would say the last few weeks it didn't mean anything if they stopped a man because they didn't even ask for papers. </sentence><sentence id="1138">They asked for you to drop your pants. </sentence><sentence id="1139">And since in Europe, only Jews are circumcised, it was very easy to detect who was a Jew. </sentence><sentence id="1140">And I have to thank, I mean my life was really saved by a man who, amazingly appeared at the time when I thought that this was my last moment on earth. </sentence><sentence id="1141">I was sent out to get something, I think, if | remember correctly, I was sent out because a horse fell on the street from shrapnels and we needed some meat. </sentence><sentence id="1142">And the only kind of meat, whenever we had meat, the only meat that we could get was horsemeat. </sentence><sentence id="1143">And of fallen horses, horses that were shot on the street, usually by airplanes. </sentence><sentence id="1144">Airplanes flew very low and they were just machine-gunning anything that moved. </sentence><sentence id="1145">And I always ran out and I also crawled out to get water. </sentence><sentence id="1146">There were certain areas where a faucet was still intact and you could get some water. </sentence><sentence id="1147">And a patrol came and caught me and they said, "Okay, here, come, come into the doorway of this house," and they were shouting, yelling, "This looks like a Jew and took off your pants, take off your pants," and they give me the order and I was kind of snow-white probably and shaking and all of a sudden another man with a much higher rank came and said to the guys, "Look, I see four, five Jews on that corner. </sentence><sentence id="1148">Go immediately, see, catch those, I take care of this idiot here. </sentence><sentence id="1149">And so we went under the doorway and I was unbuttoning my pants and kind of shaking and he said, "Listen," he said, "are you crazy?" </sentence><sentence id="1150">He said, "I don't know where you come from, do you have a place where you were staying?" </sentence><sentence id="1151">I said yes. </sentence><sentence id="1152">He said, he said, "Go back and I don't ever want to see you again on the street." </sentence><sentence id="1153">And we came out and he was hitting me and beating me and just and he said to these people, "This idiot, he's not a Jew," he said, "he's an idiot, a young idiotic kid who wants to be a hero apparently. </sentence><sentence id="1154">Go back to your mother and don't ever leave the house." </sentence><sentence id="1155">And I told my mother this story and of course, she never let me, the last week she never let me leave the place, under no circumstances. </sentence><sentence id="1156">And interestingly, about four, five weeks after we were liberated, I went to the UNRRA, the UNRRA was the U, N, R, R, A, that was the, the joint USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0467 &amp; RG-50.549.05*0001 24 committee of the Jewish Relief and you could go there and you could get some emergency supplies, food supplies, they were bringing them in. </sentence><sentence id="1157">And who was at the door letting people in? </sentence><sentence id="1158">I recognized this man. </sentence><sentence id="1159">And I walked up to him, he had a huge, a big flag emblem on his lapel, the flag of what today is Israel, at that time it was a Zionist emblem. </sentence><sentence id="1160">And I said to him, I said, "Hey, you know, you saved my life?" </sentence><sentence id="1161">And he looked at me, he said, "You too?" </sentence><sentence id="1162">He said, "There were many more." </sentence><sentence id="1163">And turned--he didn't really want me to elaborate or nothing. </sentence><sentence id="1164">And there were many people like this. </sentence><sentence id="1165">Now who they were, I was very curious and I went to find out and most of the people who were doing this were Polish Jews because a lot of them had very fair complexions. </sentence><sentence id="1166">They were blond and blue-eyed and so, and they came to Hungary early, 1939 or so, and in four, five years, they learned enough Hungarian, and good Hungarian so they had very little accent and they could pass as, there were other people in the Arrow Cross movement who had accents, so quite a few of them were in the Arrow Cross movement. </sentence><sentence id="1167">And in the Zionist Underground so, that was a lucky, a lucky accident for me. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1837">Q: And you, during that few months, food was very scarce"? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1839">A: It was, very scarce. </sentence><sentence id="1840">But again, this aunt of ours, of mine, who played such an important role in saving all of us, again, she and I, we teamed up and went, which was very customary then for city people to do, took jewelry and possessions of the family that we thought farmers might like to have and we could put on our body, and walked about, I would say, thirty, forty kilometer, about twenty miles from Budapest, and exchange it for food. </sentence><sentence id="1841">We also hired a person with a horse to drag it back to Budapest. </sentence><sentence id="1842">It was mainly flour, lard, necessities, but of course, a horse was immediately a red flag in, in the eyes of the Russians because they confiscated every horse, everything that could be used for transporting their goods. </sentence><sentence id="1843">And we were caught midway between this place and Budapest, coming back, in a small Danubian village. </sentence><sentence id="1844">On the other side of the Danube, there was a battle going on. </sentence><sentence id="1845">And we knew that it doesn't affect anything, because the Danube is a very wide river and the Germans didn't have any means to get over and why would they come over, but there was a battle over there because Trans-Danubia was not liberated yet. </sentence><sentence id="1846">And so the Russians were very edgy and they USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0467 &amp; RG-50.549.05*0001 35 confiscated the cart, they confiscated the food, they confiscated the horse and then, they also incarcerated my aunt and myself. </sentence><sentence id="1847">And I have no idea what happened, but the next... my aunt was with me in the room and the, the Russian captain came in and took her out and she came back a few hours later and she said, "Don't worry, everything is going to be fine." </sentence><sentence id="1848">And the next morning, we were given back the cart, the horse, the man who was the owner of the horse and cart and the food and everything else and let go. </sentence><sentence id="1849">And I can only guess what was the price. </sentence><sentence id="1850">The only thing I regret is that we heard that after delivering the stuff to our home and sharing it with the family, when the, the farmer whose, who had the horse and the cart went back, eventually, was caught and lost both. </sentence><sentence id="1851">So yes, if you had still some belongings that farmers would appreciate, you could have food. </sentence><sentence id="1852">Because the farmers always have food. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1868">Q: How long did that cartful of food last you? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1870">A: Ah, probably, a few weeks and then, the, the UNRRA, the American Jewish organizations were also sending packages and, and would supply us regularly. </sentence><sentence id="1871">So that helped too. </sentence><sentence id="1872">We were not really, you know, in danger of, of starving to death. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1876">Q: And did you go back to school? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1878">A: Yes, I went back to school, to high school, and eventually finished practically, my high school at the age of eighteen. </sentence><sentence id="1879">And just a few weeks before, practically, of finishing, my Zionist Organization give me signals that it was time to go to Israel because they couldn't guarantee that we would have more time. </sentence><sentence id="1880">The Communist Police was and the border guards were really closing everything very tightly. </sentence><sentence id="1881">So, I, my instructions were to say goodbye to my family and get either an instrument or an instrument case, that was instruction number one. </sentence><sentence id="1882">Then I was called by my Zionist leaders and, and asked if it is true that my mother comes from this northern Hungarian town, I said yes. </sentence><sentence id="1883">They said, "Do us a favor. </sentence><sentence id="1884">Go to that town, introduce yourself as, so they can recognize that you are, your mother is related," and all this and that, "and ask them if they would like to have a high school orchestra to play a concert in town. </sentence><sentence id="1885">And if they say yes," --which probably they would, they said, because which little town doesn't like a free concert-- "go to a printer, here is money and have nice posters printed." </sentence><sentence id="1886">And they give me the date. </sentence><sentence id="1887">I went, I talked to the mayor, he was overwhelmed, I went to the printer, I had all the prints made and I didn't realize at that time that this was the alibi just in case we would be caught because this town is on the way to the border, my mother's birthplace. </sentence><sentence id="1888">On a given day, we boarded the bus, the bus was a state- owned bus by that time from a state-owned company. </sentence><sentence id="1889">We were all either holding an instrument or having an instrument case so people thought this was a high school orchestra and while singing Communist songs, we took off for the border. </sentence><sentence id="1890">On the border, when we got close to this town, we kept on going and the bus driver said that he was hungry, we were hungry too so we stopped in a, in a certain pub or so and this was in 1948, February. </sentence><sentence id="1891">We were eating there and getting something to drink and a woman began to flirt with the bus driver. </sentence><sentence id="1892">And we were horrified because that would, everything would cause a problem, we, we knew that we had a definite plan. </sentence><sentence id="1893">And soon the bus driver said that he would like to take USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0467 &amp; RG-50.549.05*0001 36 about a half an hour rest and my, our leader argued with him but he said, "All right, go." </sentence><sentence id="1894">And as soon as he disappeared, he gathered us and he said, "Go across this field and there is a barn there and don't ask any questions, just get into the barn." </sentence><sentence id="1895">That's what we did. </sentence><sentence id="1896">They closed the barn and around midnight, or so, or later, we were marched down to the Ipoly River which is the river between Czechoslovakia and Hungary and to our great amazement, who was leading us?--the peasant woman who was in the pub. </sentence><sentence id="1897">She shed her twelve skirts or so because those women still wore many, many skirts, this was the, the thing. </sentence><sentence id="1898">Now she had a leather jacket and blue jeans and she spoke Hebrew with our leader. </sentence><sentence id="1899">She was a, an Israeli army officer, born to Hungarian parents who spoke perfect Hungarian and this was her job, to distract. </sentence><sentence id="1900">And she led us down to the river, everything was supposed to happen so that on the other side of the river, this was Czechoslovakia and the reason we had to go to Czechoslovakia and not to Austria because the border between Austria and Hungary was already closed and tightly controlled but the Czechs were still kind of in between this Year of Turn and the Democratic regime that was there before. </sentence><sentence id="1901">The, the end, at the end we crossed the river but instead of getting into the trucks, the border guards stayed and started to talk right there which was odd and very painful because there was snow on the ground. </sentence><sentence id="1902">It was very cold in February, we were wet and we had to lie on the ground for about a half an hour when they finally left. </sentence><sentence id="1903">Then we couldn't find a truck, the truck left, too, who was supposed to wait for us. </sentence><sentence id="1904">So it took us about a half a day to find it and, finally, we were taken to Bratislava, where the gendarmerie was paid off. </sentence><sentence id="1905">We were nominally arrested by the gendarmerie and he put into a warm place in the synagogue, there was straw on the floor, I remember, and the next morning, we were taken to the railroad station, put in boxcarts [sic] and within about a half an hour they opened. </sentence><sentence id="1906">We were in Vienna, in the American section of, of, of Vienna. </sentence><sentence id="1907">At that time, Vienna was divided. </sentence><sentence id="1908">So this was my, my great escape to Israel. </sentence><sentence id="1909">And from there on, of course, we were taken down and eventually ended up in Israel. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1943">Q: You mentioned how you had joined this Zionist organization that you realized that you, you were not really a Hungarian citizen. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1945">A: Right. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1947">Q: Was it the desire to have a place that led you to join the Zionist Organization? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1949">A: Yes. </sentence><sentence id="1950">I mean, they, they, they, I felt that I was among brothers and sisters and I felt--at that time remember it was the last few weeks of the war--that I was, if I fought, I was going to fight for, for the Jewish homeland. </sentence><sentence id="1951">And I already associated myself more with that than with Hungary. </sentence><sentence id="1952">That was, every young person needs a fatherland and that was mine, even though I'd never seen it before. </sentence><sentence id="1953">So, it was an emotional thing and I stayed in Israel for two day, two years. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1959">Q: How did your parents relate to your decision, to... </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1961">A: Of course, they were very, very upset and very sad. </sentence><sentence id="1962">But I said, "You can come and, and join me," you know. </sentence><sentence id="1963">And we agreed that they would but of course, they couldn't, because after   USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0467 &amp; RG-50.549.05*0001 37 we left, it was impossible to, to leave Hungary for awhile. </sentence><sentence id="1964">So, I corresponded and this was, this was one of the reasons why I returned eventually, in 1950 to Hungary, "cause I realized that I needed to make up for the years that my father was away. </sentence><sentence id="1965">So I returned to Hungary and it was the worst of the Stalinist era. </sentence><sentence id="1966">It was like 1984, it was terrible. </sentence></p></dialogue>

[ </sentence><sentence id="2311">talkover] No. </sentence><sentence id="2312">Nobody had any money. </sentence><sentence id="2313">All you did was as a refugee, you appeared at, when, when we finally were picked up and taken to Graz by the Austrian police, they were very well organized there, there, you found every religious denomination having a booth, who welcomed you. </sentence><sentence id="2314">You could go and say that I am a Baptist, I am a Catholic, made no difference and then name the country where you wanted to go to. </sentence><sentence id="2315">And, and it was very simple, you didn't need any money. </sentence><sentence id="2316">Then, next step was each had a place in Austria where they temporarily would house you, even give you a little pocket money and there you waited for your transportation to go to that country. </sentence><sentence id="2317">And that so, I did not really want to be attached to any religious organization so I went to a very independent one called the Tolstoy Foundation. </sentence><sentence id="2318">It was founded by Tolstoy's daughter and, using I think the, the royalties of Tolstoy's books, and so they are the ones who brought me to the U.S. It was all gratis. </sentence><sentence id="2319">I came over, the American military and the Air Force is the one who flew all Hungarian refugees over. </sentence><sentence id="2320">MATS, Military Air Transportation, the, the stewardesses and almost everybody involved with us were of, of Hungarian origin, most of them from Cleveland. </sentence><sentence id="2321">Cleveland is the second largest Hungarian city in the world after USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0467 &amp; RG-50.549.05*0001 43 Budapest. </sentence><sentence id="2322">And, and so here, they then, then I was handed over to a Jewish organization because my cousin came through a Jewish organization. </sentence><sentence id="2323">So in St. Louis they were waiting for me. </sentence><sentence id="2324">If you were a Hungarian refugee those days, you had no problem because the world, the whole world felt very guilty about not helping the Revolution and so they did everything possible. </sentence><sentence id="2325">I mean I was so embarrassed. </sentence><sentence id="2326">I never, I was never in my life treated this way, I thought, you know, I was some dignitary or something. </sentence><sentence id="2327">They were waiting for me at the airport and I was just... But first I had to spend, like most Hungarians, some time at Camp Kilmer in New Jersey which was a screening camp for people. </sentence><sentence id="2328">They screened out the sick, the U.S. did not take, I think, people with TB and some other illnesses, they went to Scandinavia, the Swedes did, and also Communist Party members and such. </sentence><sentence id="2329">I don't know what the criteria was, but they looked into your background a little bit. </sentence><sentence id="2330">And so this is how I ended up in St. Louis. </sentence><sentence id="2331">My cousin stayed with me for about no more than two months, not even that much. </sentence><sentence id="2332">He found some relatives in Chicago who would help him to go to Champagne, the University of Illinois, and he just left. </sentence><sentence id="2333">And we were housed, we were taken by an American family who had very good intentions but the man was a manic depressive so you could never figure out for one second to another how he would react to you. </sentence><sentence id="2334">And, apparently, his wife felt that maybe taking Hungarian refugees in would, would somehow remedy the problem but it didn't. </sentence><sentence id="2335">And they had a mentally retarded child, so it was not a very ideal situation for a newcomer although she was very nice to me and I stayed there for a few months and then eventually, I met a professor of Hungarian ancestry and origin at the University of, Washington University in St. Louis who had in Aspen, Colorado, a house, and he and his family spent every summer there because he was a member of the music festival. </sentence><sentence id="2336">And when they heard... I hated St. Louis, I just couldn't find anything redeeming about that, that city, and when they heard that I was very unhappy and all this, they took me to Aspen, Colorado and they said, "You can always work here for a dollar an hour, too." </sentence><sentence id="2337">And I loved it. </sentence><sentence id="2338">I stayed there for almost three years. </sentence><sentence id="2339">And most of my friends and connections and everything in my American life practically comes from that period. </sentence><sentence id="2340">From my Aspen period, people who helped me to get ahead in, in more ways than one. </sentence><sentence id="2341">So, I am, I was very lucky again to end up there. </sentence><sentence id="2342">Of course, those days Aspen was not what it is today, you know. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2776">A: Well, when I met my friends after the war, number one, we were so full of hatred, we were looking for some kind of an outlet, some organization that we can join, and we found it. </sentence><sentence id="2777">And part of it was they give away shirts, we found a Communist Party. </sentence><sentence id="2778">Imagine, we were fifteen year olds and we saw that people were walking around in red, flaming red shirts. </sentence><sentence id="2779">And we found out that the flaming red shirts come from parachutes and these parachutes were supply parachutes that were dropped by the Soviet forces and the Hungarians got the material and the Communist Party made a kind of a campaign and made it into shirts and would give them to anybody who signed up. </sentence><sentence id="2780">And I think this drew us a lot more than anything else, the four very close friends of mine, whom I knew from the illegal boy scout organization and, luckily, we all survived, we all went and signed up with the Communist Party and I think this is the first, or almost the last time, I ever went to the Party because, now we went to a couple of meetings and we were just bored to death, this happened to American communists, too. </sentence><sentence id="2781">Signed up or something, I mean it was the most boring thing, so we never really considered ourself truly Communist Party members because we were, I think, members for a month and then we never paid any fees or we didn't do anything after that, but this was, our first step was to go down to the Communist Party headquarters and sign up with the Communist   USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0467 &amp; RG-50.549.05*0001 52 Party, which was understandable because we felt that the Communist Party was going to be the one that revenges all these atrocities and whatever happened, and then we saw that almost everybody who was in the Arrow Cross movement is also in the Communist Party because people easily turned, that's obvious, you know, a lot of books and essays were written about how anybody who is an extremist in one way can become the extremist in--on the other side. </sentence><sentence id="2782">So we found that and that was disgusting, absolutely. </sentence><sentence id="2783">And the Communist Party knew about it and they defended it and we didn't like that, their terminology, and so we quit. </sentence><sentence id="2784">So then we went back to, and kind of regrouped as old boy scouts. </sentence><sentence id="2785">But our heart was not in it because now, I mean for so many years we could not do anything as boy scouts except go out and hike in nature, we couldn't even wear a kerchief. </sentence><sentence id="2786">And so now we could wear a uniform and some of us really bought a uniform, and then we just, we just lost completely our lust for boy scout life and that didn't work. </sentence><sentence id="2787">Then, you know, this was, another year went by and I, of the four, I broke away from the other four and I joined the Zionists. </sentence><sentence id="2788">They just, there were a lot of things that appealed to me, the fact that, finally, I am going to have a homeland, finally, I am going to have a passport, there was adventure. </sentence><sentence id="2789">Immediately, they send me up in the mountains and I had to go through a certain instruction, more than one, on more than one occasion. </sentence><sentence id="2790">And they, I advanced, I was pretty eager and good at learning things, and I became a youth leader in the movement and I loved to be with young people. </sentence><sentence id="2791">And so that, to me, was a, was a very happy period of my life. </sentence><sentence id="2792">My only conflict was with my parents. </sentence><sentence id="2793">Since I was an only child, of course, they wanted me around as much as possible, and I reached that rebellious teenage period, I was not too rebellious, but rebellious enough to move out of the house at sixteen and go to a Zionist children's home where first I was just a, a resident and I liked being with my peer group. </sentence><sentence id="2794">There were many, there were many in Hungary, a lot of the survivors, young people of my age, just chose this as a lifestyle. </sentence><sentence id="2795">And what we were doing there, we received a lot of instructions in agriculture, in the language, Hebrew language, in Jewish history, to prepare us when we go to Israel. </sentence><sentence id="2796">And my parents, of course, didn't like for me being away at sixteen and I felt really sorry for them and once the rebellious period ended, in about a half a year or so, I moved back home and one of the reasons was that life was too free on these, it was the perfect kind of thesis, anti-thesis, that we were so restricted, now everything was free, I mean, and I was a little bit of a, I was a strange kid because I didn't grow up very quickly to become a man, and I did not like the fact that here were girls of my age who wanted to sleep with me and all this and that, I just, I always pictured myself more of a, an individual, a man who has things to do and I don't, I'm not going to spend a lot of time with, with sex and all this and my mind was not only on just women, let's put it this way, even though I already had sexual experiences and the whole, and because of this, they considered me a little bit of an eccentric so that happy, I moved back home to satisfy my parents, but I didn't stay there long enough because I got an offer at the age of seventeen to go and be a resident advisor in a home for Jewish orphans. </sentence><sentence id="2797">That was on, it was called Tarogato Street in the Buda section of Budapest where I found a man who became a very good friend of mine, the man who led the institution, a marvelous man, also a Zionist, by the name of Spitzer* and his family, and they were very good to me and I felt very much at home, plus I got a nice salary and all my needs were taken care of 4 First name: Imre    USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0467 &amp; RG-50.549.05*0001 53 there. </sentence><sentence id="2798">Even I had a girlfriend who was also a resident counselor there, so happy, really, they were very happy days. </sentence><sentence id="2799">And in the meantime, I also participated very actively in, I changed organizations and left, I was in a, I would say, kind of a petit bourgeois Zionist group and I went over to the Marxists because that suited my philosophy a lot more and I stayed with them and eventually they were the ones that helped me to then immigrate to Israel, that was after, but we'll get to this. </sentence><sentence id="2800">Now I want to talk just a little bit about school because all these times I went to school, too. </sentence><sentence id="2801">Right after the, 1945, as soon as the school started, my mother was determined that I should go to the School of Commerce, the high schools were specialized, and there was one that was called, the Special High School for Commerce. </sentence><sentence id="2802">Can you stop it for a second because I want to close the window. </sentence><sentence id="2803">So as I said, my mother was determined that I should go there, of course, I had no desire but I was still a good boy and I started at that school and the fact that it was the middle of the year, basically, and I missed the first half of a year wasn't a big problem because anybody who was a, a Holocaust survivor at that time can just about do anything. </sentence><sentence id="2804">So this was no big problem, the big problem came when I noticed how many of my teachers are outright anti-American, anti- Russian, anti-Semitic, they haven't changed their attitude and there were some other Jewish kids in that school and I got together with them and I asked them if, if we should tolerate this, if they think this is correct and everybody was kind of lying low, the usual way, and I said, "No, I am not going to do that." </sentence><sentence id="2805">There was specifically one teacher who had, I forgot, had a German name, a very small man who not only was anti-Semitic and anti-Russian and anti-everything and very pro-German, but agitating. </sentence><sentence id="2806">He was not just making statements, he was really agitating and in a very emotional way and I was, I just, I reached a point where I just couldn't take it anymore, not after what happened, just, you know, in the last few years and my boy scout commander, and at that time I was still kind of hanging on with the boy scout movement, my boy scout commander was now a member of the new Hungarian Secret Police and he was an officer and he escaped from the labor camp and went over to the Russians and all this and came back with the Russian troops already and was one of the organizers. </sentence><sentence id="2807">And I went to see him and I said, "This man should be removed from the school." </sentence><sentence id="2808">And they did take him in and somehow they went down the list at school and found out that I was the one who reported him because it was obvious since I was constantly arguing with him, arguing with him in class and so. . </sentence><sentence id="2809">.End of Tape 5, Side A    USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0467 &amp;

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2845">Q: Okay, this is tape one, side B of an interview with Robert Holczer. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2847">A: I just had to quit. </sentence><sentence id="2848">And then I continued my studies, I did not want to have the same experience again and I went to the Jewish, the Jewish rabbi school, really, what it was, it was a school to educate future teachers, but it was a high school still. </sentence><sentence id="2849">Just like my previous high school was specialized for commercial jobs, this one was, basically, a teaching gymnasium, a teaching high school, which meant by the laws of Hungary at that time that once you finished--and it was instead of four, five classes, so you were nineteen when you finished the school--you were then an elementary school teacher at the age of nineteen without any college education. </sentence><sentence id="2850">I was there at this school and, of course, as far as any kind of a bad experience, I didn't have any. </sentence><sentence id="2851">Now I was among my own people, there were some very, very good friends, I liked the school, it was nothing special, it was not challenging me, the only aspect most of us didn't like is the religious aspect, which we didn't take very seriously. </sentence><sentence id="2852">So actually, I was still in that school in my eighteenth year when eventually, and we will go back to this, I emigrated, emigrated to Israel, and so I never really finished my high school. </sentence><sentence id="2853">But out of deference to what happened and all this, I got a diploma. </sentence><sentence id="2854">So I had a high school diploma which, of course, my parents got later because I needed one and... so these are the two schools. </sentence><sentence id="2855">Once I reached this level of the, this, the Jewish teaching high school for, high school for future teachers, whatever, it's very difficult to translate into English, perhaps Lyceum is a good name for it, once I reached that, then as far as my experiences after the Holocaust, there was no problem, you know, it's obvious. </sentence><sentence id="2856">Now, going back, of course in the meantime, in the Zionist movement, a lot of changes took place because we had to go practically underground. </sentence><sentence id="2857">As the communist regime established itself in Hungary and in 1948 the famous turn, Year of the Turn came about, which happened in every Eastern European country, and the Year of the Turn is an expression when the communists took control, complete power, because until 1948, we had democracy in Eastern Europe, those countries that knew what democracy was. </sentence><sentence id="2858">And Hungary had some very able politicians and was really on its road to become a democracy, so was Czechoslovakia, and probably Poland, too, of course, Romania was very different. </sentence><sentence id="2859">But, in 1948, everything has changed, we became, again, just like with the illegal boy scout group before 1945, I found myself belonging to an illegal organization, Zionism was outlawed because all of a sudden Stalin and company found Zionism, of course, a tool of the imperialists as they called it. </sentence><sentence id="2860">So we were doing, basically, the same things that we were doing before, but now very cautiously, illegally, and meetings were held usually either in some far away synagogues, basements or in some Jewish orphanages where it was not very obvious if, let's say, twenty, thirty people came in and out because there were hundreds of people living there anyway. </sentence><sentence id="2861">The, many times we paraded as young communists, if we wanted to have a larger meeting somewhere, singing communist songs when somebody came by, but otherwise doing our own business. </sentence><sentence id="2862">By 1949, early 1949, the situation almost was intolerable and, basically, they wanted to have the whole Zionist movement leave, not the communists, but the Zionist movement wanted to get as many people out as possible, fearing that if Czechoslovakia is going to turn also completely communist, that there will be no way from Hungary to go anywhere. </sentence><sentence id="2863">By that USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0467 &amp; RG-50.549.05*0001 55 time we could only go illegally across the border. </sentence><sentence id="2864">And I think it was in February, 1949, that I got an order from my Zionist leadership to go to a little northern town, Vacz, V-A-C-Z, my mother comes from that town and they knew it. </sentence><sentence id="2865">My job was to go to the mayor of the town and ask him if he would like to have a high school orchestra give a, an evening concert on some given date. </sentence><sentence id="2866">I went there, I mentioned to the mayor that I had been to Vacz many, many times because my grandparents, cousins, aunts, I had a lot of relatives and my mother was born here, and of course, he was overwhelmed that a high school orchestra is coming to play. </sentence><sentence id="2867">I then went to a printer, this was one of my instructions, and had all kinds of posters printed advertising the date and the concert. </sentence><sentence id="2868">Went back, reported it and the next command was that on a certain day, I would have to go with an instrument or with an instrument case to a comer of Budapest and there would be a bus there, a state bus, by that time every bus company was nationalized, and I have to board the bus with a lot of other people and I have to pretend that I am a member of a high school band, whatever instrument I am playing, and do, not to talk about anything, Zionism or Israel, anything like that. </sentence><sentence id="2869">And just wait for further instructions there. </sentence><sentence id="2870">And of course, I was notified that this is it, that we would be going to Israel and I bid farewell to my family and got an instrument case, boarded the bus on a certain date and time and I saw all my fellow Zionist members, the ones who were in my group, and we started toward the Czechoslovakian border. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2896">Q: Can I ask a few questions before we go on? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2898">A: Yes. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2900">Q: I wanted to, I'm interested in hearing how you felt about Marxism, why it was that Marxism appealed to you as far as the type of Zionist organization that you were involved in and hearing a little bit more about how you felt about the politics of the time and the communist takeover. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2902">A: I had very ambivalent feelings like a lot of those Jews who did not come from the upper middle class or upper class. </sentence><sentence id="2903">I came from definitely no better than the middle of the middle class or rather, perhaps, the lower middle class. </sentence><sentence id="2904">My father came from a very low class proletarian family which was very unusual among the Jews of Hungary. </sentence><sentence id="2905">My mother came from a little petit bourgeois family from the northern Hungarian town. </sentence><sentence id="2906">They thought they were middle class, but it depends on how you classify this, as far as I'm concerned they were kind of a pseudo-petit bourgeois people, the kind who, it's very difficult to define them, but there was not much work and a lot of complaining. </sentence><sentence id="2907">Now, because I never had a very, let's say satisfactory and wealthy life, naturally I had some sympathies with, with the Marxist movement, it's obvious. </sentence><sentence id="2908">Second, I had a very definite sympathy with them because they were the most adamant about taking the war criminals and punish them. </sentence><sentence id="2909">They were the most anti-fascist and all these things appealed to me. </sentence><sentence id="2910">I was, you can consider even though I was not a member, really after my one month experience, I was not a member, at least I didn't consider myself a member of the Communist Party, but I certainly was sympathizing with a lot of their goals, even though I was in a completely different game by that time, knowing I would go to Israel. </sentence><sentence id="2911">But, this is probably why I changed my affiliation and went from a USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0467 &amp; RG-50.549.05*0001 56 bourgeoisie Zionist organization to a Marxist Zionist organization where I felt very much at home. </sentence><sentence id="2912">And there were, of course, ugly things happening, the communist takeover in Eastern Europe was not a very pleasant occasion. </sentence><sentence id="2913">And one only had to think a little bit clearly and rise above all this emotion to see that the communists used very nasty methods to eliminate anyone who disagreed with them. </sentence><sentence id="2914">And the more power they grabbed, the more vicious they became. </sentence><sentence id="2915">And of course, eventually I, the Zionists suffered more what anybody who was considered a Zionist or anybody, like my father, who could have been executed if they discovered that he was with Tito, so if you were an enemy for one reason or another, there was no law. </sentence><sentence id="2916">The communists created their own laws, the secret police had free hand and, of course, I began to become very disappointed in that. </sentence><sentence id="2917">My father, he was always a Social Democrat, and he never, never approved what the Communist Party was doing in Hungary. </sentence><sentence id="2918">And he was very courageous because when the Communist Party gobbled up the Social Democratic Party, he sent in a postcard and said, "Excuse me, but I don't want to join you." </sentence><sentence id="2919">Which was very courageous because from there on, you could have been watched. </sentence><sentence id="2920">The fact that he comes from a working class and was a very little fish, I think saved his life. </sentence><sentence id="2921">But if he had been a name, probably he would have been killed then. </sentence><sentence id="2922">And so, politics, yes, I kept my eye on politics all the time and this helped me in 1949 to just go, because I figured there will never be peace here, there will never be peace here. </sentence><sentence id="2923">And, do you have any other questions? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2947">Q: Mmm-hmm. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2949">A: Okay. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2951">Q: As far as, you had mentioned that there were some serious anti-Semitic incidents at your school and I am wondering if you had any expectations after the war was over that some of that would be ameliorated and that anti-Semitism was not going to be as much of a problem any more? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2953">A: Yes, I was very naive, really, at the age of fifteen, for some reason, I thought that a better world is coming. </sentence><sentence id="2954">And I was deeply disappointed when I heard that there were even pogroms in the countryside where a few Jews dared to come back to a village or a town in Hungary, in Poland, in Slovakia, I think the Czechs were the only ones who acted in a very civilized way, but then they were always civilized and the most civilized in Eastern Europe. </sentence><sentence id="2955">That disappointed me, people were killed, survived Auschwitz, came home and killed in a pogrom in Hungary and in some other Eastern European countries, two years after the war. </sentence><sentence id="2956">And that made me very bitter and my idealism and my naivete really evaporated. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2961">Q: Did you experience anything directly, any anti-Semitic incidents? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2963">A: I have not been directly in an anti-Semitic incidence because I avoided, I avoided them, I avoided any kind of such thing. </sentence><sentence id="2964">I associated mainly with my own kind because I saw that there is no hope. </sentence><sentence id="2965">Now, this interestingly must have changed to a certain extent because almost every one of my cousins is married to a gentile in Hungary, I think with the exception of maybe two, but every one of them, and the marriages are very solid. </sentence><sentence id="2966">So I, and it's not, USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0467 &amp; RG-50.549.05*0001 57 they are still not what you would call a truly middle class family, that most of them still stayed in, you know, auto mechanics and this and that, that part. </sentence><sentence id="2967">Now, the ones who are up there, went to college and became dentists and those, they are all married to other Jews. </sentence><sentence id="2968">It's a very interesting phenomenon. </sentence><sentence id="2969">But I have not experienced anything except when, right after the war at school. </sentence><sentence id="2970">Okay? </sentence><sentence id="2971">I heard people constantly yelling anti-Semitic slogans, especially at soccer games, but I knew that I can't expect anything else any more. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2986">Q: And you, when you joined the Zionist organization, did you have, did you really have dreams of being in Israel, or that this, that this was something that you felt very strongly about? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2988">A: Yes, I had dreams and that was probably a, a, just a marvelous high of my youth. </sentence><sentence id="2989">The whole, the Zionists did a, a fantastic job in catching the spirit of young people and really giving us what we wanted to have. </sentence><sentence id="2990">We had a relatively free life, we had, we had a picture of a heroic future for us, whether we are going to be still serving in the army in Israel or just working in a kibbutz as farmers, almost everything about it had a kind of a super human touch that I'm going to be better than all these people around here who are running around like ants on the cities of Budapest, I'm going to lead a very healthy life, and finally I'm going to have a country, I have a home, I will have a fatherland and it was, it was a marvelous feeling. </sentence><sentence id="2991">And also, the whole, the whole setup, the whole organization, you know, until then, until 1946 or so, most of the picture that we saw of Jewish people is, is like sheep going into Auschwitz. </sentence><sentence id="2992">And all of a sudden these people come from Israel, they are beautiful looking people. </sentence><sentence id="2993">And not only that, they had courage, the way they carried themselves and they were teaching us a lot of things, you know, Israel sent a lot of, they called them Schliahs, people that, those who are sent, I think, literally. </sentence><sentence id="2994">And they were in charge of all these camps where we had to go to where we were taught self-defense and, you know, we lived on a tree in one camp, I think what, for forty-eight hours, we were given a piece of rope and a knife and we had to stay up, and sleep up there and make our bed and all this. </sentence><sentence id="2995">I mean, which young person doesn't like this? </sentence><sentence id="2996">The whole image of the Jew has changed in our mind and we said, "God, it's beautiful." </sentence><sentence id="2997">And when we were in danger, they were the ones who led us out of danger. </sentence><sentence id="2998">I remember once I was up in the Berzseny mountains in Hungary in a self-defense camp for a week and somebody betrayed us to the police and the police surrounded us and there was a creek, not deeper, I don't think it was deeper than maybe twenty inches, and guess who is the one who escaped from the creek in order to do something, not to save his own skin, but he was immediately telephoning and all this and that and eventually we were released. </sentence><sentence id="2999">The Israeli whatever, diplomat, I can't call them, the diplomat is not the right word because you picture somebody, you know, with a tie and suit and all this, but they were just, I, messengers or whatever, leaders. </sentence><sentence id="3000">And he escaped, he escaped in that creek, crawling in twenty inch of water, you know, getting on something that blend in with the, with the rocks, I mean they were unbelievable, unbelievable people. </sentence><sentence id="3001">And women, you know, it's, it's, okay, after them the women came and, I mean this is a completely different Jew. </sentence><sentence id="3002">I mean, and when I took my wife to Israel, she understood that, that there was just something about those kids. </sentence><sentence id="3003">And so this, this, of course, was, they were idols and it was very easy to follow them. </sentence><sentence id="3004">And they were, they were not really demagogues, I remember quite a few of them who got   USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0467 &amp; RG-50.549.05*0001 58 quite introverted, they were not giving you big speeches or something, but by personal example, they were leaders because we followed them. </sentence><sentence id="3005">So the, the bus going back to my escape from Hungary, the bus eventually reached Vacz and, needless to say, it didn't stop there. </sentence><sentence id="3006">Beyond Vacz, it became quite dark and our leader suggested to the bus driver that we stop somewhere and eat and there was a roadside pub where they also served food. </sentence><sentence id="3007">We went in and we were given money and we could order something, and in that pub, there was a very beautiful peasant woman, with I don't know how many skirts on her, this was the reason you recognize a peasant woman, in those days they still wore a lot of skirts, you know, that's an Eastern European costume that a dozen skirts is no big deal. </sentence><sentence id="3008">And she started to flirt with the bus driver. </sentence><sentence id="3009">And soon the bus driver came, went over to her table, and they had a good time and, of course, we were getting more and more anxious that this is going to create a big problem here, right? </sentence><sentence id="3010">We knew that we were on a timetable. </sentence><sentence id="3011">All of a sudden, the bus driver said to our leader, "How long do you think we will be here?" </sentence><sentence id="3012">And our leader said, "Well, all these kids eat, oh, a half an hour, forty-five minutes." </sentence><sentence id="3013">He said, "Good, I'll be back." </sentence><sentence id="3014">and left with the woman. </sentence><sentence id="3015">We ate, and our leader said, "Okay, line up outside." </sentence><sentence id="3016">And instead of going back to the bus, he led us down on a field into a big barn, I would say about one mile down in a muddy field, it was February and snow and mud everywhere. </sentence><sentence id="3017">We all got into the barn, about thirty of us, they closed the doors, barn doors, and he said, "Okay, don't worry. </sentence><sentence id="3018">Everything will be okay." </sentence><sentence id="3019">After midnight, 1:00 or so, the barn door opened and we were, they said we have to get on line and marched down, there was the river Ipoly, I-P-O-L-Y, and that was the border between Hungary and Czechoslovakia. </sentence><sentence id="3020">The Austrian border was already sealed, but the Czechs still let Zionist groups come over, it was kind of an arrangement, the Joint did it for a lot of money, however, they didn't know which border, Czech border guard was a communist or not, so we have to be very careful. </sentence><sentence id="3021">And once we went beyond the border guards, everything was organized there, I will go back to this. </sentence><sentence id="3022">So as we were marching down, I saw a woman in a leather jacket with a revolver hanging on her hip in blue jeans. </sentence><sentence id="3023">I looked at this woman's face, said, "Hey, I have seen her before." </sentence><sentence id="3024">And I looked and said, "This is the woman in the pub." </sentence><sentence id="3025">This is to show you how organized they were. </sentence><sentence id="3026">I mean, the Germans couldn't have done better, really, with their devilish organization. </sentence><sentence id="3027">I mean, everything, if you understood the whole, they called it aliyah, the going of, to Israel. </sentence><sentence id="3028">If you understood that, how they did it, you can understand how they could survive. </sentence><sentence id="3029">All right? </sentence><sentence id="3030">Surrounded by, of course, a sea of enemies. </sentence><sentence id="3031">Once we got down to the river, we had to take our shoes off, and we kept everything on our head, the river was not high enough, we couldn't swim, so we had to walk, but I was very small, and it got to my throat at one time. </sentence><sentence id="3032">Now this is February, imagine. </sentence><sentence id="3033">We got over to the other side and it was supposed to be that the border guards change, everything was according to the clock, and something happened and the border guards did not change the way they were supposed to, they were still talking to each other. </sentence><sentence id="3034">There was snow on the ground and the dogs, their dogs were barking, so we had to lie down on the snow for about a half an hour, wet. </sentence><sentence id="3035">And many of us got sick, right there. </sentence><sentence id="3036">I myself, I lost, I got frostbitten and even today I suffer for that. </sentence><sentence id="3037">Now, then the border guards finally were gone and we went up, there was a house where they used to press grapes, it was a grape growing region, but had no roof and the wind was blowing and I remember, I don't think I have ever been colder in my life since then. </sentence><sentence id="3038">And so we huddled together because now we missed the truck that was supposed to pick us up right down on a highway    USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0467 &amp; RG-50.549.05*0001 59 beyond that hill, so the Israelis, the two Israelis, a man and a woman who were leading us, they went down and eventually, in about four or five hours, they located the truck, the truck came back, the truck was looking for us and then left and then, anyway the truck came back, we got up on the truck, the canvas, the top was taken down, and from there on, all we heard was the engine of the truck was occasionally, when they were halted and the word dollar, the word dollar came back all the time, I remember that. </sentence><sentence id="3039">End of Tape 5, Side B    USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0467 &amp; RG-50.549.05*0001 60 Tape 6, Side A </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3093">Q: This is tape two, side A, of an interview with Robert Holczer. </sentence><sentence id="3094">So you'll say something about the group of people that you were with. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3097">A: I, my best friend in that group was a young man by the name of Zev Rotics. </sentence><sentence id="3098">He lives in Israel at this time still, in Haifa, at Rehov Shunamit 14, and we correspond monthly, we have been ever since, ever since that time, and eventually when I left Israel, we corresponded, we kept up and I consider him my best friend. </sentence><sentence id="3099">He's about the only person I keep up with. </sentence><sentence id="3100">Oh no, there was one, another, a man by the name of Nissan Meschel, and I have no, he is in touch with my friend, Zev Rotics, but I lost touch with him, so I have no idea what happened, I just know that he's living there. </sentence><sentence id="3101">But the others, the, I remember one young lady who was with us and she, unfortunately, had eventually pneumonia when we got to Vienna, which I will go back to when I continue the story of the journey, and died in Vienna of pneumonia, and she's buried there somewhere in the cemetery and I always planned to go and visit her, but I always run out of time and I don't know where she is buried, probably there is no more than one Jewish cemetery, so when I go back to Israel I'm going to find out because my wife... Zev Rotics, sometimes he goes to the meetings of our old friends and so he would know. </sentence><sentence id="3102">Now, after the truck finally stopped in Bratislava. </sentence><sentence id="3103">In Bratislava they took us to the gendarmerie where, as a formality, we were arrested, and interned in the synagogue, they took us to the synagogue that had already warm rooms, straw on the floor, blankets, good food, everything, and we were told that next morning we are going on. </sentence><sentence id="3104">And it was very strange because next morning, again, the gendarmerie surrounded the synagogue, it was a big show, of course, all just in case some Soviet authority is watching. </sentence><sentence id="3105">And they took us to the railroad station where we were taken in boxcars, how interesting, locked up, quite a few people in boxcars, and the train started and I think within an hour or so, they opened up and we were in the American sector of Vienna. </sentence><sentence id="3106">Because Bratislava is very close to Vienna. </sentence><sentence id="3107">We stayed in Vienna for, I think, two, one or two weeks, and in an American hospital, that's where the Joint somehow got an American hospital for the Zionist members and we were all there and we were given good food and warm rooms and it was very pleasant, the only thing we were always warmed about, not to ever wander into the Soviet section. </sentence><sentence id="3108">We were free to wander around, the city was still divided into four sections, American, British, French and Soviet. </sentence><sentence id="3109">And sometimes we had to go very close to the Soviet section in going to, I remember going to a swimming pool, it was on the edge, and so everybody was nervous. </sentence><sentence id="3110">But, basically, it was a good time. </sentence><sentence id="3111">Vienna was full of refugees, full of life. </sentence><sentence id="3112">After one week or so, then we were taken across, again by trucks, across the Alps into, no I have to correct myself, to, not to Austria, to a, a, a UNRRA camp, UNRRA was the United Nations Refugee Association or something, so the joint gave us temporarily over to UNRRA and we were housed in a beautiful area of the Alps in a town called Zaalfelden. </sentence><sentence id="3113">It is a, on a lake, just the other side from Germany, and there were some very picturesque villages nearby, and I remember even though here the food was very meager and we still were hiking almost every day and going up in the mountains, and I remember that just above our camp, our refugee camp, there was a place, a mountain hut where Hitler and Mussolini met and we had to see it and sometimes a cabbage soup a day just didn't give us enough energy, but we were still USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0467 &amp; RG-50.549.05*0001 61 pushing for it, we wanted to see it. </sentence><sentence id="3114">We stayed here, again, one or two weeks and then on, again, now over the border to Italy. </sentence><sentence id="3115">In Italy, they took us again to the train station, somewhere in northern Italy, and the train then was closed up and sealed, but regular train, we just could not leave the train, Italian detectives were on the train to make sure that nobody escapes because it was ridiculous because who wants to escape to Italy, at least at that time? </sentence><sentence id="3116">And we were taken down to Bari. </sentence><sentence id="3117">Now, the only thing that stands out in my mind was that a lot of times when the train stopped, we, of course, rolled the windows down and the good looking girls among us ended up with dozens of pictures from Italian men, written on it, I love you, I'm going to marry you and all this, by the time we got to Bari, I think the girls were exchanging pictures and who wanted this one and this one? </sentence><sentence id="3118">I mean it was a funny thing to see that those men were really just instantly falling in love with these girls. </sentence><sentence id="3119">In Bari, a ship was waiting for us, if you could call it a ship. </sentence><sentence id="3120">It was called the Galil, Galilea or Galilee, I forgot exactly, and so we boarded the ship and in two days or three days, it must have been three I think, we were going to reach Haifa. </sentence><sentence id="3121">Everybody got sea sick, the boat was an old, old fishing boat that the Israeli government brought from, bought from Greece and it was a primitive thing, very primitive. </sentence><sentence id="3122">And I know I have a very strong will and I don't want to, you know, go back to that, to the story, but I never throw up, somehow I just psych myself up ever since I was a little kid as a result of an incident that I would not throw up. </sentence><sentence id="3123">And I remember I was the only one on the ship who could eat. </sentence><sentence id="3124">Everybody else was just constantly throwing up and so we arrived, by the time we arrived in Haifa, everybody was just yellow and green and wouldn't want to look at food. </sentence><sentence id="3125">Now, the funny thing about this ship is that a few years ago I was travelling in France with my wife and we stopped in the Loire valley in a small little town, Blois, and as we were walking in the town there was a kind of a summer suit that I wanted to buy, it was very inexpensive and I needed a summer suit for wearing on some occasion that I have to wear a suit and I went into the shop and I was trying on the suit when the owner of the shop all of a sudden yelled and said, "Shalom haver." </sentence><sentence id="3126">And it appears he was talking to my wife and somehow it came that he was a Moroccan Jew and he was telling, I think, my wife that he was a Moroccan Jew and all this, because he had a definite Arabic name. </sentence><sentence id="3127">And so my wife, I think, told him that I was Jewish, too you know, and this, so he invited us after the deal--which was a good one--he invited us to a bar down on the street, an outdoor cafe, to drink something with him. </sentence><sentence id="3128">And during the conversation he asked me a little bit about my life and he said to, and I asked him and he said, "Oh, I was in Israel, I was a sailor." </sentence><sentence id="3129">I said, "Where did you sail?" </sentence><sentence id="3130">He said, In the Mediterranean, of course," and I said, ""What ship?" </sentence><sentence id="3131">He said, "The Galilea." " </sentence><sentence id="3132">What time?" </sentence><sentence id="3133">He said, "From 1948 to 1950 something." </sentence><sentence id="3134">Well, he was on that ship, you know, and I mean it was a small ship and he was one of the sailors. </sentence><sentence id="3135">Well, when we arrived in Haifa, of course, that was a very emotional scene and then eventually, the war, basically, was finished and there was no temporary animosity so then we, our movement went to a kibbutz there where we then blended in and one year after we were taught a trade in the kibbutz and we got our own land then. </sentence><sentence id="3136">I don't know what else you want to know about the Israeli thing. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3178">Q: Everyone from your group then who was travelling together went to the same kibbutz? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3180">A: Yes, everyone went to the same kibbutz except the ones who did not want to go to the USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0467 &amp; RG-50.549.05*0001 62 kibbutz, had relatives who were waiting for them and this was a little bit of a disappointment to us because theoretically, everybody was supposed to stay together, but this was not the case. </sentence><sentence id="3181">There were, not everybody wants to live in a kibbutz because it is a very difficult living for those who dream of money and wealth and their own car and all this because it's a, at that time it was a very perfect community, but it was a community, you didn't have a great deal that you owned at all, you know, you were lucky if you had a radio that you can call your own. </sentence><sentence id="3182">So we lost, I would say, about one-third of our group who had planned, but not shared their plan with us, to go immediately and stay on the outside. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3187">Q: How was it decided that your group would go to a kibbutz, was it decided communally among the group or did someone else decide it for you? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3189">A: All Zionist youth organizations basically, with very little exception, very few exceptions, were geared toward the kibbutz. </sentence><sentence id="3190">This was an understanding back in Eastern Europe where we were recruited that Israel, and they always brought the example of the pyramid, that the, we Jews, we always like a pyramid on the top, we had all the, the farmers, and down at the bottom where the pyramid is the largest, we had all the intellectuals, and Israel needed a pyramid upside down, where the largest group is going to be the farmers and the agricultural group, and the smallest one is going to be the intellectuals, the tip of the pyramid. </sentence><sentence id="3191">So almost every Zionist organization, that was the very strong influence and educational goal to teach you to go and be a farmer in a collective, you know? </sentence><sentence id="3192">So that was the reason why most of us did go to a kibbutz. </sentence><sentence id="3193">And who decided it? </sentence><sentence id="3194">It was decided above, that had nothing to do with us, where we would go, we were assigned to an old kibbutz, very old, experienced, large kibbutz, called Givat Chajim, in Israel which is in, about midway between Haifa and Tel Aviv and this is where we learned our trade for one year, we stayed there for one year. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3201">Q: Did you speak any Hebrew at all? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3203">A: We did not speak any Hebrew when we arrived there, most of us didn't speak any Hebrew, except the ones who came from very religious families. </sentence><sentence id="3204">They knew quite a bit and for them it was much easier to learn, we spoke no Yiddish because Hungarians do not speak, Hungarian Jews, very few Hungarian Jews speak Yiddish, and so at first we felt a little bit kind of ostracized by the community, especially the young Israeli kids. </sentence><sentence id="3205">There were so many Hungarians coming in at that time that the Hungarians even had a nickname in Israel, they were called Igen-Migen, Igen means yes in Hungarian and so kids would go after us on the street and call us Igen-Migen, Igen-Migen, because they heard us speak. </sentence><sentence id="3206">And so we were in a big hurry to learn Hebrew. </sentence><sentence id="3207">And then when we learned Hebrew, we had another thing, the Hungarian language is such that your accent stays with you no matter what language you learn, and so we had a very thick accent, even when we were speaking Hebrew, so we had our difficulties with the language, but most of us learned it eventually. </sentence><sentence id="3208">I was there in Israel for two years and by the time I came home, I was really speaking fluently. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3215">Q: What trade did you learn on this kibbutz? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="3217">   USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0467 &amp; RG-50.549.05*0001 63 </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3218">A: Okay, I was a tractor driver in the kibbutz and worked out plowing everything connected with the tractor, it was called a Falha, that particular branch, and from sacking, you know, flours and up to plowing and then seeding and cultivating, we had, we did everything. </sentence><sentence id="3219">Then we got our own land, own piece of land, which was a reclaimed area on the train line between Tel Aviv and Haifa, it was the, the, the Israel and Jordan swapped land and so Jordan give back a piece of land so the train service can go from Tel Aviv to Haifa because part of the train line was in Jordan. </sentence><sentence id="3220">This was the land that we received, and it was a very dangerous place, so when we, the first day we went out there, I remember, was really hair raising because the tractor drivers had to go down and plow and the, the weed in Israel is much higher than a human being and also we didn't know where the mines, if there were any mines. </sentence><sentence id="3221">And even though the army supported us and they did give us, you know, generous support there, we the tractor drivers had to go down and practically open up the area. </sentence><sentence id="3222">And so we were very respected in the kibbutz for that reason. </sentence><sentence id="3223">Above us was an Arab town, Tul Karem, which today is under Israeli occupation and still a very hot spot for riots. </sentence><sentence id="3224">And I remember that Arab town practically you could see the people on the street, and here we were on the other side living, you know, two enemies and of course, I had a lot of adventures because of living on the border, but then again, that has not much to do with the Holocaust and I am sure that the Holocaust Museum has a lot of testimonies from Israelis so they don't need. </sentence><sentence id="3225">I don't know, but that's up to you, but I have a lot of stories that came to us as a result of living so close at that time, back in 1948, 1949, on the border, you know. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3234">Q: I'd be interested in hearing how, what kinds of relations or encounters you had with Arabs in that area. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3236">A: Well, when we first showed up, when we first showed up, the first day, there were Arab shepherds down on the other side of the barbed wire, the border was just marked with a bunch of barbed wire. </sentence><sentence id="3237">And when they saw us, they emitted a sound like woo-woo-woo, and they were running away, they were just scared to death. </sentence><sentence id="3238">These were shepherds, very poor people, and we didn't know exactly who they were, but we learned eventually, that they were, they were working for the local, you know, sheik or whomever owns the land for very little. </sentence><sentence id="3239">And eventually, we also saw that here on this side of the border we are plowing with up-to-date 20"-century machinery and we saw not far from us, a man on a horseback whipping people just because they did something apparently that did not please them. </sentence><sentence id="3240">The owner of the land had practically complete jurisdiction over these poor fellows, and that was just a few hundred yards from where we were working. </sentence><sentence id="3241">As they got used to us, they came closer and closer and when they saw that we don't mean any harm, they came down to the barbed wire many times, watching to make sure that nobody sees them and tried to make friends with us and we did make friends with them for, the main reason is that chocolate was very expensive in Israel those days, cocoa, and we already had quite a few children in our group, babies. </sentence><sentence id="3242">Cigarettes were very expensive for some reason in Jordan and they were very cheap in Israel, American cigarettes. </sentence><sentence id="3243">So they asked, oh, these people offered us a deal, but they did not want to do it during the day because they were afraid that the... Jordan had the best military force, the Arab Legion, trained by the British and they were afraid that they were patrolling there and all this and it was a serious crime to deal with, with Israelis. </sentence><sentence id="3244">So at   USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0467 &amp; RG-50.549.05*0001 64 night in the darkness, and I remember it was my turn, too, it was always a few people and always the tractor drivers because we had the contact with the border people, we went down because they would recognize us and it was a very risky thing, they could have just shot me dead right there, it could have been a trap. </sentence><sentence id="3245">We went down and we were doing all the business, they jumped over or we went over, but mainly they came over because they were much better fence jumpers than we were. </sentence><sentence id="3246">So this was one contact that we had. </sentence><sentence id="3247">The other one was not so pleasant, these wadis, dry river beds, that run across, they don't recognize borders, they run, you know, back and forth, Israel, Jordan, and in, when they are dry which is most of the time, this is where the Arab thieves come over, they use these river beds because you can't see them, they are, you know, they are like little canyons. </sentence><sentence id="3248">And they would come over in these river beds and go into other areas and steal, mainly animals. </sentence><sentence id="3249">And they were unbelievably good thieves. </sentence><sentence id="3250">They would steal, they can, they would steal a cattle, they would steal a donkey, they would steal a horse surrounded by walls. </sentence><sentence id="3251">Nobody could ever figure out how they did it. </sentence><sentence id="3252">So the army hired us to be kind of a paramilitary force and go out and lie, so we had to lie down in the wadis and a few of us, we didn't have very good guns, we had old Czech guns, and wait for these thieves to come. </sentence><sentence id="3253">And I only had one occasion when three of us were in a patrol and there were about fifteen or twenty of these coming by and we didn't feel like getting murdered by them because what chances do we have? </sentence><sentence id="3254">And so we let them go by and then reported to the border police that they went by, but we didn't want to engage in any fire fight there. </sentence><sentence id="3255">Now, my good experience was with the Jordanian Legion, which then eventually had also a sad ending. </sentence><sentence id="3256">All of a sudden one day we were, I was plowing I remember, and I had to have always a guard on my tractor with a submachine gun who was constantly casing and watching because I was so close to the border and this was a friend of mine one day who was a guard in an Arab POW camp, an Israeli POW camp, guarding Arabs during the War of Independence, so he learned some Arabic from them. </sentence><sentence id="3257">And you will see why this is important, and all of a sudden we saw some, an Arab Legion patrol right by the barbed wire and they were motioning to us to come down and we said no, you know. </sentence><sentence id="3258">And so they went away. </sentence><sentence id="3259">Next day they came and again they were motioning, they said, "Peace, peace." </sentence><sentence id="3260">So finally they went back about fifty yards and they put their guns into a pile and then came back, showing that they had no weapons and they told us, "Sit down on that side of the border. </sentence><sentence id="3261">What can we do?" </sentence><sentence id="3262">They were about twelve, if they really wanted to kill us, we said, "Okay, let's go down. </sentence><sentence id="3263">What do they want?" </sentence><sentence id="3264">They just wanted to talk to us and from there on, every day they would come down at a certain time and eventually they, the Arabs have watermelon all over, so it was like a party, they would yell at one of these poor fellows who was working there and I, this is all I learned in Arabic, what it is, "Hey, bring me a watermelon." </sentence><sentence id="3265">Yalla Jibbu Battiyah. </sentence><sentence id="3266">And they brought a watermelon and they would slice it and we were eating, almost every day we had a little lunch there together, we brought some stuff. </sentence><sentence id="3267">And this went on for weeks and weeks and weeks and weeks. </sentence><sentence id="3268">And eventually we really fooled our countries because sometimes they came over and ate and laughed that they ate in Israel and sometimes we jumped over and we said, "Oh, we ate in Jordan." </sentence><sentence id="3269">And one day it was our turn, we stopped the tractor, they haven't come down yet so we were waiting for them, but we were already sitting on the other side, we had a little blanket, we put it down, all the food from our kitchen and all of a sudden a patrol is there, but it is a totally different patrol. </sentence><sentence id="3270">What happened, apparently somebody saw them and    USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0467 &amp; RG-50.549.05*0001 65 reported them, I don't know what ever happened, I never saw them again and these guys were, they drew their guns and they are going to shoot us. </sentence><sentence id="3271">And you know that border was no joke, every night somebody was killed there, either an Israeli or an Arab. </sentence><sentence id="3272">Very innocent people, you know, sometimes a, one night I felt so badly, a young couple, lovers, were walking around and apparently they were in the wrong place and an Israeli guard, and most of the Israeli border guards were from Arab countries, Arab Jews, well, not Arab, that sounds kind of strange, but Jews from Arab countries, and they were vicious. </sentence><sentence id="3273">I mean, you could not get better border guards and they were, they hated the Arabs more than we hated the Nazis. </sentence><sentence id="3274">And so they were, they were, they saw one at night, they were shooting sometimes for no reason. </sentence><sentence id="3275">So that was a very poisonous atmosphere there, and I mean it took a long time and the fact that my friend spoke some Arabic and all this and mitigated the situation, but then the man said, "How come you speak some Arabic? </sentence><sentence id="3276">Where did you learn it?" </sentence><sentence id="3277">And then he had to kind of, so finally the sergeant who was leading all them, always a master sergeant leading the patrol, he said, "You have one luck that I have a son of your age." </sentence><sentence id="3278">He said, "If I ever see you even down touching the barbed wire," he said, "I am going to just make dust out of you." </sentence><sentence id="3279">And of course, we never went back again. </sentence><sentence id="3280">That was, these are some experiences living on the border. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3328">Q: Do you remember what you would talk about with these, with the guards before they were taken away? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3330">A: Well, it was a very simple conversation because we had a language problem, it was mainly sign language quite a bit, and we were talking about, basically, these people were talking about their children, they showed pictures of their families and the word peace, Salaam or Shalom in Hebrew, was constantly mentioned. </sentence><sentence id="3331">And I have a feeling that all of us involved, probably, if they are, hopefully they are alive, will always remember this and that kind of softened us up, so we know that human beings can relax under certain circumstances and we don't have to be enemies. </sentence><sentence id="3332">It was the first time that I realized that an Arab can, doesn't necessarily have to be my opponent, you know? </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3349">A: At first I was very, very idealistic. </sentence><sentence id="3350">Then somehow, I felt a little bit disappointed where in our kibbutz, all kinds of political groups tried to kind of tear us apart. </sentence><sentence id="3351">And there were more and more arguments and somehow this and the fact that as the country settled down into so- called peace, if we can call it, the usual symptoms that every nation in the world experiences, surfaced, such as crime and... but the fact that there were Jewish criminals, that shocked me. </sentence><sentence id="3352">You know, I was so naive that I thought that anybody goes to Israel, certainly doesn't want to do anything to hurt another human being. </sentence><sentence id="3353">There were even, even murderers, and I just one day after another, these things, they added to my little disappointment, but I was still enjoying myself because I love to be outdoors and we, we did the physical work and it was all that a young person wants for self-image, good self-image, we had a very good self-image of ourselves. </sentence><sentence id="3354">There were two things that contributed to my, to my coming, going back to Hungary eventually in "51. </sentence><sentence id="3355">One was, all of a sudden I realized that I, in all my life I loved my father very, very much, and this is a, I mean it's a fact, there is nothing you can do about it, I loved my father more than I loved my mother. </sentence><sentence id="3356">Somehow I always considered my mother a little bit of a, of a kind of petit bourgeois that I never really completely understood. </sentence><sentence id="3357">And I thought that she was a little bit, she was just in another, in other words, she wanted me to be also, you know, like she was, and play the piano and all these things and I was not the type. </sentence><sentence id="3358">So I was not that close to her even though I was with her all the time and practically, I was also instrumental in saving her life in the war when I dragged her with me everywhere and all this, but my father, and I realized I spent very little time with my father as a young man because he was always away in, in the concentration camp. </sentence><sentence id="3359">And now he was home and now they couldn't come any more, Hungary was sealed. </sentence><sentence id="3360">And then I also, at the age of nineteen, became somehow involved with a group of cynical people. </sentence><sentence id="3361">And I met them here and there and some of them I knew from Hungary and they were married to this and this, I just somehow was under the influence of these who saw nothing nice any more in Israel except the bad things. </sentence><sentence id="3362">This, the homesickness plus the fact that then I began to get all kinds of propaganda material from Hungary and somehow, this was the third thing, I was misled by all this, what I read, and I thought that the situation changed and Hungary is such a marvelous country today. </sentence><sentence id="3363">And my parents tried to communicate to me, even though they never wanted me to really go away, but now they didn't want me to really come home, they were afraid what would happen to me. </sentence><sentence id="3364">And that, they just apparently didn't come across quite well because I, eventually I just decided I want to go back to Hungary, and probably homesickness had a great deal to do, I, at that time as a young man, I didn't realize that you can't go home again, you know? </sentence><sentence id="3365">I envisioned that everything is going to be back and all this. </sentence><sentence id="3366">Well, I then applied to the Hungarian Embassy, got a permit and the Israelis, of course, didn't keep me there, and in 1951, I returned to Hungary. </sentence><sentence id="3367">And those were the worst years, aside from October 15th, those years were the worst years of my life, the next two or three years. </sentence><sentence id="3368">  USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0467 &amp; RG-50.549.05*0001 67 </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3389">Q: Before we go into more details about that, you mentioned that you found the Israelis very well organized as you were escaping from Hungary. </sentence><sentence id="3390">When you arrived in the kibbutz, did you, did you share the feeling that the way that the kibbutz was organized was, was very good and smooth and, did you have any observations about that? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3393">A: The kibbutz was also very well organized, this was an old kibbutz and it was like a clock work. </sentence><sentence id="3394">Also, there was a hierarchy which naturally some people didn't understand, but I had no argument with that because I realized a person who came here fifty years ago when there was nothing here except rocks and Arabs shooting at them, has, is more equal, right, than somebody who arrives here today. </sentence><sentence id="3395">It was well run, it was a wealthy kibbutz, there was very good food, there was culture, they made sure that orchestras are coming, good ones, entertainment, no, I had absolutely no feeling of let down in this respect. </sentence><sentence id="3396">No, I admired the way they carried on. </sentence><sentence id="3397">Just a little, just a little thing that shows that how they thought of everything: shoveling manure, for example, of course, not something that somebody wants to do for the rest of his or her life, so or washing dishes in the kitchen, so there were, there were certain things in the kibbutz that it was not a, an area where you were assigned permanently, they were temporary. </sentence><sentence id="3398">And so everybody knew that once in a month I have to shovel manure and once a month or twice a month, I have to wash the dishes, so, there were some other, but even this was taken care of, you know, I think in a very human manner. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3405">Q: Did you have dreams or ideas of what exactly you would be doing when you went back to Hungary, was that... was your sense of where you wanted to go in your life very developed? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3407">A: I was naively thinking about going to the university and continuing with my education to become a teacher, a high school teacher, and so I went back through the Bosporus, Turkey, Black Sea, Romania and then Hungary. </sentence><sentence id="3408">Travelling through Romania by train, in 1949, excuse me, 1951, was quite an experience, the people just looked at me, looked at me and since there are quite a few Hungarians in Romania, | then... eventually they found out that I speak Hungarian, so there was always a Hungarian there and asked me and I very naively give all the details of my life and all this and that, and I didn't understand why they looked at me, just looked at me, just looked at me, and also Romania was tremendously gray and I could only think of 1984, going across Romania. </sentence><sentence id="3409">And that was only the beginning, 1951, you know? </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3417">Q: You're referring to the book? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3419">A: Yes, I refer to the book /984, or the movie rather, okay? </sentence><sentence id="3420">It's the same thing, but the movie is the one that I always keep in my mind when I think of Romania. </sentence><sentence id="3421">So I arrived on the Hungarian border and here was an officer on the border looked at my papers and all this and USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0467 &amp; RG-50.549.05*0001 68 he, I'll never forget what he told me, he said to me, "I don't know where you come from, but it must have been very bad, very bad there, that you come from." </sentence><sentence id="3422">And he looked at me and said, "Welcome to Hungary." </sentence><sentence id="3423">And this was a border guard officer. </sentence><sentence id="3424">And I thought this is a strange thing, what does it mean? </sentence><sentence id="3425">Well, I learned very quickly. </sentence><sentence id="3426">When I boarded the train again on the other side of the border, it was just as gray as coming through Romania and then finally when I arrived home, I looked around, I realized that I was totally, totally misled. </sentence><sentence id="3427">Never have I been misled before or after the way I was. </sentence><sentence id="3428">I arrived there and it was the grayest, most colorless, most suspicious, paranoid society you can imagine. </sentence><sentence id="3429">And my bad period started with, of course, not being able to get a job, any job, there was no one, going to the university, of course, was ridiculous to think about because I was an unreliable element, I came home, number one, from the West, I was an imperialist agent, as far as they were concerned, not only that, I was a Zionist imperialist agent. </sentence><sentence id="3430">And it took me almost six month to get a job to sweep a floor, to sweep floors and clean oil off the concrete in a garage, in a state-owned garage. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3444">Q: How did you get the job? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3446">A: With great connections, the fact that my father was from the working class and many of his brothers and their friends were involved, but mainly their friends of where they come from, this suburb of Hungary, a very poor one, suburb of Budapest, where now the communist officials with great connections, but nobody wanted any names, nobody wanted to stick out their neck, they just somehow pushed some paperwork somewhere and I was an, kind of an auxiliary labor help, a no name person whom they hired because they needed somebody to clean something. </sentence><sentence id="3447">And that was the only job I could get. </sentence><sentence id="3448">What hurt me even more was the fact that my good friends on the street, some of them who stayed in Hungary, not too many because most of them escaped, but they would not want anything to do with me because most people didn't want to touch me, didn't want to talk to me, they don't know me, they rather would go to the other side of the street than to meet me. </sentence><sentence id="3449">Some probably out of disgust that how stupid a human being can be to come back to this, and others for fear. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3454">Q: Because you had been in Israel? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3456">A: Yes, yes, because I had been out, it doesn't have to be, it didn't have to be Israel, anyone, it was a totally paranoid society, everything that happened in the Soviet Union was copied the next day, you know. </sentence><sentence id="3457">So the, I worked in this garage for about six month and I always noticed with great nostalgia, how they have these posters about urging workers to go to college and I wanted to go to college, and I went to the Party secretary of the firm which had about twelve garages, had to sign a paper that recommends you to go to the next step and every time I went to see him, he laughed at me, he said, "You know that you are here by the grace of a few people and not, you have no merits to go there." </sentence><sentence id="3458">So the, my break came when the secretary became very ill, the Party secretary of the firm, and they sent out a temporary Party secretary, and she was a woman, she was very busy when I entered, you know, dirty and overalls and all this, and when I told her what I wanted, I got an, this opportunity and try, now, when I told her what I wanted, she said, "Well, I don't have time to write you a   USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0467 &amp; RG-50.549.05*0001 69 recommendation. </sentence><sentence id="3459">I'm glad that a worker wants to go to college, we need working youth, why don't you dictate what you need to my secretary and I will just sign it." </sentence><sentence id="3460">So I passed the first hurdle, with this I went to the university where I had to submit this. </sentence><sentence id="3461">This was a committee, they interviewed you and they read your, you had to write your, your biography, autobiography for everything, everything. </sentence><sentence id="3462">So here was a committee, admitting committee, the Young Communist League, the Communist Party, one from the faculty, et cetera, about, I would say, seven, eight people. </sentence><sentence id="3463">And when they got to certain points, they said, "Come on, you must be joking that you really think that, you know, you can come here." </sentence><sentence id="3464">Well, I left and as I was going out a man whose name was Mr. Bartos, he was on the faculty, this was the Hungarian Teachers Academy, this was the university where I wanted to go, it was called the Teachers Academy, but it was part of the university. </sentence><sentence id="3465">He came out and he said, "Holczer, Holczer, didn't your father play on a certain soccer team?" </sentence><sentence id="3466">I said, "Yes." </sentence><sentence id="3467">He said, "Didn't your father have four or five brothers playing on the same soccer team?" </sentence><sentence id="3468">And he said, "Yes." </sentence><sentence id="3469">And he said, "Okay, come back in September and see, maybe since you were a minor when you left the country, I will try and write to the Ministry of Education, maybe something can be done." </sentence><sentence id="3470">Well, I was holding my breath for three months, I went back in September and I went into the Party secretary's office, they had no idea who I was, they couldn't find any paper, anything, so I was looking for him. </sentence><sentence id="3471">And I found him and he said, "Just a second." </sentence><sentence id="3472">He went into the Party secretary, he came out a few minutes later and he said, "I am very happy to inform you that the Minister of Education, on the basis that you were a minor when you left Hungary, give you special permission to enter the university." </sentence><sentence id="3473">And he said, "Now, this was the last time you ever talk to me, you ever looked at me, you ever even thought that we have anything to do with each other. </sentence><sentence id="3474">Never again." </sentence><sentence id="3475">He said, "That is the price. </sentence><sentence id="3476">You understand?" </sentence><sentence id="3477">I said, "Yes." </sentence><sentence id="3478">Said, "and say hello to your dad." </sentence><sentence id="3479">That was it. </sentence><sentence id="3480">I went home, my father remembered him, they played on the same team. </sentence><sentence id="3481">And he was the head of the physical education branch of the faculty, you know? </sentence><sentence id="3482">And this is how I got in. </sentence><sentence id="3483">And I had a very, very good time because I found out ninety-nine percent of the kids thought the same way as I did and there were very few communists, very few. </sentence><sentence id="3484">And yet, when it came to 1953, I almost was, I was thrown out for about one week. </sentence><sentence id="3485">Stalin was dying and when he, in his last breath, he looked up, he saw doctors around him and he was paranoia, he said, "Who are these?" </sentence><sentence id="3486">They said, "Doctors." </sentence><sentence id="3487">And Stalin was very anti-Semitic and he said, "Are they Jewish doctors?" </sentence><sentence id="3488">And I think, out of twelve or so, seven or eight were Jewish, they said, "Yes." </sentence><sentence id="3489">They said, "Arrest them." </sentence><sentence id="3490">And they were, all the doctors around Stalin were arrested a few days before he died. </sentence><sentence id="3491">And then, when this happened, in Hungary, too, they were looking for Jewish doctors or anybody who was, had anything to do with Zionists because they called them the Zionist conspiracy against Stalin and they found me at the college. </sentence><sentence id="3492">They had to, since this was a chain reaction, that went down. </sentence><sentence id="3493">So they found me and they told me to go home and that I am a Zionist this and Zionist that. </sentence><sentence id="3494">And Stalin died three days later and I mean, I was just heartbroken because it was before exams and all this and it was in March and I was ready to take my exams soon and then when everything died, died down, and the so-called Thaw, this is what they called it politically, the Thaw started, then they called me back and they said forget about the whole thing and continue. </sentence><sentence id="3495">  USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0467 &amp; RG-50.549.05*0001 70 </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3545">A: My father's former employers, either died or escaped in 1947 or 1948, to the West, so this, what I mentioned, was a volunteer work. </sentence><sentence id="3546">Everybody, basically, had to volunteer to do something. </sentence><sentence id="3547">This was volunteer work, he volunteered to be appointed to this position and this was not a paid job. </sentence><sentence id="3548">And it did not require a great deal of his time. </sentence><sentence id="3549">He immediately looked for some opportunity and started to work for a co-op, a lot of co-ops started and what co-ops were are a group of people who banded together and formed a what you would call a, maybe a small enterprise, as long as they worked under the ruse of a cooperation and everything was divided, the profit if there was any, and they paid their taxes to the state, this was what the communists considered kind of a happy in-between of state farms or state enterprise and private enterprise. </sentence><sentence id="3550">Because private enterprise was phased out gradually, except in cases such as a shoe maker that, you know, repairs shoes, but even for that, eventually, they had co-ops, shoemaker co-ops or tailor co-ops or this, but a few, a few of those branches, that you could not really work any other way except in a co-op, but he was working for a co-op where he rose eventually, he was a very smart man, and he rose to be kind of a midlevel manager, but also working and this co-op was working with a lot of women who would then get the merchandise and do it at home. </sentence><sentence id="3551">They were making shopping nets and shopping bags and things like that that anybody can do on a sewing machine at home. </sentence><sentence id="3552">And then they would bring it in and so actually they had a very, a very small area, a very small base and just a warehouse and he enjoyed this, he enjoyed it and he was very much liked. </sentence><sentence id="3553">The only problem he had occasionally is that they asked him, because he was such a good worker, and he received all kinds of awards that he didn't really want particularly because he was not very, you know, infatuated with the communist system, they always wanted him to join the Party because he was a perfect, what they called cadre, cadre, he comes from the working class, he was a hard-working man, he was an honest man, he rose from nothing to a midlevel manager, so he was an ideal person. </sentence><sentence id="3554">But he never joined, he always said, "No, absolutely no." </sentence><sentence id="3555">So that, he was such a good worker, they left him alone. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3583">A: Interestingly, with most people, you could talk politics. </sentence><sentence id="3584">You know, eventually, throughout these years, we isolated the ones who were suspicious to us and... because they were always eager beaver Party workers and give big speeches and some of them did big speeches and we knew that we can still talk to them, they're just careerists and they just want to go ahead. </sentence><sentence id="3585">But I would say the great majority, even in the worst days, we could still discuss things. </sentence><sentence id="3586">Obviously, we didn't do it on the street, we didn't do it elsewhere except in our own home or in a restaurant where there was a lot of noise and they couldn't discern, you know, who says what. </sentence><sentence id="3587">So in this respect, we did not really have a kind of a prison atmosphere in college. </sentence><sentence id="3588">And our professors, I would say eighty percent of them were very much against the regime and occasionally they let that go in very, you know, ambiguous statements. </sentence><sentence id="3589">We recognized it immediately and all this, but just to give you one example, most of us, we had to go to Russian instruction every day, most of us either didn't show up or if we did, we didn't listen, we didn't learn anything, and after going through college, at the end you had to take a state exam. </sentence><sentence id="3590">And I, the exam in Hungary at that time was you had to draw a written note on which you had a topic. </sentence><sentence id="3591">And you were given fifteen minutes to take notes on that topic from your memory, you were given a pencil and some paper, and when you were called upon, this was your turn and you could talk about, introduce your topic and there was a committee. </sentence><sentence id="3592">And I went to my Russian exam, and this happened to other people too, and I drew my topic and I couldn't even read the title, let alone, couldn't read the title, I just, in these years I just never bothered to read, to learn enough to read. </sentence><sentence id="3593">Today of course, I'm not very proud of this, because now I know that the more languages you speak, you know, the more lives you have, but those days, this was a political statement, they couldn't believe it, they just couldn't believe it because I was straight A in my subjects and so there was tremendous animosity toward me from the police, from the Party secretary and all the others. </sentence><sentence id="3594">Can we stop? </sentence><sentence id="3595">End of Tape 6, Side B   USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0467 &amp; RG-50.549.05*0001 72 Tape 7, Side A </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3614">A: Oh, the Russian exam. </sentence><sentence id="3615">And then I found out later that some of my classmates had the same problem and, eventually, they decided not to, not to have us back, so they just gave us a D and they were very angry about it. </sentence><sentence id="3616">But in a way it was their fault, too, because how could we get up to that point, going through all classes, didn't they realize that something is wrong?Well, this, I remember this very distinctly, that that was one way to show our reaction to what was going on. </sentence><sentence id="3617">And otherwise, even the ones who were very active in the Communist Party, most of them always gave us a signal that this is all a show, there is nothing to worry about. </sentence><sentence id="3618">There were very few people. </sentence><sentence id="3619">So when I left the college, at that time, you, I became a teacher and we were supposed to go to the countryside, they could not, you could not teach in Budapest the first year and I was then assigned to a little, small village, not far from Vacz, from my mother's birthplace, only a few miles and taught there for a year. </sentence><sentence id="3620">And this was a small village of a minority, Hungary has very few minorities, but they have some Slovak minorities in the North, these were Slovaks and they speak, they spoke very little Hungarian, but they would not admit it because they were afraid that there would be repercussion, so they asked for a Hungarian teacher, they could have asked for a Slovak-speaking teacher, too. </sentence><sentence id="3621">And it was quite an experience, but it has nothing to do with being Jewish or with the Holocaust, none of that came up, it was just a totally different one. </sentence><sentence id="3622">And then after this year that I spent in... I made contact again, I wanted to get back with a youth organization and I found interestingly that the Communist Youth Organization, the Pioneer organization probably could use me because, I mean I went through the boy scouts, I went through the Zionists, | had some very definite ideas and I answered an ad and became a director of a summer camp. </sentence><sentence id="3623">They looked for a young teacher who, I had about twelve other young teachers with me and it was in Budapest, it was just a day camp, and it turned out to be such a good experience that the local Communist Party secretary asked me if 1 would like to come and teach in the district. </sentence><sentence id="3624">And I said, "Naturally, this is it!"" </sentence><sentence id="3625">And so I was transferred to, just to a suburb of Budapest and I taught there until the Revolution came and I escaped again. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3657">Q: "You mentioned that you were involved with the Democratic Teacher's Union at one point? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3659">A: During the Revolution, they asked me to organize a Democratic Teacher's Union. </sentence><sentence id="3660">I was not a Party member, they knew that I was not also an anti-Party member either because, and this I wanted to bring out and emphasize, that as a Jew in Hungary, you could never be truly an anti-communist because you knew one thing, as long as the Communist Party was in power, there would be no pogroms and your life is safe. </sentence><sentence id="3661">And this is what happened after communism, and communist fall, most of my relatives and friends who were in Hungary, this was their greatest fear, that what will happen to them now. </sentence><sentence id="3662">And anti-Semitism is now rampant in Eastern Europe, in Hungary, too. </sentence><sentence id="3663">So this is just an interlude, I just wanted to say something about that. </sentence><sentence id="3664">So I was just teaching in this suburb and until the Revolution and as a, and during the Revolution, they sent for me and they wanted me to get the Democratic Teachers Union together, various democratic organizations, and all this. </sentence><sentence id="3665">And I came out to a couple of briefings with people, with the local council, the town council, the district council and one day there was some fighting out there and I saw a bunch of people with armbands, the Arrow Cross armbands. </sentence><sentence id="3666">And I looked out the window and all my desire to ever do anything or to stay there, just went away. </sentence><sentence id="3667">Right in that moment. </sentence><sentence id="3668">I realized that this is now when I have to leave. </sentence><sentence id="3669">Even though I had a very good life, the last three years, after I was transferred to Budapest, I had a very, very good life, relatively speaking, you know? </sentence><sentence id="3670">A good salary, I started to write for the newspaper, the... stories about young people. </sentence><sentence id="3671">I ran camps and financially, and I got all the recognition and awards and all this, I couldn't complain. </sentence><sentence id="3672">But when I saw, when I saw that, the symbol, I went home and I said, "This is it. </sentence><sentence id="3673">I will never return except to visit." </sentence><sentence id="3674">And I told my parents, "In two weeks, I'm leaving." </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3691">Q: Where did you, you mentioned that you had a, you had a real enthusiasm for working with young people and that seems to be something that you did for most of your adult life and at the time, what, where did your, where did that enthusiasm come from and what, what were you teaching, were you teaching them simply geography or were you trying to teach them a broader range of things? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3693">A: Well, when I was transferred to Budapest, immediately I started to teach geography, they had these so-called pioneer houses, these were buildings where the kids can come back in the afternoon and depending on their interests, join groups, study groups. </sentence><sentence id="3694">And I was running the geography group which was a lot of introduction and simulations of how a river is meandering and then old river is meandering, a lot of tests, hands-on type of activities. </sentence><sentence id="3695">I took them to hike and I taught them how, orientation in nature and all, everything that was romantic in the boy scouts. </sentence><sentence id="3696">And from this, I kind of organized a group of very enthusiastic kids who eventually would follow me anywhere, you know, and it appealed to me as a young, and I can still do that, and so then people saw this and they hired me to run big camps. </sentence><sentence id="3697">But I always neglected the political thing, that was not, I never really cared for the politics, but I emphasized the romantic thing. </sentence><sentence id="3698">I even wrote a book for the Pioneer movement and suggested a completely new uniform and emblems and all this, what kids love at that age, because the Pioneer uniform is the most, was the most impractical thing a child can have. </sentence><sentence id="3699">A white shirt, can you imagine, with dark blue pants and a red kerchief, I mean, and USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0467 &amp; RG-50.549.05*0001 74 nothing on it, they were not, they couldn't have any emblem anything, so I said, "No, a child wants to see his or her achievements, right there, he or she wants to show it to the world." </sentence><sentence id="3700">And so they were, they were giving me some free hand to do it and I did a lot of this, submitted it, it was accepted, so this is what I loved, that I could have some influence and push them away, mainly from politics, into romantic activities, you know, and that is the one, that is, I think that pleased me a great deal. </sentence><sentence id="3701">And eventually, it was a, I did it until the very last day, until I left Hungary, and I still corresponded with many of my kids who were in my group as adults. </sentence><sentence id="3702">And when I went back later on, ten years or fifteen years later, some of these kids were running the same kind of camps and organizations and they always came and they said, "You know, if you had told us that in the middle of the night we have to leave our homes so that nobody will wake up and assemble in a place, we would have been up there. </sentence><sentence id="3703">And we would have been following you all the way out to the border." </sentence><sentence id="3704">I didn't tell them that I was leaving because I didn't want them to even have this silly idea, but after I left some of them learned about it and three of them came after me and ended up in Switzerland, but eventually went back to Hungary. </sentence><sentence id="3705">So occasionally, when I am in Hungary, I do bump into them and I go out and look up some, and those who were very nice to me, I always see. </sentence><sentence id="3706">I even see the Communist Party secretary, the woman who was influential to get me, I took my wife, too, to see her during the late "70s and early "80s, she and her husband, I just, they were good people. </sentence><sentence id="3707">They came from the old communist underground, you know? </sentence><sentence id="3708">And though we never talked about it, I'm sure they were just as disappointed in what happened to Marx ideas as most other people. </sentence><sentence id="3709">But they would never discuss it because they were too loyal to the Party. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3728">Q: When 1956 came and some of the demonstrations started, were you intrigued in any way or did you mainly feel concerned about the fascist elements that you were seeing? </sentence><sentence id="3729">Did you go to the big demonstration on October 23rd? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3732">A: Yeah. </sentence><sentence id="3733">I was on the street all the time because I believed that I have this, anybody, most Holocaust survivors have an intuition, have a, somehow, a sixth sense and we always wanted to read the crowd. </sentence><sentence id="3734">The mood of the crowd. </sentence><sentence id="3735">And so I was in the street all the time, watching what's happening, kind of sensing the undercurrent. </sentence><sentence id="3736">I was like an animal and I knew that I knew exactly what was going on. </sentence><sentence id="3737">And I knew that these people eventually could be up to no good or quite a few of them could be up to no good because, you know, the leopard doesn't lose its spots and even though it all started with great democratic slogans, eventually after two weeks, it did disintegrate and there were a lot of fascist groups and I did not want to live under Russian tanks, but I was glad, myself, that the Russian tanks came back. </sentence><sentence id="3738">I just didn't want to live under that system either, but at least it saved the lives of a lot of people because there were ugly incidents. </sentence><sentence id="3739">The Revolution started for two weeks, the first one week was kind of democratic and looked like democratic and the second week, just everything disintegrated and the crowd went berserk and I didn't trust any of that any more. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3762">A: Well, the Revolution was defeated in the first week of November and it took me about ten to fourteen days to get going. </sentence><sentence id="3763">I just wanted to say goodbye to my good friends and my family and also I had a cousin who wanted to come with me and I had to do a little preparation there, too, because he was just a high school graduate and a very green fellow at that. </sentence><sentence id="3764">And eventually he brought his friend, so the three of us started out and in about ten, ten to fourteen days, I can't remember exactly, but no more than two weeks. </sentence><sentence id="3765">I just wanted to see exactly what works, what doesn't work, how can I approach the border, the most practical way, a lot of people were practically there and then captured and brought back to Budapest. </sentence><sentence id="3766">And the repercussion was nothing but still, you didn't want to go through all this and then in the last second, just before you would go over to Austria, captured, you know, be captured, so I kind of did a little homework, that's all, and tried to think of the practical aspects of how to do that. </sentence><sentence id="3767">End of Tape 7, Side B   USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0467 &amp; RG-50.549.05*0001 76 Tape 8, Side A </sentence></p></dialogue>

I was never that much in favor of modern times and fast times, and a landscape with skyscrapers, that was not my vision of my future life. </sentence><sentence id="3932">I was a typical European, who felt a lot more comfortable in... on a narrow street with half-timbered houses, and a lot of people on the street, and sidewalk cafes, and little restaurants. </sentence><sentence id="3933">Then to go to a country where none of this would exist. </sentence><sentence id="3934">So I had my reservations this way, emotionally. </sentence><sentence id="3935">I had no qualms about the United States politically, but I was worried about how can I adjust to a place that doesn't have much traditions. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3951">A: Yes, yes, very much so. </sentence><sentence id="3952">I still am very nostalgic when it comes to, for example Christmas. </sentence><sentence id="3953">I consider our life here quite plastic and I understand why. </sentence><sentence id="3954">I am not faulting anyone for it. </sentence><sentence id="3955">I know that a country that is so young as the United State, just never had the opportunity to develop those traditions that European countries have, that existed now for thousands of years. </sentence><sentence id="3956">And so... But it is just sad. </sentence><sentence id="3957">I feel that a great deal of problems come from the fact that we are so young, and we grew too quickly, almost like a teenager who just became totally uncoordinated. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3965">Q: But you mentioned that your father taught you about America, that it was... that it was the Land of the Free. </sentence><sentence id="3966">What did that mean to you? </sentence><sentence id="3967">What did that mean to him? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3971">A: Well, in the war, we listened, as long as he was around, and we had an opportunity, we listened to London, to the BBC, it was... and occasionally, I think, but I am not so sure, even the Voice of America could be heard. </sentence><sentence id="3972">And, of course there, we heard a great deal about the western... so-called western world. </sentence><sentence id="3973">And realized that while we are living there as practical slaves, in the western world, people have a very good life. </sentence><sentence id="3974">And that appealed to me a great deal. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3981">A: I think it was no more than two weeks. </sentence><sentence id="3982">It was just a screening process to just give a very superficial screening, so certain elements, undesirable elements would not sneak into the country. </sentence><sentence id="3983">They were looking for members of the Communist Party and unfortunately, people who were sick, because with certain illnesses, you could not gain entrance to the United States. </sentence><sentence id="3984">For example, if you had TB. </sentence><sentence id="3985">And then, from there... and also, they were in charge of sending you somewhere. </sentence><sentence id="3986">So, they were kind of dispatchers. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="4005">A: In Saint Louis... Saint Louis, Missouri, I was welcomed by the family, by that time, adopted, of course, just symbolically, my cousin, and we were united. </sentence><sentence id="4006">They were a... you might say upper-middle class American family with some problems and they thought that getting two Hungarian refugees would probably mitigate their circumstances. </sentence><sentence id="4007">And I was, within weeks, working for a wholesale jewelry company. </sentence><sentence id="4008">I was just a stockboy. </sentence><sentence id="4009">And, very simple work, and that was my job. </sentence><sentence id="4010">And on weekends, as long as my cousin was with me, of course, we were walking around and going to a movie, even though we couldn't understand much of it. </sentence><sentence id="4011">But just planning, eventually, to be integrated into this society. </sentence><sentence id="4012">And on weekdays we worked, we went home, we watched television. </sentence><sentence id="4013">And the family was... it was a very interesting situation, because the man was manic depressive and we could never figure out what his moves would be next. </sentence><sentence id="4014">The... his wife was a very darling woman, and she was the one who tried to figure this out, that with two Hungarian refugees, the situation might change. </sentence><sentence id="4015">They had a mentally retarded son in an institution, who came home on weekends and they had another son at home, a very brilliant young man, who was always creating something electrical, or mechanical, even. </sentence><sentence id="4016">So, we had good relationship with him, and I kept up with my host mother for a long time, and only when we left for Europe, that was the time when I lost contact and I don't know where she is. </sentence><sentence id="4017">I understand they got a divorce after. </sentence><sentence id="4018">It was in... unbearable to live with somebody who was so unpredictable. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="4037">Q: ... much later. </sentence><sentence id="4038">Uh-huh. </sentence><sentence id="4039">Did you have the idea at that time, that you would be staying in the United States? </sentence><sentence id="4040">I know you had the idea originally that you didn't want to stay, and you wanted to go back to Europe. </sentence><sentence id="4041">Were you thinking, after you had arrived, that you would actually stay? </sentence><sentence id="4042">What... What were your thoughts about the future? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="4049">A: Well, I realize that I was in a trap, because there was no way for me to go back to Europe, even if I wanted to, and be accepted by a... any country and get some legal status anywhere. </sentence><sentence id="4050">The reason was, once you were placed in a country, you couldn't really do much about it any more. </sentence><sentence id="4051">So I knew I had to make the best of my stay here, but I certainly didn't want to stay in Saint Louis, because I was totally astonished at the prejudice in Saint Louis. </sentence><sentence id="4052">Not just against Blacks, but also against just about anyone. </sentence><sentence id="4053">I worked mainly, this is my fate, with German, it was a German company basically, a German family, German workers and I heard enough of... you cannot name a group or a race around the  http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0467 &amp; RG-50.549.05*0001 81 world about whom they were not talking during the day, always in very derogatory terms. </sentence><sentence id="4054">And then I found out that Saint Louis was a very Germanic city at that time. </sentence><sentence id="4055">You were either of German descent, or you were Black. </sentence><sentence id="4056">And luckily, when I became very, very upset about this, my Black fellow workers, first by sign language, probably, and later on, as I learned my English, pidgin English back then, they invited me on weekends to be...to go around with them, because they said one cannot just sit at home. </sentence><sentence id="4057">And they introduced me to the Saint Louis that most people who were born there, probably, wouldn't know. </sentence><sentence id="4058">I went to just about every nightclub, I heard just about every jazz band that there existed those days, that came to Saint Louis. </sentence><sentence id="4059">And many times, in a huge dance hall, I was the only white face. </sentence><sentence id="4060">And of course, sometimes, I ran into almost trouble too, because of that. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="4076">Q: Were you not... did it seem strange to you that it would be the group of Black co-workers, rather than Germanic co-workers who would befriend you, or did you think that that had anything to do with you being Jewish, or did you reject friendships with the German descent co-workers? </sentence><sentence id="4077">What was the story with that? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="4080">A: No, because most of those Germans were Jews, and... but that didn't prevent them from being prejudiced against me too, and they knew that they were... that I was Jewish. </sentence><sentence id="4081">It was just a general thing in Saint Louis, to look down on anyone who is not an established person. </sentence><sentence id="4082">And I felt this, everywhere. </sentence><sentence id="4083">I just... and the situation at home, where I was staying with these people, was also not very happy. </sentence><sentence id="4084">And that, I think, contributed to my thoughts that, how nice it would be to go to some other place. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="4090">Q: So you came with some ideas about this being the Land of the Free, and did it surprise you to see how... what a division there was between Blacks and Whites in this country and the way that the White people treated Blacks, and the problems with equality? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="4092">A: Yes, yes, that surprised me very, very much. </sentence><sentence id="4093">In one of these weekend excursions, I was introduced to a very charming college student, she was Black, and we started to date. </sentence><sentence id="4094">And eventually, she explained to me that we cannot see each other any more, because her life was in danger, and my life was in danger. </sentence><sentence id="4095">And she said, "You don't understand this now, but twenty years from now you will understand. </sentence><sentence id="4096">And as much as it hurts me, we have to stop seeing each other." </sentence><sentence id="4097">And that was my first great introduction to prejudice, really, on a personal, you know, basis. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="4104">Q: So, up until then, you really hadn't realized what a strong division there was, or what a taboo there was against interracial relationships? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="4106">A: No, I mean, you know, I came from a society that was tremendously prejudiced and I thought I am coming to a society that is much more different and much more positive about these things. </sentence><sentence id="4107">And it really surprised me that there was so much dislike and hatred, that I knew could not be erased very soon. </sentence><sentence id="4108">  USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0467 &amp; RG-50.549.05*0001 82 </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="4112">Q: Were there any civil rights activities going on in Saint Louis during the time that you were there? </sentence><sentence id="4113">Was there... were there any at... you know, discussions, just in the wake of the Brown versus Board of Education decision that interracial education would be happening? </sentence><sentence id="4114">I mean, were you aware, or... that the schools would stop being segregated? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="4118">Were there any things like that happening in Saint Louis that you were aware of? </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="4119">A: This was in 1957, and by 1957, June, I was gone. </sentence><sentence id="4120">So I only lived there for five months or so. </sentence><sentence id="4121">And I... my English was not good enough to read newspapers or even discuss anything political with people. </sentence><sentence id="4122">I did watch television, because I felt that it was a good way to learn, and I got certain ideas, but I am not aware that I was... anyway I ever met, you know, this kind of a problem in Saint Louis, no. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="4127">Q: How did you learn English? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="4129">A: Well, when you are... this is my great argument against bilingual education, that when you have to, you learn everything. </sentence><sentence id="4130">You can learn Chinese probably, just as well as you learn English. </sentence><sentence id="4131">No, for Europeans, English is an easy language to learn. </sentence><sentence id="4132">Not so easy to write, but to learn, because it's... the grammar is much simpler than some European languages. </sentence><sentence id="4133">I just put my mind to it, and I decided, if I am here, I might as well do it. </sentence><sentence id="4134">I could have gone to Cleveland, for example, and live my life as a Hungarian, but I wanted to be integrated into the society, and I love the English language, that's the truth. </sentence><sentence id="4135">I think of all the languages, even though I admit that French is a very beautiful language to listen to, but I love the English language, I love... and this is why I love to read and I learned just by listening and my willpower, I think, helped me to get through. </sentence><sentence id="4136">And among all the people eventually I associated with, who arrived at the same time, I made the most progress, because I just decided I don't want to belong to any Hungarian club and I don't want anything to do with this. </sentence><sentence id="4137">I really want to learn English. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="4147">Q: It was a... you mentioned in the last interview that it was a friendship with... was it a professor at Washington University? </sentence><sentence id="4148">Was that how you got out of Saint Louis and to Aspen? </sentence><sentence id="4149">How did your acquaintance with this man come about? </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="4192">A: Yes, they ask me a great deal about that, naturally. </sentence><sentence id="4193">But they were also very much interested in my... at... in my present experiences then, which were also not very good. </sentence><sentence id="4194">Something happened to me after I moved out of my original family, and established my independence. </sentence><sentence id="4195">For a couple of month, I lived with a Hungarian couple who rented a room, because they needed some money, and they had a room with a separate entrance, so I rented that, and there I had a pretty bad experience, and so I was just ready to leave, anywhere, in the United States. </sentence><sentence id="4196">And this is when they showed me a film of Aspen, Colorado, where they had the summer home, and where he was a member of the music festival staff, and said, "You are coming with us." </sentence></p></dialogue>

I don't even know if anyone in the future would completely understand it, but it was just a strange coincidence that my father's company's... every company in Hungary had a Party secretary, they were in charge of practically life and death, what was going on. </sentence><sentence id="4205">And my father's Party secretary, a lady, was the mother of the person who rented the room. </sentence><sentence id="4206">So, he and his wife immediately, when this came to the surface, they immediately were afraid that I might report on them back to Hungary, which I had no interest, I couldn't care less, except one day they...

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="4474">A: Yes, I knew that living in a tourist place, I knew that I would never have, probably, the money to go out on my own, because every year, buying a place, and setting up some kind of a business, was more and more expensive. </sentence><sentence id="4475">As Aspen became more and more fashionable, everything became more expensive. </sentence><sentence id="4476">Besides, I had no interest in opening a business. </sentence><sentence id="4477">I always thought of myself as an educator. </sentence><sentence id="4478">I wanted to go back to school, and luckily, I got together with some adventuresome kids, and they told me about Alaska. </sentence><sentence id="4479">They said that in Alaska you can make a lot of money and it's fascinating, and it's beautiful. </sentence><sentence id="4480">And I loved to travel, so it was just a spur of a moment when I decided that at the end of the season, around April, I would go and follow them to Alaska, and would try to make money, and then, eventually, that fall, I was going back to school in Fresno. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="4492">A: Why Fresno? </sentence><sentence id="4493">Yeah, people always ask me this question, because I'm the most unlikely person to end up in a central California town of practically no distinction. </sentence><sentence id="4494">Hundred, hundred ten degrees heat. </sentence><sentence id="4495">Why Fresno? </sentence><sentence id="4496">Because they were the only ones, back those days, who answered my letters... not giving me a scholarship, because I had trouble getting my records together from Hungary. </sentence><sentence id="4497">It was against the law, at that time, to send  http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0467 &amp; RG-50.549.05*0001 88 anything out, and I had to wait for my parents to find an opportunity to send it out with somebody. </sentence><sentence id="4498">And so, I just... a college had to accept me on my word, and apparently they were afraid to do that. </sentence><sentence id="4499">But Fresno said okay, you can come, spend a semester, we" ll find out how you function here, and then we will determine your status, based on that. </sentence><sentence id="4500">And we cannot give you a scholarship, but we can assure you about the National Defense Scholarship, which was given to people who eventually end up in education. </sentence><sentence id="4501">And so I applied for that, and I got a National Defense loan, excuse me, not scholarship. </sentence><sentence id="4502">That's what it was called back then. </sentence><sentence id="4503">And I received that loan, and so eventually, after Alaska, I ended... I ended up in Fresno. </sentence><sentence id="4504">And of course, that was another eye opener, another piece of America that was very unknown to me. </sentence><sentence id="4505">And it was a little bit of a crazy town, with...Fresno is the center of the Armenian population in America. </sentence><sentence id="4506">And they were...

I found some goodness. </sentence><sentence id="4510">So we had some little differences, but all in all, I liked the people in Fresno. </sentence><sentence id="4511">I liked them. </sentence><sentence id="4512">I had a lot of foreign, foreign students, colleagues in the college and it was probably easier for me to navigate there, than if I had gone to a big institution, where I would have been just a strange fish. </sentence><sentence id="4513">Here I had a chance to talk to professors. </sentence><sentence id="4514">It was just a very relaxed atmosphere. </sentence></p></dialogue>

I didn't really consider teaching these children a great deal different than teaching regular children. </sentence><sentence id="4624">As a matter of fact, in certain aspects, in certain sense, it was even easier because they were so loyal and devoted to you. </sentence><sentence id="4625">Naturally, there were some problems with emotionally disturbed kids, who were in this group, too. </sentence><sentence id="4626">But basically, it was easy, because of their love and devotion. </sentence><sentence id="4627">And I stayed in it for ten years, and after ten years, I honestly said to myself,  http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0467 &amp; RG-50.549.05*0001 90 I'm burned out, I have nothing more to give, and this is when I returned to regulating...teaching so-called normal children, if there is such thing. </sentence><sentence id="4628">And my wife, yeah, I met my wife at a teacher's meeting, and our superiors, our administrators, were a rather strange bunch of people, who had sometimes very unreasonable requests, and it had nothing to do with education, such as we should have two pairs of shoes in our drawers, so we would never have dusty shoes. </sentence><sentence id="4629">And saying this to people who had to go out in the playground almost every hour, I mean it was strange. </sentence><sentence id="4630">And they criticized the way we dressed or what we said, or we looked, and they didn't much do it to me, but to... because I was a man, and I was the only man on the faculty of the county, but mainly to women. </sentence><sentence id="4631">And... so I met my wife and at that time she was married with three children. </sentence><sentence id="4632">And she struck me as a kind of a person who doesn't really want others to know much about her. </sentence><sentence id="4633">And I found out later there was a reason for that. </sentence><sentence id="4634">Then... and we just discussed things, and I in my mind said, "Oh, this lady's quite cold." </sentence><sentence id="4635">That was my first impression. </sentence><sentence id="4636">And never bothered really much. </sentence><sentence id="4637">But, our path crossed at these meetings, and eventually, she was writing some kind of a publication for mentally retarded teachers, and she called me up, and... </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="4875">Q: What about when you lived in Germany and you're... you're there in this nation that had perpetrated these crimes, and people presumably were much more aware of the history there, than your acquaintances had been when you lived in the States. </sentence><sentence id="4876">Was it a bigger issue that The Holocaust? </sentence><sentence id="4877">Was it more of a... did it have more of a place in your life and did you talk about it with people? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="4881">A: The... now, this is a very complex story. </sentence><sentence id="4882">When we lived in Germany, which was from 1974 to 1993, I would say most of the time, when there was a West Germany and East Germany, the Holocaust was not a big problem, mainly because the West Germans were bringing it into the open. </sentence><sentence id="4883">It was not something hushed up under the rug. </sentence><sentence id="4884">There were discussions about it in schools. </sentence><sentence id="4885">I spoke about it to high school students, mainly. </sentence><sentence id="4886">The whole... the whole problem with the Holocaust and the way Germans would look at it, really started after the Unification. </sentence><sentence id="4887">Now, I must also say that there weren't too many people who were alive in World War IL, by this time. </sentence><sentence id="4888">Because I was fifteen when the war ended, and I am seventy now, almost. </sentence><sentence id="4889">And so, most people are dead, who were in World War II. </sentence><sentence id="4890">Now of course, it doesn't mean that Fascism as such, is dead, or was even... was dead. </sentence><sentence id="4891">Yes, I heard anti-Semitic remarks, and sometimes, when I felt that it was the proper thing to do, I responded, and sometimes when I looked at the person, and I realize it was a primitive old idiot, there was no reason to say anything. </sentence><sentence id="4892">It would have been totally superfluous to provoke anything, because it wouldn't have made any difference. </sentence><sentence id="4893">I rather concentrated on talking to people of the middle and the younger generation. </sentence><sentence id="4894">And I found that intellectually, at least, they understood what was the Holocaust. </sentence><sentence id="4895">They were very ashamed and sorry about it, and I felt no urge to drill in, with young people especially. </sentence><sentence id="4896">I felt that they were progressive enough. </sentence><sentence id="4897">The younger German generation amazed me, because I think they are very progressive, and I think they see history in the right light. </sentence><sentence id="4898">How... all this changed after the unification, because you had now Eastern Germany  http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0467 &amp; RG-50.549.05*0001 95 joining. </sentence><sentence id="4899">A country that was never taught proper history, where the Holocaust, oh well, only West Germans were responsible for the Holocaust, because all the Nazis, according to East Germany, were in West Germany. </sentence><sentence id="4900">So, those people had no background, and they had... they were not prepared for this historical fact and they denied it. </sentence><sentence id="4901">And this is why the skinhead movement and all the neo-Fascist organizations, basically, come from, East Germany, even today. </sentence><sentence id="4902">Add to this the usual reasons for Fascism and anti-Semitism, a very high unemployment and very bad economic conditions and the fact that unification didn't bring immediate remedies to all their problems. </sentence><sentence id="4903">So they had to again go back and blame the old scapegoat, the Jews, in spite of the fact that there aren't too many. </sentence><sentence id="4904">So, since they couldn't attack many who are living among them, they went back to the past. </sentence></p></dialogue>

And he said, "You open your mouth, and everybody says, "Oh, what a nice accent, where are you from?"" </sentence><sentence id="5190">And he said, "T open my mouth and they say, "Hey, you are not from here, are you?" </sentence><sentence id="5191">And you know what they mean," he says, "that I'm a damn Yankee." </sentence><sentence id="5192">And I don't know about this, but all I can say is that nobody has ever reacted negatively toward my accent. </sentence><sentence id="5193">I see that sometimes people smile when I talk to them, and I know why they do it and I consider it a friendly gesture. </sentence><sentence id="5194">And that's about it. </sentence><sentence id="5195">The only people I'm really mad at, the ones who listen to me for awhile and say, "What's that?" </sentence><sentence id="5196">Because I know that they are putting me on. </sentence><sentence id="5197">That... if schoolchildren could understand me, they could, too. </sentence><sentence id="5198">But... and another thing that, of course irritates me, when... my hearing is not that good any more, and this has nothing to do with accent and all this, it's just that some people are very intolerant, and if you ask, you know, "Will you please repeat it?" </sentence><sentence id="5199">They just say, "Forget it." </sentence><sentence id="5200">And the word forget it really irritates me. </sentence><sentence id="5201">But that has nothing to do with accent and being foreign born. </sentence><sentence id="5202">Otherwise, I find that people are much friendlier, even with my reservations about being suspicious, much friendlier than they were in some other states that I've travelled. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="5332">Q: Will you say something about what that experience is like? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="5334">A: Oh that, that is... I do this with great pleasure, because I know that... in this area, there are very few people, probably, who experienced the Holocaust, and even know what it is. </sentence><sentence id="5335">And so, one schoolteacher started this program in the local schools, and she always invites me, about two, three times a year. </sentence><sentence id="5336">And last time, it was a closed circuit television that they put me on, with some other classes around Kentucky. </sentence><sentence id="5337">And... but most of the time, I just talk to her classes... her combined classes or some other teachers bring in classes, and these are usually kids, thirteen, fourteen years old, and I like to talk to them, because that's how old I was when the real disaster hit me. </sentence><sentence id="5338">And so I can kind of get down to their level of understanding and explain certain things to them. </sentence><sentence id="5339">And I find that they are very receptive, very receptive. </sentence><sentence id="5340">So, I consider it a mission. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="5389">Q: Have you not... I mean, well, you mentioned you hadn't experienced anti-Semitism, have you experienced anybody kind of asking you why don't you go to church, or you know, kind of asking you what church do you go to, or just expecting you to be Christian? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="5391">A: Yeah, I... that comes around a little bit more often, when the people just cannot comprehend that, how can anybody who doesn't steal, doesn't cheat, doesn't embezzle, has been married for thirty-three years, why am I not a church goer? </sentence><sentence id="5392">And that is what I have to explain many times to people. </sentence><sentence id="5393">Not only that, when I say I'm a non-believer, of course, I think I'm out of their favors. </sentence><sentence id="5394">And... but I try to make a point there, too, that one does not have to go to church and belong to a religion, to lead a decent life. </sentence><sentence id="5395">And I say that. </sentence><sentence id="5396">I look around and see how many people who go to church are in the news, beating their wives and embezzling money from the school's treasury, or from the county treasury or using highway funds for their own purposes. </sentence><sentence id="5397">You don't have to go. </sentence><sentence id="5398">You can set your own rules. </sentence><sentence id="5399">So, I do more argument about that than anything else. </sentence></p></dialogue>

I always say, I'm Jewish, but I am not a Jew... Iam a Jew, but I'm not Jewish. </sentence><sentence id="5414">And of course, first, nobody understands what I'm talking about. </sentence><sentence id="5415">And I say, "Ethnically speaking, I am a Jew. </sentence><sentence id="5416">I come from a ethnic group called the Semites and one of the subgroups are Jews." </sentence><sentence id="5417">I said, "Now these people have been mixed... intermingling with other people for over a thousand years, and therefore there is no such thing as a pure Jew, but then there's no such thing as a pure anything any more, since history mixed us up quite successfully. </sentence><sentence id="5418">But, when it comes to religion," I said, "even though I am a Jew, my religion is not Jewish. </sentence><sentence id="5419">I have no religion." </sentence><sentence id="5420">I said, "I am not... I do not belong to any organized religion." </sentence><sentence id="5421">So eventually I think they understand what I mean. </sentence></p></dialogue>

I think today there are close to three million Turks living in Germany, a country of sixty-five million people. </sentence><sentence id="5485">That's quite a bit, and of course, was tremendous resentment by some people to begin with. </sentence><sentence id="5486">But the real problem came not while the economic boom was on, the real problem came when it was over, because now you had a lot of people who were already adults, and born in Germany, to Turkish parents, and all the rest. </sentence><sentence id="5487">So now, here  http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0467 &amp; RG-50.549.05*0001 106 came the problem of what to do with them. </sentence><sentence id="5488">Are they citizens, are they not citizens? </sentence><sentence id="5489">And welfare, are they qualified for welfare? </sentence><sentence id="5490">So, I am afraid of the same thing here. </sentence><sentence id="5491">Right now, especially around here, in the Bluegrass, everybody who can think, knows that these illegal... or legal Mexican workers are fulfilling an important job. </sentence><sentence id="5492">They are working here in a job that most other people wouldn't take. </sentence><sentence id="5493">So, nobody has great reservations. </sentence><sentence id="5494">When they see... I heard that when they see something in the paper, that a thief was arrested, or a murder happened, and it is a Spanish name, they do mumble about it, which is natural, I don't consider this extraordinary. </sentence><sentence id="5495">But my biggest fear is, what is going to happen when this economic boom ends, and here we will be with these people. </sentence><sentence id="5496">Now, they are not going to work. </sentence><sentence id="5497">If they don't work, what will happen to them? </sentence><sentence id="5498">To their mind? </sentence><sentence id="5499">What will happen to those who watch around, and will take the opportunity to do the same as they do in Germany. </sentence><sentence id="5500">The skinheads in Germany were burning down the buildings where they lived. </sentence><sentence id="5501">People died in fire, they were beaten up on the street, or they were killed. </sentence><sentence id="5502">Several, several times this happened. </sentence><sentence id="5503">So, I hope that we'd... it doesn't come to this. </sentence><sentence id="5504">I think that the... we need more education, especially in the schools, to make these people welcome. </sentence><sentence id="5505">They are here for a reason, they are human beings, and just like anyone else in America, they came in by the same rights. </sentence><sentence id="5506">If there is illegal immigration, that is not for Kentucky to try to stop it, because we can't, it has to be stopped down on the border, that's not our problem. </sentence><sentence id="5507">But those who are here, they are here. </sentence><sentence id="5508">So what are you going to do? </sentence><sentence id="5509">But the churches, the schools, any institution, I think should work together to make sure that people know that these are human beings, these are not some alien group that is here only temporarily. </sentence><sentence id="5510">They are not here temporarily. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="5551">Q: Do you draw... when you think about this issue, does you mind draw parallels to your own experience, and experience of Jews in Europe? </sentence><sentence id="5552">I mean, even though it's not... I mean, with the Jews in Europe, they had been residents for hundreds and hundreds of years and they certainly belonged there, but... but the idea of some kind of economic problems making one majority group turn against a minority group and persecuting them. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="5560">A: ... yeah, oh, in this... in this respect, there is a comparison. </sentence><sentence id="5561">I... definitely, that... they would be made scapegoats, the minute the chips begin to fall. </sentence><sentence id="5562">But I don't think that in America we ever have a danger of the death camps or concentration camps any more. </sentence><sentence id="5563">I know that we had them, of course, on a much, much smaller and different scale, for the Japanese Americans in the West coast, but I don't think that would ever come to this. </sentence><sentence id="5564">I'm more afraid of individual treatment of these people. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="5570">Q: Incidents like skinheads getting... </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="5572">A: Yes, yes, yes, yes, and I would like to see that we deal in school, we deal with them  http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0467 &amp; RG-50.549.05*0001 107 realistically, that we let their children come to school without any reservation, because children in the world everywhere, makes no difference where they come from, where they go, they should be in school. </sentence><sentence id="5573">And number two is that we do not go overboard with bilingual education. </sentence><sentence id="5574">These kids know how to speak Spanish, they should know how to speak English, and even the families, I think, would appreciate the fact, that we would just throw them into an English speaking class, and I can guarantee that in three months, they would speak English, without even an accent. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="5580">Q: The one thing that I... that | missed asking was about your parents. </sentence><sentence id="5581">I... you mentioned, maybe in the last interview, that they came to the States, to visit for your wedding. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="5616">A: ... the Long Drug... the employees began to get a bit suspicious, what is this man doing here, and he was smiling always, because he couldn't speak a word of English. </sentence><sentence id="5617">So, finally, I had to... I explained, I talked to the people, and said, "This is my father, he doesn't speak any English, and he loves your store." </sentence><sentence id="5618">And this is all he did. </sentence><sentence id="5619">We drop him off here, he's totally harmless. </sentence><sentence id="5620">He never killed a fly in his life. </sentence><sentence id="5621">He just likes to... and so they laughed, and they just... and eventually they all kind of tried to communicate with him and he with them. </sentence><sentence id="5622">And another thing that... just blew his mind, that all you can eat little places in San Francisco. </sentence><sentence id="5623">And we used to go to one that had very nice stuff, steam  http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0467 &amp; RG-50.549.05*0001 108 table, of course. </sentence><sentence id="5624">And he just could not understand that here, we were five, seven people go, and of course, the kids kept going back and taking more and this and that, and so finally he said, "I can't," he said, "in Hungary, a restaurant like this would go broke in one day." </sentence><sentence id="5625">So, my wife went to get the manager, and it... she was a very nice lady, and explain to her where my father comes from and what these questions are, so she sat down with us, and she said... "cause my father said, "How do you make money, all you can eat?" </sentence><sentence id="5626">So, she then pointed out to my father, that look, "Here is your granddaughter. </sentence><sentence id="5627">Look what she has. </sentence><sentence id="5628">She really didn't take much. </sentence><sentence id="5629">Look at your wife, she didn't eat that much. </sentence><sentence id="5630">Look at you, you didn't eat that much. </sentence><sentence id="5631">The two boys," she said, "the two boys, okay, so they might take up... up to the price that they paid, but look, all of you, you're eat..." and so, she was very patiently explaining. </sentence><sentence id="5632">She said, "Our problem is not what people eat, it's what people try to put into their jacket." </sentence><sentence id="5633">She says, "You'd be surprised how many people come in here with a bag, and all this." </sentence><sentence id="5634">My father could not understand this, that even in America people... because he had, certainly, a very idealistic view of America. </sentence><sentence id="5635">But I forgot to tell you that every time we picked him up from Long's Drugstore, he learned this sentence to say. </sentence><sentence id="5636">First he learn it in... he said it in Hungarian, then I taught him how to say in English, so the children can understand. </sentence><sentence id="5637">He says, "This country is invincible." </sentence><sentence id="5638">After looking at the drugstore, he made up his mind, that based on this wealth that is in this... just in this store, and the way people just come in and can afford and buy, all this...he said, "This country, my son, is invincible." </sentence><sentence id="5639">He had unlimited faith in this country. </sentence><sentence id="5640">And I don't know whether in a previous interview I told you, when people ask him, "Why don't you stay here?" </sentence><sentence id="5641">He told them a joke. </sentence><sentence id="5642">I think I... </sentence></p></dialogue>
