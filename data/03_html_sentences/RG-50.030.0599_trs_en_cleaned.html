<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="87">A: Okay. </sentence><sentence id="88">I lived in Hamburg for the first nine years of my life. </sentence><sentence id="89">I clearly remember a few things about school. </sentence><sentence id="90">I can remember being stoned, finally, on the way home from school one day by children that I played with just the previous week. </sentence><sentence id="91">They were, obviously, put up to this by their parents, but that was sort of our -- my message to me and to my sisters to not return to school. </sentence><sentence id="92">So that was my end of my schooling in Germany. </sentence><sentence id="93">I was nine years old. </sentence><sentence id="94">I was, I remember, being angry at my father for not allowing me to join the Hitler youth, which you got to go on outings, camping trips, and hikes and like the Boy Scouts. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="103">Q: Right. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="105">A: But of course as a Jew they wouldn't have taken me anyway. </sentence><sentence id="106">But I really didn't understand too much of that at that time. </sentence><sentence id="107">It didn't become really obvious to me as a nine year old until Kristanant (ph) when I can clearly remember them, the Gestapo, knocking at the gates of our house in Hamburg to arrest my father as it was common on the night of November 9th, 1938 to arrest all male Jews above 13 or 14 years old. </sentence><sentence id="108">I was too young, but they were after my father. </sentence><sentence id="109">My father knew he would be arrested, but wanted to go together with his brother-in-law. </sentence><sentence id="110">So he went over to his brother-in-law's house and thought they would be arrested together. </sentence><sentence id="111">My mother greeted them at the door as they came in, in her housecoat. </sentence><sentence id="112">It was about Midnight, full of -- the housecoat, I remember, was full of my -- the metals that my father had earned fighting for the Germans in the first world war. </sentence><sentence id="113">He was a much decorated major in the artillery, in the mounted artillery, actually, and was heavily wounded. </sentence><sentence id="114">And she thought somehow that that would exclude him from being arrested, but of course it didn't. </sentence><sentence id="115">They didn't really -- This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="116">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="117"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection weren't interested in the metals. </sentence><sentence id="118">And they wanted to know where he was and they went and got him. </sentence><sentence id="119">Luckily enough, he was released about a week later, because one of the arresting officers actually had fought under him in the first world war and knew him personally from that. </sentence><sentence id="120">And many people were kept for months some were never released. </sentence><sentence id="121">But that finally opened his eyes that, gee, maybe we should really do something, try to get out of here. </sentence><sentence id="122">He has two brothers, incidentally, who are married and had families. </sentence><sentence id="123">One went three years earlier to France and one went two years earlier to London. </sentence><sentence id="124">But my father -- I discussed this with him many times -- thought like so many German Jews that this guy -- this upstar Hitler would blow over. </sentence><sentence id="125">It's a passing thing. </sentence><sentence id="126">We've just got to tough it out. </sentence><sentence id="127">Things will get back to normal again. </sentence><sentence id="128">And a lot of -- alot of Jews, German Jews, felt almost more German than Jewish in that respect. </sentence><sentence id="129">You've probably heard that before. </sentence><sentence id="130">So he made -- he made moves to -- after Gustalac -- opened his eyes and he made moves to try to get out. </sentence><sentence id="131">We had a very distant uncle in New York. </sentence><sentence id="132">You had to have -- America had no Open Door Policy and you had to have somebody vouch for you over here that you would not become a burden to the States or -- to the state or go on the welfare rolls. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="163">Q: Right. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="165">A: So we finally did get an exit visa to England. </sentence><sentence id="166">And we -- and on April 20th -- I remember April 20th, 1939, happened to be a -- that's the date of Hitler's birthday. </sentence><sentence id="167">We left for England. </sentence><sentence id="168">Stayed two months -- two months in England waiting for some kind of transportation to the States. </sentence><sentence id="169">We only had a transit visa in England so it wasn't -- wasn't a -- couldn't be a final destination. </sentence><sentence id="170">He stayed -- my father and mother stayed with his brother in London. </sentence><sentence id="171">I was -- there wasn't enough room, so I was put on a farm somewhere in Devonshire where I remember being very, very lonely. </sentence><sentence id="172">Couldn't speak a word of language -- couldn't speak a word of English at the time. </sentence><sentence id="173">Had to point to food and things like that and had to -- never really lived on a farm before. </sentence><sentence id="174">My sisters, incidentally, went on the Kindertransport a few months before we left; about six months before. </sentence><sentence id="175">They both were adopted by British families and they were on the Kindertransport. </sentence><sentence id="176">Both sisters. </sentence><sentence id="177">Okay. </sentence><sentence id="178">Then we finally got the -- on the SS Dinzeldike (ph) Dutch freighter with -- had room for 30 passengers going from London to San Francisco through the Panama Canal. </sentence><sentence id="179">Thirty days on the ocean. </sentence><sentence id="180">Very exciting for a boy of 9. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="197">Q: Right. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="199">A: Get lost on the ship and go to places where you're not allowed. </sentence><sentence id="200">And -- and I remember it as a very exciting -- exciting voyage, except we were told we were going to San Francisco and the only thing I ever heard about San Francisco was the earthquake of 1906. </sentence><sentence id="201">So I figured, well, probably going to live in a cardboard shack there because they </sentence></p><p><sentence id="202"> This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="203">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="204"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection </sentence></p><p><sentence id="205"> can't have any permanent houses. </sentence><sentence id="206">It must be all black lava sand. </sentence><sentence id="207">I had this weird idea of what a -- what an earthquake country would be like -- </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="208">Q: Right. </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="209">A: -- until the day we sailed under the Golden Gate Bridge. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="211">Q: Right. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="213">A: You know, and then of course, it was -- it was quite -- quite different. </sentence><sentence id="214">But it was a very weird expectation of where we would go. </sentence><sentence id="215">At this time, my father was the only one of our family of five that spoke English. </sentence><sentence id="216">He had been to England as a young man. </sentence><sentence id="217">And my sisters had picked up a little in their couple of -- in their six months in England. </sentence><sentence id="218">I spoke practically none at all, because during my time in England I wasn't there long enough to go to any kind of school. </sentence><sentence id="219">Schooling or anything. </sentence><sentence id="220">So basically I grew up in San Francisco. </sentence><sentence id="221">And we arrived during summer, so by the time school started, I pick up a lot of English on the streets already. </sentence><sentence id="222">For a nine year old it's very quick. </sentence><sentence id="223">I was supposed to be, by my age, in fifth grade. </sentence><sentence id="224">So they put me in fourth grade because I didn't speak enough English. </sentence><sentence id="225">And then they let me jump from fourth to sixth later on to catch on with my -- to catch up with my age group. </sentence><sentence id="226">But, what else can I tell you? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="241">Q: Well -- so, this is wonderful, because, you know, it gives an overview -- </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="242">A: Yeah. </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="243">Q: -- of the time. </sentence><sentence id="244">So if it's okay, if we just go back then and then maybe highlight some of the moments, you know, and talk -- </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="245">A: Okay. </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="246">Q: -- about any -- any other memories -- </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="247">A: Yeah, sure. </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="248">Q: -- related to that. </sentence><sentence id="249">So, again, in Hamburg and then before the stoning incident, had you experienced anything else, had you seen anything else? </sentence><sentence id="250">What was going on? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="254">A: Okay. </sentence><sentence id="255">Well, this reminds me of, as you know, Germany has a policy of inviting Holocaust survivors back to their original birth city. </sentence><sentence id="256">Right? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="260">Q: Yes. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="262">A: So several years ago -- that's been about eight or nine years ago now -- we were both invited back; my wife to Berlin and I was invited to Hamburg. </sentence><sentence id="263">And they show you the - - the city. </sentence><sentence id="264">But during that time while I was in Hamburg at the hotel, someone from the archives, much like you, came by to interview -- have a personal interview, get the story of each one. </sentence><sentence id="265">This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="266">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="267"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="382">Q: No, no. </sentence><sentence id="383">That's wonderful. </sentence><sentence id="384">Thanks for sharing. </sentence><sentence id="385">If it's okay, can we talk about your sisters and the family's decision, you know, the process of making the decision, what happened, how it happened, to get on the Kindertransport? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="390">A: Yeah. </sentence><sentence id="391">I've never quite figured out. </sentence><sentence id="392">And you know, it's -- it's interesting that after your parents die you think of all the millions of questions that you wish you would have asked them, which of course, they are not ask-able anymore. </sentence><sentence id="393">But I was relatively frail, underweight and very skinny. </sentence><sentence id="394">And for some reason or another, my parents decided to keep me with them and put them on the Kindertransport rather. </sentence><sentence id="395">Maybe they felt I was too young. </sentence><sentence id="396">My wife was six months younger than I am when she was put on the Kindertransport by her mother, you know. </sentence><sentence id="397">It's also very, very hard for me to conceive, as a parent, to conceive of what you must feel like to give your child up into the unknown, because you generally prefer the devil that you know that may be existing with you than the devil that you don't know and you have no idea what you're giving your child to this... In the -- in the film, what is it? </sentence><sentence id="398">The -- "Into The Arms of Strangers" there is this one very emotional scene where a father just simply pitches his baby through the train window and a teenager catches the baby and saved its life. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="408">Q: Yeah. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="410">A: But for a parent to give up a child into the unknown like that is very difficult. </sentence><sentence id="411">But anyway, my sisters both went out, I think about four months before we did. </sentence><sentence id="412">Actually, on separate Kindertransports. </sentence><sentence id="413">And my oldest sister, Susan, stayed with my -- stayed with my father's brother. </sentence><sentence id="414">My younger sister Eva was adopted by a Jewish cab driver in London with whom she corresponded with for many years after she came back here, and was treated very well. </sentence><sentence id="415">Some of the children had much worse experience, as you probably heard. </sentence><sentence id="416">Some were taken advantage of, some were used as domestic servants. </sentence><sentence id="417">But my wife's -- my wife was adopted by a Quaker family and grew up as a Quaker and also was treated very well. </sentence><sentence id="418">A lot of Quakers came forward to adopt children. </sentence><sentence id="419">Okay. </sentence><sentence id="420">My sister in New York, for example, I've tried to get her into the Kindertransport organization or such. </sentence><sentence id="421">Well, she's listed in it, but she really is a denier. </sentence><sentence id="422">She never would want to step foot on Germany. </sentence><sentence id="423">She would never -- she hasn't told her kids much about this. </sentence><sentence id="424">She doesn't -- she really -- and she's -- she was the oldest. </sentence><sentence id="425">She was actually -- I was -- yeah. </sentence><sentence id="426">She was 16 at the time, so she would have a better memory than anything and she's forgotten everything. </sentence><sentence id="427">She's forgotten everything. </sentence><sentence id="428">She's remembers nothing about the voyage, the trip, or anything. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="448">Q: Right. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="467">Q: Really. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="469">A: She never mentioned it at all. </sentence><sentence id="470">And you know, they worked together for a couple of years. </sentence><sentence id="471">And my wife was just blown away that somebody would just totally -- </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="472">Q: Right. </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="473">A: -- you know, deny that. </sentence></p></dialogue>
