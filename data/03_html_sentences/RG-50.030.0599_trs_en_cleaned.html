<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="82">A: Okay. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="84">Q: Let's talk, if you will, about your earliest memories in Hamburg. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="86">A: Okay. </sentence><sentence id="87">I lived in Hamburg for the first nine years of my life. </sentence><sentence id="88">I clearly remember a few things about school. </sentence><sentence id="89">I can remember being stoned, finally, on the way home from school one day by children that I played with just the previous week. </sentence><sentence id="90">They were, obviously, put up to this by their parents, but that was sort of our -- my message to me and to my sisters to not return to school. </sentence><sentence id="91">So that was my end of my schooling in Germany. </sentence><sentence id="92">I was nine years old. </sentence><sentence id="93">I was, I remember, being angry at my father for not allowing me to join the Hitler youth, which you got to go on outings, camping trips, and hikes and like the Boy Scouts. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="102">Q: Right. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="104">A: But of course as a Jew they wouldn't have taken me anyway. </sentence><sentence id="105">But I really didn't understand too much of that at that time. </sentence><sentence id="106">It didn't become really obvious to me as a nine year old until Kristanant (ph) when I can clearly remember them, the Gestapo, knocking at the gates of our house in Hamburg to arrest my father as it was common on the night of November 9th, 1938 to arrest all male Jews above 13 or 14 years old. </sentence><sentence id="107">I was too young, but they were after my father. </sentence><sentence id="108">My father knew he would be arrested, but wanted to go together with his brother-in-law. </sentence><sentence id="109">So he went over to his brother-in-law's house and thought they would be arrested together. </sentence><sentence id="110">My mother greeted them at the door as they came in, in her housecoat. </sentence><sentence id="111">It was about Midnight, full of -- the housecoat, I remember, was full of my -- the metals that my father had earned fighting for the Germans in the first world war. </sentence><sentence id="112">He was a much decorated major in the artillery, in the mounted artillery, actually, and was heavily wounded. </sentence><sentence id="113">And she thought somehow that that would exclude him from being arrested, but of course it didn't. </sentence><sentence id="114">They didn't really -- weren't interested in the metals. </sentence><sentence id="115">And they wanted to know where he was and they went and got him. </sentence><sentence id="116">Luckily enough, he was released about a week later, because one of the arresting officers actually had fought under him in the first world war and knew him personally from that. </sentence><sentence id="117">And many people were kept for months some were never released. </sentence><sentence id="118">But that finally opened his eyes that, gee, maybe we should really do something, try to get out of here. </sentence><sentence id="119">He has two brothers, incidentally, who are married and had families. </sentence><sentence id="120">One went three years earlier to France and one went two years earlier to London. </sentence><sentence id="121">But my father -- I discussed this with him many times -- thought like so many German Jews that this guy -- this upstar Hitler would blow over. </sentence><sentence id="122">It's a passing thing. </sentence><sentence id="123">We've just got to tough it out. </sentence><sentence id="124">Things will get back to normal again. </sentence><sentence id="125">And a lot of -- alot of Jews, German Jews, felt almost more German than Jewish in that respect. </sentence><sentence id="126">You've probably heard that before. </sentence><sentence id="127">So he made -- he made moves to -- after Gustalac -- opened his eyes and he made moves to try to get out. </sentence><sentence id="128">We had a very distant uncle in New York. </sentence><sentence id="129">You had to have -- America had no Open Door Policy and you had to have somebody vouch for you over here that you would not become a burden to the States or -- to the state or go on the welfare rolls. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="157">Q: Right. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="159">A: So we finally did get an exit visa to England. </sentence><sentence id="160">And we -- and on April 20th -- I remember April 20th, 1939, happened to be a -- that's the date of Hitler's birthday. </sentence><sentence id="161">We left for England. </sentence><sentence id="162">Stayed two months -- two months in England waiting for some kind of transportation to the States. </sentence><sentence id="163">We only had a transit visa in England so it wasn't -- wasn't a -- couldn't be a final destination. </sentence><sentence id="164">He stayed -- my father and mother stayed with his brother in London. </sentence><sentence id="165">I was -- there wasn't enough room, so I was put on a farm somewhere in Devonshire where I remember being very, very lonely. </sentence><sentence id="166">Couldn't speak a word of language -- couldn't speak a word of English at the time. </sentence><sentence id="167">Had to point to food and things like that and had to -- never really lived on a farm before. </sentence><sentence id="168">My sisters, incidentally, went on the Kindertransport a few months before we left; about six months before. </sentence><sentence id="169">They both were adopted by British families and they were on the Kindertransport. </sentence><sentence id="170">Both sisters. </sentence><sentence id="171">Okay. </sentence><sentence id="172">Then we finally got the -- on the SS Dinzeldike (ph) Dutch freighter with -- had room for 30 passengers going from London to San Francisco through the Panama Canal. </sentence><sentence id="173">Thirty days on the ocean. </sentence><sentence id="174">Very exciting for a boy of 9. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="191">Q: Right. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="193">A: Get lost on the ship and go to places where you're not allowed. </sentence><sentence id="194">And -- and I remember it as a very exciting -- exciting voyage, except we were told we were going to San Francisco and the only thing I ever heard about San Francisco was the earthquake of 1906. </sentence><sentence id="195">So I figured, well, probably going to live in a cardboard shack there because they </sentence></p><p><sentence id="196"> can't have any permanent houses. </sentence><sentence id="197">It must be all black lava sand. </sentence><sentence id="198">I had this weird idea of what a -- what an earthquake country would be like -- </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="199">Q: Right. </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="200">A: -- until the day we sailed under the Golden Gate Bridge. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="202">Q: Right. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="204">A: You know, and then of course, it was -- it was quite -- quite different. </sentence><sentence id="205">But it was a very weird expectation of where we would go. </sentence><sentence id="206">At this time, my father was the only one of our family of five that spoke English. </sentence><sentence id="207">He had been to England as a young man. </sentence><sentence id="208">And my sisters had picked up a little in their couple of -- in their six months in England. </sentence><sentence id="209">I spoke practically none at all, because during my time in England I wasn't there long enough to go to any kind of school. </sentence><sentence id="210">Schooling or anything. </sentence><sentence id="211">So basically I grew up in San Francisco. </sentence><sentence id="212">And we arrived during summer, so by the time school started, I pick up a lot of English on the streets already. </sentence><sentence id="213">For a nine year old it's very quick. </sentence><sentence id="214">I was supposed to be, by my age, in fifth grade. </sentence><sentence id="215">So they put me in fourth grade because I didn't speak enough English. </sentence><sentence id="216">And then they let me jump from fourth to sixth later on to catch on with my -- to catch up with my age group. </sentence><sentence id="217">But, what else can I tell you? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="232">Q: Well -- so, this is wonderful, because, you know, it gives an overview -- </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="233">A: Yeah. </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="234">Q: -- of the time. </sentence><sentence id="235">So if it's okay, if we just go back then and then maybe highlight some of the moments, you know, and talk -- </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="236">A: Okay. </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="237">Q: -- about any -- any other memories -- </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="238">A: Yeah, sure. </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="239">Q: -- related to that. </sentence><sentence id="240">So, again, in Hamburg and then before the stoning incident, had you experienced anything else, had you seen anything else? </sentence><sentence id="241">What was going on? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="245">A: Okay. </sentence><sentence id="246">Well, this reminds me of, as you know, Germany has a policy of inviting Holocaust survivors back to their original birth city. </sentence><sentence id="247">Right? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="251">Q: Yes. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="253">A: So several years ago -- that's been about eight or nine years ago now -- we were both invited back; my wife to Berlin and I was invited to Hamburg. </sentence><sentence id="254">And they show you the - - the city. </sentence><sentence id="255">But during that time while I was in Hamburg at the hotel, someone from the archives, much like you, came by to interview -- have a personal interview, get the story of each one. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="259">Q: Right. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="261">A: Okay. </sentence><sentence id="262">So I did that interview. </sentence><sentence id="263">And then several years later I was called by a movie producer in Germany, Nina Koshofer -- who was Nina Koshofer, who was in the process of doing a very, very ambitious project of a documentary on the Jews sponsored by German television and French televisions stations. </sentence><sentence id="264">That's called -- do you speak German at all? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="269">Q: I don't speak German. </sentence><sentence id="270">No. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="273">A: It's called -- in English it's The Jews, History Of A People. </sentence><sentence id="274">In German it's (speaks in German). </sentence><sentence id="275">And it was running for -- it's a five-hour documentary. </sentence><sentence id="276">It was running for five consecutive days on television, an hour each. </sentence><sentence id="277">It was sort of -- it ended up sort of a little bit like Roots was in this country, which was the history of black slavery. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="283">Q: Right. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="285">A: Here you may have seen it. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="287">Q: Yeah. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="289">A: Which also ran about four or five days ina row. </sentence><sentence id="290">And it was a very thorough documentary. </sentence><sentence id="291">She spent three and a half years traveling to Israel, Lithuania, France, Germany, everywhere to film this thing. </sentence><sentence id="292">So she had some good funding from these television stations. </sentence><sentence id="293">And believe it or not, she brought her whole -- whole camera crew over to San Luis Obispo, California and filmed us, and filmed the Shabbat, the evening meal which we had to stage on a Sunday night, instead of Friday, because she happened to be here on Sunday -- </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="294">Q: Right. </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="295">A: -- you know. </sentence><sentence id="296">And did quite an extensive interview. </sentence><sentence id="297">So this -- this documentary ran. </sentence><sentence id="298">Ihave a DVD of it. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="303">Q: Uh-huh. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="305">A: It ran both in Europe and it has not run on PBS yet but it's scheduled. </sentence><sentence id="306">It's scheduled to run on PBS. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="309">Q: Wonderful. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="311">A: So it really starts sort of with Moses and ends with our family in San Luis Obispo. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="313">Q: Wow. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="315">A: So it's really long. </sentence><sentence id="316">It's interesting. </sentence><sentence id="317">But she -- the reason I was picked for this is because of this interview that I did in Hamburg. </sentence><sentence id="318">She ran -- she read through all these archives, all these interviews -- </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="319">Q: Right. </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="320">A: -- and said, I need somebody who has been kicked out of Germany who was a hero in the first world war. </sentence><sentence id="321">They really wanted to interview my father, but because he wasn't alive anymore, so they settled with me. </sentence><sentence id="322">And one of the -- one of the episodes of my life that they -- they staged in this film with somebody portraying the young kid -- nine year old kid portraying me, which might be interesting here, was because -- you asked me to go back to remember things. </sentence><sentence id="323">I remembered very clearly the Gestapo coming in and surveying all our belongings, which they did. </sentence><sentence id="324">I still have a list of -- a very, very detailed list. </sentence><sentence id="325">So many handkerchiefs, so much linen, so many knives, forks, and spoons; all the inventory. </sentence><sentence id="326">Most of which was confiscated. </sentence><sentence id="327">Ones -- we were allowed to take one knife, fork, and spoon per person. </sentence><sentence id="328">For a family of five we could take five things with us. </sentence><sentence id="329">And anything of value that they wanted too, any ornamentation that we had around. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="330">And we had a large vase, vase, a carved glass vase with a gold rim on the top. </sentence><sentence id="331">And I noticed they were going through getting anything -- any metals of any value, silver or gold, or anything that they were confiscating. </sentence><sentence id="332">So while they were rummaging through the house -- I was watching this -- I took this vase and held it under the kitchen faucet under hot water and wanted to see if the rim would come off. </sentence><sentence id="333">And tapped it, and believe it or not, the rim came right off. </sentence><sentence id="334">So they took the rim and they left us the vase. </sentence><sentence id="335">We still have the vase in our living room at home now. </sentence><sentence id="336">They were only interested in the -- </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="337">Q: Right. </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="338">A: -- in the metal part. </sentence><sentence id="339">Not the vase. </sentence><sentence id="340">It's a large carved glass vase. </sentence><sentence id="341">I thought it was quite handsome. </sentence><sentence id="342">Anyway, that part they staged in this -- in this little film, the history of the Jews there, and -- and a lot of my father's exploits in the first world war as a major. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="343">I'm not sure what else I can tell you except the thought of this has never -- the thought of our background is somehow never very far from -- from my -- I've been a Professor of Architecture at Cal Poly San Luis Obispo and I've concentrated on minority populations. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="344">I guess -- I'm guess it's related to the background of minorities. </sentence><sentence id="345">And we do talk to high school groups and college groups and various groups in -- in Californi </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="346">A: I would like to do that. </sentence><sentence id="347">I haven't done that yet in Germany. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="350">Q: Right. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="352">A: It would be interesting to do that in Germany. </sentence><sentence id="353">Go ahead. </sentence><sentence id="354">Now ask me something else. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="358">Q: No, no. </sentence><sentence id="359">That's wonderful. </sentence><sentence id="360">Thanks for sharing. </sentence><sentence id="361">If it's okay, can we talk about your sisters and the family's decision, you know, the process of making the decision, what happened, how it happened, to get on the Kindertransport? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="366">A: Yeah. </sentence><sentence id="367">I've never quite figured out. </sentence><sentence id="368">And you know, it's -- it's interesting that after your parents die you think of all the millions of questions that you wish you would have asked them, which of course, they are not ask-able anymore. </sentence><sentence id="369">But I was relatively frail, underweight and very skinny. </sentence><sentence id="370">And for some reason or another, my parents decided to keep me with them and put them on the Kindertransport rather. </sentence><sentence id="371">Maybe they felt I was too young. </sentence><sentence id="372">My wife was six months younger than I am when she was put on the Kindertransport by her mother, you know. </sentence><sentence id="373">It's also very, very hard for me to conceive, as a parent, to conceive of what you must feel like to give your child up into the unknown, because you generally prefer the devil that you know that may be existing with you than the devil that you don't know and you have no idea what you're giving your child to this... In the -- in the film, what is it? </sentence><sentence id="374">The -- "Into The Arms of Strangers" there is this one very emotional scene where a father just simply pitches his baby through the train window and a teenager catches the baby and saved its life. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="384">Q: Yeah. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="386">A: But for a parent to give up a child into the unknown like that is very difficult. </sentence><sentence id="387">But anyway, my sisters both went out, I think about four months before we did. </sentence><sentence id="388">Actually, on separate Kindertransports. </sentence><sentence id="389">And my oldest sister, Susan, stayed with my -- stayed with my father's brother. </sentence><sentence id="390">My younger sister Eva was adopted by a Jewish cab driver in London with whom she corresponded with for many years after she came back here, and was treated very well. </sentence><sentence id="391">Some of the children had much worse experience, as you probably heard. </sentence><sentence id="392">Some were taken advantage of, some were used as domestic servants. </sentence><sentence id="393">But my wife's -- my wife was adopted by a Quaker family and grew up as a Quaker and also was treated very well. </sentence><sentence id="394">A lot of Quakers came forward to adopt children. </sentence><sentence id="395">Okay. </sentence><sentence id="396">My sister in New York, for example, I've tried to get her into the Kindertransport organization or such. </sentence><sentence id="397">Well, she's listed in it, but she really is a denier. </sentence><sentence id="398">She never would want to step foot on Germany. </sentence><sentence id="399">She would never -- she hasn't told her kids much about this. </sentence><sentence id="400">She doesn't -- she really -- and she's -- she was the oldest. </sentence><sentence id="401">She was actually -- I was -- yeah. </sentence><sentence id="402">She was 16 at the time, so she would have a better memory than anything and she's forgotten everything. </sentence><sentence id="403">She's forgotten everything. </sentence><sentence id="404">She's remembers nothing about the voyage, the trip, or anything. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="424">Q: Right. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="426">A: So, it's very interesting. </sentence><sentence id="427">My wife just recently published a book about her experience. </sentence><sentence id="428">Shedding Skins. </sentence><sentence id="429">I don't know if she mentioned to you, but she had -- she worked very closely with a Jewish editor in our -- in our city that proofread the book and would give her pointers on it. </sentence><sentence id="430">And shortly after that -- her publication -- this editor died. </sentence><sentence id="431">And we went to the funeral service and learned through the editor's daughter that she was also a "Kind" and she never mentioned it. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="438">Q: Really. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="440">A: She never mentioned it at all. </sentence><sentence id="441">And you know, they worked together for a couple of years. </sentence><sentence id="442">And my wife was just blown away that somebody would just totally -- </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="443">Q: Right. </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="444">A: -- you know, deny that. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="446">Q: Uh-huh. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="448">A: Okay. </sentence><sentence id="449">What else? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="452">Q: Is everything okay? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="454">A: No. </sentence><sentence id="455">I wanted to show you something. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="458">Q: Okay. </sentence><sentence id="459">Great. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="488">Teacher sort of picked us up by our scruffs of our necks and was going to kick us out. </sentence><sentence id="489">But I realized that -- that you know, the prejudice wasn't just limited to Germany. </sentence><sentence id="490">Why would -- it happened here too. </sentence><sentence id="491">I am the keeper of our family passports so I still have my -- my Nazi passport. </sentence><sentence id="492">We were all given the middle name of Israel, as you probably know. </sentence><sentence id="493">I had hair once too. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="545">A: Yes. </sentence><sentence id="546">Okay. </sentence><sentence id="547">My father was a -- started a coffee firm in Hamburg, importing coffee and processing it from Guatemala, so that's all he really knew was coffee. </sentence><sentence id="548">So when we came to this country he started peddling coffee house -- until he found a firm here, he started peddling coffee house to house, selling coffee by the pound from house to house, by foot, because he never learned to drive in Germany. </sentence><sentence id="549">He had a chauffeur. </sentence><sentence id="550">Over here he just never learned to drive, even all the years he was here. </sentence><sentence id="551">But after about, oh, I'd say six months approximately of peddling coffee he realized he could not support a family </sentence></p><p><sentence id="552"> of five by selling coffee, and yet that was about the extent of what he knew. </sentence><sentence id="553">So he found a job on the San Francisco waterfront and became a stevedore. </sentence><sentence id="554">And for the first time in his life really did -- did physical eight to five. </sentence><sentence id="555">He was a union member and working on the waterfront. </sentence><sentence id="556">And told me, I remember, that in many ways he preferred that because at 5:00 he could no longer -- he would no longer have to worry about his -- his business. </sentence><sentence id="557">He was -- his time was his own. </sentence><sentence id="558">He worked strictly from eight to five. </sentence><sentence id="559">It was tough physical work, but he was free of any -- any kind of other concerns and obligations. </sentence><sentence id="560">And my mother started being a saleswoman in a department store. </sentence><sentence id="561">No. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="562">She started -- first of all, she started cleaning people's houses. </sentence><sentence id="563">She was a domestic house cleaner cleaning people's house for many years and then she became a sales clerk in a department store. </sentence><sentence id="564">And so we all -- we had pitched in. </sentence><sentence id="565">We all had some kind of jobs. </sentence><sentence id="566">There was a Jewish Council of 1933 which helped us get an apartment in San Francisco. </sentence><sentence id="567">It helps you get settled a little bit. </sentence><sentence id="568">I still spoke, always, German when I came home, and English in school. </sentence><sentence id="569">So my sisters also had jobs. </sentence><sentence id="570">I started sweeping out - - [remember my first job sweeping out a plumbing store and a grocery store for eleven cents an hour. </sentence><sentence id="571">I remember that. </sentence><sentence id="572">When I finally figured out how much I was making an hour, I quit and got the job at 20 cents an hour somewhere else. </sentence><sentence id="573">But that was -- yeah, that was in San Francisco. </sentence><sentence id="574">So I never really had a much -- through junior high and high school, I never had any much social life at all because I had a job after school almost all the time. </sentence><sentence id="575">So we all sort of -- we all sort of pitched in. </sentence><sentence id="576">I was the only one of the -- I was the only one in my family fortunate enough to go to a university. </sentence><sentence id="577">I went to U C Berkley and studied architecture. </sentence><sentence id="578">And got drafted into the U.S. Army during the Korean War, which was -- they sent me to Germany, which was a good place to be during the Korean War. </sentence><sentence id="579">And it was very interesting for me, because I would -- this was 1955, ten years after the end of the war. </sentence><sentence id="580">And I could very easily put on civies and go into a bar and sit down and have a beer and listen to everybody refighting the Second World War which was fascinating for me, you know. </sentence><sentence id="581">And an awful lot of denial going on. </sentence><sentence id="582">Hitler, who was he? </sentence><sentence id="583">And you know -- sort of thing. </sentence><sentence id="584">Or I -- I was not a Nazi. </sentence><sentence id="585">And I always would ask what time -- what point they joined the Nazi party, because if they joined in the late -- in the -- "44, early "45, "43, then they probably weren't convinced Nazis because by that time they had to join in order to survive. </sentence><sentence id="586">But those who joined in the early forties, and even the late thirties were pretty -- pretty convinced of that, you know. </sentence><sentence id="587">So anti- semitism was not that -- I had no desire to -- to live there. </sentence><sentence id="588">I was glad, glad to be part of the US Army. </sentence><sentence id="589">That was -- </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="590">Q: (Inaudible). </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="591">A: Yeah. </sentence><sentence id="592">It was very interesting. </sentence><sentence id="593">In fact, I was there during the time when the Germans were being asked by NATO to rearm and develop their own Army. </sentence><sentence id="594">And I was a corporal. </sentence><sentence id="595">And we had -- we started getting orders that when we meet German officers we were to salute. </sentence><sentence id="596">I could never bring myself to do that. </sentence><sentence id="597">So I'd go down the street and a   German officer would start approaching me. </sentence><sentence id="598">And of course, the -- the lower rank is supposed to salute first. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="608">Q: Right. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="610">A: And the upper rank then returns the salute, but with me it was -- I was -- I teased them to call me, but they never really did. </sentence><sentence id="611">But I would never, never salute. </sentence><sentence id="612">Finally, when the officer gets up to me, he salutes -- </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="613">Q: Right. </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="614">A: -- you know, and then I would return the salute. </sentence><sentence id="615">Or I would not -- no. </sentence><sentence id="616">Actually, I did not return the salute. </sentence><sentence id="617">But as far as expecting to be called out on this, and never did. </sentence><sentence id="618">Never did. </sentence><sentence id="619">They probably suspected, oh, this guy's Jewish. </sentence><sentence id="620">He's not going to salute me. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="628">Q: Right. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="630">A: And it was interesting at that time. </sentence><sentence id="631">I did a little research on my own and found out that in schools nothing was -- at that time, nothing was being taught at all about the Nazi er </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="632">A: They did -- they do now. </sentence><sentence id="633">They have picked it up a lot, but at that time, ten years after the war it was just total denial. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="636">Q: Right. </sentence><sentence id="637">Right. </sentence><sentence id="638">Great. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="642">A: Okay. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="650">Q: Absolutely. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="652">A: This -- that is very interesting. </sentence><sentence id="653">And I think the Holocaust -- you guys either would have one -- have it already. </sentence><sentence id="654">I don't know how you -- if you research other -- what other countries do. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="668">Q: We will -- I will definitely talk to somebody about that. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="670">A: It's available in English now and in German, and I think in French too -- </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="671">Q: Wonderful. </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="672">A: -- now. </sentence><sentence id="673">So it's a -- it's a good thing to have. </sentence><sentence id="674">Yeah. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="678">Q: And maybe if we could talk about your children. </sentence><sentence id="679">And you talked to them about -- I mean, obviously, you're the keeper of family histories and -- </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="680">A: Yeah. </sentence><sentence id="681">We're trying not do the same mistake that I did with my parents by not asking enough questions. </sentence><sentence id="682">And now as our children are -- are getting older, you know, they're what, 46, 44, and 42, so they're -- and they have children of their own. </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="683">Q: Right. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="685">A: So particularly my son is very, very -- I took -- I took him along when we were invited to Germany. </sentence><sentence id="686">Did I -- Oh. </sentence><sentence id="687">I'm sorry. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="691">Q: -- really quick. </sentence><sentence id="692">No. </sentence><sentence id="693">Actually, we can just... </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="705">Q: Put it on a little tighter. </sentence><sentence id="706">Great. </sentence><sentence id="707">Okay. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="711">A: What do you want -- you want me to repeat something? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="713">Q: Just, if we could just go back a little bit about -- </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="714">A: Okay. </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="715">Q: You were speaking about your son. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="717">A: Okay. </sentence><sentence id="718">My son is probably the most, I'd say the most Jewish of the three of us -- three of my children. </sentence><sentence id="719">And we took him with us to Germany for this visit to Hamburg and Berlin. </sentence><sentence id="720">And he's also a member of Kin 2. </sentence><sentence id="721">He did a stint in Israel. </sentence><sentence id="722">He speaks fluent Hebrew. </sentence><sentence id="723">He joined the Israeli defense forces for a short time to free -- to free natives for fighting -- for fighting. </sentence><sentence id="724">They train foreigners to be sort of domestic part of the IDF. </sentence><sentence id="725">He teaches Spanish in Berkley. </sentence><sentence id="726">Interestingly enough, it's part of, I think, our effect on our children that they have all gone into professions, non-entrepreneurial professions, but they are more -- much more interested in working with and helping people. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="727">My daughter is a physical therapist. </sentence><sentence id="728">My other daughter in New York works for the Innocence Project with Berry Scheck. </sentence><sentence id="729">She's a lawyer by training. </sentence><sentence id="730">Works with the Innocence Project. </sentence><sentence id="731">And Charles teaches Spanish. </sentence><sentence id="732">And I've been teaching, primarily trying to sensitize architects, architecture students to designing for disabilities, working with disabled people. </sentence><sentence id="733">And most 20 year old architecture students feel they're totally indestructible so they don't really think about accessibility within a building. </sentence><sentence id="734">So that's more or less what I'm concentrating on, and dealing a lot with just diverse populations, designing for diversity. </sentence><sentence id="735">So I think it's had an influence on teaching and on our value </sentence></p><p><sentence id="736"> system and in general. </sentence><sentence id="737">I think, you know, most of the people there have gone -- in the conference I noticed too have gone into some kind of -- of a field in the humanities rather than business, which is very interesting sort of a side effect on it -- </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="738">Q: Absolutely. </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="739">A: -- on what's been happening. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="741">Q: Absolutely. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="743">A: Otherwise, we've tried to share things with our children, tried to answer their questions as much as possible as what we remember. </sentence><sentence id="744">We wish we remember more precisely. </sentence><sentence id="745">That's about it. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="749">Q: Wonderful. </sentence><sentence id="750">Well, thank you, thank you, thank you so much for -- </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="751">A: Okay. </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="752">Q: -- for the interview and for sharing with us today. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="754">A: I'll probably think of a lot of things that I didn't -- I didn't mention, but -- in fact, you know -- </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="755">Q: Actually -- yeah, actually, maybe that would be a good idea if we can take a minute. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="756">I can just pause it and then if you want to just sit. </sentence><sentence id="757">I have the time if you have the time and we can -- if you have -- </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="758">A: 12:30, I guess. </sentence><sentence id="759">Yeah. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="762">Q: If there's anything that, you know, you want to just think about and then -- </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="763">A: Yeah. </sentence><sentence id="764">We can go ahead -- </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="765">Q: Let's just do that. </sentence><sentence id="766">So I'm going to just pause it and then... Great. </sentence><sentence id="767">So we are recording again after a pause with Paul to collect our thoughts. </sentence><sentence id="768">And once again, we discussed you would like to tell us about your grandparents. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="773">A: Yeah. </sentence><sentence id="774">I was unfortunate to know -- only one of my grandparents was alive when -- when I was born. </sentence><sentence id="775">And that was my mother's mother; my grandmother, Rosa Abeles, or Omas (ph) as we called her. </sentence><sentence id="776">She -- we tried very hard through the Red Cross to try to get her out afterwards because she refused to come out with us. </sentence><sentence id="777">She was old, elderly, overweight and -- and devoted only to Germany, really. </sentence><sentence id="778">Didn't have -- didn't -- would not leave Germany under any circumstances. </sentence><sentence id="779">And we tried very hard through the Geneva Red Cross and finally learned at the end of the war that she had died in Theresienstadt in the concentration camps in Theresienstadt where a lot of older people were taken. </sentence><sentence id="780">After doing some research at Yad Vashem when we went to Israel years later, we looked up the date -- the dates that she was there, which Germany is of course incredible at recordkeeping. </sentence><sentence id="781">They keep records of everything. </sentence><sentence id="782">And we found that she was at Theresienstadt for about six months period until she died, probably of starvation, at the -- at the same time that my wife's grandmother was also at Theresienstadt. </sentence><sentence id="783">They could have possibly known each other years and years before we ever met. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="796">Q: Right. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="798">A: You know, I didn't meet my wife until 1960. </sentence><sentence id="799">So it's very possible that they might have known each other, as it is just one of those very strange coincidences. </sentence><sentence id="800">I'm often asked in talks in school what affect this has had on -- on my faith. </sentence><sentence id="801">And I have to admit that the whole experience probably made me more Jewish than I would have been in Germany, because we are relatively secular Jews and am still -- I do -- we do belong to a synagogue here as we did in Hamburg, but it's reformed. </sentence><sentence id="802">As you know, Jews have reformed conservative and orthodox. </sentence><sentence id="803">So it's very much on the liberal or reformed side here. </sentence><sentence id="804">But certainly, I felt more Jewish because of what's happened there. </sentence><sentence id="805">It was interesting when we first came to America -- this was almost a couple years before Pearl Harbor, but only -- we arrived here 30 days, directly 30 days after the war in Europe broke out. </sentence><sentence id="806">We arrived on August Ist. </sentence><sentence id="807">The war started September 1, 1939.And we were treated as enemy aliens here. </sentence><sentence id="808">We were considered German. </sentence><sentence id="809">When the Japanese were deported from the west coast after Pearl Harbor, there was serious talk about doing the same thing with the Germans. </sentence><sentence id="810">They never did it because our skin color was not so obviously different from everybody else's skin color, but there was serious talk about also doing that. </sentence><sentence id="811">I remember the FBI coming into our apartment in San Francisco, confiscating a Grundig radio that we had brought over because they thought it might receive shortwave. </sentence><sentence id="812">It didn't receive shortwave of course, but they confiscated it anyway. </sentence><sentence id="813">So at this time the Deutsch of Bund, the German Bund was marching up and down the streets of New York holding demonstrations. </sentence><sentence id="814">So America really had not a clue as to what was really happening there at all. </sentence><sentence id="815">And I was very instrumental in our little community here. </sentence><sentence id="816">We just finished building the very first LEED certified synagogue in the world. </sentence><sentence id="817">A LEED is an international standard for rating energy efficient buildings. </sentence><sentence id="818">It simply means Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design. </sentence><sentence id="819">And so I was quite instrumental in getting that designed and built and LEED certified. </sentence><sentence id="820">So Lam active in that respect. </sentence><sentence id="821">I think the effect that this whole thing has had on me more is to -- is to really be very, very conscious of any type -- any types of discrimination. </sentence><sentence id="822">Right now I'm working closely with a Moslem group which is getting a lot of prejudice in our area, and in many areas. </sentence><sentence id="823">Kids are being picked on in school. </sentence><sentence id="824">There's -- there's just a lot of -- a lot of the same kind of ignorant prejudice. </sentence><sentence id="825">It comes really out of ignorance more than anything else, of not understanding and not even wanting to understand. </sentence><sentence id="826">You know, when I went back in the military to Germany I was the first Jew that many Germans had ever met, or had any contact with whatsoever, you know. </sentence><sentence id="827">But when they said, we had no idea of what was really going on, that was very questionable, because they -- well, maybe they knew enough not to ask the right questions. </sentence><sentence id="828">That was -- but they did see their neighbors disappearing and -- and all kinds of things. </sentence><sentence id="829">One thing I left out is that after I got out of the US Army, I took what was known at the time as a GI Bill of Rights which allows you to study. </sentence><sentence id="830">They give you a small stipend. </sentence><sentence id="831">I think it was $150 a month, which would make it very difficult to study in the U.S. at a university, but I could do graduate work in architecture in Germany. </sentence><sentence id="832">So against my father's best wishes, I enrolled at the Academy of Fine Arts in Munich and spent a couple of years there doing graduate work in architecture. </sentence><sentence id="833">Had a very, very international class, a master's program in architecture. </sentence><sentence id="834">And a professor, who had fought on the front in the -- Sep Ruf, a well known architect in Germany, who had fought on the front. </sentence><sentence id="835">And one weekend decided to put us all in cars and take us to Dachau, which is just outside of Munich, you know. </sentence><sentence id="836">And he insisted that I ride with him in his car. </sentence><sentence id="837">And he tried to make a strong case for the fact that he was a soldier on the front, an officer on the front, and not really knowing what was happening back home, as far as the Jewish problem. </sentence><sentence id="838">I still -- I still have suspicions that if they wanted to find out what was happening, not only to the Jews at home but to the Jews of the countries that were -- that they were occupying during the war, they could easily find out. </sentence><sentence id="839">Even an -- even an artillery officer could find that out, what was really going on. </sentence><sentence id="840">But he took us to the memorial. </sentence><sentence id="841">And explained to us all -- the memorial at Dachau had just been built. </sentence><sentence id="842">It was a very -- it was a very emotional trip. </sentence><sentence id="843">I was the only Jew in that architecture group, but the group was -- only included two Germans. </sentence><sentence id="844">The rest were from, really, all over the world. </sentence><sentence id="845">They had students from everywhere that came together and had a chance to experience that very, very powerful visit. </sentence><sentence id="846">And they seemed
