<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2090">A: We were -- we were hand picked for that beca -- I don't know -- wa -- wa -- one of the reasons I know, there was a -- a-an -- an officer or a colonel, a very elegant fellow, he spent two years in Paris in the American embassy as military attache before the war. </sentence><sentence id="2091">So he knew Paris inside-out. </sentence><sentence id="2092">So they told his regiment to be the leading regiment into Paris, because he knew every corner -- and I wa -- I was going to say, every elegant woman. </sentence><sentence id="2093">I think that may have been the reason th -- the for -- not th-the reason, but the regiment was picked as the leading regiment. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2126">Q: I bet you had -- every day was completely different, and -- </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2127">A: Every day was a little bit different. </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2128">Q: Yeah. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2130">A: E-Even when -- if the headquarters didn't move, there was always something different to do. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="2131">And of course the first -- the first big challenge came when we hit Cherbourg, 20 -- 24 - 25 days after landing on D-Day. </sentence><sentence id="2132">That was the -- the first city that came -- that was liberated 0 -- the mayor may have come in -- </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2133">Q: Okay, okay. </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2134">A: -- if [heard something. </sentence><sentence id="2135">And that -- that city was important because they needed the deep dock for the big boats to come in. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2138">Q: Right. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2140">A: And the freight and everything. </sentence><sentence id="2141">So into Paris -- in-into Cherbourg, I was alone, I had no officer with me. </sentence><sentence id="2142">So I drove in and I -- I didn't speak French, a few words, and I decided -- I checked myself into the German military hospital. </sentence><sentence id="2143">I figured some of the bi-big Nazi bastards may put bandages on, or cl -- or -- or -- legs or arms or something, and give themselves up as soldiers so they wouldn't get arrested. </sentence><sentence id="2144">But I -- I couldn't find any in the hospital under that duration, and the smell in that hospital was impossible. </sentence><sentence id="2145">So after an hour or so I checked out. </sentence><sentence id="2146">I couldn't -- I couldn't find anybody and I didn't -- couldn't stay any longer, th-the smell -- they had dead people, they buried them in the backyard, and it was miserable. </sentence><sentence id="2147">So I checked out and I went to the Hotel Atlantic where the division had set up headquarters and I put a blanket on the floor in the lobby and I slept there for a few hours. </sentence><sentence id="2148">General Roosevelt was -- had been appointed commanding officer of the Cherbourg area. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2158">Q: Did you know him? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2160">A: I met him, but I didn't know him, but Major Fissette worked with him for -- for -- lived with him for three, four months. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2162">Q: This was President Roosevelt's son? </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2178">Q: Let me ask you this. </sentence><sentence id="2179">Because you were -- knew the German language and because you grew up in Germany, do you think that you had insight into German soldiers or German movements, or German military operations in any way that was helpful? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2182">A: No, I couldn't -- I couldn't help the military because I wasn't supposed to talk to capt -- to -- to prisoners. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2184">Q: But -- but did you have knowledge of how things worked? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2186">A: [had knowledge if I could -- could sit down with them and question them, but I wasn't supposed to do this, I had to stick to my headquarters. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2188">Q: Mm-hm, mm-hm. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2190">A: Because they had special guys in each regiment who were supposed to -- to stick to these soldiers and try to get them to talk and find out. </sentence><sentence id="2191">That's why one of the fellows in the 22!infantry hit a German soldier and he -- he claims, if you give me a map, I'll show you exactly where Rommel's headquarters is. </sentence><sentence id="2192">So he opened up a map and the guy really pointed it out, it was a certain chateau in a small village. </sentence><sentence id="2193">And that information they gave to the air corps and within a few days they bombed the road leading to the headquarters and Rommel was driving on that road and was wounded very badly. </sentence><sentence id="2194">He was unconscious for a week. </sentence><sentence id="2195">Of course, they didn't know he wanted to be our friend. </sentence><sentence id="2196">So it shows you what can happen. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2205">Q: Yeah. </sentence><sentence id="2206">I want to go back to Paris. </sentence><sentence id="2207">Any other -- did -- any other good stories from anything that happened to you in Paris? </sentence><sentence id="2208">How long were you there? </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2897">A: I didn't arrest them, I tra -- I made the German police arrest them and put them into jail. </sentence><sentence id="2898">And then first I had to change the warden in jail because he was a Nazi, I couldn't trust him. </sentence><sentence id="2899">So I had to kick him out and put a new man in. </sentence><sentence id="2900">Otherwise, he would have let them go anyhow. </sentence></p></dialogue>
