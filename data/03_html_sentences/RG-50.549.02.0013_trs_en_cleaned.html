Let us begin with your name -- your birth name and your name now and also when you were born and where. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="11">A: All right. </sentence><sentence id="12">Well, my name is Regina Gelb, born Laks, L-a-k-s. I am also known as Renia, R-e-n-i-a. So you could refer to me as Renia and Regina, but -- but for all practical -- for all official purposes, I really am Regina, so you can only find me under that, but everybody else knows me also as Renia. </sentence><sentence id="13">Gelb, obviously is my married name. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="17">Q: When you were born -- </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="18">A: Oh yes, I was born in Starachowice and I'll spell that for you because it's a very long name. </sentence><sentence id="19">S-t-a-r-a-c-h-o-w-i-c-e. That was, at the time of my birth, also known as Wierzbnik, W-i-e-1r-z-b-n-i-k.

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="28">Q: Whereabouts is Starachowice? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="30">A: Yes. </sentence><sentence id="31">Starachowice is in central Poland, about two and a half hours by car from Warsaw, directly south. </sentence><sentence id="32">It is an industrial town and it was -- if we go a li-little back in history, Poland, as you know, was divided up to 1918, between Russia, Prussia and Hungary. </sentence><sentence id="33">We were -- I was born in the very heart of Poland, which was called in those days, Congress Poland, because when Napoleon went through Poland, he carved up a piece of free Poland and that was the -- the core of the -- the core -- the -- the center of Poland, where Starachowice is located. </sentence><sentence id="34">Now, th-the town, as I a-am fond of remembering -- reminding everybody -- the fact that the town was an -- an industrial town played a great part in my surviving the war. </sentence><sentence id="35">The reason being that after the first war, when Poland became independent in 1918, the -- the marshall pusitski who was then the -- the head of the Polish government -- it was decided that Poland has to arm itself, so they carved up a -- an industrial complex within the heart of Poland and they started -- there was ore to be smelted and big factories went up. </sentence><sentence id="36">How this historic fact relates to my survival is probably a bit farfetched, but it isn't, for the reason that the factory di -- me -- the factory in our town, which prior to the war, smelted ore and pro -- was -- produced iron of all kinds of locomotives and -- and meat grinders, from the big to the smallest, was converted to a munitions factory as soon as the war broke out. </sentence><sentence id="37">By virtue of which, the Germans decided that the entire area, which contained these different factories, which This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="38">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="39"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0013 4 were converted into munitions factories, would need le -- slave labor. </sentence><sentence id="40">Therefore, people who were living within that area, were first used as slave labor. </sentence><sentence id="41">Of course, in due time they would die out and they would be shipped, whatever. </sentence><sentence id="42">The numbers would always be supplemented by new people, who were either shipped out of towns or caught or whichever way. </sentence><sentence id="43">The number --eventually the number of slave labor people working for the -- in that factory, was constant, even though people were dying like flies. </sentence><sentence id="44">But of course we're -- are getting ahead of our story here, because this is only the beginning. </sentence><sentence id="45">I just meant to make the connection that Starachowice, the factory was -- before the war, the factory was in Starachowice proper. </sentence><sentence id="46">The bedroom of Starachowice proper was Wierzbnik. </sentence><sentence id="47">That was basically a town where everything took place, commerce and so on and it was a very sizable Jewish community, about one third of the people living in Wierzbnik were Jews. </sentence><sentence id="48">And they were generally, as they always were -- they were merchants and they were cobblers and carpenters and so on and they -- there also was such a thing as the Jewish intelligencia in those days. </sentence><sentence id="49">Of which my parents were part. </sentence><sentence id="50">But that was the town and -- and Starachowice did not have Jews living in -- in it, because the Jews were not allowed to work in the factory, strange as it might seem. </sentence><sentence id="51">Before the war, the Jews were not allowed to live or work in the factory. </sentence><sentence id="52">In -- and, as I said, eventually the two were combined so by then you couldn't do -- have these restrictions but that was the fact, before the war. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="77">Q: I just have one follow-up question on that story -- </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="78">A: Yes? </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="87">Q: What were the reasons? </sentence><sentence id="88">Were they anti-Semitic reasons or were they different reasons? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="91">A: I could not tell you. </sentence><sentence id="92">You know, there are certain things which to this day remain a mystery to me, because I was a child. </sentence><sentence id="93">I just knew that Jewish people did not work in the fact -- in the plant and that there were no Jew -- Jews living there. </sentence><sentence id="94">And I'll tell you, actually why -- I'll tell you, I -- I almost know now, because I've read some -- some books on the subjects about Starachowice that were written actually the last 20 years. </sentence><sentence id="95">Starachowice was at one time, built in colonies for people directly involved with the factory. </sentence><sentence id="96">In other words, after 1918, when that factory went up, they started building colonies, one was called Roboneetcha, which is for the workers and another one was for the -- for the, I guess for the administration over there. </sentence><sentence id="97">But they had these colonies, they were what you call now, you know in America, you have a lot of these developments. </sentence><sentence id="98">You know, you have houses and the -- the -- but the -- the basic commerce was still in Wierzbnik. </sentence><sentence id="99">The reason Jews did not live in Starachowice, because to qualify, you had to work in the factory, you see? </sentence><sentence id="100">Yeah. </sentence><sentence id="101">And that was true up to the very war. </sentence><sentence id="102">And when the war broke out, obviously things got totally changed because the resettlement of Jews came into being and all this, but this is a story that we'll probably continue later. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="115">Q: So maybe if you can tell us a little bit about your family now. </sentence><sentence id="116">About your early upbringing, your daily life? </sentence></p></dialogue>

first of all, we were a family of five -- father, mother and the three of us. </sentence><sentence id="124">My oldest sister, Anna, who is also called Hanya. </sentence><sentence id="125">Her last name now is Wilson and she's a Canadian. </sentence><sentence id="126">My sec -- my middle sister, Krisha, who's also called Kris, but her true name is Rosalia Kristina Lehrman. </sentence><sentence id="127">And we call her Krisha for short. </sentence><sentence id="128">And my name, Regina, which also is Renia. </sentence><sentence id="129">We were a secular type of family. </sentence><sentence id="130">The town was very Jewish in the sense that it had a very sizable Orthodox Jewish community. </sentence><sentence id="131">But my parents, of course were part of the Jewish community, but we were not Orthodox, we were not -- we were secular. </sentence><sentence id="132">And my parents were very much oriented to Zionism. </sentence><sentence id="133">But before we proceed that, let me just explain to you the other background. </sentence><sentence id="134">The fact that we spoke Polish at home, we were brought up in the Polish language. </sentence><sentence id="135">Both my parents spoke Polish beautifully, even though my father's background was really German. </sentence><sentence id="136">He came from Solsnoviets, which is western Poland, which -- Salesia, in Salesia. </sentence><sentence id="137">And he was brought up in the German language, because obviously he went to school -- he was an educated man -- he went to school pri -- prior to the f -- end of the first war, prior to 1918, which means that, depending on which sphere of influence you lived in, that was the language in which you were taught. </sentence><sentence id="138">Well, my pa -- my father was a German, in that sense, because he -- he spoke German beautifully. </sentence><sentence id="139">To this day I talk about his encyclopedia because that played a big part in the war, also. </sentence><sentence id="140">He had his encyclopedia in German, he -- he was subscribing to magazines and other things and he spoke German beautifully, but of course his Polish was wonderful. </sentence><sentence id="141">Mother, on the other ha -- hand, came from the so-called Russian part of Poland, so she spoke Russian in addition to her This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word.

</sentence><sentence id="144">But we were brought up at home in the Polish language. </sentence><sentence id="145">My parents knew Yiddish and spoke to each other only if they didn't want the kids to understand. </sentence><sentence id="146">Now my father was an engineer in the forestry business. </sentence><sentence id="147">That was a very big business in Poland. </sentence><sentence id="148">They employed people who had good education, a good scientific, what's that to say?Science background, which my father had from his German education. </sentence><sentence id="149">Assessing forestry for lumber and such. </sentence><sentence id="150">And there was a big sawmill in Starachowice -- in -- in Wierzbnik, Starachowice -- belonged to Jewish people, I think they were Austrians. </sentence><sentence id="151">And they were -- that was their ownership. </sentence><sentence id="152">And they employed -- it -- it was a sizable type of operation because th-the lumber was -- the -- the forests that were cut elsewhere, brought in, were -- were turned into lumber. </sentence><sentence id="153">And mother was -- as it was true in Poland, she was not what you call a working woman, not until 1938 or so and I -- P'll come to that. </sentence><sentence id="154">And we had a very good life. </sentence><sentence id="155">Of course we had a maid, as everybody else did and when I tell people how it was when -- we had a -- a seamstress come to the house, you know and people used to buy goods and they used to sew it for you, the -- you know, the seamstress would come and she would sew the sheets and she would sew the skirts for the kids and the blouses and all that. </sentence><sentence id="156">And this was of course another totally other way of life. </sentence><sentence id="157">And then you had the laundress, she came and she did the big laundry and -- and she took it to the mangle and I told somebody about the mangle and said, "What is that?" </sentence><sentence id="158">Well, the sheets were mangled. </sentence><sentence id="159">And there is such a thing and I know the machine. </sentence><sentence id="160">I could even describe it. </sentence><sentence id="161">But anyhow, we had a very good life, until the late 30's. </sentence><sentence id="162">We had a wonderful life, as you -- I'1l show you some pictures in my albums. </sentence><sentence

to a place called Busco -- Busco's druey, which had sulfur baths and she went regularly, ev -- every summer for six weeks. </sentence><sentence id="166">And after that, of course, we used to come -- she used to come back and we used to go so-called country, somewhere in the -- on the farm to -- to recover. </sentence><sentence id="167">But sh -- this was a strenuous kind of treatment and she used to take us with her to Busco. </sentence><sentence id="168">Not all three at one time, but two, sometimes one and I remember -- I have even a picture from Busco with my mother and my sister has a picture from Busco that -- mother did that in the summertime, but other than that she was very involved with the Zionist movement in Poland. </sentence><sentence id="169">And she was instrumental in ope -- in opening a Hebrew school called Tarbud, which was specifically designed for children like ourselves, who came from secular homes, where Polish was spoken, for them to have the Jewish identity. </sentence><sentence id="170">We used to go after regular school. </sentence><sentence id="171">After the Polish -- regular Polish school, we used to go to Tarbud, it was called Tarbud. </sentence><sentence id="172">And Tarbud, they taught us Hebrew and they taught us Jewish history and the Bible and such. </sentence><sentence id="173">But basically, we were too young to know Hebrew well enough to study the Bible, so that was in Polish and the language, to an extent to which a child could manage at that age. </sentence><sentence id="174">And mother was also very instrumental -- first of all, she was president of Viso the women's international Zionist organization. </sentence><sentence id="175">Whether she was president of -- of the area, or whatever the area encompassed, I couldn't tell. </sentence><sentence id="176">Whether it was a county, or -- or southern Poland or central Poland or -- I don't know, but she was president of Viso. </sentence><sentence id="177">And these wom-women Zionist movements supported very much the pioneering -- the preparation of young Jews for Palestine. </sentence><sentence id="178">The pioneers for Palestine. </sentence><sentence id="179">And they used to be called Hag Sharah. </sentence><sentence id="180">And Hag This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="181">It is not the primary source, and it

RG-50.549.02*0013 9 Sharah was the kind of a training center which was established even in Starachowice -- in Starachowice, Wierzbnik where these young fellows, that was mostly young men or very young women who were not married and had no children. </sentence><sentence id="183">Young people who wanted to go to Palestine and be pioneers. </sentence><sentence id="184">And they were trained in farm work and in communal living and all that. </sentence><sentence id="185">And the women Zionist movement, of which my mother was president, not just -- didn't just support it, but was running that Hag Sharah. </sentence><sentence id="186">Father was also quite involved with it, but of course he had to earn a living. </sentence><sentence id="187">But mother, this was her full-time job. </sentence><sentence id="188">All this changed about 1938 because the Jewish people who owned the fac -- the sawmill in the town, sold it to Christians. </sentence><sentence id="189">And -- I think they were Austrian Jews, if I remember correctly. </sentence><sentence id="190">Anyhow, after they have given up the -- the operation -- the plant, every single Jew was fired. </sentence><sentence id="191">From the top to the bottom. </sentence><sentence id="192">Whether he was an engineer or whether he was whatever. </sentence><sentence id="193">Pushed the tr -- the -- the -- the barrels or collected the -- whatever it was. </sentence><sentence id="194">It was completely staffed by Polish Christians. </sentence><sentence id="195">And that was also the very hard time, there was lots of boycotting done of Jewish stores and Jewish enterprises. </sentence><sentence id="196">And of course, studying history, I know that this didn't come of itself, it was germane, but at the same time, the influences coming out of Germany were also very much involved in this very open -- very open antagonism. </sentence><sentence id="197">You see, they wouldn't beat you, but they -- they, if you had a store, they would march around and they would say -- they would march and they would yell, "Don't buy from Jews," and don't buy from Jews and such. </sentence><sentence id="198">Now, my father was

or in any way but to describe it, we really had a wonderful childhood. </sentence><sentence id="311">The parents were, as I told you, very progressive minded. </sentence><sentence id="312">And we were very, very close-knit, especially with my mother's side of the family, because they lived only within 20 miles or so of the -- or 20 kilometers, I don't know which, but very short distance from Starachowice. </sentence><sentence id="313">And personally, I never knew either grandfather. </sentence><sentence id="314">My father, as I told you, came from Solsnoviets and that's western Poland.

maiden name was Tannenblume, so I did not know my Tannenblume grandfather and I didn't know my Laks grandfather. </sentence><sentence id="318">However, I knew my grandmothers very well, both of them. </sentence><sentence id="319">The -- grandmother Laks used to come for -- you know like you, in the old days they used to come for a visit, was an extended visit, let's say for six weeks, so she lived with us. </sentence><sentence id="320">And then she would go to visit her other son, Alexander, in Radom. </sentence><sentence id="321">And then she would make the rounds and then she would -- she

trips. </sentence><sentence id="324">But that was the time when I saw her, but the other grandmother, we called Babcha, is a grandmother for -- in Polish. </sentence><sentence id="325">The other grandmother, I really -- not just adored, she had great influence over me and I remember her dearly and I'll never forget her because of my childhood, my orientation to the importance of things. </sentence><sentence id="326">For example, she was the owner of a printing shop. </sentence><sentence id="327">I never tire of talking about it because she was -- she owned a printing shop with her two daughters. </sentence><sentence id="328">There were two daughters, unmarried daughters living with her. </sentence><sentence id="329">One of them was Regina, that's mother's sister, Regina Tannenblume and the other was Anja. </sentence><sentence id="330">Anja Tannenblume. </sentence><sentence id="331">Babcha was Sara Tannenblume. </sentence><sentence id="332">Babcha was officially, so to say, the owner of the printing shop because it belonged to my grandfather, but the three of them -- actually the -- th-the daughters were running it. </sentence><sentence id="333">And I would be invited -- grandmother was fond of inviting one child at a time. </sentence><sentence id="334">She was religious and she was kosher and she did not think my mother was doing the kind of job with the secular education, that we really needed this other something -- this other background. </sentence><sentence id="335">So I would go by myself on the -- it was a train, I think, or on the bus. </sentence><sentence id="336">And she would wait for me. </sentence><sentence id="337">You know, it was a very short ride, I mean really short. </sentence><sentence id="338">My mother wouldn't trust me to somebody there thasay Babcha's going to be waiting. </sentence><sentence id="339">Then she did. </sentence><sentence id="340">And my total fascination with the printing shop -- I fell in love with that place, totally. </sentence><sentence id="341">Not just that the man in the back, you know, that was a hand operated printing machine. </sentence><sentence id="342">They allowed me to touch it and go with them. </sentence><sentence id="343">And then they would cut -- they would cut the material, the lets -- they used to do for movie houses, they used to do posters. </sentence><sentence

machine. </sentence><sentence id="350">So you had the confetti. </sentence><sentence id="351">So I had another bag of confetti. </sentence><sentence id="352">I even remember, they used to make stickers. </sentence><sentence id="353">You know, in Poland, there was a sticker on the bread. </sentence><sentence id="354">You know, when you bought a loaf of bread, there was a little, as big as a postage stamp. </sentence><sentence id="355">I forgot why it was there, I think it named the bread, whatever. </sentence><sentence id="356">Anyhow, to punch the holes for the stickers, that was another confetti, much smaller, sort of like a powder. </sentence><sentence id="357">Anyhow, my attachment to Babcha, of course, the grandmother Tannenblume started with this fascination of the printing shop. </sentence><sentence id="358">And of course, she treated me wonderfully. </sentence><sentence id="359">She took me to the park for concerts and such, which there was a big park there for that. </sentence><sentence id="360">But basically she wanted me to learn the -- the prayers. </sentence><sentence id="361">So I would say the prayer before breakfast and I would say the prayer before bedtime and I would say all these prayers and she also was ve -- very religious and I distinctly remember she had two sinks in the room and a stove with a -- she had like a metal partition and she would put a metal partition because one part that was for the meat wouldn't part -- touch the other part. </sentence><sentence id="362">In other words, with all her love and -- and -- and attention to me, she really got this -- this idea of -- th -- her idea of -- of getting something to the grandchildren that they weren't getting at home, very well. </sentence><sentence id="363">She got it across very well, because I never forgot it and of course we are very much -- we're very much -- not that we feel Jewish, we are Jewish to the core. </sentence><sentence id="364">W -- Just

percent comes from the house, because that was the -- the identity with Judaism was so very, very strong. </sentence><sentence id="369">But Babcha's identity with Judaism was the other part that I

couldn't be true, because such a thing couldn't be true, you know, that you take groups of people and you burn them or you gas them. </sentence><sentence id="5790">So that's just gossip and during the

really that it brought out the beast in the human being. </sentence><sentence id="5792">It had nothing to do with land, you know, reclaiming your land one way or another. </sentence><sentence id="5793">It was nothing to do with fighting for the -- for your culture or for your moral standards. </sentence><sentence id="5794">It was just the opposite. </sentence><sentence id="5795">It was

</sentence><sentence id="6997">And because his considered himself a Polish Jew and a Jewish Pole, it was decided, whoever it was, Polish organizations and Jewish organizations decided to use Korchuk's
