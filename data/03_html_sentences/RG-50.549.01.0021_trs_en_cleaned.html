Polish people, that went __, was also persecuted by a Russian, came to my father and said that "I will take your belongings and you come to me because, and you were good to me and | will help you out and he had a very big, not a palace, a very big farm house and a lot of landing(ph). </sentence><sentence id="140">So, my father and my sister took a baggy and put some belongings and ended up going

August 27, 1996, at Lily's home in the Bronx, New York. </sentence><sentence id="144">This is tape one, side B. </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="145">A: Still today, | don't know if it was staged, that he wanted to rob us, this Pole, or it was just, just one of those things that the peasants were wild and they were, they just attacked him. </sentence><sentence id="146">So there | was sitting and I, when | saw my father all bloody and there is, there are no word that | can describe you, but | was very concerned because my little sister became very hysterical and she couldn't cry because we had to be very quiet. </sentence><sentence id="147">Our life was in danger. </sentence><sentence id="148">So we left everything that we had there, all our goods, and we went again to the Rabbi. </sentence><sentence id="149">And in the morning, somehow, my father contacted a peasant and gave him a sum of money and he, asked him to take us to Vilna to my aunt. </sentence><sentence id="150">After my father came with this, all bleeding, something happened to my dog, Rex. </sentence><sentence id="151">He was so attached to us, he was like a member of my family. </sentence><sentence id="152">When my mother passed away, he was sitting there in the room because in Europe you didn't put the casket in a funeral home, it was in the room, so he was sitting and he went, and he was howling, it was a terrible howl, but there was no way that he would move from my mother's casket. </sentence><sentence id="153">He was sitting together with me and | spent the night with him there. </sentence><sentence id="154">When there was the funeral, he wanted to go in the funeral cortege and he became wild when they had to subdue him and put him in the room. </sentence><sentence id="155">He was very much attached to us. </sentence><sentence id="156">When my father came and all bloody, something happened to this dog and he, had like a paralysis and his head turned to the side. </sentence><sentence id="157">And my father took him out to a field and asked somebody to shoot him. </sentence><sentence id="158">And it was like an end of an era. </sentence><sentence id="159">Because this dog was like, everything what was good and carefree and pink and colorful in our childhood. </sentence><sentence id="160">So next day, we got up very, very early in the morning and this peasant took a wagon of hide, and put us there, camouflaged us and we had like babushkas(ph), and he took us, after a few hours, we came very early in the    morning to Vilna. </sentence><sentence id="161">And he left us in a place that | was not even familiar where, how where. </sentence><sentence id="162">And | also didn't know that there was then a curfew of Jews, that the Jews could just walk a certain hours, and the Jews had to have yellow, a star, this, Stars of David, and they also had to walk in the gutter. </sentence><sentence id="163">So it took us a few hours and | was walking with my sister on the street like two little Polish girls. </sentence><sentence id="164">And when my aunt saw us, she thought that we came from the other side, who know what. </sentence><sentence id="165">Of course, she was very, very happy and we were in Vilna. </sentence><sentence id="166">A few days later, my father came. </sentence><sentence id="167">And my father, from all the aggravation of everything, became ill and had a very big abscess. </sentence><sentence id="168">And also, in Vilna, the Jews were persecuted like subhumans. </sentence><sentence id="169">Every day, new edicts were coming. </sentence><sentence id="170">We couldn't have a radio, we couldn't have a jewelry, we couldn't have a watch, we couldn't have properties, we couldn't talk to gentiles. </sentence><sentence id="171">| mean, we were plain ostracizes. </sentence><sentence id="172">And every day they used to come and take out men and young boys and they used to disappear and the women never knew where they were and what was done to these young . </sentence><sentence id="173">One of my uncles, my mother's sister's husband, was taken from the street, he was standing and reading an edict, he was taken from the street and she never saw him again. </sentence><sentence id="174">So the situation was very, very tense and my father was very ill and he was afraid to go out in the street. </sentence><sentence id="175">But once he became so ill and the abscess that he had was so big that during the night, he decided that he had to go, so my uncle and my aunt took him by the hand and they were walking in the middle of the night, they took him to a hospital that was in the Jewish section, it was a Jewish hospital. </sentence><sentence id="176">And he was staying there. </sentence><sentence id="177">And my other uncle no, never went out. </sentence><sentence id="178">And when the Gestapo used to come and ask if there are men there, she used to come out and, luckily, they would look in a few rooms and my, he was camouflaged, something, so my uncle was never found. </sentence><sentence id="179">So it was, until, until, | don't remember exactly the date, | think it was June 6, 19, no, no, no, September 6, 1941, that an edict came that all the Jews have to go to the ghetto. </sentence><sentence id="180">But it was such a diabolic, diabolic plan, a master plan, the way they did it. </sentence><sentence id="181">There was, as | told you, there was a section, a Jewish section in the heart of Vilna, a very, very cultural town that had a lot of theaters, archives and museums and it had, and Jewish, very rich Jewish life with libraries and all kinds of societies and charitable organization. </sentence><sentence id="182">And there were a lot of Jewish doctors that had a Jewish hospital. </sentence><sentence id="183">And also, there were a lot of facilities for poor Jewish children. </sentence><sentence id="184">In the heart of Vilna was a section where very poor Jews lived, it was in very bad conditions. </sentence><sentence id="185">The German came there in the middle of the night, with trucks, told all those Jews to walk out, put them on the trucks and took them to a prison called Lukishke(ph) and also took them to a place, a big forest called Ponare(ph), it was a place where those Jews was lined up and shot discriminately, first they had to make their own grave, and they were falling in those graves. </sentence><sentence id="186">When | was in ghetto, sick in the hospital, that | will tell you later, one of the woman who escaped between the dead bodies came to the ghetto and in the beginning when she was just a little lucid, she described what happened to her, so    we knew for a fact that it was happening. </sentence><sentence id="187">And then, after a few days, she lost her mind. </sentence><sentence id="188">| still remember her yelling and screaming and crying after the children that she lost there, after the family. </sentence><sentence id="189">So it was, a very diabolic plan how to do it. </sentence><sentence id="190">When we were told to go to the ghetto, they came, everything was done early in the morning, and my uncle, Yosef(ph) Perski(ph), said to my aunt, "Look, | am not going to the ghetto". </sentence><sentence id="191">He was, had a very big advantage, he doesn't look Jewish, he look like a gentile, he look like a Pole and he was a business man that had a lot of connections with Polish peasants. </sentence><sentence id="192">He was buying wood there from them and also dried mushrooms, he says, "| am going there and | want you to go with me". </sentence><sentence id="193">She says, she, my aunt Sonja, who was like a second mother to us, said to him, "I promised my sister on her death bed that | am, be a second mother and | will take care of those two little girls, Lilla(ph) and Rhya(ph)," this was how we were called, "And | won't leave them alone". </sentence><sentence id="194">We didn't know about it. </sentence><sentence id="195">So they kissed and he sneaked out and he went. </sentence><sentence id="196">We never heard from him. </sentence><sentence id="197">And she went with us to the ghetto. </sentence><sentence id="198">Before he left, he gave us a few things to put on and as we were walking on the street, | had one coat and one raincoat and the Poles were lined up on the street and looking at, and | will never forget that they said, "Look at those Jews, they have two coats". </sentence><sentence id="199">So they were, nobody of them lifted a finger and said, "Come, | give you food, | won't let you go to the ghetto", because they really were rejoicing what was happening to us. </sentence><sentence id="200">There were two ghettos and one ghetto, the people that were taken to one ghetto, this was the ghetto that | was, were destined to leave. </sentence><sentence id="201">The other ghetto, a lot of people were taken, again, to the Lukishke prison, from there to Ponare, and they were simply shot. </sentence><sentence id="202">So this way the have the liquidated a lot of Jews. </sentence><sentence id="203">Before the war, before 1939, there were 80,000 Jews in Vilna. </sentence><sentence id="204">Vilna was a culture center, with many institutions, it was a culture Jewish center that was like a magnet from all the people that wanted to soak up and had a nice cultural experience. </sentence><sentence id="205">So slowly, slowly the Jewish population were reduced and also, at this time, there were all other people, Jews, that escape from Austria, that escape from Germany, that escape from Poland, that look for solace in Vilna, and they, unfortunate, were also put to live in the ghetto. </sentence><sentence id="206">| can talk for hours and hours about those conditions that were in the ghetto. </sentence><sentence id="207">It is indescribable. </sentence><sentence id="208">One room was habitated four or five family. </sentence><sentence id="209">There was no sanitary conditions, there was not even enough water. </sentence><sentence id="210">The rations were terrible, | mean, it's not to live and not to die. </sentence><sentence id="211">And the most important thing is, that the . </sentence><sentence id="212">All those people that were doers, that were thinkers, that were writers, became so helpless, so degradated, so broken up, that they just couldn't exist. </sentence><sentence id="213">| remember that my father, whenever that there was something in the family, they used to come, they with Mazur, he knew everything, he was, he felt that he can help, he felt that he can, so was the most helpless person in the ghetto. </sentence><sentence id="214">He was like a hunted animal and | think this was the biggest injustice that was done to Jewish people. </sentence><sentence id="215">By dehumanize them. </sentence><sentence id="216">The taking away their self-esteem, the taking away their pride, the taking away their    human dignity. </sentence><sentence id="217">| know that you want to ask me how | meet my father. </sentence><sentence id="218">Yeah?Okay, you can ask me. </sentence></p></dialogue>

are looking for a pharmacist to look in, to work in a pharmacy because it was the Jewish hospital that was in the center of the ghetto and they needed a pharmacist. </sentence><sentence id="337">So he was very happy and very elated and, of course, they took him right in and he was working in the pharmacy. </sentence><sentence id="338">We were starving so much that at night sometimes we couldn't sleep. </sentence><sentence id="339">And they give us such a small ration that they gave us this piece of bread when we came home, me and my sister, we finished already the bread, so you know. </sentence><sentence id="340">As much as my aunt wanted to share the rations with us and may times she shared with us, it was not enough. </sentence><sentence id="341">So one day | decided, | heard that people are going outside the ghetto and they are working. </sentence><sentence id="342">So one time | got up very early in the morning and we had, in the middle of the ghetto, a place called Judenrat(ph) and there were people that, from the Jewish, that community, that were like in charge of the ghetto, they were, and one of those that was in charge of the ghetto was Jacob Gentz(ph), who was an officer in the Lithuanian army and he was like a Jewish commander of the ghetto. </sentence><sentence id="343">And right there there was a very big place and German used to come and take men and women, we were always segregated, to work and | was lucky enough that | was recruited by this German, his name was Kraus(ph). </sentence><sentence id="344">And he took, he took me to work. </sentence><sentence id="345">There was, maybe a handed, two handed young girls, and he, he took us out from the ghetto and we were working on the cobblestones and we were working, working, working a long time. </sentence><sentence id="346">And all of a sudden, the whole column stopped and to my amazement, they stopped in front of the private school where | spend the happiest days of my life. </sentence><sentence id="347">They took us down there, the school was occupied by Gestapo and from the classrooms they made offices. </sentence><sentence id="348">And there was a very big cellar there that when | was a student, | didn't even know that that existed. </sentence><sentence id="349">And they put us into this big cellar and the cellar was full with potatoes and we had to sort out the potatoes, they were rotten and so there | was, sitting in this , in this big cellar and | was thinking, this must be a nightmare. </sentence><sentence id="350">| wanted to run, run out from there, run to one of my classrooms, sit down in my seat, there was sitting late, and | said to myself, | am running out, | will take the hardest test, | don't care. </sentence><sentence id="351">And then all of a sudden | see a man walking there and taking care of chicken, there were a few chicken there in the cellar. </sentence><sentence id="352">He looked terrible, , this was Professor Morgenstern(ph), he was the latest of my teachers and he was like the teacher that took care of our class. </sentence><sentence id="353">And when my mother passed away and in our religion, for seven days, we sit shiva, he came to my house and he was talking to me, because when my mother was sick, my grades fell very badly because | didn't want to study and | was there always the teacher's pet. </sentence><sentence id="354">| was very good student. </sentence><sentence id="355">And he was talking to me and he said, "Look, I'm sure that you, if you will just put your head to it, you can have a makeover test and you will have better grades". </sentence><sentence id="356">But | remember saying to him, "I really, at this point, | really don't care. </sentence><sentence id="357">For me, the world is finished". </sentence><sentence id="358">So to my amazement, Professor    Morgenstern is standing there and taking care of the chicken. </sentence><sentence id="359">You see, we are not supposed to socialize with men, this was the biggest crime, but | ran over to him, | said, "Professor Morgenstern". </sentence><sentence id="360">But he didn't recognize me. </sentence><sentence id="361">He went through a very big tragedy. </sentence><sentence id="362">In his presence, his wife and his daughter and his son were shot. </sentence><sentence id="363">And he was in such a state of shock, that he was just like an out mad(ph). </sentence><sentence id="364">As | was sitting there crying, afraid to cry loud because there were, full of sad, | see the door opens and two girls and a man are coming out, this was the janitor and his two Polish daughter. </sentence><sentence id="365">When | was a little girl and we were going to school, the janitor and his two daughters were always helping us with galoshes because the climate in our town was very severe in wintertime and many times we would share our lunches, we considered them our friend. </sentence><sentence id="366">When they saw me sitting there, they said, "Look at this little Lilka(ph), we thought that all Jews were killed in Ponar". </sentence><sentence id="367">This was the hello that | had from them. </sentence><sentence id="368">They were standing with their hands on their hips and they were practically laughing. </sentence><sentence id="369">Okay, the day ended and | came home and | was beside myself. </sentence><sentence id="370">It was just a little bit too much for me to go to the school, to see my professor and to hear those talking. </sentence><sentence id="371">Anyhow, look, | was going there and working there for a long, long time. </sentence><sentence id="372">And one advantage was that we could bring a few raw potatoes, but by the entrance, if they would caught us with potatoes, we would be shot on site. </sentence><sentence id="373">But we learned how to camouflage it, you know, and sometimes we were lucky, they would let us through, and those potatoes were very helpful because my father used to sell them and we could buy something else. </sentence><sentence id="374">After a while this job finished and this same German took us to an airport called Porbanek(ph) and, again, | started to work in Probanek. </sentence><sentence id="375">We were working long, long, long time. </sentence><sentence id="376">They brought us over, they used to always line us up and count us and the job with it was unload big pieces of coal, unload wood, unload potatoes and many times in the winter, we had to clean the airport. </sentence><sentence id="377">The snow was falling and there we were. </sentence><sentence id="378">And we saw those military little planes coming down and all those military men in their white warm coats and there we were freezing practically, we had no, no warm clothes and | had a very big problem because the shoes that | had were falling apart. </sentence><sentence id="379">So my father went to the Judenrat and they gave me a pair of shoes, they were wooden clumps(ph). </sentence><sentence id="380">They were wooden, you know, and with presented some material, when | was working in the snow | couldn't walk because the snow was, it was just sticking, so it was a very big deal. </sentence><sentence id="381">But one day, when we were lined up, | was lucky. </sentence><sentence id="382">Every day four women were chosen to go into the barracks and clean. </sentence><sentence id="383">This was a very big thing because you, it was wintertime, you didn't have to freeze. </sentence><sentence id="384">And | was lucky, | was chosen with all those four women. </sentence><sentence id="385">So there | was, standing in this big place, and | was given a bucket of water and a mop and | have to mop those barracks. </sentence><sentence id="386">Here you have me, | was just a school girl, who never in her life boiled a pot of tea. </sentence><sentence id="387">| didn't know it. </sentence><sentence id="388">So there were, the other three women who were more experienced , took their bucket and they knew what to do. </sentence><sentence id="389">They took me and put it in this big room that you    couldn't see from one end to another and the floor was dirty and there | was standing, | didn't know how to start. </sentence><sentence id="390">| know how to do it today, but | didn't know then and | was standing there and crying, bitter tears. </sentence><sentence id="391">All of a sudden, like an apparition, a very high German officer is coming with a few younger around him and he sees me and he says to me, "What are you doing here?" </sentence><sentence id="392">And at this time, | spoke a very good German yet, today | cannot speak German, | have a mental block. </sentence><sentence id="393">In a very clear German, | said to him, "| am Jewish, brought in from ghetto to wash it and | don't know how to do it". </sentence><sentence id="394">End of Tape 1. </sentence><sentence id="395">  Tape 2 He looked at me. </sentence><sentence id="396">| don't know what...he called in a soldier, told a soldier to wash the floor, took me by the hand and took me to his office, said to me "Are you hungry?" </sentence><sentence id="397">| was afraid to say, so | put my head down and he told another German to bring me a sandwich and hot soup, and then | was sitting there. </sentence><sentence id="398">He said to me, "You are Jewish?" </sentence><sentence id="399">| said, "Yes," and he started to ask me my whole story and then | was sitting and conversing with this man and | became so...the hot soup...and the sandwich make me so, you know, courageous, that | didn't, | said to him, you want me, | know, you want me to recite for you the Early King by Getta(ph); so, he says to me, "You know the

</sentence><sentence id="401">And, this man says to me, "You are Jewish?" " </sentence><sentence id="402">Yes," | said, "Yes." </sentence><sentence id="403">He said, "They told us that all the Jews are crooked, have crooked noses, they have beards, they are liars, they are cheaters. </sentence><sentence id="404">| says to him, "You know | was very good in Chemistry." </sentence><sentence id="405">He wanted to ask me a few chemical formulas. </sentence><sentence id="406">Anyhow, to make the long story short, this man brought me a book of poetry and told another soldier to close the door, and brought me a few sandwiches that | took to my father and to my aunt and to my sister in the ghetto, and he was beside himself, he was so brainwashed that he was beside himself that the Jewish young girl can talk to him intelligently, can explain to him, can cite poetry, can read, and he gave me the book, but | was afraid to take it. </sentence><sentence id="407">| said to him, if they caught me, by the guard, with the German book, | was : | am telling you, to illustrate to you, how the German people were brainwashed, because if he was a high officer, he had a education. </sentence><sentence id="408">How could he let, to come to this level that he could think by himself, and he couldn't distinguish...and, in my experiences, during the Nazi era, | had a few encounters. </sentence><sentence id="409">Once | met with somebody that will talk and that he is the director of the Munich Opera. </sentence><sentence id="410">That he was also an officer. </sentence><sentence id="411">He was in the Assess(ph), and that he couldn't understand when | told him that as a child, | knew the Lehar(ph) operettas, | knew the opera; he couldn't understand that the Jews were all so cultured, people that are professionals, that they were not cheaters, and not liars, and not bloodsucker. </sentence><sentence id="412">It was beside him, and he couldn't understand this. </sentence></p></dialogue>
