<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="270">Q: So tell me though, as an eight or nine year old child, to have such -- such a very strong, marked position, how had things been explained to you by your parents, of what was going on, and why you'd left Vienna, and -- and this war, and so on. </sentence><sentence id="271">Ti -- can you recall that? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="274">A: Not really. </sentence><sentence id="275">I don't remember ever actually discussing it with them. </sentence><sentence id="276">It was just sort of a fact of life that you left Vienna. </sentence><sentence id="277">You didn't -- you -- you couldn't stay there any more, because there were these guys marching around with the brown uniforms, and the boots, and -- and these were not good guys, and the sooner we got out of there, the better. </sentence><sentence id="278">So, off we went to England, and I became an English child fast. </sentence><sentence id="279">I --I was --as I said, I was teaching my parents English because I -- I picked it up, you know, very quickly. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="286">Q: So, in other words, was it an English child saying to the principal that no, I don't want to talk to the German prisoners of war, because they're the enemy of England and we've just survived the blitz, or was it a -- </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="287">A: No, I just said I don't want to talk to them. </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="288">Q: And that's it. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="298">Q: Lalso find it very surprising that a principal would ask an eight year old child to meet with prisoners of war. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="306">A: Yes, except we always felt a little bit like the outsiders. </sentence><sentence id="307">We were the refugees. </sentence><sentence id="308">At that time, Britain was not very cosmopolitan, especially out in the country, you know, London was a little different, but out in the country, you know. </sentence><sentence id="309">They didn't know what Jews were. </sentence><sentence id="310">We sort of had to explain, you know. </sentence><sentence id="311">There was a woman who came from London, once or twice -- I think once a week or twice a week, I don't remember exactly, to teach me Hebrew, which I still can't read. </sentence><sentence id="312">And once in awhile, after things were not quite as bad, we -- we had some relatives in London, so we would go to visit them in -- in London occasionally. </sentence><sentence id="313">Meanwhile, my aunt, the aunt, my mother's sister, the one who married the German, she had also been   http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection interned in the Isle of Man. </sentence><sentence id="314">And she was released, and she stayed in London for -- until after the war, and eventually came to the U.S. But we would go and visit her too, but this was, you know, not while the blitz was going on. </sentence><sentence id="315">That -- that was pretty bad. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="328">Q: Do you remember war -- wartime sorts of episodes or experiences while in Britain, or was it blitz, and Cheltenham and -- and this, you know, inter -- non- interaction with -- with the -- the POWs, you know, that you were asked to do. </sentence></p></dialogue>
