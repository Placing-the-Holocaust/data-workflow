<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="9">A: Well, I'm delighted that you came and made this long trip. [ </sentence><sentence id="10">Laughs] </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="13">Q: Can you start out by just giving me the name that you were born with and the name that you live with now, please? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="15">A: Okay, my real, official, legal name is Regina born Laks. </sentence><sentence id="16">I also went by the name of Renia throughout my life, so actually I'm still being called Renia, but if you want to find the legal me, you will find it always under Regina, whether it's school or professional life or however or legal or - everything is Regina. </sentence><sentence id="17">My present name is Gelb; I'm married to Victor Gelb, so I basically never use my, my maiden name, which some people did retain. </sentence><sentence id="18">I did not, so my name is really now Regina Gelb. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="23">Q: And when were you born and where? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="25">A: I was born December 16", 1929 ina place called Wierzbnik, which you could not find anymore on the map now because it has been joint to another town called Starachowice and renamed. </sentence><sentence id="26">It was basically incorporated. </sentence><sentence id="27">And if I know history of the town, the incorporation - the towns were joined in 1931, -9, just before the war, so that first these towns were adjacent basically, one was sort of a factory town and the other was the bedroom town. </sentence><sentence id="28">Wierzbnik was the bedroom town and the Jewish community really resided in Wierzbnik rather than Starachowice. </sentence><sentence id="29">And I was born in Wierzbnik and, as I said before, if you want to find it on the map, you will not. </sentence><sentence id="30">You will only have to look for the name Starachowice, so that's where it is and it is central Poland, south of Warsaw about two hours by car. [ </sentence><sentence id="31">Phone interruption. ] </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="39">Q: I want you to do me a favor for a second. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="41">A: Yes. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="43">Q: I want you to close your eyes for a minute and think about what comes to your - then you can open them again - what comes to mind when you first think about your childhood? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="45">What's the picture that you get in your head about your childhood? </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="46">A: Could I open my eyes now? </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="47">Q: Yes. </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="48">A: Well, basically a very carefree life, because I was a young child, and the second is that I was sort of privileged, more than my sisters were privileged by virtue of being the youngest. </sentence><sentence id="49">I was sort of the baby in the family. </sentence><sentence id="50">As you know, the third one in line sometimes gets mistreated by the older ones, not that I was, but I certainly was spoiled by my parents because I was what you call the baby in the family, and anything around the idea of being privileged is not, does not include being spoiled; it's just being singled out for being special, it's more or less. </sentence><sentence id="51">I was forever being told I was smart and I was this and that and it actually served me very well in later years during the hard times because I always had the idea that I really could do certain things because I was always told, "Well you're was smart and you do well in school." </sentence><sentence id="52">And you... So that later on I could rely on this idea that was lodged in my head, which, well, today, I think they have all the euphemisms- self-whatever it's called today, self-appreciation, or whatever, the fact remains that because I was a) singled out by my parents for being a very good child and smart child and for being given this, this, impetus to build on that, I think I more or less relied on it in later years, I mean, you know, during the hard times, saying, well, I probably could do it because I was told that I really could do it, so let me just do it. </sentence><sentence id="53">And that's probably the single most important aspect of my memory of what I brought out of that, of my childhood, out of my childhood. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="60">Q: Do you think that was true for your two older sisters, Chris and Hania? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="62">A: Well, I really don't know. </sentence><sentence id="63">I couldn't tell you for sure for the reason that, you know, Hania was always the, what you call the brilliant one in the family and she was out of town, in a special high school for the gifted and whatever, and Krysia was the gorgeous, the gorgeous, the beauty of the family, you know, and I had no assets, you know, I had no such things to prove. </sentence><sentence id="64">So this is another aspect of it, you know, that Hania was always spoken of the genius of the family, which she really was absolutely, and Krysia was really strikingly beautiful, I mean, she wasn't just pretty, she was strikingly beautiful. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="65">And I'm always saying this, I'm repeating it forever because it's a fact, if Mother was walking, let's say, in the street with Krysia, with Chris, and people would stop and everybody would say "Oh, what a beauty!" </sentence><sentence id="66">And Mother said, "You can't say that because she would get it into her head that she's so beautiful, she wouldn't have to make an effort in life." </sentence><sentence id="67">But the fact remains that, you know, I always felt well, if my parents say I'm smart, I must be smart or whatever, because there was nothing to be said about me. </sentence><sentence id="68">I wasn't very, exactly very pretty and I don't think I was a genius, so... And I had these teeth, you know, my teeth were uneven sort of, and I was skinny, so that I didn't present anything so outstanding as to be pegged one way or another. </sentence><sentence id="69">However, you see, whether this was an excuse that I took the fact that I was supposed to be smart, or whatever, I really built on that idea. </sentence><sentence id="70">I absorbed it and I lived with it and I built on it, so for better or worse, it really, it really did come in handy in later years. </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="71">Q: Were you close with both of your parents? </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="72">A: Very, we were an extremely close family, and not just with my parents, but with my mother's side of the family, because they lived very near, within twenty - whether it's twenty miles or twenty kilometers, I don't know. </sentence><sentence id="73">Grandmother lived in Ostrowiec, which is a town very near. </sentence><sentence id="74">Father's family came from Silesia from Sosnowiec, and that was further, much further out, was western Poland; whereas Starachowice and Ostrowiec were in central Poland, because Mother's family came from Sandomierz, which is slightly to the south of Ostrowiec and Starachowice, so basically Grandma and my mother's family lived within the area right, you know, how far back the family went, I don't know, but I do know Mother was born in Sandomierz, and subsequently the family lived in Ostrowiec and my mother was married in Ostrowiec. </sentence><sentence id="75">In fact, after the war, when I went to visit Ostrowiec - Mother used to say that she was married on the balcony - and when I went back to Ostrowiec to look at it, of course, the houses were during Communist time in Poland and the building was extremely had the dilapidated look, you know. </sentence><sentence id="76">The outside walls were sort of shabby and peeling but the balcony was there, it was a corner balcony and Mother said they put the huppah out there, because, you know, my grandfather was religious, so that, I imagine, to satisfy his requirements, the huppah was outside on the balcony, and so I found, yes, that was interesting, the building is still there. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="82">Q: What was your father like and what did he do? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="84">A: My father was, well, you know, I shouldn't be saying that, but you know they describe German Jews as Jekes. </sentence><sentence id="85">My father was basically from Silesia and brought up, under the, under, you know, western Poland was occupied by Germany. </sentence><sentence id="86">You know, Poland was partitioned in the 18" century, so that the western part of Poland was taken over by the Germans, the south was taken over by Austro-Hungary - Austria, actually - and the rest was taken out by Russia. </sentence><sentence id="87">Now, my mother happened to come from the Russian quote- unquote zone. </sentence><sentence id="88">It's not a zone, but you know, Russian sphere of influence; whereas my father, having been born in Sosnowiec and grown up in Silesia, spoke German language, went to German schools and really was this very organized, straight, very precise type of man, which they describe as a Jeke, you know, whereas, you know, this is in no way derogatory, never.. What I meant to say that he was really very much German, rather than Polish sort of thing, but of course he spoke Polish beautifully. </sentence><sentence id="89">And he was an engineer... </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="96">Q: Let me ask you something... </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="98">A: Yes. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="100">Q: ...about his personality. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="102">A: Yes. </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="103">Q: Was he a man filled with humor? </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="104">A: Yes. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="106">Q: Was he very serious? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="108">A: No, he was serious but, you know, there was a lot of singing. </sentence><sentence id="109">I remember that. </sentence><sentence id="110">There was a lot of singing going on in the house all the time. </sentence><sentence id="111">In fact, I understand that my - whether my mother only or both parents participated in - oh, you know, it wasn't what you call official, big theatre, but there were the amateur groups, because I know my mother's brother, my uncle Morris - Moish - he was very much involved in amateur theatrical group and I know parents had a little contact with that, but what I do know for an absolute fact is that my father always sung in the house, I mean, he loved Lehar. </sentence><sentence id="112">So, when I hear "The Merry Widow", I always, but forever, associate it with my father because all certain arias from "The Merry Widow" were his absolute favorite. </sentence><sentence id="113">You could always hear him sing, and my mother, too. </sentence><sentence id="114">Whether this is different now because there are radios and televisions and all this and there isn't much talking at home or singing whatever, maybe people sing in the shower, I don't know, but I do know that there was just singing, as you walked around the house or whatever, you were singing and so my father was one of these who really kept on singing and not for any audience; for himself. </sentence><sentence id="115">Mother, too. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="124">Q: I understand that at least Krysia and, I don't know, maybe Hania and you also sang with... </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="126">A: Oh, yes, yes, yes, we did. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="128">Q: ...with them. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="130">A: Yes, because, you see, singing was so natural in those days. </sentence><sentence id="131">As I said, you didn't rely on any outside - I mean, a circus came to town, you know, or something like that - but there was never what you call, there was never a regular theater or there was never an opera. </sentence><sentence id="132">It was a small town, you see, so that basically people just organized their own entertainment and I was too young to really know, to have even gone if there was one. </sentence><sentence id="133">I would never have gone. </sentence><sentence id="134">In fact, I remember that even to go to the movies, we were, you know, the laws were so strict, a child could not go to movies unless it was a Shirley Temple movie or something. </sentence><sentence id="135">I remember going to Shirley Temple movies, but I never ever went to the movies otherwise because they wouldn't have let me in. </sentence><sentence id="136">That was, yes, and, this is why - as I said, there was no official theater or, but there was entertainment provided by people who lived there and I, of course, our family being Jewish, in this particular respect, you should not associate our Jewish family with the religious part of town because that was a little frowned upon, you know. </sentence><sentence id="137">We lived a more secular - not more - we did live a secular life; whereas the religious Jews in town lived a totally different life, as you could see it even in New York these days, I mean, you go to Williamsburg, or you go to Eastern  Parkway where the Lubavitch live, and you immediately see that, if you belong to a reformed synagogue as we do, it really is not the way we lived life, and we still could feel as Jewish as they do and I'm sure as deeply identified with "Jewishness" but not necessarily religious "Jewishness" to the extent, because we are not observant and our home - at home in Poland - my grandmother was very religious so in order for her to come and visit, Mother had to keep a kosher home, but we were not necessarily kosher in any strict sense of the word. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="146">Q: So even though you were a child... </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="148">A: Yes. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="150">Q: How did you understand - I know that you went to your Grandma because she was very concerned that you weren't getting a proper Jewish education. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="152">A: Yes, yes, yes. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="154">Q: But was, did your father come from a more secular home and is that why your home was so secular? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="156">A: I think so, I really couldn't tell you, I really truly couldn't tell you. </sentence><sentence id="157">All I know is that Grandmother basically, the grandmother herself did not come from a religious family, or maybe she did, because she was very well educated. </sentence><sentence id="158">And for a 19" century woman to know French and German and be fluent in languages is sort of unusual. </sentence><sentence id="159">She came from a good family. </sentence><sentence id="160">But she married my grandfather, who was very religious, and then she wore a wig. </sentence><sentence id="161">Yes, so I have one picture, which I have given to the Museum, where there's a family picture with Grandma in the middle, and you could see that she is wearing a sheitel and whether she did it because... Maybe it was an arranged marriage. </sentence><sentence id="162">I mean, I really don't know. </sentence><sentence id="163">This is all speculation, but I do say that I have never known my grandfather, but I was very close to my grandmother. </sentence><sentence id="164">And she used to invite one child at the time, in the summer, to spend a week with her. </sentence><sentence id="165">So, she did the Baruch Atah (ph) at the breakfast and she taught us how to pray at night but, you know, she felt she needed to supplement what was missing in our education because we - I, personally - went to public school, Polish public school, and I also went to the Tarbut Hebrew school after school, which was a Zionist organized - Mother was, you know, president of WIZO, and through her effort the Tarbut was organized. </sentence><sentence id="166">In fact, my sister Hania, Anna, reminded me that the teacher who was hired to run the Hebrew school in our town, a Mr. Wopata (ph), was brought over by my mother, and he lived in our apartment, in our home, until they found lodgings for him. </sentence><sentence id="167">So, you see, that in no way it disparages the religious group. </sentence><sentence id="168">It's just that there was a segment of population in Starachowice - Wierzbnik, meaning Wierzbnik because we are talking before the war - there was a segment of the population which was more, it was secular; not detached from Judaism, but detached from the strict observance, because, you know, the religious group, the Hassidim, had their own schools for girls, Beth Jacob, and of course they had the heder - the heder, that goes without saying. </sentence><sentence id="169">There  was a heder, and there was a girl. </sentence><sentence id="170">None of us went to any of these schools, you see, so I went to Polish public school and to the Hebrew Tarbut after, you know, after my school was out, after my Polish school was out. </sentence><sentence id="171">So it didn't separate us from the Jewish population, but we were not part of that other life. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="188">Q: Was there a good percentage of the Jewish population who were more like you than were religious, or was it a really tiny group? </sentence><sentence id="189">Do you know? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="192">A: Really, I couldn't tell you, but I do know a lot of people on my parents level who were, in fact some of them were survivors and I've kept in touch with them, and so there were, you know, they were sort of what they used to call "intelligentia", which is sort of, I don't know. </sentence><sentence id="193">I use the expression for the lack of better description because I don't mean in any way to show this group to be superior to the other group. </sentence><sentence id="194">It's just that this was the less observant group, no less religious, and the fact that my mother was so extremely, extremely devoted to the cause of creating, you know, the Zionist movement, the...helping along the pioneers who had gone to Israel, excuse me, to Palestine in those days. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="199">Q: What was she like? </sentence><sentence id="200">What kind of woman...? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="203">A: Very vivacious, extremely vivacious, quick moving, quick thinking and lively, lively, very lively. </sentence><sentence id="204">Father was lively, too, but in a more serious way. </sentence><sentence id="205">Mother was very vivacious and the...well, her outstanding characteristic was that she was really very...altruistic isn't the word, she was very concerned with others. </sentence><sentence id="206">She always did for others, one way or another, she did for others, you know. </sentence><sentence id="207">There was a - I remember there was a flood, somewhere in Poland, I really don't know, but I do remember that there was money being collected in the community - not Jewish community - for the cause, to help the flood victims. </sentence><sentence id="208">And I remember she made me a boat out of cardboard, because we went through the streets for donations, and I wore that boat, now, I don't know where the flood was and I don't know how that was all organized. </sentence><sentence id="209">I just remember walking around with this, like a ship made out of cardboard with , you know, and people would put in coins and that was the collection, so in retrospect when I think about it, and you know, all this idea of the Jewish population living parallel lives with the Polish populations but not mingling doesn't always hold true, because I'm sure this was not a Jewish flood, and I still don't know where the flood was, but I do distinctly remember as a child walking around with this boat, where people, it was like on a ribbon, you know, I had it attached on a ribbon, and people would put in money for the flood victims. </sentence><sentence id="210">So you see, to me, that is, this is already an indication that people who claim that there was absolutely no connection between the Christian Poles and the Jewish Poles doesn't hold true because, in our personal lives, I know for a fact that we were very close to Christians, to Christian families, some of whom saved our lives later on, but that's another story. </sentence><sentence id="211">But when we talk about the flood, this is a general, a more general overview of things, and much as there was anti-Semitism on another kind of level, but there had to be coexistence, that, you know, supplied some kind of a living arrangement if nothing else, so... but of course we got off the subject, I don't know how, we did... </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="212">Q: That's okay. </sentence><sentence id="213">Your father was a forestry engineer is that correct? </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="214">A: Yes, yes. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="216">Q: Did you know what he was doing? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="218">A: No, I just knew that he - the first time I heard the word "logarithm", was that he was working with logarithms. </sentence><sentence id="219">I don't know if it was a machine, but anyhow I found that it was the figuration, not a figuration, assessments of forestry, because he used to travel to eastern parts of Poland, where there were heavy forests, virgin forests and he would assess, you know, he would assess the forest for the lumber industry and that was engineering and - I - it was engineering for which there was another Polish word, but I don't know the English word, but that was his occupation. </sentence><sentence id="220">He was, as I told you, he was educated in the German language and I imagine German in those days carried a heavy weight in the scientific field, so he, I'm sure he had an easy life, easy time of it, you know. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="224">Q: Was he away a lot? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="226">A: What? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="228">Q: Was he away from home a great deal, do you remember? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="230">A: No, no, those were short trips, because, you know, he was basically employed by, in town. </sentence><sentence id="231">There was a sawmill owned by Jews, I think they were, I never knew, but I think they were from Vienna, or somewhere but the name was Heller because everybody talked about the Heller sawmill. </sentence><sentence id="232">In fact, Hania reminded me that subsequently when the sawmill was taken over by the Germans, there were Jews from our town who did slave labor in the sawmill which somehow or other I didn't exactly, you know... I only remember the factory, the munitions factory, in relation to the labor camps, because I'm getting a little bit ahead of myself, but I always think of war production in the munitions factory, but basically the sawmill was also a war production, if you really want to put it in it's proper perspective, I mean, they certainly weren't building, doing lumber for Jews to build houses or anything like that, so that goes without saying. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="236">Q: Were you wealthy? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="238">A: No, but we were well to do, but not until just before the war. </sentence><sentence id="239">That was, you know, during the depression, the Heller's I think sold it, or whatever it was, they sold it or they gave it up, I don't know, but I know that Father lost the position and then we had very hard times but so did everybody else. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="242">Q: So, how, when you say you were well to do, what, how does that manifest itself? </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="243">A: Well I mean, if you look at the old pictures, and you they traveled to the Baltic sea to the Sopot. </sentence><sentence id="244">My parents have a lot of pictures from, had a lot of pictures from that. </sentence><sentence id="245">I also know that Mother had severe arthritis and she used to go for cure, for six-week cure and that was another very wonderful experience because she always took at least one of us. </sentence><sentence id="246">And I still have pictures that were sent to us from Palestine, from Israel, from friends of Mother's who had those pictures from Sopot and had pictures from Busko Zdroj which was that, that, no, spa and I remember going with Mother. </sentence><sentence id="247">In other words, what happened is one kid went to Grandma and two kids went with Mother to Busko Zdroj and the six weeks that Mother had treatments there, of course, generally weakened her a lot. </sentence><sentence id="248">So, when we would come back, we would go in the country, you know, on a farm, on somebody's farm and we would stay a week so Mother could recover, and I imagine that you couldn't well afford, if you couldn't afford to go to Busko Zdroj every year. </sentence><sentence id="249">In fact, you know, during the war when everything was closed off for Jews, meaning we couldn't travel, we couldn't go to school and such and such, of course, Mother could not go, I mean, not that we could afford it, but you know, but I'm saying that because she no longer was able to go for her treatments, which was sulfur by the way, sulfur baths, and she suffered terribly, she... her arthritis was much worse because, of course, she, she had no way of curing, I mean not curing, you don't cure arthritis, but alleviating the pain. </sentence><sentence id="250">And Busko Zdroj was a very interesting place for a child because the baths were within a park, you see. </sentence><sentence id="251">It was, of course, you could not, this was not a public park, and they had a band shell and they had music - opera, arias - and to this day when I hear Tosca, I remember sitting in Busko Zdroj in front of the band shell listening to the music, yes, it was very nice. </sentence><sentence id="252">And, and we stayed in a hotel, which was very nearby, because you don't need to cross the road, whatever, street, to go into the park for the baths, and I used to go and object to the smell because, you know, sulfur smells like rotten eggs. </sentence><sentence id="253">And I would go with mother and I would hear the sound when they set up - they used to call it mud, you know, those were mud baths basically, so you would - they would turn - there was always an attendant and then I sat out in a like vestibule type, or whatever it was, but I wasn't inside, but I would hear when the sound came out "bloto" - that means mud, mud was coming - and you know, and I know what they did. </sentence><sentence id="254">The person would be, Mother would be in a bathtub, the mud would fill it, they would put a wooden crate over the bathtub, and throw a sheet over it, so that she was submerged in that hot sulfur mud, after which the attendant would take her for a shower and then they would massage her, whatever, on the table like, then we would go home - she had to go to bed. </sentence><sentence id="255">Those were crude, very heavy-handed treatments, but they were good. </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="256">Q: They helped her? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="258">A: Yes, because during the war she was really sick. </sentence><sentence id="259">She couldn't go anymore, you know, since Busko was very near Kielce and that required traveling, and there was no traveling for Jews. </sentence><sentence id="260">End of Tape #1  Tape #2 </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="264">Q: I want to get, before we get to the war period, I wanted to ask you, up until 1939, what is your relationship with your sisters? </sentence><sentence id="265">You are...? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="268">A: I'll tell you right away, from a viewpoint of the family type, they really liked me a lot, but I was never included. </sentence><sentence id="269">This is... </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="272">Q: [Laughs.] </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="274">A: This is... I probably should now refer back to what I started at the beginning, that my parents, sort of, I always felt my parents took pity on me. </sentence><sentence id="275">So they said, "Oh, you're smarter than everybody," and such, true or false. </sentence><sentence id="276">I mean, I took it for the truth, but the fact remains that I wasn't to bother, to bother, to bother them, because they were already older. </sentence><sentence id="277">I was just to, to be around my parents. </sentence><sentence id="278">So, if you went somewhere, my parents took me along. </sentence><sentence id="279">If they went somewhere, you know, I tagged along. </sentence><sentence id="280">And I even have a picture somebody sent me from Connecticut. </sentence><sentence id="281">His parents had a New Year's Eve party and you can see my parents and his parents, some other people and there's wine on the table, and in the middle of everything, I'm the only kid sitting there. </sentence><sentence id="282">I'm a little kid, a scrawny, little kid, meaning it really reinforces my memory that I tagged along, even though whether I enjoyed it or not, I couldn't say, but I do know that I was the special child, so to say, so they took me everywhere, but of course the truth was that they had to take me.

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="294">Q: You know, it's interesting because Chris is only two years older than you. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="296">A: Right, yes. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="298">Q: But there was - you were the kid to her. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="300">A: Yes. </sentence><sentence id="301">The reason is, I think that Chris is, first of all she is the middle child, you know. </sentence><sentence id="302">She was always very independent, Krysia was always very independent, you know, hands on, this and that. </sentence><sentence id="303">I was sort of a kid type of, that you had to look after. </sentence><sentence id="304">So Chris - maybe she felt I was a burden, if she wanted to go and have some friends, have some good times with her friends, why would she bother looking after the kid, if I fell or if I didn't fall of whatever? </sentence><sentence id="305">You know, but of course, we loved each other. </sentence><sentence id="306">As you very well know, we are the closest family that there is, that there ever was, and that wasn't even because we went through the war together, that we were bound by common horrible experience. </sentence><sentence id="307">But because the family was such, that we really were one, even though - and you know, I never felt slighted, you know. </sentence><sentence id="308">I just knew that, if I'm going to have a good time, it's going to be with my parents or with my own peers but certainly not with Chris and Miles, and that was even true during the war, not, why did I say? </sentence><sentence id="309">Miles, I didn't say Miles, I didn't mean Miles. </sentence><sentence id="310">I meant Chris and Hania. </sentence><sentence id="311">That was even true during the war when the refugees from Lodz were sent in. </sentence><sentence id="312">You know, there was a group of Jews sent into our ghetto. </sentence><sentence id="313">And immediately the quote "golden youth of Lodz" ended up in the circle of  0 Hania and Chris. </sentence><sentence id="314">And they would read poetry, and Byron, Lord Byron in translation and all this. </sentence><sentence id="315">I sat in the same room, but certainly not within the circle. </sentence><sentence id="316">I heard it, I was a non- participant observer. </sentence><sentence id="317">I was somewhere in the room, but I was not of the group, I was with the group, you see? </sentence><sentence id="318">But that did not in any way preclude the terrific devotion that my sister had shown me, because I know for a fact there were instances during the war that I was a goner, and had it not been for them, I would never ever have survived. </sentence><sentence id="319">So, you see, when push came to shove, and of course - but even without that, you know, you study kids in the family...you know, some kids... Maybe they felt my that parents protected me, so they didn't need to bother. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="340">Q: Let me just ask you a question. </sentence><sentence id="341">Chris - when I interviewed Chris - she mentioned something about you, that she remembered, you as a child, and I wonder if you remembered the same thing. </sentence><sentence id="342">She said you would always pick up new words constantly and use them immediately, often inappropriately, sometimes not... Do you recall that? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="346">A: Yes, yes. </sentence><sentence id="347">Absolutely, I mean this was really, almost an obsession. </sentence><sentence id="348">This is how I became a translator, because it's so easy for me to pick up words and think words. </sentence><sentence id="349">And when I came to America, I had no knowledge of English, but having known some French and Latin before and having fooled around with these big words - you see, Polish vocabulary contains a lot of words out of Latin, you know - so later on, I - because I really was crazy about words as a child, and of course quite often I used to misuse them, you know, misuse them, but I still used them, wrong or right or whatever; I stuck them in wherever I could. </sentence><sentence id="350">And this is why I had such an easy time with English, because it was really a matter of hearing the pronunciation and learning spelling. </sentence><sentence id="351">But if I read it to myself quietly, I could make out the text, because, you see, I have found the similarities with the other languages, and the fact that somehow or other, my mind was oriented to words, whatever. </sentence><sentence id="352">So that is true, she is absolutely right. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="360">Q: So, as you're growing up - now, you're born in "29, so when the Nazis take over in Germany... </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="362">A: I'm 10 years old, no, not in Germany... </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="364">Q: ...No, "33 - you're much younger. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="366">A: Yeah. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="368">Q: So, between "33 and "39, do you hear things - I know towards the end of "39, there are German Jews that come into your area, right? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="370">A: Yes. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="372">Q: So, do you begin to experience... sense something, even if you don't know what's happening? </sentence><sentence id="373"> 1 </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="376"> A Well, I sensed something, but I've said it so often now, and it truly is a fact, I really didn't know very much, I don't really know, and I keep saying it, I mean, it's repetition now until you can't take it anymore, but the fact is I don't know what my parents knew and when they knew it. </sentence><sentence id="377">And I certainly knew that times were rough; I knew that something was happening in Germany. </sentence><sentence id="378">But I also knew that there was a famine in China, you know, so - because there was a famine in China in the 30s, I think - so that I knew that there was famine in China and I knew there was something going on in Germany, but how that related to my personal life or to us, it was sort of far-fetched. </sentence><sentence id="379">I did begin, during the economic times, I did begin to feel certain pressures, and I did begin to feel certain anti-Semitic, well, direct anti-Semitic references to who we were, but that was not on any scale - because as a child, you know, a child can call you a Jew and he can call you baldy and he can call you any kind rotten name, and if you can rationalize to yourself within that context, you know how kids fight, and... So, I was aware of a certain change in atmosphere in Poland because I do know now from studying history that there was a wave of anti-Semitism that was extremely, to the naked eye, it was easy to see, because, you know, when I translated - I was working on Korchuk (ph) a lot, Korchuk's writing, and I translated his works - I realized that his only, the only reason for his being removed from the position of the good doctor, who read poetry and talked about child upbringing on the radio in the 30s, that he was removed from that position only because of anti- Semitism. </sentence><sentence id="380">He was a very progressive educator, as you know, and a very enlightened man and he was a Jew, of course, by birth, but he was very Polish in his upbringing and outlook, not Christian, but Polish, and he brought all these new ideas to Poland, because he studied in England, you know, and he brought the new ideas, the new approach to child upbringing, because he also wrote stories for children, you know. </sentence><sentence id="381">He wrote books about children and books for children. </sentence><sentence id="382">And he would read and they would call him the "old doctor", and I know, I used to listen to the old doctor, but then I didn't hear the old doctor. </sentence><sentence id="383">In those days, I didn't know, but I now know, that the program - that he was removed from the radio program only because he was Jew, because the anti-Semitic, the wave of anti-Semitism has progressed to the point where, toward the outbreak of the war, it was really almost palpable. </sentence><sentence id="384">And all this happened, you know, after Pilsudski died, Marshall Pilsudski, who died in 1935, had the idea of a federal, federalist state, Poland being, including minorities and such. </sentence><sentence id="385">And after he died - of course all this I know now from studying history - that those who opposed him so strenuously were of the national right-wing party, and they came into prominence in the late 30s, so that the wave of anti- Semitism, which actually was given freer reign, could basically come to the fore. </sentence><sentence id="386">You know, they, maybe they weren't encouraged, but they weren't stopped. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="398">Q: So, though you know this now... </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="400">A: Yes. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="402">Q: ...from reading the history, did you experience the change as being that significant? </sentence><sentence id="403"> 2 </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="406">A: I experienced - you know, I have spoken about this several times. </sentence><sentence id="407">I have experienced a few, a few such - well, it was an incident or it was rather a sort of a one-two-three kind of a happening. </sentence><sentence id="408">For example, I had - I went to school. </sentence><sentence id="409">I don't know if it was 1938 or deg39, first day of school, and I had a new teacher. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="414">Q: But this was before the war? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="416">A: Before the war, probably it was 19- No, I didn't go to school in 1939 because September is when the war broke out. </sentence><sentence id="417">So, it had to be 1938. </sentence><sentence id="418">And I went to school and this was a male teacher. </sentence><sentence id="419">And he said, "I would like every child to stand up, and tell me his name," you know, so that he could acquaint himself. </sentence><sentence id="420">When I stood up, and I said, "My name is Regina Laks," he looked up at me and said, "Your name is not Regina. </sentence><sentence id="421">You go home to your mother and tell her that your name is Rivka." ( </sentence><sentence id="422">ph) Well, I was so hurt by it, I never forgot it. </sentence><sentence id="423">I always talk about it, always, always, because I was so very hurt by it. </sentence><sentence id="424">Apparently, I have already been feeling other things around me, but they were not as personal, in front of a class, with brand new kids. </sentence><sentence id="425">That was one incident that remained with me for a life, for the life, and another was a new family came to live in my neighborhood, and I got very friendly with a girl - her name was Kaya (ph), very lovely, lovely. </sentence><sentence id="426">They were educated people, and we used to play a lot. </sentence><sentence id="427">She used to come to my house; I used to go to her house. </sentence><sentence id="428">And then around Passover, and I don't know what year that was. </sentence><sentence id="429">that could have been maybe 1937, because I was a little kid yet, maybe. </sentence><sentence id="430">Anyhow, so I said, "Why don't we go home and play in my house." </sentence><sentence id="431">And she said, "No, I can't go to play in your house. </sentence><sentence id="432">My mother said not to go because it's Passover and the Jews take blood from the children for Passover." </sentence><sentence id="433">You see, that was a child who probably wasn't anymore than 7 or 8 years old. </sentence><sentence id="434">So, those two very personal, very personal, encounters stayed with me for a lifetime. </sentence><sentence id="435">But, as I was saying, I still felt part of the environment that I grew up in. </sentence><sentence id="436">I never felt that the Christians were against me or that I was against them. </sentence><sentence id="437">I could only see the difference between the Hassidim who didn't mix at all and didn't want to mix, and the Polish population. </sentence><sentence id="438">But as far as I was concerned, I really felt very much at home and, you know, we spoke Polish only at home. </sentence><sentence id="439">My parents knew Yiddish and spoke it to each other if they didn't want us to know. </sentence><sentence id="440">Of course, my father spoke German very well, and Mother spoke Russian by virtue of growing up in, under the Russian sphere of influence. </sentence><sentence id="441">But aside from that, Polish was the language. </sentence><sentence id="442">And, in fact, a lot of Christians were surprised that we spoke without an accent which is probably - with a subtext, with a hidden subtext, you know, when you got a compliment, "Oh, my goodness, you speak Polish so well!" </sentence><sentence id="443">Of course, there was a subtext, not that I knew it then but I know it now. </sentence><sentence id="444">In other words, I was not supposed to speak Polish so well and without an accent by virtue of being Jewish. </sentence><sentence id="445">But really that didn't bother me in the sense, in any way. </sentence><sentence id="446">I took it as a compliment; I took it as a fact, you see, and I've never felt in any way angry at the Poles or blaming them or, or I never, any animosity. </sentence><sentence id="447">I mean, they were people to me, dear people, and those especially who were very dear to my parents were very dear to us. </sentence><sentence id="448">And I certainly had wonderful friends among the Christian children, so that, that issue never came up. </sentence><sentence id="449">And when those two incidents came,  3 I took them as separate and detached from the bigger picture, you know, it was on a smaller scale, kids" stuff </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="484">Q: But let me - can I probe this just a little bit? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="486">A: Yes. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="488">Q: What was it, that your feelings were, when you - was it humiliation? </sentence><sentence id="489">Was it anger, when the teacher said your name is Rivka what...? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="492">A: Very humiliated, I was not angry. </sentence><sentence id="493">I was... He put me to shame, because my name really was not Rivka. </sentence><sentence id="494">It so happens, if you want to, you know, give a child a Jewish name, it is Rivka - because Regina is really Rivka - but I was never, in Tarbut, in the Hebrew school, I had the name Regina then was Rivka and, but I was never ever - I was either Regina or Renia, I was never Rivka and to be singled out like this, I don't know. </sentence><sentence id="495">I - school was very dear to me always, and school was everything to me, and I was always good in school, so I felt always elevated and wonderful about the school experience. </sentence><sentence id="496">And this was a very harsh and very humiliating kind of experience because I by then knew what it was that he was trying to say. </sentence><sentence id="497">He didn't care about me. </sentence><sentence id="498">He perhaps wanted to imply that I was camouflaging my Jewishness. </sentence><sentence id="499">Because you see, I did not go to the Jewish school; I went to the public school. </sentence><sentence id="500">And there weren't too many of us, but there were kids, most certainly. </sentence><sentence id="501">So, I sort of felt that | was being humiliated for no reason, and not because I could analyze it in depth. </sentence><sentence id="502">It's just that I knew that Rivka wasn't my name. </sentence><sentence id="503">Regina - if you looked, as I said at the beginning, if you looked at any kind of my legal papers or otherwise, records or whatever, it's always Regina, not Renia, and its not Rivka, it's really Regina - so that this was my name, I was born and given this name. </sentence><sentence id="504">So that, that was a double humiliation, as if I were really telling a lie or something on one hand, or maybe I was trying to camouflage something which was not the case. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="518">Q: Were there other Jewish kids in the class? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="520">A: Oh yes, certainly, yes, children, absolutely </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="522">Q: Did he do the same thing to them? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="524">A: Not in this particular instance. </sentence><sentence id="525">I don't know, he must have, I don't know, just me. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="528">Q: And what did the other kids do when he said that? </sentence><sentence id="529">Did they do any- Did they laugh, did they...? </sentence><sentence id="530">Nothing? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="534">A: No, and I went home and I told Mother. </sentence><sentence id="535">I said, "He told me to tell you that this is not my name." </sentence><sentence id="536">Mother says, "Don't worry about it." </sentence><sentence id="537">And what was done about it, I don't know. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="542">Q: Did he ever call you that name again? </sentence><sentence id="543"> 4 </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="546"> A No, no, he had to call me Regina because that was in the record. </sentence><sentence id="547">But Mother did feel the humiliation I suffered and she said, "Ah, doesn't matter, it's not a big deal," whatever it was, but I never forgot it. </sentence><sentence id="548">So, it absolutely stayed with me all these years and, you know, Chris and Hania, I don't even know if they know about it, in the sense of... I had a few incidents in my life, including the German, the war. </sentence><sentence id="549">There were certain little incidents that hurt so much, that were totally insignificant on a larger scale, but somehow, you know, I guess it's how you, I don't know, I don't know what is important to you in life or whatever. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="554">Q: Right, it's hard to know what it is that : </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="556">A: Yes, but those, yeah, those two things I never forgot, the one with the Rivka and with the Jews, blood for the matzos. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="558">Q: So, what did you say to that little girl when she said this to you? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="560">A: No, nothing! </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="562">Q: Nothing? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="564">A: Nothing, I said, ""No, you don't want to come? </sentence><sentence id="565">That's fine. </sentence><sentence id="566">You don't want to come." </sentence><sentence id="567">So, she said, "Okay, you come after the holidays." </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="572">Q: So, did you go home and tell your parents that she said this to you? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="574">A: Yes. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="576">Q: And what did they say? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="578">A: They said nothing, "You don't even have to play with her because she's new." </sentence><sentence id="579">You know, so they said, "Well, you know she's new." </sentence><sentence id="580">You see, this is the whole point. </sentence><sentence id="581">Our parents, especially with regards to me - I cannot speak for Chris and I cannot speak for Anna, Hania, I cannot speak for them - because I was really truly protected. </sentence><sentence id="582">Anything that ever happened was somehow smoothed over. " </sentence><sentence id="583">Oh, she said that she's new here. </sentence><sentence id="584">Anyhow, you don't have to play with her." </sentence><sentence id="585">You know, "He told you that your name is like this? </sentence><sentence id="586">You know that's not true, you know you have your own name and that's what it is." </sentence><sentence id="587">So that, there, things were always smoothed over in a way where they shouldn't bother me, but some of course did bother me and they stayed with me obviously. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="598">Q: Do you remember, do you remember people coming into your parents" house, adults, before, right before the war, where there was people talking about what might be happening? </sentence><sentence id="599">Not that you participated in it, but did you ever experience people coming in and there being a certain kind of tension in the house, even though you couldn't...? </sentence><sentence id="600"> 5 </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="604">A: Well, I know my parents were very sociable. </sentence><sentence id="605">They always had company and such, but I really don't remember, no, I don't remember. </sentence><sentence id="606">As I said, I do, did know something going on with the German Jews and I knew there was famine in China. </sentence><sentence id="607">I knew that, but this, those were such big issues and I was not ever invited to share this kind of conversation, you know, so I guess between that and being protected, it really ended up by my being totally oblivious to the realities of the late 30s. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="612">Q: I thought maybe you would be sitting outside of a conversation... </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="614">A: Well, I would, I would listen, yes, but you know, somehow it sort of went in and out, you know. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="616">Q: Okay. </sentence><sentence id="617">So then September 1939 comes, yeah, September 1939. </sentence><sentence id="618">And this must be a huge shock. </sentence><sentence id="619">All of a sudden... </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="624">A: Yeah, the Germans, yeah, yeah. </sentence><sentence id="625">That was, I mean, it was not a shock, because they were already talking about the war, there's gonna be a war, but of course the larger part of it I really didn't know. </sentence><sentence id="626">I just knew that the Germans were invading and there were anti- aircraft trenches being dug and all this thing - the youth, mobilize the youth to dig the trenches. </sentence><sentence id="627">I wasn't invited. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="632">Q: [Laughs.] </sentence><sentence id="633">You were too young. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="636">A: So, I wasn't invited, but I do know there is going to be a war. </sentence><sentence id="637">Why the Germans were planning on a war, | didn't know. </sentence><sentence id="638">I didn't know anything except for the fact that, when, when, Father was, what you call, they had civilians for anti-aircraft, what you call... a civilian force for alert, you know, so my father was a captain for the block, or whatever you call it. </sentence><sentence id="639">And he used to go to briefings to say when, you know, and then the sirens would wail. </sentence><sentence id="640">So, Father went to briefing and he came home and he said there's going to be a, a bombardment and they are going to be bombarding Starachowice because there is this factory here, this munitions factory, and the town is ordered to evacuate. </sentence><sentence id="641">You see, so then I knew the war was on. </sentence><sentence id="642">Now, that had to be very early September. </sentence><sentence id="643">The war broke out on the first, on the western part, so maybe this was the fourth or fifth or something like this, but first week of the war. </sentence><sentence id="644">And we were told to evacuate, I mean, not were told - everybody, all the precinct captains spread the word, and everybody was to head for the forest. </sentence><sentence id="645">There were woods, you know, surrounding the area. </sentence><sentence id="646">So, we did as told and everybody was going toward the forest. </sentence><sentence id="647">And Mother made sure that we got dressed very well, that we wore the best...this always amazes, amuses me because this was around the holidays, you know, the Jewish holidays. </sentence><sentence id="648">I got a pair of brand new shoes, so Mother says, "Tt's the best thing to do is to wear the best clothes and to have enough, because God knows when we'll come back and you might as well have the good stuff rather than the old stuff, right?" </sentence><sentence id="649">So, I put on a pair of brand new shoes which were never broken in, and after, later on when we came back, I had blisters on the feet. [ </sentence><sentence id="650">Laughs.] </sentence><sentence id="651">Anyhow, we had  6 to get dressed in more than one thing because, in case, when we come back and there's no house left, we had to have something. </sentence><sentence id="652">This was the hottest September on record. </sentence><sentence id="653">So, we ended up in the woods outside... </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="672">Q: But how many...? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="674"> A I had a few layers of clothes and the new shoes, brand new shoes, which I never wore. </sentence><sentence id="675">I was going to wear them for the holidays. </sentence><sentence id="676">So that we ended up in the woods. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="680">Q: Did you take, I understand that you all carried something of value from the house. </sentence><sentence id="681">Is that right? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="684">A: Yes, right, not so much of value. </sentence><sentence id="685">Mother took sugar, yes, and I remember she had the salami kind of a thing she took there, because we did not know where we were going or what we'll be doing, and whatever you could wear, that's the good stuff, you wore. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="688">Q: Did you take something special of your own? </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="698">A: I really don't remember. </sentence><sentence id="699">I only remember the two things, that it was extremely hot and I had bad blisters on my feet because we ended up in the forest, in the words, mixed in with the, not just with the population of Wierzbnik, Starachowice, but all the peasants who lived in the surrounding area also evacuated and they basically took their horses and cows and dogs and so on. </sentence><sentence id="700">So you had this cacophony of sounds, the cows, and of course, 1 like to tell the story, of this, this sort of a joke on us type of incident. </sentence><sentence id="701">The factory, as you know, was smelting ore, because there was ore in the area, and they were doing, it was doing already war production, because in Starachowice, where the factory was, the plant, was located in a district called the central [says name in Polish] the central industrial area, that was organized for Poland after the first war, to arm themselves because they felt, you know, now that Poland was independent since 1918, they had to be armed. </sentence><sentence id="702">Well, they located these factories, the plants, in this central Poland area that had iron ore deposits, so there was ore smelting and such, so the rationale was such that in the first war, the first thing that was really destroyed were all the munition factories and all this. </sentence><sentence id="703">By virtue of this historic truth, all you could expect is smithereens in our town, so that everybody evacuated because if not, you were going to be wiped off the earth together with the factory, you see. </sentence><sentence id="704">And we found ourselves in the woods, with all that as I told you, the mixture of the Hassidim and the secular Jews and the Christians and the peasants and the  7 cows and the dogs and the horses. </sentence><sentence id="705">Meanwhile, the Germans came very close by. </sentence><sentence id="706">There was no bombing, no significant bombing on Starachowice, because obviously they were going to take over that factory in a blink of an eye, which they did. </sentence><sentence id="707">And we got caught in a valley - "we" meaning the entire mixture of everybody - we were caught in the valley. </sentence><sentence id="708">The Germans were on the one - you know, I come from a hilly, it's not mountainous area, but hilly, the Swietokrzyskie (ph) mountains are not far from us, but this is hilly area - so that you had the Germans on one side of the valley, you had the Polish troops on the other, and they shot at each other while we were in the valley, so that one horrendous night, when all the bullets were flying, we were right in the middle. </sentence><sentence id="709">And of course, the Germans in those days, and I know this for a fact, many more times from this one... [Tape cut off.] </sentence><sentence id="710">End of Tape #2  8 Tape #3 </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="725">Q: I think the tape stopped before you explained how the planes were swooping down with lights underneath them and shooting at you. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="727">A: Yes, at the group caught in the valley - townspeople and the peasants from the surrounding areas - and of course that was real, true, naked warfare, that's what that was, because eventually, I hate to say that, but I do know that there was bayonet warfare going on, and that was my first real true awakening to what was happening. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="729">Q: You must have been scared to death. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="731">A: Scared to...that was a night of total fear. </sentence><sentence id="732">I mean, you know, later on, because I didn't know fear, how, how extensive and how fierce fear can be, but that one night was the first experience in my life of acute fear. </sentence><sentence id="733">I didn't know whether we would ever make it, because we were not just in the crossfire, we were also being shot at from the airplanes. </sentence><sentence id="734">But all this went on until the morning. </sentence><sentence id="735">At dawn, of course, everybody went back to town. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="741">Q: Let me ask you something. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="743">A: Yes. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="745">Q: Did your mother hold you? </sentence><sentence id="746">Were you being held on to by somebody during the night? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="749">A: Yes, yes, we, I remember there were, the peasants had carts, you know, a cart with the horse, and I remember everybody was hiding under carts, you know, because they could see, and as I said before, the Germans, they didn't see us. </sentence><sentence id="750">They could hear because there was all that barking and baying and, and whatever other animal sounds you could hear, and even if the people were quiet. </sentence><sentence id="751">You cannot quiet an animal when he sees, when he hears shooting, so that gave us away. </sentence><sentence id="752">And the funny thing is - I just remembered something - at daylight, at daybreak, we sort of scattered from the area, and then the planes came again, and I ran over - everybody said, "Run under the bushes." </sentence><sentence id="753">So, you know there were trees and bushes, because we stayed in the forest. </sentence><sentence id="754">The valley was sort of a clearing, it was in the clearing, but surrounding was the forest. </sentence><sentence id="755">So, I ran over as fast as I could and I grabbed a tree. </sentence><sentence id="756">Well, it wasn't a tree! </sentence><sentence id="757">This was a Polish soldier! </sentence><sentence id="758">Because, you know, they had olive drab uniforms, green, type of green. </sentence><sentence id="759">And, of course, in the panic, I mean, everything, so I - the thing moved, the tree could move. </sentence><sentence id="760">Well, I look up and there was the soldier, but that was more as a, you know, I thought I probably felt good about it because he was going to protect me, you know, whereas everything else was naked fear. </sentence><sentence id="761">And subsequently when we went home - this is also very important, I think I've already mentioned it - the town was not bombed, absolutely not bombed, and that was, with I'm sure by design. </sentence><sentence id="762">So that eventually when everybody got settled back and it was now official that the Germans have occupied Poland, the factory was taken over and converted to heavy war machinery and, whereas before the war, Jews were not employed in that  9 plant, now Jews were beginning to be taken in as a labor force. </sentence><sentence id="763">Now this is just the mere beginning, because eventually, of course, the Jewish labor force was the primary force, because it was slave labor and it didn't - they had to pay the Poles. </sentence><sentence id="764">So, I really, I'm not an authority on it, but I would suspect that the professional engineers or whoever it is in that war industry, were retained and perhaps these unskilled workers, maybe the Christians, could have been dismissed, so that Jewish slave labor was hired. </sentence><sentence id="765">Because subsequently - I don't mean right now at the outbreak of the war - but subsequently, not only would the Jews start working as a force, labor force, in the factory, while there was still a ghetto, but once the ghetto was liquidated, there was a labor camp set up just to supply workers to the factory and, since there were always typhus and there were shootings and killings and Jews were just disposed of here and there, there was forever a new shipment arriving of workers. </sentence><sentence id="766">Now, what the specific number was of workers of workers, I don't know, maybe 2,000, but I know that the number stayed as was, because they had all these assigned spaces, I imagine. </sentence><sentence id="767">So that the slave labor was already in full operation shortly after the outbreak of the war, but later, when the camp was set up, they kept the number - because you know the Jews, the town was cleared of Jews, so they had no more, no more people in Starachowice to supply for the labor force, but they did bring them in from all over everywhere. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="787">Q: Do you happen to recall your first supper, dinner when you came back from the forest? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="789">A: Yes, I absolutely do! </sentence><sentence id="790">You know, it was hot summer, and we came - in fact, when we left in the morning, we didn't clear the table, because it was such a rush, and we had to get dressed, and we had to pack up, and Dad said, ""We've got to go, we've got to move because the bombs are going to fall any minute and the whole town is just going to be in ashes, and we've got to get out," So, we left everything. </sentence><sentence id="791">We came back, there were flies running all over, all the dishes were on the table, and I don't really remember but, whatever there was yet, I'm sure, you know, my mother must have kept stuff in her supply cupboards or whatever. </sentence><sentence id="792">So, I don't know that we experienced starvation when we got back, because it took awhile - you know, that was basically the German, the concept of eliminating the Jews by any way you could, so it's by starvation, or by shooting or whichever. </sentence><sentence id="793">But that did not enter the picture. </sentence><sentence id="794">You came home and whatever you had in your cupboards - and I imagine my mother must have stocked up on things because the talk of war was so prevalent. </sentence><sentence id="795">The only thing is that, you see, this is modern warfare - I mean, not by today's standards, when you have atomic weapons and such - in those days, that was modern warfare, but as you know even when you study sociology, they tell you, "First things happen, then culture and the way of living adapts itself to what's happening." </sentence><sentence id="796">Now, when the second war broke out, people like my parents, who survived, who went through the first war, applied the reasoning of the first war to the new experience of another war. </sentence><sentence id="797">In other words, what was true then should be applied now, and this is how you are going to manage this new event. </sentence><sentence id="798">But of course that was as far from the truth as it could be, because the warfare in the first war was not the same, the blitzkrieg itself, you know, the airplanes and all, that was the - I mean, the Germans occupied Poland I don't know how many, five days something like that - so who... in the  0 first, in the first war, there was no such thing. </sentence><sentence id="799">There was, there were battles fought hand to hand, and this is why the bayonet fight, that I heard later, that was sort of unusual because it didn't fit the picture, but we did hear it at night when they said they were fighting with bayonets. </sentence><sentence id="800">It could be that was also hearsay because, yes, people would expect that, judging by the first war. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="813">Q: What is your most immediate recollection of the change for your life, not everybody else's life, but as a child? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="815">A: Yes, the first and foremost, I didn't go to school. </sentence><sentence id="816">That was first. </sentence><sentence id="817">Number two, there is a river runs through Starachowice, Wierzbnik its called Kamienna, it's a tributary of the Vistula. </sentence><sentence id="818">Now, we used to go swim in the river. </sentence><sentence id="819">We had a little dog and he used to go, we had a maid, she loved that dog, so she - we would go swimming and she would soap up the dog in a bucket and throw him in the river, and then would go after the dog in the river. </sentence><sentence id="820">Anyhow, so number one, there was no school. </sentence><sentence id="821">It was very hot, September was very hot - couldn't go swimming. </sentence><sentence id="822">Then you started seeing - the Germans were marching through the town, all the time, in formation, they sung. </sentence><sentence id="823">You know, they were always marching wearing those boots and singing. </sentence><sentence id="824">And very soon, there were these - I cannot say whether it was Gestapo, SS or whoever - they started coming around in these little groupings, individuals, two Nazis or three Nazis, with a dog or two dogs, so that immediately put a stop to my even going outside to play. </sentence><sentence id="825">So, all the things that were dear to me, starting with school, number one, were now out, certainly couldn't go Ostrowiec to visit Grandma because travel was out. </sentence><sentence id="826">So, I probably didn't understand the larger picture of what was involved, but I certainly knew on a more personal basis that things are completely different and that whatever is happening is not good. </sentence><sentence id="827">That much, I mean, I could see. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="841">Q: Did you feel, as a Jewish person, as a Jewish child, different from what was happening to the Christian Polish kids? </sentence><sentence id="842">I mean you had, there was a very close family, the Paliszewskis, to you, right? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="845">A: Yes, exactly, the Christian people, yes. </sentence><sentence id="846">Well, the point is, eventually, I mean, I don't know, 10" of September, 31* of, 31deg of October or whenever, the schools were open and the children went back to school, but we didn't. </sentence><sentence id="847">It isn't that the schools were closed. </sentence><sentence id="848">The schools were closed to Jewish children. </sentence><sentence id="849">So, that was the first and immediate, so to say, blow to my...to me. </sentence><sentence id="850">And whatever other bigger things that were happening, I was oblivious of that because nobody told me. </sentence><sentence id="851">As I've said so many times, my parents were so protective that I never really knew the full truth until the war was over and I started reading up on things that I found out what really went on. </sentence><sentence id="852">I just knew that nothing was good anymore, and certainly I couldn't go to school, so that was a big blow. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="861">Q: Was your maid Jewish or Christian? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="863">A: No, no, she was Christian, she was Christian. </sentence><sentence id="864"> 1 </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="867">Q: So, what happened to the maid and the dog? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="869">A: Well, this is, this is an interesting story. </sentence><sentence id="870">I always talk about my dog, I loved him! </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="873">Q: What was his name? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="875">A: Ledy. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="877">Q: Lenny? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="879">A: Ledy , I don't know whether he's meant to be Lady or Ledy or whatever, but we called him Ledy. </sentence><sentence id="880">And it was a birthday present for one of us. </sentence><sentence id="881">My father brought him in a packet. </sentence><sentence id="882">He was a tiny little pup, all white, a Spitz, and my father - I forgot who's birthday it was but that was a birthday present - and he was a very lovely, beautiful white dog but you had to brush him all the time, and the maid adored him, her name was Genia (ph).Anyhow, shortly before the war, he became vicious. </sentence><sentence id="883">What happened, we had, my mother, my grandmother, from Ostrowiec had a cousin by the name of Pfeffer (ph). </sentence><sentence id="884">They were very well-to-do Jews in Ostrowiec, and her son - her sons had all the motor vehicles that were good in 1939 - her son, one son had a Ford and one son had a motorcycle, and he came running through Starachowice on his motorcycle and had an accident and ended up in the hospital, in the Starachowice hospital. </sentence><sentence id="885">He was from Ostrowiec his name was Pfeffer (ph), the last name, but I don't know his first name. </sentence><sentence id="886">Well, anyhow, the mother immediately came, stayed with us, and she cooked for him. </sentence><sentence id="887">She started cooking all these exquisite dishes, and he wouldn't eat, because he was laid up in the hospital - I don't know he had broken bones - she would bring it back and feed it to the dog. </sentence><sentence id="888">Now, the dog was on a very strict, whatever. </sentence><sentence id="889">This dog started eating all these fancy things. </sentence><sentence id="890">Anyhow, this is the story I was told why he became vicious. </sentence><sentence id="891">One day, a woman was passing by - because there was a big courtyard, you know, in European houses, you had a gate, like a big gate you went through, and there was a courtyard - a woman was coming through the courtyard, he was barking to get out, he jumped on the handle, however, he got himself out of the house, ran over and tore the woman's skirt up front, a whole big chunk of skirt. </sentence><sentence id="892">Well, after that, of course, my parents had to pay for the clothes and so on, but he was taken to a farm, so we had to give him away, because he was unmanageable. </sentence><sentence id="893">I always knew that he was spoiled by that food, but maybe not, I don't know. </sentence><sentence id="894">But anyhow, so we didn't have the dog. </sentence><sentence id="895">As for the maid, she lived way out, at the outskirts of the town, with an old mother. </sentence><sentence id="896">And she was a maid for my parents from way back, I mean, way, way, like when Hania was a baby, because we have pictures from the Baltic sea and such, she sits there, Genia (ph) sits with Hania, you know, we see her in pictures, we saw her in pictures a lot. </sentence><sentence id="897">Anyhow, she lived in the outskirts of the city, and subsequently she turned out to be one of those who did not prove herself to be a true friend, because she took things from us during the war that Mother wanted to give her to save, like a sewing machine, you know, things of value, and she absolutely denied. </sentence><sentence id="898">When Chris and Hania went back to Poland and went to see her, she had drapes, velvet, green velvet drapes, and  2 bedspreads to match, it was hanging and she said she didn't have it. </sentence><sentence id="899">My mother had a box of china that was in perfect condition that she took. </sentence><sentence id="900">She denied it; it was right there. </sentence><sentence id="901">And she, I think she said she was going to denounce them, Chris and Hania, you know, because you know Chris and Hania went back to Starachowice and there was this horrible incident that night, and the Paliszewskis saved their life. </sentence><sentence id="902">So, you right away have this balance, you can balance this, whether Genia (ph) was greed, it was pure greed, or whether it was other motivation, I don't know, but she was member of the family for years, I mean, many years, so that she did not prove to be a friend, as good a friend as she ought to have been, because she was treated very well by the family. </sentence><sentence id="903">But of course the others, the Paliszewskis, they were people who saved our lives and such. </sentence><sentence id="904">So, you can see there is never a one answer to this kind of a problem. </sentence><sentence id="905">This is why I've always felt that, as much as you want to remember personal incidents, the true picture to me of living in Poland as a Jewish person is not of one of animosity to the others, you just, you have to have that understanding because always for one example, you will always find another example to counterbalance that, and this is exactly how I have felt right along and not many people feel that way, I know. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="934">Q: No, I was going to ask you why, because often, certainly in my family, the anger at the Polish population is sometimes more severe than to the Germans. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="936">A: Yes, this is how it was, and people from my hometown, very much so. </sentence><sentence id="937">I don't know if you know that I was involved with the restoration of the cemetery in Starachowice, and when I originally brought up the subject - later 1 went to Poland in 1980 and we went to the cemetery with the Paliszewski's granddaughter, she took us there - we took pictures of the cemetery itself and of different tombstones which were, of course, overturned and overgrown and whatever. </sentence><sentence id="938">I really don't read Yiddish, so I couldn't tell whose tombstones they were. </sentence><sentence id="939">Nobody from our family is buried there. </sentence><sentence id="940">Anyhow, when I came back and Victor made large size, you know he blew up the photo - we had them made into large photographs and I took them to the Starachowice reunion, at the annual . </sentence><sentence id="941">Well, I was practically attacked by some. </sentence><sentence id="942">They told me, "Renia, you should be ashamed of yourself. </sentence><sentence id="943">How you even think of having to, that we should restore something to give money to them. </sentence><sentence id="944">They never did anything for us. </sentence><sentence id="945">They would take the money, they wouldn't do it, anyhow." </sentence><sentence id="946">This is a project that started in 1980 and it was only realized ten years ago, because I finally realized there were people of good will who decided those who feel that way do not have to participate, and we did, and we did through the right channels and with the right money and everything is done. </sentence><sentence id="947">In fact, I just wrote an introduction to the book that's coming out about the cemetery, and I was very fortunate to have it registered with one of the people from my hometown who were dear friends of my family, Pola Frank (ph). </sentence><sentence id="948">She is no longer alive; she was my teacher in Poland. </sentence><sentence id="949">In then last minute, we registered the Jewish cemetery in New York with a Jewish organization - I don't know the name of it. </sentence><sentence id="950">The building is right across Temple Emanuelle on 5 Avenue, 65th Street. </sentence><sentence id="951">I think there was a Rabbi Chaiar (ph), or Chaiat (ph) somebody. </sentence><sentence id="952">And we came in, and said we don't have the funds yet, but we'd very much like to have this on - they were submitting a list to the Polish government of Jewish cemeteries - in  3 the nick of time, he said next week or next day, whatever, they were going to submit. </sentence><sentence id="953">We got the name in. </sentence><sentence id="954">So, immediately, within a year, there was a sign posted that this is a historic landmark not to be touched. </sentence><sentence id="955">But it took us a number, a good number of years to realize that we should not wait around or take the criticism of our hometown people for, to prevent us from doing the project. </sentence><sentence id="956">And between Israel and Canada and us, we had the money in no time. </sentence><sentence id="957">We send - it was done through Israel: the money was sent in, the architect was found, the caretakers were found. </sentence><sentence id="958">Apparently, that cemetery in Starachowice is now the model restored cemetery. </sentence><sentence id="959">But you see, this, I said that in reference to how other people felt. </sentence><sentence id="960">Not only did they feel terrific animosity to the Poles during all that went on, because, you know, a lot of people felt that the Poles did not do for Jews what they could have. </sentence><sentence id="961">But, you see, even after the war, for something as terribly important as a Jewish cemetery in a town that had all this population obliterated, there isn't a sign that there was Jewish community there except for the cemetery, and that was my project from the beginning, Pola Frank (ph) and I were saying: Here you have the pictures, here is what it looks like, the houses were being built on the cemetery, first the Germans took the tombstones to pave roads, then the Poles brought their homes closer and closer. </sentence><sentence id="962">Give it a few more years and you would have nothing, so that we were very lucky that, against all the criticism, we went ahead and because we worked in cooperation with Israel and Canada, we were really able to do it. </sentence><sentence id="963">And now I'm so pleased about that. </sentence><sentence id="964">This is really something, you know, second generation people go to visit, and other people from Israel, and I was told that even the people who do oversee now, you know, whoever oversees the Jewish cemeteries in Poland, says that ours is the nicest, the best kept and so forth. </sentence><sentence id="965">The stones are upright, the lettering was done, it's cleaned up, beautiful fence, iron fence with a beautiful gate with the magendavit (ph) on it, very nice, very nice. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="996">Q: All right, let's get back now. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="998">A: Yes. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1000">Q: The one question I wanted to ask before the tape is going to run out is what did, happened in your family when school was no longer possible for you. </sentence><sentence id="1001">I understand a little school was developed in your house? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1004">A: A little school developed, right! </sentence><sentence id="1005">And Hania, of course, was the main force behind it because she was the family genius - she had all the books. </sentence><sentence id="1006">In fact, when she was in high school in Radom, she used to do tutoring, anyhow, so this was like breathing air for her. </sentence><sentence id="1007">And she took three of my friends and myself and she formed a little class, and we followed the curriculum which she knew and for which the books were available in the house. </sentence><sentence id="1008">So, it was a regular school, with regular homework, and I resented the fact that she expected more of me than all the others, and I said, I mean, she lives with me in the house - you'd think she could be a little easier on me, but no. </sentence><sentence id="1009">But, of course, later on I realized that my really truly foundation for my further education came from that, because we really studied seven days a week. </sentence><sentence id="1010"> 4 </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1018">Q: Seven? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1020">A: Well, we did it at home. </sentence><sentence id="1021">You couldn't go swimming, the dogs were - the Germans were out with the dogs, people were being rounded up for slave labor, and kids were just either shot or kicked or the dogs was, you know, they were always threatened with dogs and the Nazis went around with the rubber whips, so even if you didn't get killed, you could be beaten up terribly, a dog could eat you up or whatever, so the only thing was to be home and that, that really was... </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1024">Q: So, how many hours a day was Hania teaching? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1026">A: I don't remember, but big section, a big segment of the day was for classroom, and then there was homework. </sentence><sentence id="1027">And then I - he reminds me, of a friend of mine, Mitye Weigensburg (ph), they were neighbors not far from us, and people wanted to read books. </sentence><sentence id="1028">There was no access to libraries, we are now talking about the secular Jews, you know. </sentence><sentence id="1029">So he and I opened a lending library. </sentence><sentence id="1030">He always reminds me about it - he lives in Connecticut we meet once a year at the . </sentence><sentence id="1031">We took books from every house, whoever wanted to, and we had a lending library, so today you had my books and I had yours, and we kept records. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1038">Q: So you're ten, eleven years old? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1040">A: Yes, yes, and you know, the strange thing about it is, I always say, I talk about it, nothing ever goes to waste, because, in later years when my kids were in public school in New York, I was the volunteer chairman of the library in the school for 11 years, I ran the volunteers who worked in the school library here, so, I always tell him, I say, "Guess what? </sentence><sentence id="1041">Whatever we did then applies now." </sentence><sentence id="1042">And that was true, so the schooling was done at home the homework was done at home and the rest was still around the books, we had the lending library. </sentence><sentence id="1043">People were delighted to get books because people couldn't go out, you know, and this is already in the ghetto, you know, because later on forget it, later on was different. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1048">Q: You had paper, enough paper in the house? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1050">A: Yes, because in the old days, you know how to recycle everything. </sentence><sentence id="1051">I mean, you never threw away a little piece of paper that wasn't filled in. </sentence><sentence id="1052">And we made little cards, so we wrote who - I can assure you it wasn't the Dewey decimal system - it was just a scribble here, a scribble there, Mrs. X got this book and Mrs. Z got the other book. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1060">Q: Renia, tell me something about what you think the effect of having a home schooling was on you? </sentence><sentence id="1061">I wondered whether you thought that in future years that it was very helpful to have all this - whatever it was you learned - in your head. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1064">A: Yes. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="1065"> [Tape interruption] </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1066">A: First of all, you know, as a child, you don't really plan a future and you don't look ahead to things that are included in the grown up world. </sentence><sentence id="1067">You live in your own little world, and one day's this and the next day's that, and past it, maybe two more days, and past it, there is no planning. </sentence><sentence id="1068">But absolute - my absolute thrill about being able to study was that I was back in school. </sentence><sentence id="1069">Not for future background or future foundations of how I was going to use it or not use it. </sentence><sentence id="1070">It was just the mere fact that my access to study was not severed as was my access to everything else, such as going swimming in the river or playing outdoors or whichever. </sentence><sentence id="1071">So, this was absolutely the only viewpoint that I had. </sentence><sentence id="1072">Never for a minute orienting myself to how that was going to come in handy. </sentence><sentence id="1073">Aside from which, you know, as I analyze now the system, the educational system in Poland as against the system in America, Polish education emphasized - it was sort of an elitist concept - but it emphasized education for its own sake. </sentence><sentence id="1074">You know? </sentence><sentence id="1075">You could end up being a carpenter, but you could at the same time be the highly educated person who read all the philosophers and knew the highest level of mathematics, and never apply it to what you were doing, but had the education. </sentence><sentence id="1076">And, I don't know, by osmosis, I guess, that rubbed off - that concept rubbed off on me. </sentence><sentence id="1077">So that studying, as I said before, because this was war, and I was back in school, and just one day to the next being occupied by books was great. </sentence><sentence id="1078">But by the same token, I always breathed that air that said, you know, you study because it's such fun; because you're going to be a mathematician or you're going to be a professor or whatever. </sentence><sentence id="1079">You studied because that was really part of the great, great joy of life. </sentence><sentence id="1080">And so, assuming that I, in my child's way, incorporated those two aspects, it was study for its own sake. </sentence><sentence id="1081">Plus, it kept me out of the street where the Germans were with the dogs. </sentence><sentence id="1082">And it kept me very occupied. </sentence><sentence id="1083">Plus, it also kept me in a competitive setting. </sentence><sentence id="1084">It wasn't monotonous to the extent that you were doing everything for yourself, by yourself, without measuring yourself against some other people. </sentence><sentence id="1085">And these were my very dear friends, so that the entire idea really revolved around being occupied - gainfully occupied, not just killing time or wasting time. </sentence><sentence id="1086">And whoever even thought - I certainly didn't know - planning for the future. </sentence><sentence id="1087">I could never, ever visualize, even when I was older during the war and the war was coming to an end, I couldn't even visualize the end of the war or what I would be doing. </sentence><sentence id="1088">There wasn't such thing in my mind ever of a pre- set plan, you know, of applying this to that and doing this and that. </sentence><sentence id="1089">Everything that came after really evolved out of my basic studies with Hania, there's no question about it. </sentence><sentence id="1090">It's just that I brought to it a certain attitude already, which of course lasted me for the lifetime, that school is joy and I loved it and it was good. </sentence><sentence id="1091">But I didn't know how it was  6 going to fit in the future - who knew that I would even survive, and who even knew how the world would end, how it would look, and how... No, this is totally outside the realm of my imagination. </sentence><sentence id="1092">Really, to put it totally in the perspective, that's exactly how it goes. </sentence><sentence id="1093">It didn't... The idea of a future occupation or a future plan that would evolve out of the study with Hania never entered my mind, really! </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1122">Q: How many hours a day did Hania teach you? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1124">A: You know, that I couldn't tell you, but I know it was a, it was a big chunk of the day, big. </sentence><sentence id="1125">Plus the fact that I did homework, and lots of it. </sentence><sentence id="1126">Lots and lots of it, so that I was really occupied all day. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1130">Q: Did she give you good grades? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1132">A: She did, but she always reprimanded me "cause she said I could do better than that. </sentence><sentence id="1133">So, she did reprimand me, even in front of the other kids. </sentence><sentence id="1134">I didn't appreciate that, but I loved her anyhow. </sentence><sentence id="1135">But of course my parents were absolutely thrilled because there was nothing for a child to do, and being outdoors was very dangerous, so that, that really filled all the needs. </sentence><sentence id="1136">My parents were satisfied, I was happy, Hania was happy, so all around, it really was good. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1142">Q: So, did you not go outside at all? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1144">A: Practically not. </sentence><sentence id="1145">Because, even if you did go to play, like kids play ball or something, and somebody would say, "Oh, they're out again with the dogs," you would immediately go in. </sentence><sentence id="1146">Because, you know, people were being - grown-ups were being rounded up for all kinds of things: for deportations, for killings, for cleaning, for whatever. </sentence><sentence id="1147">But children were just as big a temptation for a Nazi with a dog as a grown-up was, just for the sake of, you know, scaring a Jew kid. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1152">Q: Just to get everything clear, you were 10 years old when... </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1154">A: ...when the war broke out, right. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1156">Q: Hania was 15 when she was starting to teach you, right? </sentence><sentence id="1157">And Chris is 13. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1160">A: Right. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1162">Q: Right? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1164">A: And Chris was also in a class, in Hania's class. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1166">Q: Really? </sentence><sentence id="1167"> 7 </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1170">A: Yeah, but not in my class. </sentence><sentence id="1171">Hers wasn't a real class; hers was more... You see, this was the whole idea of keeping yourself occupied with books. </sentence><sentence id="1172">At my level, it was a class. </sentence><sentence id="1173">I don't know that Chris had homework or anything. </sentence><sentence id="1174">But it was more like maybe discussions or reading together, you know, like people could get together to read and share books. </sentence><sentence id="1175">But that was a very wonderful - this wasn't an idea that came from outside; it came from the house. </sentence><sentence id="1176">But that really kept us out of harm's way. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1184">Q: It put you in a different world. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1186">A: Oh, yeah, absolutely. </sentence><sentence id="1187">So, to sit out the war - nobody knew anything about anything that was going to happen or wouldn't happen, but you know, you have to sit out the war and however best you can, and this was a fine way. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1190">Q: So, the thoughts that you had are that this is war, nothing else terribly bad, it would be deprivation... </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1192">A: Yeah, it's not the first war that the parents were talking about, and people who were still around that have lived through the first war. </sentence><sentence id="1193">You know, the deprivation, and then the soldiers are fighting, you see. </sentence><sentence id="1194">And if you're not on the front, and you're not caught where the soldiers are fighting, then the war will blow over and everything will be fine again. </sentence><sentence id="1195">Because it's the soldiers who fight; civilians don't fight. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1200">Q: So, how do you remember what happened to your father? </sentence><sentence id="1201">Do you remember what you saw when you were 10, 11, 12, during those...? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1204">A: Well, ll tell you what I remember. </sentence><sentence id="1205">As I told you, the memory being so selective, that I remember all these nonsense things - not nonsense, but the little things that really stuck in my mind, when the biggest things escape my memory. </sentence><sentence id="1206">But I do remember how my mother was upset when Father was rounded up for cleaning detail. </sentence><sentence id="1207">You know, because this was below his station. </sentence><sentence id="1208">I think I said that in the interview, because that also stuck in my mind. </sentence><sentence id="1209">Mother always talked about it. </sentence><sentence id="1210">Father was rounded up in the street and nobody knew where he was. </sentence><sentence id="1211">And Mother went, and she said, oh, you know - she was told that the people who were rounded up are cleaning out - cleaning - are sweeping the railroad station. </sentence><sentence id="1212">So, she went to the railroad station. </sentence><sentence id="1213">She was looking, couldn't find him, and there was this German - German soldier, but she didn't see the men, the Jews there. </sentence><sentence id="1214">So, she went over to him and asked him, "Excuse me, where are the herren?" - </sentence><sentence id="1215">Where are the gentlemen? </sentence><sentence id="1216">And he said, "These aren't gentlemen; these are Jews!" </sentence><sentence id="1217">And how Mother was upset about that, and of course, Father was terribly humiliated. </sentence><sentence id="1218">Because this was early on - this was still in deg39 - and this was such a humiliating experience for a man, like this, and for Mother, too. </sentence><sentence id="1219">So, Mother always talked about it. </sentence><sentence id="1220">Of course, we realized later on that this didn't really mean all that much, because what came later is a totally different category. </sentence><sentence id="1221">But in those days - this was right after the Germans conquered Poland - so, that much I remember that Mother was very upset about it. </sentence><sentence id="1222">You know, those are small things,  8 big things, but they are a very big part of the bigger picture of genocide, because those were the initial steps, as you would now know, but certainly we didn't know then. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1242">Q: Do you have any recollection of the time your father came home having somewhat been beaten up by a Nazi? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1244">A: Very vague, very vague. </sentence><sentence id="1245">That, I know it happened, but the recollection is very vague. </sentence><sentence id="1246">Maybe I just eliminated it from my psyche somehow. </sentence><sentence id="1247">No, that I don't really... I just remember one man, Roman Zinger, was brought around. </sentence><sentence id="1248">He was hit and his jaw was dislocated. </sentence><sentence id="1249">And he was taken around by the Germans to show what you're going to look like if you do not obey. </sentence><sentence id="1250">I remember that, but I don't remember about my father. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1258">Q: How long were you able to stay in the apartment you had been living in when you came back after the evacuation? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1260">A: Well, probably "til early 1940, because we lived on the main street, which connected the old Wierzbnik and Starachowice. </sentence><sentence id="1261">That was called the main street, and that was called Piusutskego (ph). </sentence><sentence id="1262">First it was called Starachowice, then it was called Piusutskego (ph).That was the first street evacuated, because that was the so-called best street. </sentence><sentence id="1263">After - and we were just pushed further into Wierzbnik. </sentence><sentence id="1264">You see, we were on the connecting street between the two towns. </sentence><sentence id="1265">We were pushed further into Wierzbnik, but that was only the first location. </sentence><sentence id="1266">We had three more places that we lived in before the towns were liquidated. </sentence><sentence id="1267">I don't know how much of the Starachowice story was told in terms of the historical events. </sentence><sentence id="1268">You see, there was no so-called closed ghetto, as we know a ghetto to be, like a large ghetto, like the Warsaw ghetto. </sentence><sentence id="1269">Our ghetto was a gradual - As other parts were being cleared of the Jews in my hometown, they were being sent further into Wierzbnik. </sentence><sentence id="1270">As little villages were being evacuated around the town, all these people were being sent further into Wierzbnik. </sentence><sentence id="1271">But the Christians who lived there were not dislocated, you see, so that at no point was there such a thing as a barbed wire or anything like that, you see? </sentence><sentence id="1272">Those Christians who still lived there lived there, and the Jews were just packed in and packed in and packed in. </sentence><sentence id="1273">And then of course our street that we were sent to, that was cleared, so we had to go further in, and we ended up next to the Christian cemetery called the Old Cemetery - there are two, the New Cemetery and the Old Cemetery. </sentence><sentence id="1274">We, our last residence was past the Old Cemetery - that was the location - and we lived in a Christian's home. </sentence><sentence id="1275">He was a teamster; he had a horse and wagon. </sentence><sentence id="1276">They occupied half, and we had a kitchen and a din- and a living- one room and a kitchen. </sentence><sentence id="1277">Half of his house. </sentence><sentence id="1278">And until the time until we were actually liqu- that the town was liquidated, that's where we lived. </sentence><sentence id="1279">That's where went for the Final Solution, my parents and I, not Hania and Chris. </sentence><sentence id="1280">And they lived next door; the Christians lived next door. </sentence><sentence id="1281">So this is, this happened between 1940, early 1940, when Piusutskego (ph) Street was cleared, up to October 27, 1942. </sentence><sentence id="1282">That was life in the ghetto. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1307">Q: Until deg42. </sentence><sentence id="1308"> 9 </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1311">A: deg42, yes. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1313">Q: When you moved each of these three times, is it your parents who found the place? </sentence><sentence id="1314">Or you just run out? </sentence><sentence id="1315">Do you have any idea? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1319">A: No. </sentence><sentence id="1320">I have no idea. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1323">Q: You have no idea? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1325">A: I imagine there was a relocation office or something. </sentence><sentence id="1326">I really don't know. </sentence><sentence id="1327">I couldn't tell you. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1331">Q: What do you recall about what your father was doing? </sentence><sentence id="1332">Obviously, he's no longer for a long time doing...? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1335">A: He was a scribe. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1337">Q: What does that mean? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1339">A: He was a secretary. </sentence><sentence id="1340">He used to type. </sentence><sentence id="1341">I really don't know, but I know that he was not what you call a functionary of any significance. </sentence><sentence id="1342">You know, he had, he had, he's not part of any Judenrat. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1347">Q: So, there was a Judenrat? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1349">A: I think so. </sentence><sentence id="1350">I'm not sure. </sentence><sentence id="1351">But I know Father was always, because he was so neat and organized, and he typed, and so he was always that guy who did the secretarial work through the camp, you know, through the ghetto and the camp. </sentence><sentence id="1352">But I truly don't know. </sentence><sentence id="1353">I think there was a Judenrat in town... </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1359">Q: But you're not sure. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1361">A: Not sure, and I really wouldn't know who was in it. </sentence><sentence id="1362">Even though I did read in the Starachowice, the book, the names, but I really wouldn't know for sure. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1365">Q: During this period, prior to the ghetto really being formed, even though it isn't a closed ghetto, do you experience a lot of fear, knowing that you have to be in the house, even in spite of the fact that you love schooling so much. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1367">A: Oh, yes, but then I first started to realize what this was all about. </sentence><sentence id="1368">I mean, we didn't know what this was leading up to, and we certainly didn't - J certainly didn't know what was happening elsewhere, that I didn't know. </sentence><sentence id="1369">But I did know that, by virtue of being near the plant, the war production plant, that people were being sent in for their labor. </sentence><sentence id="1370">You see, I didn't realize that basically it was the other way around. </sentence><sentence id="1371">People were being cleared out of  0 other places to be sent here, not because they were needed. </sentence><sentence id="1372">In other words, the Germans didn't go outside of the ghetto to find these people. </sentence><sentence id="1373">It's just that all these other communities were being cleared, and Starachowice was the logical place to shove them into, even though it would be bursting at the seams, for the reason this was access to slave labor. </sentence><sentence id="1374">Of course, I know this all in hindsight, but in those days, it just seemed that perhaps they were trying to have more labor, a bigger labor force, so they were just going out and sending these people in. </sentence><sentence id="1375">But of course, it was the other way around. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1385">Q: Is your, is your mother working also? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1387">A: I think so. </sentence><sentence id="1388">Yes, I think so. </sentence><sentence id="1389">But I don't remember where, but I think she was working. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1393">Q: So, you're in the house with your... </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1395">A: No. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1397">Q: Both sisters? </sentence><sentence id="1398">Chris was... </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1401">A: Chris and Hania were working in the brick factory. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1403">Q: Right from the beginning? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1405">A: I don't remember. </sentence><sentence id="1406">I just remember at the end, that's where they were. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1409">Q: Yes. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1411">A: I was given a job very shortly, very - probably, at the, the same month probably that they cleared the town of Jews, I was given a job in the factory, in the plant, just putting the...You know, these were cannon shells; they weren't too big. </sentence><sentence id="1412">You were supposed to put it on, on the machine, and the lathe would, you know, like you carve an apple, would take off the first peel and then you took it off. </sentence><sentence id="1413">It was piecework. </sentence><sentence id="1414">And they were around to watch you and count. </sentence><sentence id="1415">You put it down; you put another one. </sentence><sentence id="1416">Anybody could do it; you didn't need the Herculean strength to do that. </sentence><sentence id="1417">And then, of course, after the town was cleared of Jews, and of course, that's going further into the camps, I started working in the laundry. </sentence><sentence id="1418">So, after that, I never worked in the factory, only in the laundry. </sentence><sentence id="1419">Whereas Hania and Chris were detained overnight in the brick factory, so that the morning that the town was cleared of Jews, they did not report to the square, the market square. </sentence><sentence id="1420">But I did, with my parents. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1432">Q: I want to get to that, but I just want to ask you a question about your little school friends, that you went to school with. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1434">A: Yes. </sentence><sentence id="1435"> 1 </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1438">Q: Were these close friends of yours? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1440">A: Yes, I'm Jewish, obviously, yes, and from the same, from the same type of family. </sentence><sentence id="1441">You see? </sentence><sentence id="1442">Again, as I was trying to explain, I did not mean to divide it into superior or inferior or anything. </sentence><sentence id="1443">The secular type of Jews who lived in town, and these were my friends. </sentence><sentence id="1444">They were absolutely my friends. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1450">Q: And did they live very nearby? </sentence><sentence id="1451">Because given what you said, it was dangerous for kids... </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1454">A: Yes, well, they lived very nearby, yes, they did. </sentence><sentence id="1455">They lived on Piusutskego (ph) also, so it was very, I mean, access was easy. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1458">Q: Did you talk privately with them about what was going on? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1460">A: Frankly, I probably did, because I was always very curious about everything, you know, but maybe I just... I absolutely don't remember. </sentence><sentence id="1461">But, I'Il tell you frankly, when there was talk about war, before the war broke out, and my parents said, "Oh, it's going to be a horrible thing if there is a war because the first war was so bad."" </sentence><sentence id="1462">You know, they used to tell us about the first war. </sentence><sentence id="1463">And quietly I was thinking to myself, "Why would a war be so bad? </sentence><sentence id="1464">You know? </sentence><sentence id="1465">You could learn all these new things and you could find out and it's different..." So, quietly thought, well, I think the war would be good, because from my viewpoint, why not? </sentence><sentence id="1466">I mean, all these exciting things that my parents were talking about, you see? </sentence><sentence id="1467">So, then, when the war came, and I am quite sure that we talked - the kids, among ourselves - talked about the same thing, up to a point. </sentence><sentence id="1468">Because finally, when we realized what was really going on, then I am sure that we changed around. </sentence><sentence id="1469">Because once we started fearing for our own lives, it was no more that idealized version of new things happening. </sentence><sentence id="1470">And that I remember distinctly, that I always used to say, "Gee, I really would like a war, because I would know what - you know, new things that are happening, you know, how they do it. </sentence><sentence id="1471">Because war means soldiers fighting; it doesn't apply otherwise." </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1484">Q: So, it was a sort of entertainment that your parents gave you with these stories... </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1486">A: Not an entertainment. </sentence><sentence id="1487">It was something, it was an experience that I would really, yes, I would very be glad to be part of, but... uh... it didn't turn out that way. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1490">Q: Chris told a story of about a bunch of young people - I have no idea if you were there - outside when somebody - now, I don't know exactly where this is because I don't know exactly where she was describing - they were outside, it seemed to be the summer, and some young man came out from the bushes looking awful and talking about Treblinka. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="1492">And Chris and Hania brought him into the house. </sentence><sentence id="1493">Were you there? </sentence><sentence id="1494">A I'm sure I was there, but I don't remember that. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1502">A: You see, how big was the house? </sentence><sentence id="1503">By now, we must have lived in one room. </sentence><sentence id="1504">I couldn't absent myself. </sentence><sentence id="1505">The fact is my parents never told me directly anything. </sentence><sentence id="1506">Whatever I did know, I probably guessed, and then I probably rationalized quickly, that this was, because you know, they were saying rumors, all kinds of gossip. </sentence><sentence id="1507">And rumors, gossip, I'm sure they were saying rumors and gossip just to protect us. </sentence><sentence id="1508">You know, but I truly don't know. </sentence><sentence id="1509">I've said it so many times. </sentence><sentence id="1510">I don't know what they knew, and what they didn't know, and how much they withheld from me personally, not from Hania and Krysia. </sentence><sentence id="1511">You see that I really don't know. </sentence><sentence id="1512">Chris was really sort of a more mature person. </sentence><sentence id="1513">Chris was always a hands-on and practical type, so I think she could have known much more than I did, but I did not know. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1526">Q: Actually, she said that she didn't believe this guy. </sentence><sentence id="1527">And brought him in to the house, and your parents asked her to leave. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1530">A: Yes. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1532">Q: So, she didn't hear... </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1534">A: You see, so she also didn't hear. </sentence><sentence id="1535">And if she didn't hear and was asked to go out, I certainly would never had been told about it. </sentence><sentence id="1536">That's absolutely a fact. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1540">Q: Now, during these two years prior to the - because I want to get to the evacuation - during these two years, are things getting worse in terms of food, in terms of...? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1542">A: Yes, this was the time when the screw was being tightened, you see. </sentence><sentence id="1543">There was scarce food; you had to really fight for it. </sentence><sentence id="1544">You had to keep - you could still barter; you still had access to the Polish population, you see, so you could barter and you could buy and you could try the hardest you could, but subsistence was meager, very meager. </sentence><sentence id="1545">And then - I don't know if Chris told you about it - but one Sunday, when people are leaving church - you know, the church was up on Church Street. </sentence><sentence id="1546">Cruzcherna (ph) was up on the hill, and the market square, where we were eventually, from which we were sent to the selection. </sentence><sentence id="1547">The market square was - coming down from Cruzcherna (ph), from the church, was the market square. </sentence><sentence id="1548">Something happened - Poles killed a German or something - and I remember distinctly, they built a gallows in the market square and they hung 12 Poles on a Sunday, when people were coming down from the church, from Cruzcherna (ph) Street, from Church Street, down to the square. </sentence><sentence id="1549">In other words, I suspect that whatever exchange there was between the Jews and the Poles, surreptitious as it was and quiet as it was, could have diminished to a great extent, because that was a warning to others, too. </sentence><sentence id="1550">Of course, I found out what happened years later that they lured a German or two Germans to a prostitute and they got there and they killed them. </sentence><sentence id="1551">And so for that, 12 Poles were hung on a Sunday after church. </sentence><sentence id="1552">So, I imagine - I don't know what year this was, but we were still living in the so-called ghetto. </sentence><sentence id="1553">And, of course, whether this is a direct result - whether the starvation that was setting in was a direct result of this warning that they give  3 to the Christians, they gave to the Christians, I don't know. </sentence><sentence id="1554">But, of course, food was scarce and, and things were very bad. </sentence><sentence id="1555">The only thing was that Mother was very inventive; she once an excellent cook, so she made things out of nothing. </sentence><sentence id="1556">The first time in my life I ate cookies that was baked with sugar beets, made with sugar beets - it's because there was no sugar, of course. </sentence><sentence id="1557">So, that's, that's the screw was being tightened, but it wasn't yet completely tight. </sentence><sentence id="1558">You see, there was still the possibility of surviving, if the sickness didn't kill you, if they didn't shoot you, if the dogs didn't tear you to shreds. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1576">Q: One very brief question before we take a break, because the tape is going to run out: Do you remember when you had to put an armband? </sentence><sentence id="1577">I understand you wore an armband? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1580">A: Yes, absolutely, a white armband with a blue - a blue Star of David on it. </sentence><sentence id="1581">Probably right away, probably when we still lived on Piusutskego (ph), I suspect, including children. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1584">Q: Until the end? </sentence><sentence id="1585">Until the evacuation? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1588">A: Oh, yes, absolutely. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1590">Q: Right. </sentence><sentence id="1591">All right, let's take a break and change the tape. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1596">Q: Renia, I want to ask you to describe one of the most difficult days, probably, of your entire life, the evacuation, October 27", 1942. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1598">A: Yes, yes. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1600">Q: Can you lead us through the day? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1602">A: Yes. </sentence><sentence id="1603">First, I have to say that Chris and Hania - Ana - were employed in the brick factory. </sentence><sentence id="1604">Because, as you well know by now, there was the munitions factory, munitions plant, there was the brick factory and there was the sawmill, and I think there was one more. </sentence><sentence id="1605">I don't remember. </sentence><sentence id="1606">All these employed slave labor. </sentence><sentence id="1607">And the word got around - first of all, able-bodied people were taken anyhow - but word got around that if you work, you have a chance to have a better life. </sentence><sentence id="1608">Not survived - we didn't talk about survival and all that. </sentence><sentence id="1609">It's just that you could live a little better if you had a job. </sentence><sentence id="1610">So, anybody who was anybody secured a job. </sentence><sentence id="1611">Now, Hania and Chris worked in the brick factory, and they had the night shift. </sentence><sentence id="1612">October 26" to 27" is when they were inside the factory, in the brick factory. </sentence><sentence id="1613">October 27" in the morning - I think 6:00 in the morning - is when the round up started for the evacuation of the Jews from the hometown. </sentence><sentence id="1614">Now, Hania and Krysia were never released from the factory, and I really don't know about people who worked in the munitions plant, but I imagine they were also kept back, because they were already a work force that could be counted on. </sentence><sentence id="1615">Well, I was at home at the last of our residences in the ghetto, sharing the house with this Christian family, and that was past the Old Cemetery, the old - old Christian cemetery. </sentence><sentence id="1616">We were made to walk. </sentence><sentence id="1617">First of all, the knock came on the door, and "Everybody out, everybody out." </sentence><sentence id="1618">We got dressed - I know, again, several layers of clothing - and we were driven toward the market square. </sentence><sentence id="1619">So, as we passed the old cemetery, we started coming nearer to the market square, and that's where a lot of Jewish people lived before the war anyhow, but now, of course, it was packed, because other streets have been cleaned - not cleaned, but cleared of the Jewish people. </sentence><sentence id="1620">And as people would walk out of the buildings, if they didn't walk straight, if their child was crying, the Germans were in a total frenzy, and there were Latvians who were assisting. </sentence><sentence id="1621">They were shooting at anybody who didn't rush, who didn't go as fast as he was told, who didn't walk straight, had one more bundle than, than it was absolutely allowed. </sentence><sentence id="1622">So that, between the old cemetery and the square, which was probably no more than half a mile, there was such atrocities that I rather thought the world was ending. </sentence><sentence id="1623">Because, I mean, I'd seen a lot of things up to that point, you know, but I had never seen people falling and children, infants smashed against the walls, and you know, horror upon horror, and this was only a half a mile walk. </sentence><sentence id="1624">Now, my parents held me by my hand on each side, and as I said, I was overdressed because Mother insisted. </sentence><sentence id="1625">I also was a very skinny child, and she wanted to make me look more mature. </sentence><sentence id="1626">Of course, I wasn't developed, I was just a mere child, so she shoved some stuff into me to make me look mature and developed and she put rouge on my cheeks. </sentence><sentence id="1627">And we walked to the market square, and as we were coming closer, there was a building where Mother's very dear  5 friends lived, and there was a family Kalinyerska (ph). </sentence><sentence id="1628">Mrs. Kalinyerska (ph) was an elderly woman, maybe in her seventies - I mean, for a child, age at that time... I don't know, but I know old Mrs. Kalinyerska (ph), that's how I know her. </sentence><sentence id="1629">Her daughter went to Palestine through the efforts my mother's Zionist ha-sharat (ph). </sentence><sentence id="1630">So, she was there. </sentence><sentence id="1631">And as we were passing very near the square, Mother - she couldn't walk - Mother took her under the arm and walked with her to the square, and I followed with my father. </sentence><sentence id="1632">And when we came to the square, the scene was indescribable, because they had the Latvians and they had the Germans and they had dogs. </sentence><sentence id="1633">And people were being whipped with rubber whips, and people were shot with rifles and with guns and with whatever. </sentence><sentence id="1634">And people were screaming and everybody - they were shouting and - whatever. </sentence><sentence id="1635">We came on a scene which was very hard to understand, because the Germans, who were standing at each corner of the square, directed the people coming out of these adjacent streets: "To the right here, you go this way, you go this way." </sentence><sentence id="1636">You had no idea which way you were going. </sentence><sentence id="1637">All I knew in the final analysis was that Father was sent one way, which I understood because the men were separated, I was sent another way, and Mother and Mrs. Kalinyerska (ph) were sent another way. </sentence><sentence id="1638">So, I still couldn't make out what is happening here, and who is going where and why. </sentence><sentence id="1639">Very soon, my group was whipped into formation, and I mean whipped in to formation, I think five rows and five across, and we were driven toward Starachowice, meaning by Piusutskego (ph) and that way. </sentence><sentence id="1640">And we had to march in formation, as if to - as if to a beat, and whoever couldn't make it, whoever stumbled, was immediately shot on the spot. </sentence><sentence id="1641">Now, I at this point had no - First of all, I didn't know where Hania and Krysia were. </sentence><sentence id="1642">I knew they never came home from the factory. </sentence><sentence id="1643">So, I could just imagine that they could have been sent in another group like this - whatever - or maybe they were somewhere dead and I didn't see them. </sentence><sentence id="1644">I didn't know. </sentence><sentence id="1645">And as I got into the group driven that way toward Starachowice plant, I found myself eventually in Strzelnica - of course, I didn't know what Strzelnica was about - but this is where I ended up, in Strzelnica in an open area, and we were told to sit down and stay there. </sentence><sentence id="1646">I was beside myself with fear. </sentence><sentence id="1647">I was horror-stricken and totally lost. </sentence><sentence id="1648">I think of all my traumatic experiences in the world, that is absolutely the most traumatic. </sentence><sentence id="1649">Because you know, at all other times, I had somebody to lean on - Chris and Hania or my parents - this, I was totally alone, and I really didn't know, you see. </sentence><sentence id="1650">I didn't know that Chris and Hania were still around. </sentence><sentence id="1651">I was petrified. </sentence><sentence id="1652">I cried, and I was... So, people who knew the family, they said, "Oh, don't cry. </sentence><sentence id="1653">Mother will come, and this will sort itself out. </sentence><sentence id="1654">This is whatever it is. </sentence><sentence id="1655">They..." Whatever. </sentence><sentence id="1656">Eventually, I found out that Father was in the same camp, in other words, he was with the men and I was put with the women. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1712">Q: So, you marched off with women. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1714">A: With women, to Strzelnica, and Father marched off to Strzelnica with the men. </sentence><sentence id="1715">Subsequently we found out that people like my mother and Mrs. Kalinyerska (ph) were put on a train. </sentence><sentence id="1716">Nobody was saying where, but of course, that train went to Treblinka. </sentence><sentence id="1717">Hania and Krysia, on the other hand, after all this was over, they were sent to place called Majowka, which was another camp in town. </sentence><sentence id="1718">So that somehow, because then they started - people were beginning to be shifted, because I forgot how it was - I think Majowka  6 people used to work in the sawmill, or something, or the brick factory - I really don't know how it was all decided who worked where - but I do know that word came back to us that Hania and Krysia survived - no, the word was not "survived" - that they were not shipped out. </sentence><sentence id="1719">That they did not - that they were not shipped out, that they are still around, and that they are in Majowka. </sentence><sentence id="1720">So, of course, now I'd met my father - not that I stayed with him, because men were separated from women. </sentence><sentence id="1721">And Father again went into the office to do book work for the . </sentence><sentence id="1722">And Hania reminded me that what happened later was that Father was sent to Majowka, or however it was, or Krysia was sent... How was it now? </sentence><sentence id="1723">I forget how it was, but anyhow, two of us were in Strzelnica, Father and I.Hania and Krysia were in Majowka. </sentence><sentence id="1724">Later on, the camps were combined. </sentence><sentence id="1725">And, of course, later on the camps were shifted again. </sentence><sentence id="1726">But at this point, I was with my father, and that, of course, was a great consolation, even if I didn't stay with him, because he was with the men's group. </sentence><sentence id="1727">I stayed with women who knew me, who knew the family, and looked after me up to such time as Krysia and Hania joined me. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1743">Q: Can we just go back? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1745">A: Sure. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1747">Q: I'm trying to visualize the picture you've created. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1749">A: Yes. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1751">Q: You're a child of... 1942... You're thirteen... </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1753">A: Thirteen, yes. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1755">Q: .. .thirteen years old, and you're seeing a level of violence - you've seen some violence - but you're seeing a level of violence that... </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1757">A: Never ever. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1759">Q: ...exceeds anybody's imagination. </sentence><sentence id="1760">Do you scream when you see things? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1763">A: No, no. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1765">Q: You're very quiet with your parents. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1767">A: Iam scared. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1769">Q: You're so scared... Right. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1771">A: Iam scared out of my wits. </sentence><sentence id="1772">I really, I couldn't scream. </sentence><sentence id="1773">In fact, when we finally got to Strzelnica, and I didn't know yet Father was around, I couldn't yet cry - but I cried later -  7 but I couldn't yet cry because I was overwhelmed with fear. </sentence><sentence id="1774">The terror of it all and the fear, it's sort of, you know, like you become breathless. </sentence><sentence id="1775">I was frozen in the fear of it all. </sentence><sentence id="1776">And I must say, this was the first time - the march to the square and then the march to Strzelnica - were my real first encounter with horror which I could not avoid. </sentence><sentence id="1777">You know, like when we were coming back from the woods, when the war broke out, I saw dead horses on the road. </sentence><sentence id="1778">I didn't see ever dead horses before, so I covered my eyes. </sentence><sentence id="1779">I sort of covered my eyes, and I didn't see the - I saw the dead horses were coming up, and there was a dead horse, so I covered my eyes. </sentence><sentence id="1780">But later on, there was no way of covering your eyes, because the horror was such, and you had to watch yourself, and you had to stay in line and you had to march as fast as you were told to. </sentence><sentence id="1781">So that the overwhelming fear was sort of like paralysis, you know, paralysis of your brain. </sentence><sentence id="1782">You don't think. </sentence><sentence id="1783">You make the motion, your body propels you, but it's not the brain; it's the fear that propels you, I guess. </sentence><sentence id="1784">And later on, until I wound down enough to cry - it took awhile because I was out of my mind with fear because, for the first time in my entire life, I was alone, left in these circumstances, where all these years I was so protected. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1799">Q: This is going to be a strange question, but... </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1801">A: Yes. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1803">Q: Do you think you were afraid because you were alone or because you were vulnerable, because you saw how vulnerable, or was the two of them...? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1805">A: No, I was afraid because I was alone. </sentence><sentence id="1806">Because, first of all, because of what I saw, you know? </sentence><sentence id="1807">This was a shock to my system. </sentence><sentence id="1808">Even if I were too much (ph) with parents and my sisters, I would still be shocked out of my wits to see the horror that I encountered between leaving the house and the selection in the square and the Strzelnica camp. </sentence><sentence id="1809">I couldn't cover my eyes and I couldn't make believe it didn't exist because I had to have my wits around me to pay attention to everything because, if somebody fell under my feet, I couldn't stumble. </sentence><sentence id="1810">So, the entire picture revolved around saving your life however you can, so you cannot disregard what's happening around you. </sentence><sentence id="1811">So, that's 1942, and this is the rude awakening that is the point at which I was facing up to what is really happening, even though I wasn't yet told anything. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1819">Q: So, when you... Is the first person in your family that you saw your father? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1821">A: My father. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1823">Q: And did you talk? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1825">A: Well, maybe not. </sentence><sentence id="1826">No, maybe waving or something. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1829">Q: I see. </sentence><sentence id="1830"> 8 </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1833">A: There was not yet, you know... We were segregated; he was in one group, but the fact is that he saw me and I saw him and we waved. </sentence><sentence id="1834">And then other people got in touch with other men, so everybody said, "Oh, Renia, your father said that he's here and he'll look after..." And you know, so people would send messages that way. </sentence><sentence id="1835">So, that was the only thing. </sentence><sentence id="1836">But of course he did not know what happened to my mother. </sentence><sentence id="1837">But of course maybe he knew and didn't tell me. </sentence><sentence id="1838">Because my mother was supporting an elderly woman. </sentence><sentence id="1839">So if you really had any, any understanding of the situation, you knew that Mrs. Kalinyerska (ph) was not one to be going to slave labor because she was old. </sentence><sentence id="1840">And my mother, supporting her, had to go with her. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1849">Q: So, one would assume if that young man who came out of the bushes - the story that Chris told - and if your parents really believed him as to what was happening in Treblinka, your father probably figured out where your mother probably went. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1851">A: I can tell you, my understanding of everything is that they knew much more than they ever let on, because they were intelligent people, aside from which, you know, my father was fluent in German. </sentence><sentence id="1852">In fact, he spoke and wrote and read German. </sentence><sentence id="1853">He used to subscribe to German periodicals and such. </sentence><sentence id="1854">I doubt very much that my father didn't know. </sentence><sentence id="1855">I mean, that is impossible. </sentence><sentence id="1856">But the fact that he didn't tell me, that is an absolute fact. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1863">Q: So, did you keep in your head that at some point you would see your mother again? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1865">A: Yes. </sentence><sentence id="1866">Absolutely. </sentence><sentence id="1867">I kept it in my head that - because, you see, the word "resettlement" was being bandied about. </sentence><sentence id="1868">What that word meant didn't quite - was never clarified, but they said "The resettlement to the east, the resettlement..." The word "resettlement". </sentence><sentence id="1869">So, you know, you can always rationalize it. </sentence><sentence id="1870">If you have already met the quota for slave labor for the Starachowice plant and the other factories nearby, then you resettle... I mean, on the child's level, you can more or less follow their train of thought. </sentence><sentence id="1871">The others were resettled to places which was needed other people, so that was resettlement. </sentence><sentence id="1872">And by the same token, I couldn't imagine that I wouldn't see my mother again, so that was another thing. </sentence><sentence id="1873">Hiding from the real possibility of what happened. </sentence><sentence id="1874">I felt that way right along, you know?I knew I didn't know. </sentence><sentence id="1875">I knew what I didn't know. </sentence><sentence id="1876">I really realized, but I didn't want to know. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1890">Q: So, how long did it take before you met up with your sisters, do you think, about? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1892">A: I don't really know, but my next recollection of the camp was - yeah, I worked in the laundry, you know, I was assigned to the laundry. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1894">Q: That was right away? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1896">A: In Strzelnica, right away. </sentence><sentence id="1897">So that I did not go to the factory anymore. </sentence><sentence id="1898">I worked in the factory maybe a month at the most. </sentence><sentence id="1899">I worked in the fa-... And my next recollection of the place was that Hania became very - Hania must have already been in, because she had an  9 extreme case of typhus. </sentence><sentence id="1900">And I remember that, because selections were being made. </sentence><sentence id="1901">We had to line up, and they told you to run, and whoever could not run fast enough was taken out and shot. </sentence><sentence id="1902">People were taken - ten or twelve men were told to dig a grave - and then people were taken over to the pit and shot. </sentence><sentence id="1903">So, I do remember that Hania had such an extremely severe case of typhus, she was hallucinating and talking out of her head. </sentence><sentence id="1904">I also had typhus but a mild form, so that, that was the one thing I remember so distinctly. </sentence><sentence id="1905">And I met here in Florida, I met a friend of mine who worked with me in the laundry three years ago, and she said to me, "You know, Renia, you saved my mother's life." </sentence><sentence id="1906">And I said, "I saved your mother's life? </sentence><sentence id="1907">I never heard of anything like that." </sentence><sentence id="1908">And she says, "Well, what happened is when we worked in the laundry..." She and her mother worked in the laundry with me, and her mother had a severe case of typhus. </sentence><sentence id="1909">And they called us out and told us to line up, and she says that I stood - she put the mother between me and her - her mother was a tiny little woman; we were both taller than the mother and we held on to her and they passed by and didn't notice and she survived. </sentence><sentence id="1910">Whereas I know for a fact that her mother saved my life because when I had typhus, she told me to stand over the cauldron where the steam was coming from, because I was red, you know, feverish, so she says, "When they see you, they will know that it's the steam." </sentence><sentence id="1911">And so it was - they opened the door and looked in and then if anyone was sick with typhus, and we were all over the cauldrons there, and when I turned my head, they saw me all sweaty and red, and I was just one more slave worker doing laundry. </sentence><sentence id="1912">So, that was actually, she - that was Mrs.Shacter (ph) - And so it was news to me when she told me I saved her mother's life. </sentence><sentence id="1913">But the fact is that selections were being made right along, and typhus sufferers were eliminated one by one. </sentence><sentence id="1914">So, Hania miraculously survived that selection. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1935">Q: What did you - what went through your head when you saw these selections and people being killed because they were sick, or for some other reason? </sentence><sentence id="1936">Did you think they were going to kill everybody? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1939">A: No, absolutely not. </sentence><sentence id="1940">I just don't know what I thought at that time. </sentence><sentence id="1941">I just knew that times were very bad. </sentence><sentence id="1942">And I just hoped maybe the war would be over and how it will be over, I didn't know. </sentence><sentence id="1943">I didn't know who was fighting whom, and where was the front or if there was the front, or the Germans were there to stay, or whatever. </sentence><sentence id="1944">I just figured that it couldn't go on forever, you know, one way or another it has to end. </sentence><sentence id="1945">And I just - I made no connections. </sentence><sentence id="1946">In fact, I was really, truly - I was not an independent thinker in any such way that you could imagine me, planning or... I probably understood what was going on very well. </sentence><sentence id="1947">I understood it very well, because horror is not very hard to understand. </sentence><sentence id="1948">It's naked horror in front of your eyes, so you know what is happening. </sentence><sentence id="1949">But how that related to the overall thing, I knew I was petrified. </sentence><sentence id="1950">I lived in fear every second of my life. </sentence><sentence id="1951">That I knew. </sentence><sentence id="1952">After that, I couldn't say that I ever could figure out the next day or the month later or if it will end - I knew it would end sometime - but how and when, no such thing. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1967">Q: Now, you were probably a little past the age of when a young girl would have menstruated. </sentence><sentence id="1968"> 0 </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1971">A: Oh, yes, not past the age, but, just to give you the quick overview, I went through all the camps - Auschwitz and Ravensbriick and Retzow and back home to Poland - and I still did not start. </sentence><sentence id="1972">So, that was what you say called a delayed reaction. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1975">Q: Right. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1977">A: And of course, I was not developed and I lacked proper nutrition; I was a skinny child. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1979">Q: Did you know that you were supposed to menstruate? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1981">A: But of course! </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1983">Q: Yeah. </sentence><sentence id="1984">And were you nervous about the fact that...? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1987">A: No, I was glad! </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1989">Q: [chuckles] </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1991">A: I was very, very happy - not happy, but I was glad because I feared - that was one extra fear, what would happen if and when I did, because supplies were - if you can call them supplies - rags were hard to come by. </sentence><sentence id="1992">No, but I never had such a fear because nothing was happening and nothing did happen and I never developed until after the war. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1995">Q: Were you able to notice whether other women were menstruating in the ghetto? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1997">A: No, I know that they didn't because in Auschwitz - I repeat that like an ignoramus because I don't know what it means - but in Auschwitz, they used to say that the soup, the so-called soup that we were given, had brom in it. </sentence><sentence id="1998">Now, I don't know what brom is - and this was some kind of a - whatever it was, a medication or whatever - that that prevented women from menstruating. </sentence><sentence id="1999">I have no idea, I am just repeating it as I heard it. </sentence><sentence id="2000">So, I know that the women did not menstruate. </sentence><sentence id="2001">Why, I wouldn't know, and whether it was due to some concoction or an agent or a chemical being put in the food, I couldn't tell, but I knew that much. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2007">Q: Now, that's a long-term myth, that they put in something in the food. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2009">A: It is. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2011">Q: They put stuff in the food, but not to stop menstruation. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2013">A: So, maybe lack of nutrition...? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2015">Q: That's why I was asking, in the ghetto circumstance and in the camp circumstance - you didn't get it, but I wondered whether you noticed that other women...  1 </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2017">A: I wouldn't know. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2019">Q: You wouldn't know? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2021">A: I know that I did not until way after we came back to Poland, and I mean, way after. </sentence><sentence id="2022">Maybe even later than that - maybe in Berlin in "46. </sentence><sentence id="2023">As far down the road as that. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2027">Q: And what was food like in the camp? </sentence><sentence id="2028">What did you get in the morning? </sentence><sentence id="2029">Did you get two meals, three meals, if one could call them meals? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2033">A: Would you believe that I really don't remember? </sentence><sentence id="2034">I know that we were fed. </sentence><sentence id="2035">But, in those days, we were getting Pancheska (ph), the Pancheski (ph) family were sending, you know, they had some of our better things, crystal, silver, and they were selling it off little by little and were sending in money. </sentence><sentence id="2036">One of the husbands, actually, it was one of the sisters was married to one of the men who worked in the factory - you know, one of the Pancheska (ph) sisters. </sentence><sentence id="2037">There were four sisters, so one of the husbands - the husband of one worked in the factory, and he used to bring - Maria used to sell the stuff - and he used to bring the money. </sentence><sentence id="2038">And she was the only one who never even wanted that stuff originally, but Mother said those are things of sentimental value. </sentence><sentence id="2039">In fact, after the war, whatever we had from home is from them. </sentence><sentence id="2040">You know, those little Passover silver cups - Did Chris tell you about it? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2049">Q: Yes. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2051">A: Yeah, so those things, she kept that she didn't sell yet. </sentence><sentence id="2052">Because, Genia (ph), the maid, she had really - she really wanted everything, and she took everything. </sentence><sentence id="2053">But you know, a sewing machine is not of sentimental value, and bedspreads and draperies have not got sentimental value. </sentence><sentence id="2054">So, she took it and it was her own, but Mrs. Pancheska (ph) took everything my parents had - you know, gifts, wedding gifts, and such, silver - so, they kept it and sold whatever they felt that would bring in more money and that's how we survived. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2059">Q: So, this was an unusual circumstance to have somebody so close being able to get things in to you? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2061">A: Yes, yes. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2063">Q: And is it the case also that she was able to get medicine in when you had typhus? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2065">A: I don't think so. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2067">Q: No? </sentence><sentence id="2068"> 2 </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2071">A: No. </sentence><sentence id="2072">Money was nothing. </sentence><sentence id="2073">I mean, money you can hide but you cannot hide things. </sentence><sentence id="2074">And he used to give it - the husband of one of the sisters - used to give it to somebody we knew and they would bring it from the factory, so that worked out. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2079">Q: Did they take away your clothes when you went into the - into the camp? </sentence><sentence id="2080">You had all these layers of clothes. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2083">A: Yes. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2085">Q: What did you do with them? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2087">A: No, in that camp, we kept our clothes. </sentence><sentence id="2088">They didn't give you - I don't think so - not until Auschwitz. </sentence><sentence id="2089">I think I wore my personal things. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2093">Q: And where did you sleep? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2095">A: In barracks. </sentence><sentence id="2096">You see, Strzelnica was what they call a shooting range originally, and then they built a bunch of barracks there, you see, so that is where one of the camps was made, was Strzelnica. </sentence><sentence id="2097">Whereas - Now, when I went to Poland, in 1980, I asked - Pancheska's (ph) granddaughter took us there. </sentence><sentence id="2098">I wanted to see Strzelnica. </sentence><sentence id="2099">Well, it's back to a shooting range, you see. </sentence><sentence id="2100">And some of the barracks were left over but not all. </sentence><sentence id="2101">So, that was an area that was inside the woods, and the barracks - again, I can't tell you whether they were built for us or built prior or however, but there were barracks and we slept with women. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2109">Q: We need to take a break now, to change the tape. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="2111"> End of Tape #5  3 Tape #6 </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2113">Q: Renia, how would you describe your relationship with your two other sisters at this point? </sentence><sentence id="2114">I mean, they're sort of... Do each of you have a different role at this point, I mean, could you describe it that way? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="2117"> A In a sense, yes, and in a sense, no, because as far as I'm concerned personally, I was always at the receiving end, meaning I received all the love, and I received all the protection, and I received all the care and all everything. </sentence><sentence id="2118">I was the one really who most likely contributed list to the general survival scheme, or whatever you call it. </sentence><sentence id="2119">I was on the receiving end of it most of the time. </sentence><sentence id="2120">I adored my sisters. </sentence><sentence id="2121">Krysia, Chris, my next higher than I sister, was always the practical kind and always very wise in organizing and assessing, so... Hania was sort of in the clouds. </sentence><sentence id="2122">She was very smart and very brilliant, but she was always sort of - she was catered to, you know. </sentence><sentence id="2123">In those days, if you had a very smart person in the family, you had to defer to that person because you couldn't disturb the genius at work. </sentence><sentence id="2124">So, it sort of carried over to her... Not that she was a sponger of any kind - it's just that she was really at a certain level of higher existence that she didn't really have to so much worry about everyday things. </sentence><sentence id="2125">So that basically, Chris was the one who pulled the two of us toward the center, you see? </sentence><sentence id="2126">And Hania was very bright and very intelligent, and understood most everything better than I do anytime, but we loved each other a whole lot, and the fact that we were now separated from our parents - now, I'm saying separated because we were still separated from our father but we knew he was around and saw him every now and then and would wave to him, and we were separated from our mother because we really did not know what death was all about. </sentence><sentence id="2127">So, we deluded ourselves that, well, this resettlement, whatever. </sentence><sentence id="2128">Having seen so many people resettled from Lodz and from Austria in our own hometown, we knew what resettlement was all about. </sentence><sentence id="2129">People were being shifted here and there, and so Mother was shifted somewhere else, and everything is going to come out fine, because when everything ends, she will show up. </sentence><sentence id="2130">So, basically, we were even closer as a unit now than we ever were. </sentence><sentence id="2131">And, I must say, I contributed only by the fact that I was there, and they felt that they had to protect me, and so that was a little more mortar to the binding. </sentence><sentence id="2132">But I was not the planner; I was not a - I didn't visualize things in practical terms. </sentence><sentence id="2133">I understood the situation very well, having now seen what was transpiring, but how that applied to anything; it really didn't, not in my little world, because this was all stuff 1 didn't know how to deal with. </sentence><sentence id="2134">Besides, I had these two protectors. </sentence><sentence id="2135">First I had my two parents; I was always the tag-along. </sentence><sentence id="2136">Now, Hania and Krysia were sort of protecting me. </sentence><sentence id="2137">So, I just had to see that I stayed out of trouble, that I was alert at all times to what was around me, that I understood the danger, that I understood how to handle myself, you know? </sentence><sentence id="2138">And the rest, I knew I was being provided with the love and protection. </sentence><sentence id="2139">And that truly was how I really survived the war. </sentence><sentence id="2140">Not on my own account in any way. </sentence><sentence id="2141">I don't take credit for survival at all, truly. </sentence><sentence id="2142">That is how I actually saw myself. </sentence><sentence id="2143">I saw to it that I really should know what was going on and try to avoid getting into trouble, meaning situations that had no exit. </sentence><sentence id="2144"> 4 </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2173">Q: Why wouldn't you consider that - I don't want to call it a survival strategy - but why wouldn't you consider that things that you actually did? </sentence><sentence id="2174">You had to watch, because... </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2177">A: But I was not responsible for anybody but myself, don't you see? </sentence><sentence id="2178">In the way we were brought up, watching out for yourself wasn't the greatest thing in the world that you want to do, because you really always needed to think of that other person. </sentence><sentence id="2179">But by virtue of being at the end of the line, and not being terribly attuned to realities and not being old enough to understand it all and put it together, I could understand the danger and the fear, but I couldn't relate it to the fact that I was doing anything special, because I wasn't doing anything for anybody. </sentence><sentence id="2180">I was trying to keep myself alive by seeing that I survived, you know? </sentence><sentence id="2181">That's about it. </sentence><sentence id="2182">Not by harming anybody, not by doing anything special, but by just watching out, and of course, to keep control of the fear, which was a task of itself. </sentence><sentence id="2183">Controlling your fear is extremely hard, if you see if your fear is legitimate, it's extremely hard to do. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2191">Q: Could you control your fear? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2193">A: At certain times I could, at certain I could not. </sentence><sentence id="2194">Like the time when I was alone going to Strzelnica camp. </sentence><sentence id="2195">But my fear was uncontrollable, but there was double fear of what would happen if I didn't control myself - because everybody was just falling by the wayside. </sentence><sentence id="2196">You see, that much I understood. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2201">Q: Were there other kids about your age in the camp, as well? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2203">A: Oh, yes. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2205">Q: There were? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2207">A: Not only, you know, I imagine you must have heard about it. </sentence><sentence id="2208">Not only were they in the camp, they were basically smuggled into the camp. </sentence><sentence id="2209">They were outside the camp with Christians, or however they were smuggled. </sentence><sentence id="2210">These kids eventually went to Auschwitz, survived Auschwitz, five and seven year old kids, survived Auschwitz, and one of them is still alive in Israel. </sentence><sentence id="2211">But three of these little kids that lived in camp, who went to Poland after, to Starachowice after the war, were killed in Starachowice, so you heard about that. </sentence><sentence id="2212">I think the name was - Hania reminded me - Eisenmann (ph) - and Wolfowicz (ph) was the man that was the boss of the laundry where I worked, so Wolfowicz (ph) I think had two children. </sentence><sentence id="2213">They were in camp, you see, he smuggled them in and they lived in the back of the laundry or whatever, but I knew of the Wolfowicz (ph) kids. </sentence><sentence id="2214">And they survived the evacuation to Auschwitz, they survived Auschwitz, and everything that came after, and they came back to Poland, and they were killed after the war in Poland. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2223">Q: Do you have any idea why they smuggled the kids into the camp from these places they were being hidden? </sentence><sentence id="2224"> 5 </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2227">A: I don't know. </sentence><sentence id="2228">I just knew, because they were in a position to get them in, because they bribed someone or something. </sentence><sentence id="2229">I know that Mr. Wolfowicz (ph) was my boss in the laundry, and his kids - he had two kids - so, I don't know how many there was - I don't know, less than ten - and they did survived. </sentence><sentence id="2230">They were five-year-old kids. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2235">Q: But how about children your age, young adults? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2237">A: Yeah, they were, they were, some of them survived, down in Israel, of course. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2239">Q: So, the contact that you had during the day - you're at the laundry most of the day? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2241">A: Yes. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2243">Q: So, you don't see your sisters because they're working elsewhere? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2245">A: Right. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2247">Q: So, do you have friends outside your two sisters? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2249">A: Oh, yes, yes, my peers. </sentence><sentence id="2250">For example, the girl in the laundry, Rachelka Shacter (ph), she was a very good friend. </sentence><sentence id="2251">Then I had my Hania Tenser (ph), she was the one who came from Israel to testify that she was in the gas chamber, and she was my friend. </sentence><sentence id="2252">Yes, I had - you know - they were all kids, but you know, a fourteen, thirteen year old kid can work pretty well in the laundry, believe me, and that was just as well slave labor as anything. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2257">Q: Now, I'm going to go back to a question I asked you a long time ago, because you interpreted it somewhat differently than I had intended it. </sentence><sentence id="2258">Do you now, when you're in the laundry, in some sense reap the benefits of having been in school with your sister teaching you, because you kept learning things? </sentence><sentence id="2259">Did these things go through your head? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="2263">Do you replay the books in your head, and poetry? </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2264">A: Oh, yes, most of all poetry. </sentence><sentence id="2265">I am absolutely crazy about poetry. </sentence><sentence id="2266">And, you know, the amazing thing is that the emphasis on learning things by rote, by heart, was very strong in my schooling years, and Hania kept on the same way, so I actually remember a whole lot of Polish poetry, I remember sections of Shakespeare in Polish, and you know, in the hardest of times - to this day I can recite poetry that I wouldn't even believe that I would. </sentence><sentence id="2267">There is a Polish epic, Pan Tadeusz, that of course I must have read a million times now already, but I do read it - it's one of the greatest works. </sentence><sentence id="2268">Anyway, I went to see the movie based on that - it was released about two years ago, by Andrzej Wajda, the director, and they stuck very close to the script and used at least 80% of the poetry as was the epic. </sentence><sentence id="2269">I was sitting in the movie with Victor - of course, Victor doesn't speak Polish, but he enjoyed the movie subtitles - and I am reciting with the movie, I am reciting Pan Tadeusz because I exactly know what's going to come. </sentence><sentence id="2270">And he walks into this room and he looks around and he sees the grandfather clock, and he recites this poem about his connection  6 to the grandfather clock, and I am going right along with him, and I know one line ahead of him all the time. </sentence><sentence id="2271">So, those things sustained me, definitely. </sentence><sentence id="2272">And I didn't see it - again, it's a connection, where it's going to lead me. </sentence><sentence id="2273">This was like nourishment; perhaps that's how I should have put that - that learning for its own sake, if it was pleasurable, was the greatest pleasure. </sentence><sentence id="2274">So, when you're down and out, what else but to draw on this something that was so pleasurable. </sentence><sentence id="2275">And it was personal, intimate, because you didn't have to find a book, you didn't have to rely on the movies or on other people - all you had to do was start reciting in your head that poem - and there were so many, because we were forced to memorize good poetry, really. </sentence><sentence id="2276">So, that was, to this day, I absolutely have every piece of poetry that I love, I have it now, and I re-read it, strangely enough. </sentence><sentence id="2277">I enjoy it and I enjoy it and there is no end to the enjoyment, and that could have been part of what I call this lifting up the soul. </sentence><sentence id="2278">Again, you see, it doesn't - I'm sorry that I don't answer, didn't answer your question to your satisfaction. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2294">Q: No, no, no, no, no - that's not what I said. </sentence><sentence id="2295">You interpreted it differently; it wasn't that you didn't answer it to my satisfaction. </sentence><sentence id="2296">It's just that I had a slightly different intention, and it was very interesting to hear where you took it. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2300">A: Yes. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2302">Q: But perhaps I asked it too early. </sentence><sentence id="2303">Asking you now is maybe more appropriate. </sentence><sentence id="2304">Is there any poem that you recall repeating to yourself a lot there, that you could repeat for us, that was really important? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2308">A: No, no, mostly it was Mickiewicz or Tuwim - I don't know if you've heard of him. </sentence><sentence id="2309">Mickiewicz was a 19" century poet of Polish origin, but Lithuanian, he came out of, when Lithuania was part of - heavily Polish. </sentence><sentence id="2310">But Tuwim was contemporary, and he wrote children's poems, and he was a Jew, a Polish Jew. </sentence><sentence id="2311">And his poetry was very much taught in schools. </sentence><sentence id="2312">Mickiewicz, of course, and there was Slowacki, and there were all other important poets, but they were 18"/19(tm) century poets. </sentence><sentence id="2313">Twentieth century poet was Julian Tuwin, who was a Jew by birth, and every kid knew his poetry. </sentence><sentence id="2314">In fact, when our parents had company and they wanted to show off the kid, they would come and say, "Hey, hey, say that locomotive poem by Tuwim." </sentence><sentence id="2315">You showed off that because it was such beautiful poetry. </sentence><sentence id="2316">And, so I have Tuwim, I have him. </sentence><sentence id="2317">Unfortunately, I didn't quite agree with the way his life turned out, because he sort of - he came to America during the war and then went back to Communist Poland. </sentence><sentence id="2318">He had left this . </sentence><sentence id="2319">Not that it means anything in the broader sense. </sentence><sentence id="2320">He was nevertheless the greatest poet of the 20"... one of the great, outstanding Polish poets of the 20" century was Julian Tuwim. </sentence><sentence id="2321">They're trying to rehabilitate him now, but his poetry lives on, so who cares, whatever the background. </sentence><sentence id="2322">So, you know, all of those little poems and big poems would come back, and they gave you a semblance of continuity of something that was, maybe you didn't lose it yet. </sentence><sentence id="2323">If you could remember that poem that your mother made you recite at that party, you know, and the connection, you see? </sentence><sentence id="2324">And of course, you know, children, you had to curtsey for your parents" friends; you had to curtsey. </sentence><sentence id="2325">So, when you came to make a big presentation, she  7 called you in, you had to curtsey and say the poem, and then would curtsey and walk out. </sentence><sentence id="2326">So, if it was possible, which it was, to make the mental connection from the present situation which I found myself in to this thing that was once sort of part of the other life, that was great. </sentence><sentence id="2327">And if you call it the thread that sustains you, fine, but that's what it really was. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2348">Q: Were there any situations where there was a public sharing of poetry or singing in the camp that you remember? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2350">A: Yes, a lot of times, because, as I told you, Polish education required you to know certain poems, period. </sentence><sentence id="2351">That's it. </sentence><sentence id="2352">So, this is how it was, that if you started, somebody else chimed in, somebody else sung. </sentence><sentence id="2353">There was a lot of singing; it was good. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2374">A: Yes, we saw Father, yes. </sentence><sentence id="2375">He slept elsewhere, but he was working in the little office, so we could always see him. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2378">Q: How do you remember him doing? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2380">A: He was doing fine, because we were around. </sentence><sentence id="2381">But people told us - people from Starachowice who survived the war and Auschwitz, whom we met after the war - they said that the minute he came to Auschwitz, he was another man. </sentence><sentence id="2382">Father, according to accounts of other people that knew him, he perished in October, you see, we came to Auschwitz at the end of July; he perished in October. </sentence><sentence id="2383">They said he aged so, and he totally, he was totally disheartened. </sentence><sentence id="2384">He was totally - he felt completely lost. </sentence><sentence id="2385">Maybe he by then knew - he could have known about my mother. </sentence><sentence id="2386">I don't know. </sentence><sentence id="2387">But then, of course, he didn't have us anymore. </sentence><sentence id="2388">He knew we were somewhere in there, but he didn't really know. </sentence><sentence id="2389">They said that his legs swelled up and he was gone. </sentence><sentence id="2390">He perished in Auschwitz. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2416">A: Out of Strzelnica camp to Auschwitz? </sentence><sentence id="2417">Well, you see, I might as well bring in the fact that we were not evacuated from Strzelnica and Majowka. </sentence><sentence id="2418">We were evacuated from a totally different camp. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2422">Q: Oh, so describe it. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2424">A: Well, the munitions factory had a siding, you know, because to deliver and take out the stuff by train. </sentence><sentence id="2425">At a certain time, at a certain point in 1944, in July or so, middle of July, we were resettled to yet another camp, but very near the munitions factory, next to the siding, the railroad siding, and that camp was the last camp in Starachowice from which the evacuation to Auschwitz took place. </sentence><sentence id="2426">That is where the break-out was, the rebellion and the break-out. </sentence><sentence id="2427">That is where we were loaded on the train for Auschwitz, which is not Strzelnica and it's not Majowka, but it's the third place which I don't even know if it had a name, but it was the closest in location physically to the munitions factory because the railroad, the railroad tracks were right there, and that's where we were loaded to go to Auschwitz. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2432">Q: And how long were you relocated in that place? </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2438">A: No, days, maybe a week or two at most. </sentence><sentence id="2439">And this was a transient type of - I can't even say it was camp. </sentence><sentence id="2440">It had barbed wire, or it had a wooden fence, whatever - it was surrounded by a fence, and it had guards, guard towers, you see, because that was very, this was so near to the factory that this was really probably war production area anyway, but they had guards, and they had Ukrainians in them. </sentence><sentence id="2441">And this is where, and I don't know, Chris or Hania would remember better how long we stayed, but this was absolutely not a camp that we lived in because by then we didn't work anymore. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2482">A: No. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2484">Q: Now, are you afraid again? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2486">A: The one thing that I absolutely never lost was fear. </sentence><sentence id="2487">That is one thing that followed me right through the war. </sentence><sentence id="2488">Fear was sort of like, like your skin. </sentence><sentence id="2489">Skin is part of your body, and fear is another aspect of that. </sentence><sentence id="2490">And we just, I don't know that we knew that Auschwitz existed. </sentence><sentence id="2491">I didn't; I don't know who knew. </sentence><sentence id="2492">I just know that when we were being loaded, however that was arranged, Father's train, the car on the train, and ours were adjacent, meaning whether his was the last of the men's wagons and we were the first of the women's or the other way around. </sentence><sentence id="2493">I don't know. </sentence><sentence id="2494">I just remember that when we arrived in Auschwitz, when they unloaded us on the platform, that as soon as the women came out of this wagon, we saw the group of men coming out of that one that was adjacent to us, and that was the last time we saw him. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2504">Q: How was the trip? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2506">A: That was most horrendous. </sentence><sentence id="2507">Horrendous isn't the word, because it was summertime, you know, it was the end of July 1942... No, what am I saying, it wasn't deg42, of course not -  0 deg44! </sentence><sentence id="2508">We're talking now, of course, this is the Russian offensive that has started, so the Germans are emptying all these labor camps and they are sending people westward. </sentence><sentence id="2509">And we of course have no idea how the war is progressing, or at least I don't. </sentence><sentence id="2510">Because I really am living on another planet. </sentence><sentence id="2511">I just want to survive. </sentence><sentence id="2512">I'm full of fear and I'm trying to manage, but other than that, I really don't have any idea what is happening. </sentence><sentence id="2513">The only thing is that something bad is happening to the Germans because now there are signs that they are a little scared, you know? </sentence><sentence id="2514">So, when we are loaded on those trains, I don't know that we know that we're going to Auschwitz or I don't even know that - I mean, I didn't - I didn't even know that Auschwitz existed, but I figured if there is a war and the soldiers are moving closer, there will be soldiers fighting with soldiers. </sentence><sentence id="2515">Maybe they want us out of the - you know, this is another type of pipe dream kind of thing. </sentence><sentence id="2516">There was no water, you know. </sentence><sentence id="2517">People were dying. </sentence><sentence id="2518">There was shouting for the water, it was just horrendous. </sentence><sentence id="2519">You know, I always think, was it the fact that I was so skinny that I survived? </sentence><sentence id="2520">Really, I didn't require, you know, I wasn't hungry like other people, and my body didn't require fuel the way some other people's bodies required fuel. </sentence><sentence id="2521">There could be something to it, you know? </sentence><sentence id="2522">So, anyhow, when we arrived in Auschwitz, 1944, I think it was either end of July or early August. </sentence><sentence id="2523">And then we found out in Auschwitz that other camps were being evacuated from all over, meaning east of Auschwitz. </sentence><sentence id="2524">You know, our camps, our camp - Majowka/ Strzelnica - Starachowice was located in central Poland within that industrial district, and there were others - there was Skarzysko-Kamienna, there was Radom, there were other camps that were now being all evacuated. </sentence><sentence id="2525">And we knew, for example, that the Radom transport arrived. </sentence><sentence id="2526">And one day we saw my Aunt Rose in Auschwitz, passing by - we were carrying rocks this way and they were carrying rocks the other way - so we knew that all these other camps - we didn't know that Aunt Rosa was alive, but we saw her in Auschwitz - so we knew, the word spread, that all these camps were being liquidated, so we could figure out something wasn't going too well for the Germans, and... </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2548">Q: Before we take a break with the tape, when you arrived in Auschwitz, was it as awful an arrival as your marketplace experience? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2550">A: Oh, yes, except for me personally, Hania and Krysia were there to protect me. </sentence><sentence id="2551">In the marketplace, I was all alone and younger. </sentence><sentence id="2552">You see, I'm a little older now, and of course, I have already learned to cope a little. </sentence><sentence id="2553">Not that I was a lost soul, no. </sentence><sentence id="2554">I was resilient in a self-preservation type of way but I wasn't yet totally what you call clever about things. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="2555">But, no, when we arrived in Auschwitz, we were the three of us. </sentence><sentence id="2556">The interesting thing was, of course, which we didn't know before but we now know, but most of those transports, the last minute transports of people shipped out of the slave labor camps, whether there was no time or whatever, they were not subject to selection. </sentence><sentence id="2557">This is why the five-, seven-year-old kids survived Auschwitz. </sentence><sentence id="2558">We were just herded out, put into the so-called showers, given, thrown the clothes that they gave us, you know? </sentence><sentence id="2559">Our hair was chopped off - I didn't say cut off, I say chopped off - so that we realized that the situation was quite different. </sentence><sentence id="2560">Because little children and older women and people were already just shoved in all at once, from all over - Skarzysko, from Radom, from Wostrowiecz (ph). </sentence><sentence id="2561"> 1 </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2562">Q: I'm sorry, we're going to have to stop now and change the tape. </sentence><sentence id="2563">End of Tape #6  2 Tape #7 </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2566">Q: I was just thinking that your middle-childhood years, from 10 to 15, is all during this horrible period. </sentence><sentence id="2567">You're 15 years old when you enter Auschwitz. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2570">A: Yeah. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2572">Q: It's quite extraordinary to think of that, isn't it? </sentence><sentence id="2573">When I asked you about the entrance into Auschwitz, was there a lot of beating when you were taken off the railroad car, or was it more quiet? </sentence><sentence id="2574">Do you have a recollection of that immediate time? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2578">A: No, I don't, no, the only thing I remember distinctly having seen Father on the platform. </sentence><sentence id="2579">But after that, I remember they were rushing us much in the so-called shower room or whatever you call that. </sentence><sentence id="2580">And maybe Hania, Anna, would tell you about how she objected to being pushed and shoved and screamed at and for that they shaved off her hair, whereas our hair was just chopped off. </sentence><sentence id="2581">They grabbed you by the hair, they put the scissors to it, and however it came it came, but they didn't shave your head, they didn't give you a haircut, they just chopped off some hair, whereas Hania and her friend Irene Muller, Irka Muller (ph), who is now Irene Ross, both very tall, Hania was with her and objected to the fact that she was being pushed on and screamed, and said, "Don't talk to me like this." </sentence><sentence id="2582">So, the woman in charge, she was a Czechoslovak woman, she said, "Just for that, I'1l show you what I can do." </sentence><sentence id="2583">And she put her on the side there, and they shaved off her hair and Irene's hair - total zero, you know, complete bald - and we burst out laughing, in total hysterics. </sentence><sentence id="2584">We thought it was just so funny, because the fun in it was not the fact that the hair was shaved, but because they were both tall and little heads on the top, you know, the pin on top. </sentence><sentence id="2585">And it was so grotesque that it really lent itself to absolute hilarity in these circumstances, so we just laughed ourselves hilariously silly to tears. </sentence><sentence id="2586">And we left that area, as we were all herded out. </sentence><sentence id="2587">We left that area with Hania shaved to zero and Krysia, Chris, and I just having our hair, as I said, just chopped off however, and... </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2598">Q: So, your bodily hair was not shaved. </sentence><sentence id="2599">Only... </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2602">A: No, I had no bodily hairs. </sentence><sentence id="2603">I don't remember, but I guess not. </sentence><sentence id="2604">But we were tattooed right then and there, too. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2608">Q: So, you had your clothes off. </sentence><sentence id="2609">You were nude when they cut your hair? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2612">A: I think so. </sentence><sentence id="2613">I think so. </sentence><sentence id="2614">And we were tattooed, and I really always stress the fact that we lined up together for tattooing so that we had consecutive numbers, which really contributed to our survival as a unit, the three of us. </sentence><sentence id="2615">Because, you know, not having a name, you are always referred as a number, and when they call X number of people for detail or work somewhere, you happen to be in the same unit of numbers, so that was lucky. </sentence><sentence id="2616"> 3 </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2622">Q: Do you still have your tattoo? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2624">A: Absolutely yes. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2626">Q: Did you ever think of taking it off? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2628">A: No, not only did I never thought of it, but I was trying - I was absolutely almost forced into doing it, which I very much objected to. </sentence><sentence id="2629">You know, during my early years in America, I used to work in the summers as a babysitter, as a governess. </sentence><sentence id="2630">So, I went to a hotel in the Catskills with a doctor's wife, you know, he was a surgeon - a plastic surgeon - and they had two children - one girl was about four and a baby like eight months old. </sentence><sentence id="2631">And the mother used to be there with the two kids in a bungalow on the hotel premises and we used to eat in the dining room, but we lived separately, and the husband used to come for the weekends. </sentence><sentence id="2632">Well, anyhow, when he discovered I had - I got the job through high school, through my high school, but that is another story, but an interesting story. </sentence><sentence id="2633">But anyhow, I go to this camp, and it was in Wingdale, New York. </sentence><sentence id="2634">And of course I had came to meet them, and then the doctor used to come for the weekend, and he noticed my number. </sentence><sentence id="2635">He said, "You know, I am a plastic surgeon. </sentence><sentence id="2636">I'd like to remove this number." </sentence><sentence id="2637">And I said, "No, I don't want to remove it." </sentence><sentence id="2638">So, he says - he thought - you know, those were my salad (ph) days - and he says, "Listen, I will not charge you, you have nothing to worry about. </sentence><sentence id="2639">I will do a fine job and it won't cost you a penny. </sentence><sentence id="2640">After, you come back to New York, you come to my office and I'll do it for you for free." </sentence><sentence id="2641">I said, "No, I don't want to do it." </sentence><sentence id="2642">And I wouldn't do it. </sentence><sentence id="2643">And he said to me, "Why would you want to have it?Why on earth would you want to keep it? </sentence><sentence id="2644">You're a young girl. </sentence><sentence id="2645">Why on earth would you want to keep it?" </sentence><sentence id="2646">I said, "Well, I have brown eyes, they're a part of my body. </sentence><sentence id="2647">That's a part of my body, too, and I'm staying with it." </sentence><sentence id="2648">So, I kept it, and of course I never regretted it, never. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2671">Q: Was it humiliating to have the tattoo put on? </sentence><sentence id="2672">Did it hurt you? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2675">A: Oh, yes it was painful. </sentence><sentence id="2676">You know, they pulled on the skin. </sentence><sentence id="2677">By the way, we had very "elegant" numbers, quote-unquote, "elegant", because I know people who got there much earlier than we did. </sentence><sentence id="2678">They have these horrendous looking numbers - a "7" crooked, an "8" was something else. </sentence><sentence id="2679">By the time we got there, which was, as the war progressed, it was really toward the end of the war already, they had such fine experience in tattooing that our numbers, Hania's, Krysia's and mine, are in perfectly beautiful sequence - even, really even - so that we don't have these numbers that others had on the outside, these humungous - we have these elegant numbers because they had all these - and by the way, I have the second serial. </sentence><sentence id="2680">My number begins with an "A" because they ran out of the first series of numbers, and they started an "A" series. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2687">Q: So, when you get tat-... You're shaved, you get tattooed, and then the clothes. </sentence><sentence id="2688"> 4 </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2691">A: The clothes were thrown at you. </sentence><sentence id="2692">Whatever happens to be, whatever - size does not matter. </sentence><sentence id="2693">You get what you got and shift for yourself. </sentence><sentence id="2694">If you were a size 5, you get size 27, and if you're size 12, you get size 6, and after that you have to go and exchange with others. </sentence><sentence id="2695">And those were rags basically, rags. </sentence><sentence id="2696">I mean you know, stuff - I understand now that they were shipping out to Germany, good clothes and such, so whatever was left in the piles was really second-hand already. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2703">Q: Were they filthy? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2705">A: Actually, I don't know. </sentence><sentence id="2706">I don't think so because I imagine they must have steamed them for lice. </sentence><sentence id="2707">There was always vermin in there. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2711">Q: When did you find out that this was Auschwitz and what Auschwitz was? </sentence><sentence id="2712">Was it very soon after your arrival? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2715">A: Oh, yes, absolutely, by then there was no hiding from the truth. </sentence><sentence id="2716">Because, first of all, you saw the crematories. </sentence><sentence id="2717">| think by then there no five crematories left. </sentence><sentence id="2718">I think by then, because you know, some of the crematories were destroyed by whatever means. </sentence><sentence id="2719">The point of it is we were not burned. </sentence><sentence id="2720">There was no selection for burning or for gassing. </sentence><sentence id="2721">We were just brought in as a unit and shipped into Birkenau as a unit, and all the other camps - of course, we realized why this was happening. </sentence><sentence id="2722">There were just too many camps being emptied into Auschwitz to be able to run the enterprise as they did before, with selections and such. </sentence><sentence id="2723">So that when we came, you could smell - you could see the fire out of the chimney. </sentence><sentence id="2724">And of course, burning flesh has a very strong odor that is nothing like anything else that you know. </sentence><sentence id="2725">So, that was unmistakable, the burning of human bodies, unmistakable. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2739">A: Yes, we discovered that and, you know, my memory of all this is sort of hazy, but I do know that there was a gypsy camp not far from our barracks because they talked about the gypsies, and we heard that the Hungarians were being shipped in, too, at the same time. </sentence><sentence id="2740">But you see, this was already very - I don't know how they brought out people to Auschwitz as far as numbers, but I am sure with the German system, the way they run everything to the last detail, they probably spaced these transports. </sentence><sentence id="2741">Now it was just one after the other, but the Russian offensive was really nearing to Auschwitz. </sentence><sentence id="2742">I mean, you know, the Russians stopped at the Vistula River, and that was another political treachery (ph), but who knew then that Stalin wouldn't cross the Vistula, but they were coming. </sentence><sentence id="2743">The Russians were coming from the east, so all these camps - we were, after all, located not far from the Vistula, not all that far, so anyhow... I mean, not as near as Krakow or other cities that were on the Vistula, but we were within the area that could be contacted very quickly. </sentence><sentence id="2744">However, they didn't because Stalin sat himself down and waited for the Germans to finish off the job. </sentence><sentence id="2745">So, all these camps that were being emptied, we realized  5 that something was happening from the east. </sentence><sentence id="2746">But how much could you know when you're living behind barbed wires, and now you're coming here, and you see all these other camps, Radom, and everybody else is there. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2755">Q: You were put into a quarantine camp for the first month? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2757">A: Yes. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2759">Q: Do you remember what barrack it was? </sentence><sentence id="2760">Do you have any recollection? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2763">A: No, no, the only thing I remember is that after the war, in 1987, and I was there with Chris, that we went to see the barrack, so then I knew that was the barrack. </sentence><sentence id="2764">But I remember the barrack as a barrack in the interior, but if you ask me what number it was and to find it in the complex, I couldn't, but I was there in 1987. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2767">Q: How did you understand what a quarantine camp was? </sentence><sentence id="2768">What was that supposed to mean, "quarantine barrack"? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2771">A: Well, Pll tell you, all these fancy words of "quarantine" and all this other thing, you only knew that there were all kinds of new horrors coming, so one horror was of this nature and one horror was of that nature. </sentence><sentence id="2772">Personally, as I told you, I could not figure out what it led to or what it led from or how it figured in the larger picture. </sentence><sentence id="2773">I didn't know if they meant to keep us there for a month or for a year or forever or whatever. </sentence><sentence id="2774">But having now acquired enough experience to see that nothing is certain, that nothing is permanent, that everything changes, and it always changes for the worse, because so far in our experience, nothing changes for the better. </sentence><sentence id="2775">It was all downhill and by some miracle, we managed to stay together, which was altogether a miracle, altogether the most unbelievable miracle. </sentence><sentence id="2776">So, that we knew was a lucky break, that one, but everything else was just pure horror. </sentence><sentence id="2777">And this was just another thing, and God only knows what the next thing was going to be. </sentence><sentence id="2778">And that horrendous smell of burning flesh was really... well, sort of like very ominous in the sense that that is maybe after all going to be, you know, the final, the final, the tail end part of this horrible journey, who knows - we didn't know. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2787">Q: Do you recall the moment that you found out about the gas chambers? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2789">A: Oh, we were told right away. </sentence><sentence id="2790">The old-timers were there, of course. </sentence><sentence id="2791">They said, "They burn people here. </sentence><sentence id="2792">They ship them in, they burn them all the time." </sentence><sentence id="2793">Of course, no question!How could you not know? </sentence><sentence id="2794">I mean, even if you didn't know, you saw the flame. </sentence><sentence id="2795">Generally, if you drive by the Jersey Turnpike, you see the smoke coming out, whether it is acrid smoke or whatever it is, it's smoke, it's belching black or white or whatever. </sentence><sentence id="2796">This was fire, you see? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2806">Q: Not smoke. </sentence><sentence id="2807"> 6 </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2810">A: Not smoke; this was fire. </sentence><sentence id="2811">You saw, in the dark of the night, this luminous ball of fire against the dark sky. </sentence><sentence id="2812">It was unmistakable. </sentence><sentence id="2813">You couldn't call it anything else. </sentence><sentence id="2814">This was light fire. </sentence><sentence id="2815">Now, this light fire also had an overpowering stench. </sentence><sentence id="2816">And now, here you have the old- timers who tell you this. </sentence><sentence id="2817">Now, how much more can you - do you need to figure out what was going on? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2826">Q: So, did they also tell you things to avoid? </sentence><sentence id="2827">Did you get clues about how one could survive in this thing? </sentence><sentence id="2828">That there was a way...? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2832">A: No, no. </sentence><sentence id="2833">Because - I don't remember the sequence of things, but I remember there were some girls who ran away, who escaped from Auschwitz at that time, and they were brought back and they were hung. </sentence><sentence id="2834">So, we already knew, you know, like the hanging in Poland on the square for the Christians to see when they came out, so we already knew that such tactics lead to other things, that this was just a warning but watch out because you're next. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2838">Q: Did you see the bodies? </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2844">A: I heard about it. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2846">Q: So, in the first month or two, do you three talk about this situation? </sentence><sentence id="2847">Try to figure out...? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2850">A: We talked all the time. </sentence><sentence id="2851">First of all, we sleep nine to a bunk. </sentence><sentence id="2852">It is very hard to accommodate nine people to a bunk, so we had to talk. </sentence><sentence id="2853">You have nine people herded into one place, you have to talk. </sentence><sentence id="2854">You talk because at a certain time, you can't even step down; you have to be up in your bunk. </sentence><sentence id="2855">So, obviously some are old-timers - although we are still traveling - so-called traveling, quote-unquote - we are still within the Starachowice group because we were shipped as a unit, and we were placed as a unit. </sentence><sentence id="2856">Of course, we are mixed in with others, of course, but we still have some of these people from Starachowice with us. </sentence><sentence id="2857">And we were nine to a bunk, so all of us couldn't be all greenhorns; some of them have already previous knowledge of what this place is about and what's happening. </sentence><sentence id="2858">So, now there are no secrets; now we know the truth. </sentence><sentence id="2859">And I think I myself for the first time am beginning to realize that all these things I was trying to explain away - you know, this is now 1944, and for the last two years, "42-"44, it is always downhill, it is downhill, it is downhill, but now this could very well be the end of the downhill, but this is more than the imagination will allow. </sentence><sentence id="2860">I remember being very scared in Auschwitz, very, very scared, because I thought that was the end, I really did. </sentence><sentence id="2861">But by that time I think my attitude was a little different, you know? </sentence><sentence id="2862">Sort of accepting of whatever was going to happen. </sentence><sentence id="2863">Because, you know, by now, we still didn't know about Mother, we didn't know. </sentence><sentence id="2864">I mean, everybody could figure out that she didn't survive, but  7 we didn't know. </sentence><sentence id="2865">And what happened to Father we didn't know either, so now we're just the three of us, and whatever awaited us after this we didn't know, because we had no idea where the war was heading, which way. </sentence><sentence id="2866">We knew it wasn't good for the Germans, but that's about it. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2884">Q: Do you have nightmares? </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2890">Q: You didn't? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2892">A: No, I didn't have nightmares, no. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2894">Q: Were you able to sleep okay? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2896">A: Oh, yes! </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2898">Q: Really? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2900">A: If you were made to carry heavy rocks and then be a skinny kid, you were exhausted!Too exhausted not to sleep. </sentence><sentence id="2901">Besides, there's something to be said for being squeezed in with all these bodies. </sentence><sentence id="2902">You know, you cannot toss and you cannot scream, because somebody is going to poke you right away and, "Hey." </sentence><sentence id="2903">Maybe I had nightmares, but they didn't allow me to have nightmares because, when you're squeezed between two other bodies, how would you be able to thrash around or yell or scream? </sentence><sentence id="2904">Somebody's going to go, "Hey, shut up, you," or whatever. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2911">Q: Was it quiet in the barrack or was it noisy? </sentence><sentence id="2912">Do you remember? </sentence><sentence id="2913">Smelly? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2917">A: Well, it wasn't clean... I really don't remember - I just remember the upper bunk is where we were at. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2919">Q: You were in the upper bunk, so that was good. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2921">A: I remember that. </sentence><sentence id="2922">But there was nothing on the wood itself. </sentence><sentence id="2923">A pallet, I think, but there was very little. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2927">Q: Was there an oven in the middle? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2929">A: I think so. </sentence><sentence id="2930">But that I know from having gone back now to take a look. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2933">Q: When did - I don't know the chronology, so I may be asking the question too soon - when did the incident with the boots happen? </sentence><sentence id="2934">Was this before you were in Effektenkammer or after? </sentence><sentence id="2935"> 8 </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2939">A: You mean whose boots? </sentence><sentence id="2940">Hania's boots? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2943">Q: No, when you were asked to clean the boots of the... </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2945">A: Oh, yes. </sentence><sentence id="2946">No, that was exactly the time; that was exactly the time, inside the barrack, right. </sentence><sentence id="2947">That was Aranka. </sentence><sentence id="2948">She was the head of the barrack. </sentence><sentence id="2949">And you know the latrine was outside. </sentence><sentence id="2950">To go to the latrine, you had to have permission. </sentence><sentence id="2951">To get permission, and there were only X number of people could go at one time so you were allowed in this group of three. </sentence><sentence id="2952">So, whatever, I was going to the latrine, and she caught me coming back to the vestibule - Aranka who was as big as a horse and as fierce looking as the Gestapo themselves. </sentence><sentence id="2953">She was a Czech girl, Czechoslovak. </sentence><sentence id="2954">And she was wearing these black boots - riding boots - and she dragged me over. </sentence><sentence id="2955">She says to polish those boots with my spit, and I was so terribly offended, but I knew I could pay with my life if I didn't, because she was so powerful and so fat and so big and I was a skinny kid, and one blow from her, that would have been the end. </sentence><sentence id="2956">But I was so incensed about it. </sentence><sentence id="2957">| remember that I always think about it in the sense of how stupid it was for me to get myself so worked up over it. </sentence><sentence id="2958">Because from what I had already experienced and seen, I should have known that this is just one more humiliation, but it isn't of such great importance that it should make - I cried over it because, of course, she put her foot up on the stool, and I stood there on my knees polishing her boots and spitting and I had very little spit to spit with, and of course she would have killed me. </sentence><sentence id="2959">And I felt so humiliated and offended and I never got over it for the longest time. </sentence><sentence id="2960">And I knew as I told you that this was out of proportion to the reality. </sentence><sentence id="2961">It seems, as I survey my war experiences, that always it was that particular instance, it wasn't the general, you know? </sentence><sentence id="2962">The specific and personal was the one that stayed with me. </sentence><sentence id="2963">For having seen all these things and having experienced other people's horrible experiences right next to me, those other things really count for very little, except that I could really have paid with my life. </sentence><sentence id="2964">But it wasn't so much the fear for my life, but the humiliation that she was not German, you see? </sentence><sentence id="2965">I had already accepted that anything that had to do with the Nazis was dreadful and to be avoided, but the source was different. </sentence><sentence id="2966">In other words, it was coming from a Czech woman that the humiliation was double because [had yet not accepted that aside of the Nazis, there were other people who could do that. </sentence><sentence id="2967">So, I was just absolutely - it destroyed me. </sentence><sentence id="2968">But it really didn't amount to much. </sentence><sentence id="2969">I did survive it, so... I polished her boots and I'm sure she never knew which one of those ugly looking people I was. </sentence><sentence id="2970">So, there were no repercussions to it in a sense. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2997">Q: So, she didn't take it out on you later? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2999">A: No, because I did do the job, there's no question. </sentence><sentence id="3000">I was down on my knees, and she was towering over me. </sentence><sentence id="3001">I tell you, once kick and I could have been gone. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3005">Q: Does this situation in some way remind you of the situation your mother told you about with respect to your father? </sentence><sentence id="3006"> 9 </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3009">A: Absolutely, yes, absolutely, it was exactly the same. </sentence><sentence id="3010">And the German said to her, "These aren't gentlemen, these are Jews. </sentence><sentence id="3011">And that Father became so humiliated. </sentence><sentence id="3012">Of course, he was sweeping the rail station. </sentence><sentence id="3013">It was very, very upsetting to him. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3019">Q: Was this Czech woman Jewish? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3021">A: I really don't know. </sentence><sentence id="3022">Her name was Aranka; everybody was scared to death of her because her physical presence was really very... threatening. </sentence><sentence id="3023">And she had a very loud voice and screamed a lot. </sentence><sentence id="3024">I was always afraid of her, but this is not why I felt humiliated, I think. </sentence><sentence id="3025">It was because she was not German. </sentence><sentence id="3026">Because by then I started realizing that it is not the Nazis only that I have to fear; I have found a new source of fear that I have to watch out for, and I could only handle that much. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3033">Q: It gets bigger and bigger. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3035">A: Yeah, the circle, so to say, is getting enlarged, and now I have other things to worry about, because just because she's not a Nazi doesn't mean she can't kill me, "cause she can, and get away with it. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3037">Q: We'll have to take a break to change the tape. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="3039"> End of Tape #7  0 Tape #8 </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3041">Q: Let me go back to Majowka for a moment, because I realize that - I wonder if there are any comparable incidents for you in Majowka - not necessarily of being humiliated, but maybe humiliated or beaten, or were there people that you were as afraid of in Majowka as you were in Auschwitz? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3043">A: You know, I don't really remember, but I do know that I felt - probably, I would guess I would have felt less fear in Majowka than in Auschwitz because Majowka was still Starachowice and Father was still on the premises and it was really hometown, my hometown, even though there was no semblance to life or home or anything, this was the place that was a familiar - not the camp, but the town was a familiar town. </sentence><sentence id="3044">Auschwitz was a totally different situation, where everything was threatening from Day 1. </sentence><sentence id="3045">The mixture of fatherless; the total terror being surrounded by electrical barbed wire; by a system in place - you know, I think Starachowice camps were run sort of ad hoc, if you know what I mean. </sentence><sentence id="3046">Run it as well as you can, and if you can't, then shoot a few and kill a few and run it. </sentence><sentence id="3047">This was organized murder, planned, executed and otherwise set up to the last detail. </sentence><sentence id="3048">And then you get thrown into a situation of different nationalities, so you are beginning to understand the scope of this entire drama - it's not a drama - of this entire epic is much larger. </sentence><sentence id="3049">It isn't a little Starachowice slave labor camp that is kept to produce war machinery, where just soldiers fight each other. </sentence><sentence id="3050">This is another aspect of something that is not yet even known or comprehended or - it doesn't seem to serve a purpose. </sentence><sentence id="3051">You see, in Starachowice, you could always rationalize: "They have to keep these slave laborers; otherwise, they cannot win the war. </sentence><sentence id="3052">If they don't produce the cannon shells, the war cannot be won, or whatever. </sentence><sentence id="3053">They cannot fight the war." </sentence><sentence id="3054">So, however you slice it, these people are not expendable because somebody has to produce war material. </sentence><sentence id="3055">In Auschwitz, there's no such reasoning available to you because you realize this place is like a dead end. </sentence><sentence id="3056">It has no function as far as doing something for any reasonable kind of an end. </sentence><sentence id="3057">It doesn't produce war material. </sentence><sentence id="3058">It doesn't do anything to fight the Germans... er...to help the Germans to fight the war. </sentence><sentence id="3059">It houses people who are getting killed. </sentence><sentence id="3060">Nobody is doing anything except stupid things - if anything, cutting marshes and, like Sisyphus, carrying back and forth the rocks from here to there. </sentence><sentence id="3061">We saw our Aunt Rose from Radom. </sentence><sentence id="3062">One day we are on the line carrying the rocks here and she was going with the rocks there and we waved to her. </sentence><sentence id="3063">We didn't know she was in Auschwitz. </sentence><sentence id="3064">So, you begin to understand, even as I was beginning now to more or less mature into this reality of what it was, that this is another story all together. </sentence><sentence id="3065">This is absolutely the end of the line for not just Starachowice people and the Jews. </sentence><sentence id="3066">It's the mixture people - you get Czech people and they brought in the transport from Salernjica Grise (ph) and all kinds of people who, for all kinds of reasons who have nothing to do with punishment. </sentence><sentence id="3067">So, that's when it becomes obvious that that is another thing to contemplate. </sentence><sentence id="3068">So, basically, a place like Auschwitz, where you do not produce, cannot be explained away. </sentence><sentence id="3069">It must be confronted, even for somebody as - somebody who tries so hard to dismiss certain things, meaning, "Well, you know, tomorrow is another day, and this isn't so bad." </sentence><sentence id="3070">But it is. </sentence><sentence id="3071">It is. </sentence><sentence id="3072">Now you know it is so bad. </sentence><sentence id="3073">And, you know, we still don't know that Father perished, we don't  1 know that yet. </sentence><sentence id="3074">But the ambiance, and the work that is not work, and the food that isn't food, and the constant roll calls, and the threats if you don't show on roll call everybody else gets killed and all this, this has another dimension. </sentence><sentence id="3075">And this is when, I mean, you see, I have already learned to live with fear as part of - fear that could at least be used to motivate me to look out and to watch out, to see that I don't become a burden to my sisters and to see that I can maneuver somehow through. </sentence><sentence id="3076">But here, there is just somehow - things are cut off when we come to Auschwitz because you don't see anything to justify your being there. "" </sentence><sentence id="3077">Why do they want me here? </sentence><sentence id="3078">Over there, they needed the laundry, but here they don't need anything. </sentence><sentence id="3079">They're just feeding you for nothing." </sentence><sentence id="3080">Which is another thing that I understood by then: you cannot be fed for nothing - whatever feeding that meant - but if you are fed, that means they permit you to live, and if they permit you to live, that means they have to use you for whatever you that have. </sentence><sentence id="3081">But here, there is nothing to do. </sentence><sentence id="3082">I mean, it has no connection to all the things that you have already figured out, that I have already figured out. </sentence><sentence id="3083">So, I realized then that this would really be the end for us. </sentence><sentence id="3084">But I still didn't think that I would have to decide how to get out of it. </sentence><sentence id="3085">I felt Krysia and Hania would really protect me. </sentence><sentence id="3086">So, whatever happens, with three of us together. </sentence><sentence id="3087">But that was a dark hour; those were really dark hours in Auschwitz, the first period, you know. </sentence><sentence id="3088">Of course, it was getting colder, and after the quarantine we were sent to cut marshes and it was getting much colder. </sentence><sentence id="3089">We were standing in water. </sentence><sentence id="3090">And it was physically getting to be - not that it was demeaning. </sentence><sentence id="3091">Nothing was demeaning anymore. </sentence><sentence id="3092">It was just the physical hardship was beginning to creep in. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3178">A: Yes, definitely, yes, but I didn't experience any of it. </sentence><sentence id="3179">I don't know, I really always talk about it, that human kindness is what I have actually depended on. </sentence><sentence id="3180">That I have - Somehow, people have always shown me a certain kind of deference - not deference because of anything that I represent, in fact, because I was skinny and undernourished and a poor little skinny kid. </sentence><sentence id="3181">So, everybody was taking pity on me, you know, so I always felt no matter where I went, there was always somebody taking pity on me to do this or to do that or to console me or whatever. </sentence><sentence id="3182">We never had situations where we had to fight, but there were people in the barracks absolutely who fought. </sentence><sentence id="3183">I mean, people would kill for a piece of bread. </sentence><sentence id="3184">And people would... But, you know, I always have this habit in me to analyze things, why would... "Well, maybe the Greek people, they understand things differently." </sentence><sentence id="3185">I was yet to grow up to understand that people are just people. </sentence><sentence id="3186">You can come from the North Pole or the South Pole or anywhere in between. </sentence><sentence id="3187">It's still the same people and it's exactly... The only thing is that in such unusual circumstances, different people reveal their character in a different way, so that some people who personify goodness become even better than goodness personified. </sentence><sentence id="3188">Others who have the beast in them become even more beastly. </sentence><sentence id="3189">You could see that among the Germans as well - those who turned a tender head when they could see something wasn't exactly according to the tule, and those who just waited for you to step out of the line-up two inches because they were ready to kill, and they were ready, and you stepped out and that was it. </sentence><sentence id="3190">But those are all musings on a psychological kind of a reality that, in my own little world in those days - I could always depend on the Starachowice people who were still around, that I knew. </sentence><sentence id="3191">And we were still around, mixed with them. </sentence><sentence id="3192">And then there were others who were also riddled with fear. </sentence><sentence id="3193">And then there were others that I always felt that I didn't want to be near - I mean, prisoners, you know? </sentence><sentence id="3194">This was a world of its own, but a reflection of a bigger world, I guess, which is that human beings just are about the same everywhere, it's the circumstances that bring out in you whatever it is that you have in you. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3212">Q: Did anyone ever surprise you, someone you thought was a good person turned out in that situation to be very difficult or harsh? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3214">A: I can't remember those things really. </sentence><sentence id="3215">I'm sure if I thought about it, I probably would dig it out somewhere in the recesses of my mind. </sentence><sentence id="3216">But at this point, no, I couldn't off-hand think of anybody, but I do know that, speaking in generalities, I could tell you that people always took pity on me and were nice to me. </sentence><sentence id="3217">That, I mean, I don't know how else to put that. </sentence><sentence id="3218">There was something about people that made them look after me. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3224">Q: So you never found a circumstance where people actually resented the fact that you were so young and still survived? </sentence><sentence id="3225">Women who might have been older and had lost...? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3228">A: No, quite the opposite. </sentence><sentence id="3229"> 3 </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3232">Q: Really? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3234">A: Quite the opposite. </sentence><sentence id="3235">Maybe I reminded them of their kid. </sentence><sentence id="3236">Whatever it was, but it was quite the opposite. </sentence><sentence id="3237">And I always said to myself it's because I look like that. </sentence><sentence id="3238">And I never fought my way to be first in line or first to get food. </sentence><sentence id="3239">I always got sort of behind, I think. </sentence><sentence id="3240">That's very strange when I think about it, but that's how it was. </sentence><sentence id="3241">I did survive thanks to Chris and Hania, but I also survived thanks to the goodness of other people. </sentence><sentence id="3242">There's no question about it. </sentence><sentence id="3243">That absolutely is a fact. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3254">Q: Did you ever get depressed during these first few months in Auschwitz? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3256">A: No. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3258">Q: You didn't? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3260">A: No, and I'll tell you why. </sentence><sentence id="3261">I was so preoccupied with survival. </sentence><sentence id="3262">First of all, I was filled with fear. </sentence><sentence id="3263">And out of the fear came the fact that I've got to manage. </sentence><sentence id="3264">And you cannot let yourself - not that you can't - I didn't - I couldn't - I just - whatever it was, whether I wouldn't allow myself or whether I knew that it wouldn't lead anywhere. </sentence><sentence id="3265">The fact was you had to face what it was and manage. </sentence><sentence id="3266">And that was what took up - you can't be depressed. </sentence><sentence id="3267">Because depressed means tomorrow they put a bullet through your head. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3276">Q: Did you see many depressed people? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3278">A: Oh, yes. </sentence><sentence id="3279">I had already analyzed this before. </sentence><sentence id="3280">I think older people had a harder time than younger kids. </sentence><sentence id="3281">And I noticed this after the war, too, when we came to America. </sentence><sentence id="3282">People who already lived a life, you know? </sentence><sentence id="3283">People who had lived, who were married or whatever. </sentence><sentence id="3284">They were forever probably, I don't know, grieving for what - I mean, I didn't have time to grieve because I didn't live yet. </sentence><sentence id="3285">I didn't live yet, and all I knew was I had to watch out. </sentence><sentence id="3286">That was just to sum it up in a very plain way. </sentence><sentence id="3287">I had to watch out. </sentence><sentence id="3288">And other than that, depressed - I don't that that was even a concept that I could really even know what it was about. </sentence><sentence id="3289">I just knew that had to stay on the mark, you know? </sentence><sentence id="3290">Not to allow myself to do what is not supposed to be done, and not to allow myself to be called into a place that I knew would be trouble. </sentence><sentence id="3291">And that was it. </sentence><sentence id="3292">And that was - you know, I think when prisoners are in prison who break out of a prison, | think that's how they spend their days, thinking forever how to break out. </sentence><sentence id="3293">I had no idea how to break out, and I certainly wouldn't attempt it. </sentence><sentence id="3294">But the idea of how to stay on the mark, it was a total preoccupation, which, of course, included how to survive on the meager food. </sentence><sentence id="3295">It wasn't just the fear that could get you; it was the lack of food. </sentence><sentence id="3296">And don't forget, I was a growing child and did not get proper nutrition. </sentence><sentence id="3297">Other people required were hungrier than I because my body didn't require much, or maybe I was stupid to think that, but I really did not - I wasn't driven to insanity by hunger, because I was very hungry but my body tolerated it. </sentence><sentence id="3298">So, you see, this idea of depression, I don't know that I knew the meaning of it, because  4 life was too busy surviving. </sentence><sentence id="3299">And in any way of pushing my way or whatever; just minding my person. </sentence><sentence id="3300">And that's about all I can tell you about depression. </sentence><sentence id="3301">I will tell you 100% it was a totally foreign concept to me, if I even knew what it meant - I probably didn't. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3326">Q: Do you have vivid recollections of the food? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3328">A: Yes. </sentence><sentence id="3329">I'll tell you what, I used to use... I'll tell you now, because Victor, my husband Victor, loved turnips. </sentence><sentence id="3330">When we got married, he said, "Oh, I'd love for you to cook turnips." </sentence><sentence id="3331">And I said, "One thing I'm going to tell you right now," because you know he's American-born, three generations. </sentence><sentence id="3332">And I said, "One thing - I'd cook anything and everything. </sentence><sentence id="3333">Please don't ask me to cook turnips." </sentence><sentence id="3334">And he said, "Why not? </sentence><sentence id="3335">It's a very good food." </sentence><sentence id="3336">And I said, "Listen, I have an association with the smell of turnips and I will never get over it, not ever. </sentence><sentence id="3337">Please don't ask me to cook it. </sentence><sentence id="3338">I will not cook it. </sentence><sentence id="3339">If you want turnips, you will have to go to a restaurant." </sentence><sentence id="3340">Because, in Auschwitz, the only thing you ever got was turnips in a soup. </sentence><sentence id="3341">The turnips, of course, were never washed, so you had the sand and the peel, and the turnip. </sentence><sentence id="3342">If you found a piece of turnip, it was lucky. </sentence><sentence id="3343">But the - I can't say fragrance. </sentence><sentence id="3344">That's too fancy. </sentence><sentence id="3345">But the smell of the turnip is so deeply ingrained with me with that period, that I truly cannot stand - not the sight of turnip, I wouldn't know, because it looks like a sweet potato. </sentence><sentence id="3346">If you cook it properly and away from me, maybe I wouldn't know until I tasted it. </sentence><sentence id="3347">But absolutely that is what remained - the business with the turnips. </sentence><sentence id="3348">That was food. </sentence><sentence id="3349">I think they gave out coffee once - Coffee with a capital "C" - that was the water with a little chicory in it, I guess, and a piece of bread and the turnip soup. </sentence><sentence id="3350">That was food. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3374">Q: Did you ever have margarine on your food, or...? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3376">A: I don't think so. </sentence><sentence id="3377">I don't remember. </sentence><sentence id="3378">I just know that there were other people who were always hungrier than I was. </sentence><sentence id="3379">I was very, very hungry, but I was not as hungry - I think Hania was always hungrier than I was. </sentence><sentence id="3380">She was always tall, very tall, I mean, as Polish women go, I mean, as people from Poland go, even Jewish, she was very tall, and I was just a skinny kid, but Hania was tall and I think her body required more food than mine. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3386">Q: So, you think she suffered more than you? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3388">A: I think so, and I knew people who really, truly suffered from hunger more than I. I used to dream about food. </sentence><sentence id="3389">You see, you asked me whether I had nightmares. </sentence><sentence id="3390">No. </sentence><sentence id="3391">You know what I dreamt about? </sentence><sentence id="3392">I dreamt about the table settings my mother used to put out. </sentence><sentence id="3393">My mother used to love to serve elegantly. </sentence><sentence id="3394">I love to remember that. </sentence><sentence id="3395">And I remember this party and I remember the settings. </sentence><sentence id="3396">I remember the food that was on it, but the settings, I was obsessed with the settings, in my dreams, in my recollections of home. </sentence><sentence id="3397">So, that was really, that was part of getting fed. </sentence><sentence id="3398"> 5 </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3410">Q: So, I'm going to take you back, just because you mentioned this, talk about being stimulated to go back for a moment to another time. </sentence><sentence id="3411">Chris, when she talked about the first night that you came back after you had left town when the war started, and you came back. </sentence><sentence id="3412">The first meal back home, she claims that your father said, "We are going to set the table with a tablecloth and a formal setting," even though you had very little food. </sentence><sentence id="3413">You do remember that? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3418">A: Yes, absolutely. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3420">Q: It's quite extraordinary. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3422">A: Yes, as a matter of fact, as time went on, and we would always have proper settings and there was not much to eat - a boiled potato - because that kept a semblance of a life. </sentence><sentence id="3423">But, of course, in Auschwitz you could dream about it. </sentence><sentence id="3424">I mean, Mother used to set beautiful tables - I don't mean during the war. </sentence><sentence id="3425">But you know, I even dreamt about sugar cookies, those sweet... sweet... beet... </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3430">Q: Sugar beet? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3432">A: Yes, sugar beet cookies, because when she learned to bake that during the war, I even dreamt about that, and that's quite a leap from looking at an elegant table. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3434">Q: Do you remember people having conversations about food? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3436">A: Oh, all the time, all the time, all the time people used to talk about food. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3438">Q: And what kind of a conversation was it? </sentence><sentence id="3439">Did people exchange recipes? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3442">A: Yes, they talked about recipes. </sentence><sentence id="3443">They talked about what they saw in display windows. </sentence><sentence id="3444">If they happened to be from the same town, "Oh, you remember, this pastry that had this display of every day fresh..." Whatever. </sentence><sentence id="3445">Absolutely, all the time. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3450">Q: Now, how did that function for people? </sentence><sentence id="3451">I do know one survivor felt like "we ate with our talk", or something. </sentence><sentence id="3452">It was as if the talk was a substitute. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3456">A: It was. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3458">Q: But it didn't hurt more or make you more hungry? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3460">A: No, I'll give you an analogy. </sentence><sentence id="3461">When I cook, you know, I like to cook, I used to cook fancier because now we're eating all this other simpler stuff. </sentence><sentence id="3462">But in the days when I was cooking, and I would have a party, whatever, I would have no time to eat, and I was so hungry, hungry, but I had to cook, so I said, "Well, let me first start cooking." </sentence><sentence id="3463">And by the time I was done cooking all these French dishes with the wine and all, I was so satiated  6 from the fragrance, this beautiful fragrance of the food, that by the time I was done with cooking, I really didn't need to eat. </sentence><sentence id="3464">I definitely didn't need to eat because the idea plus the fragrance, the wonderful wine cooking, would fill me. </sentence><sentence id="3465">That is analogous to the fact that, if you, perhaps, if you talked of food that was really part of another setting, and I don't mean food just for the eating of it, but for the sustenance and the other thing that comes with food, that that could fill you. </sentence><sentence id="3466">Not for long, because eventually, five, six hours later you still would wake up hungry and famished, but that is the only analogy that I could think of. </sentence><sentence id="3467">And it is true. </sentence><sentence id="3468">It is absolutely true because people were talking all the time about food. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3478">Q: And you, too? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3480">A: Yes, yes. </sentence><sentence id="3481">You know, people were describing this or these people talking about ptishye (ph), which were like profiteroles au chocolat, so you remember, and then it filled you. </sentence><sentence id="3482">So, I guess there has to be something to it if so many people did it. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3486">Q: Did you see a lot people smoking, women smoking? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3488">A: No, I don't think there were any cigarettes. </sentence><sentence id="3489">I remember that during the war they used to roll in a piece of paper and I don't even think they had tobacco; I think they had crushed leaves or something. </sentence><sentence id="3490">My father was a smoker, though, but not my mother. </sentence><sentence id="3491">Women, I don't remember that women smoke. </sentence><sentence id="3492">Or maybe they did, but certainly not in camp. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3498">Q: No, that's what I meant: did you ever see women using cigarettes to barter for other things? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3500">A: Oh, to barter, yes, not to smoke. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3502">Q: Oh, to barter? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3504">A: To barter, absolutely. </sentence><sentence id="3505">Let's say you wanted a piece of bread. </sentence><sentence id="3506">So, you sold a scarf to get a turnip, then you exchange the turnip for cigarettes, and then you barter the cigarettes for bread. </sentence><sentence id="3507">You see how that went? </sentence><sentence id="3508">You were a non-smoker. </sentence><sentence id="3509">The cigarette was a means of getting the bread in a circuitous way. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3516">Q: So, cigarettes were very valuable? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3518">A: Very, but the final object was bread. </sentence><sentence id="3519">How you arrived at it is another story, but cigarettes were very often involved. </sentence><sentence id="3520">It wasn't because you smoked them for yourself or smoke...Who eventually ended up with the cigarettes, I have no idea. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3525">Q: Did you ever barter? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3527">A: No. </sentence><sentence id="3528"> 7 </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3529">Q: But your sisters must have. </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3530">A: I don't think so. </sentence><sentence id="3531">I don't know, I really don't know. </sentence><sentence id="3532">This is out of my hand. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3536">Q: I think we" ll break for the tape at this point, because I have a longer question to ask. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3540">Q: I want to go back again to Majowka because I neglected to ask something, and it may make a connection to Auschwitz, I don't know. </sentence><sentence id="3541">Was there sexual abuse of women in Majowka that you know about? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3544">A: No. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3546">Q: In none of the camps? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3548">A: I really, I don't know. </sentence><sentence id="3549">If there was, I am not aware of it at all. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3552">Q: So, you were not afraid of any kind of sexual...? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3554">A: No, how could I be, considering who I was and how I looked and who, I guess, would look at me? </sentence><sentence id="3555">That was never, ever... Later on, when we were past Retzow and after the Liberation, that's a story further on, when we were inside of Germany and the Russians came, and we were warned that they rape women, so we should run away and we should not stay there. </sentence><sentence id="3556">That's as far, but, but even by then, I didn't ever think of it. </sentence><sentence id="3557">The only thing that I was afraid of in - unless other women experienced it in Auschwitz - that if you were sick and had to stay behind on the bunk, and you couldn't go to the outside, to work, like in the marshes like we did, that they would come and drag you out and they would do with you what they wanted to do with you, whatever that meant, but I guess that meant probably more of being killed than... Yes, but you see after the Auschwitz detail left, and barrack had to be emptied, they went through the barracks to see if anyone was hiding because sick people who couldn't make it to the roll call... So if they found you, they took you whenever they took you, but that was never, ever an issue, not with me. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3562">Q: Do you remember the day when Chris was taken out of the barrack and told to take her two sisters, when you are given this, what ends up being a very protected job? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3564">A: You mean in Auschwitz? </sentence><sentence id="3565">Oh, yes, oh, yes, yes. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3568">Q: Can you describe that day? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3570">A: Well, in fact, somebody just reminded me that Chris and Hania actually were asked for the jobs and I wasn't. </sentence><sentence id="3571">I was going to be left behind. </sentence><sentence id="3572">No, this was an opening in - maybe I'll sort of put a frame around it - We are now in Auschwitz since, let's say, early August. </sentence><sentence id="3573">We have been in quarantine and we have worked in the marshes and it's getting very much colder, very much, because winter is setting in. </sentence><sentence id="3574">There is a detail of women that is to be sent to a place where they sort clothes that is left behind by political prisoners, not Jews, not Jews. </sentence><sentence id="3575">We don't yet know why or how, but they request, I think, thirty women or whatever to be sent there. </sentence><sentence id="3576">So Krysia and Hania are picked for the detail, and I am not to be in the detail because I am small. </sentence><sentence id="3577">So, somebody intervened on my behalf and she  9 said, "She is a hard worker and she's very smart. </sentence><sentence id="3578">She would be very good." </sentence><sentence id="3579">So, instead of thirty, they let go thirty-one. </sentence><sentence id="3580">And we arrived... The first week, we went to work and came back to the barrack, or maybe the first two weeks. </sentence><sentence id="3581">I don't remember. </sentence><sentence id="3582">But in the beginning, we went there and then came back. </sentence><sentence id="3583">What we found out is that the women at that job, that's still Auschwitz property, except this is a sort of a separate unit - that the women, political prisoners, were somehow involved in the Polish underground or they were in cahoots or whatever, so they were shipped out. </sentence><sentence id="3584">So, now, they didn't want any more Polish women Christians; they wanted the safer type, which is from the Jewish camp. </sentence><sentence id="3585">So, again, as I said, I don't know if it was a week or two weeks or three weeks - whatever it was, originally we went there and back, there and back at night. </sentence><sentence id="3586">Eventually, we didn't go back to the barracks in Birkenau; we stayed there. </sentence><sentence id="3587">And that was a Heaven sent. </sentence><sentence id="3588">First of all, if got cold outside. </sentence><sentence id="3589">We didn't have to go to the marshes. </sentence><sentence id="3590">Second of all, we were dressed now properly; you see, because we were next to those piles of clothes, so we could pick what we had, what we could wear. </sentence><sentence id="3591">And now it was getting colder, so shoes were very important - very. </sentence><sentence id="3592">So, we had warmer clothing, better shoes, and we worked at that detail, and these women were a very interesting group. </sentence><sentence id="3593">They were all very intelligent, and they had real political connections. </sentence><sentence id="3594">Some of them - we discovered one of them, Christina Jevulsha (ph), that she was Jewish actually, but she was a Polish political prisoner, passing for a Christian. </sentence><sentence id="3595">Anyhow, we worked at that detail up to the evacuation of Auschwitz, the death march, and that really saved our life because we were already getting terribly run down from the outdoor work in the marshes, you see, and now it was getting worse because the winter was coming. </sentence><sentence id="3596">And because we worked in that place - probably two months or so - and we slept indoors and we worked indoors, and we were wearing better clothes. </sentence><sentence id="3597">So when the death march, the evacuation of Auschwitz took place, we walked out on the death march wearing proper clothes, meaning warm clothes for winter, and our health was restored because we didn't work outdoors, and I think the food was a little better, too, although I do not remember exactly what the feeding was, how they - it was institutional food, and it was doled out, but it probably was a little more than the turnip soup with the sand in it. </sentence><sentence id="3598">And that - you know, it seems, in that whole saga of this war experience, it seems that there were already a little - there was a little interval that allowed us a little breathing space which restored the soul and the body before we would face the other horror. </sentence><sentence id="3599">So, luckily, that stretch of time - which wasn't more than probably two months - allowed us to really, by not working outdoors, not to really come down with whatever, you see. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3630">Q: Did it surprise you that, in the context of Auschwitz, there would be kommandos that would not have selections, that you really were not only protected from the elements, but protected from what Auschwitz was? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3632">A: Yes, very much. </sentence><sentence id="3633">But, you see, this was such an exceptional setting which was totally strange to us. </sentence><sentence id="3634">The clothes of political prisoners were hung up, numbered. </sentence><sentence id="3635">If a political prisoner died, the stuff had been packed and sent to the family. </sentence><sentence id="3636">If a political prisoner was transferred, the clothes traveled after them. </sentence><sentence id="3637">We were engaged in packing. </sentence><sentence id="3638">And of course, Heaven help you if you stole something or took a thread out of it. </sentence><sentence id="3639">And the fact remains  0 that I couldn't imagine that a thing like that existed. </sentence><sentence id="3640">Send the clothes of that prisoner back to the family? </sentence><sentence id="3641">I still don't understand it in the scheme of the genocide, of the Nazi genocide, why that was done. </sentence><sentence id="3642">I mean, these were Christian, obviously, but what was the importance of sending the clothes back to the families? </sentence><sentence id="3643">After all the harassment and the inhumanity that they have shown the human beings, that they should be concerned about clothes being... I just, it doesn't, I don't know. </sentence><sentence id="3644">But luckily for us, that was the case. </sentence><sentence id="3645">And so I learned to pack. </sentence><sentence id="3646">But that was, it was good because we were in a more civilized setting, to begin with. </sentence><sentence id="3647">These Polish women were very good. </sentence><sentence id="3648">They were very intelligent and there was very little of that animosity, the Polish-Jewish type, no, this was rather... </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3666">Q: These were also old-timers who remained there. </sentence><sentence id="3667">They had been there awhile. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3670">A: Yes. </sentence><sentence id="3671">I think most of them were shipped out. </sentence><sentence id="3672">I think thirty or thirty-one were shipped out. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3676">Q: But there was a group that was still there? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3678">A: Yes, somebody had to be left behind to show the newcomers. </sentence><sentence id="3679">But I do know that they were in touch with other Polish prisoners, but, of course, we never were aware of really, of what was going on. </sentence><sentence id="3680">But I do know now that they had contact with the Polish underground. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3684">Q: Do you have any idea how come Hania and Chris were chosen out of all the women in the barrack? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3686">A: Yes, the woman who did help us wrote a book about it. </sentence><sentence id="3687">She liked us, so writes in the book that we were not the pugnacious type, and she noticed that other people knew how to fight their way out and way in. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3690">Q: Who is she? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3692">A: Felicia Hyatt, Felicia Berlant Hyatt (ph). </sentence><sentence id="3693">She was a scribe in the barrack, and she took a liking to us. </sentence><sentence id="3694">And she, when the request came for people, she picked us, and she was the one who was instrumental in my being attached to this detail. </sentence><sentence id="3695">And she wrote not a very nice chapter, it's in her book, it's called Short Calls...something Calls, what is it...Close Calls. </sentence><sentence id="3696">And so she was instrumental in that she took a liking to us, she said they were intelligent girls and we didn't know how to fight our way out so, whatever. </sentence><sentence id="3697">She says that in the book. </sentence><sentence id="3698">So, anyhow, that's how we ended up there, and that was a lifesaver. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3706">Q: So, then there's going to be an evacuation of Auschwitz. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3708">A: Right. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3710">Q: Did you have - I don't know how to use the word - to stay, or to go? </sentence><sentence id="3711"> 1 </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3714">A: No. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3716">Q: No choice. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3718">A: No, the only choice we were given to others who did stays, was like my friend Hannah Tenser from Israel, who was left in the gas chambers because they ran out of gas, or other people who were too sick to move; they were left behind as refuse. </sentence><sentence id="3719">But we were just marched out like everybody else. </sentence><sentence id="3720">But we were lucky that we were dressed well because it was January and it was cold. </sentence><sentence id="3721">So, I don't know that we would have made it. </sentence><sentence id="3722">Maybe we would have - other people did. </sentence><sentence id="3723">But it helped to have good shoes and to have good clothes. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3730">Q: Did you have gloves? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3732">A: Probably. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3734">Q: Hat? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3736">A: Yes. </sentence><sentence id="3737">We had access to the piles of clothing that they wanted... You know, when we got there, they said take off everything you have on and go pick something that fits you - not from the prisoners but from the Jewish property. </sentence><sentence id="3738">So, we had shoes to fit and clothes to fit and it was warm, because we were there toward, you know, in the winter. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3742">Q: Yes, it was January 18th. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3744">A: Yes. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3746">Q: Did you leave Birkenau and walk toward Auschwitz I, or do you have any recollection where you went? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3748">A: No, I only know that we went on a march, and I only know that I completely lost my mind. </sentence><sentence id="3749">And I fell asleep while walking. </sentence><sentence id="3750">I was sleepwalking. </sentence><sentence id="3751">I absolutely fell asleep, and Chris and Hania were dragging me. </sentence><sentence id="3752">And the whole march is one - it's not a nightmare, it's completely obliterated except for what I remember: the snow was on the ground, we were marching down a country road or whatever, with dark trees on each side and snow in the middle, and it seemed like a place - an enclosure. </sentence><sentence id="3753">So, I was walking and they were dragging me, but I was dead asleep, totally. </sentence><sentence id="3754">And I always talk about it, when, every now and then, they would stop everybody to relieve himself, and Chris and Hania would squat down and tell me to relieve myself, but I wouldn't because I wasn't here; I was in the other reality, so that - it's true, and so finally... </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3762">Q: Were you actually sleeping? </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="3778"> A It was to Gleiwitz? </sentence><sentence id="3779">I didn't know. </sentence><sentence id="3780">That's where we went, right, I didn't know. </sentence><sentence id="3781">Gliwice now, right. </sentence><sentence id="3782">And I didn't know where we were walking, and I have no recollection except for this enclosure, white snow and the trees. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3788">Q: On the one hand, you say that you were dressed well, and you clearly felt better than you had two months prior, right? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3790">A: Right. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3792">Q: So, what's this sleeping about? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3794">A: I have no idea. </sentence><sentence id="3795">I walked as much as I could and the rest I slept. </sentence><sentence id="3796">I know one thing which I am very proud of. </sentence><sentence id="3797">When we got to a certain big barn with where to stay overnight, and I must have been terribly clumsy or horribly tired, and I wasn't moving right, and a German came and knocked me in my face - this is the second time, by the way. </sentence><sentence id="3798">I once got hit in Auschwitz like this - with a ring; he was wearing a big signet ring, and he knocked me, and I fell right down at the barn door, and everybody else was chased into the barn. </sentence><sentence id="3799">I had the presence of mind when I woke up, when they started blowing whistles for everybody to get up, I had the presence of mind to stand by the door, and found Krysia and Hania as they came out. </sentence><sentence id="3800">But that was...One day I have to have this made to...I have to account for it, how it came about that I slept through this march. </sentence><sentence id="3801">At least half the way I slept through. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3810">Q: And also how to account for your two sisters having the strength to hold you for that long. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3812">A: I don't know. </sentence><sentence id="3813">I don't know. </sentence><sentence id="3814">They were pushing me, you know. </sentence><sentence id="3815">They were pushing me and talking to me and I kept sleeping, and I truly don't know. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3820">Q: So, you think that you were sleepwalking. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3822">A: Not sleepwalking, I was just sleeping. </sentence><sentence id="3823">I do remember that I never thought of the place where I was as I was as the place I was in. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3826">Q: Oh. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3828">A: I thought that was somewhere - because, the dark skies - we walked at night - and the dark trees and the white bottom. </sentence><sentence id="3829">So, I'm now in an enclosure. </sentence><sentence id="3830">I'm not outdoors. </sentence><sentence id="3831">You see,  3 I am not outdoors. </sentence><sentence id="3832">I am somewhere in an enclosure, walking down. </sentence><sentence id="3833">But how that jives with the reality, that I've never figured out, but that was a fact. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3840">Q: Did they try to wake you? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3842">A: No, they just dragged me. </sentence><sentence id="3843">I mean, there was no reason, I mean, to wake me, so if I opened my eyes - I probably had my eyes open, but I was sleeping. </sentence><sentence id="3844">I was really very much asleep. </sentence><sentence id="3845">Much of the trip, I was asleep, until we reached Gleiwitz, was it? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3850">Q: And then you were on... </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3852">A: ...on the train, yeah, they were in open cars, and the snow was falling, that I remember Yeah, because by the time we reached Ravensbriick, I was awake, having slept myself out on the train. </sentence><sentence id="3853">You know, we sat in open cars, so the snow was falling, and we ate the snow off our coats, so that between the fresh air and not having to walk and the snow, which was moisture, I came to. </sentence><sentence id="3854">And when we got to Ravensbriick, I knew, finally I saw the sign "Ravensbriick". </sentence><sentence id="3855">I did read it; I did see the sign. </sentence><sentence id="3856">So I knew we were in another place, not that place that was an enclosure. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3862">Q: [laughs] That's very interesting. </sentence><sentence id="3863">Did you think you were going to die? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3866">A: Um, many times, but not at this particular - I mean, by then I realized everything sort of was a chance, you know? </sentence><sentence id="3867">Chancy, things were chancy, things were too chancy and all around. </sentence><sentence id="3868">So, if I was going to die, that means that's what came up. </sentence><sentence id="3869">Because there was no planning, you know, there was no planning, there was no decision making on that score. </sentence><sentence id="3870">It's just how the wind carried you. </sentence><sentence id="3871">If you were too exhausted and your legs were swollen and you fell by the wayside, that was the end. </sentence><sentence id="3872">But it wasn't that you planned what I'm going to do ten days later, nothing. </sentence><sentence id="3873">You just went with the event, went with the flow, as they say. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3882">Q: So, none of you - neither of you - got sick in Auschwitz? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3884">A: Krysia was sick, yes, Chris was sick one time. </sentence><sentence id="3885">I forget what was her...her legs? </sentence><sentence id="3886">No, I forgot. </sentence><sentence id="3887">She was sick, and then she got better. </sentence><sentence id="3888">You'd have to ask her, but I do remember she was sick, yes. </sentence><sentence id="3889">But, you see, on the death march, I wasn't sick. </sentence><sentence id="3890">I was just over- exhausted or whatever. </sentence><sentence id="3891">And you see, I always talk about the fact that I was skinny, and I wasn't hungry, but maybe my body was growing and required more - maybe it didn't require food but it required rest. </sentence><sentence id="3892">I don't know. </sentence><sentence id="3893">It's a mystery. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3904">Q: When you arrived in Ravensbriick, somebody made a decision - I don't know if it was Hania or Chris - undoubtedly it wasn't you... </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3906">A: No. </sentence><sentence id="3907"> 4 </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3910">Q: ...because you claim you never made any decisions - to say that you were Christian, and to take the name Gorska as the last name. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3912">A: And I don't remember that. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3914">Q: You don't remember that? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3916">A: No, but I do know - I know that it happened, but I don't know how it came about or where or whatever. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3918">Q: But you do remember that that's how you were known? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3920">A: Yes, because Ravensbriick, as you know - this is about the end of January or so, early February - and Ravensbriick was so overrun with people. </sentence><sentence id="3921">All these camps that were first evacuated from Poland into Germany, and then from Germany and Poland into - they were just shoving them in. </sentence><sentence id="3922">They put up tents in Ravensbriick; there were no more barracks available. </sentence><sentence id="3923">There were tents. </sentence><sentence id="3924">So that it really, you were so, now - now we were completely disconnected from the original group. </sentence><sentence id="3925">We were still traveled - when we were in Auschwitz we were very much with the group - but because we were not evacuated with the Starachowice people, we came there with another group, and then we got mixed in with all kinds of nationalities and people camps that you never heard of and that you did hear of and so on. </sentence><sentence id="3926">So, it didn't matter who you were. </sentence><sentence id="3927">You could have told them you were Roosevelt's daughter, you know, for that matter. </sentence><sentence id="3928">You could have picked out something out of the blue moon, or King Farouk's first wife, whatever, you see? </sentence><sentence id="3929">So, if Hania said that or Krysia said that, it must be so. </sentence><sentence id="3930">But, as I told you, it wasn't my decision. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3942">Q: How horrible was it in Ravensbriick? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3944">A: Very bad - it was the worst. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3946">Q: Worse than Auschwitz? </sentence><sentence id="3947">Why? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3950">A: Because it was disorganized. </sentence><sentence id="3951">Not that it was disorg-...It wasn't in any way planned to contain the number of people that were shipped in. </sentence><sentence id="3952">It was in no way organized with a plan for the future, even, because the war was now turning, you know, the war effort of the Allies was now taking shape. </sentence><sentence id="3953">So, that the Germans, whatever they were up to, knew only themselves, but the fact is that a place like Ravensbriick that had all these people shipped in - and maybe the decision wasn't yet made what to do with that, with these people, I don't know - but the fact remains that the camp was overrun. </sentence><sentence id="3954">We stayed in a tent. </sentence><sentence id="3955">There were no more people possible to squeeze into the barracks. </sentence><sentence id="3956">You can imagine they accommodated you now in the Grand Hotel now, in the tent, because, I mean, this was beyond any setting, especially since they always were so organized in the - their genocidal plan included every detail on down the line, and this was, of course, already  USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0410 rs out of their hands. </sentence><sentence id="3957">So, that was rough; that was bad. </sentence><sentence id="3958">The food was - no food and no place to stay in, and just chaos. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3968">Q: All right, you haven't taken - been able to clean yourself for days... </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3970">A: Yes. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3972">Q: So... </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3974">A: I don't remember. </sentence><sentence id="3975">I think we used snow, or something like this. </sentence><sentence id="3976">That could very well be. </sentence><sentence id="3977">Because we ate snow, and we probably cleaned ourselves with snow, too. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3982">Q: And did the registration include giving you a new number? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3984">A: I don't think so. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3986">Q: So, you kept the same number? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3988">A: Frankly, I don't even think they registered us. </sentence><sentence id="3989">I mean, if you consider what was happening at the time, with the influx of the people. </sentence><sentence id="3990">I really don't remember, I truly, I don't, but it was so chaotic that I can't imagine that they would still be able to count or whatever. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3994">Q: Did you have a red stripe down your back from Auschwitz? </sentence><sentence id="3995">A painted red stripe? </sentence><sentence id="3996">Or did you have clothes that didn't have that? </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="4020">Q: Were people dying? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="4022">A: Yes, in fact, we have a friend from Israel whose mother we saw in the melee of people. </sentence><sentence id="4023">We saw out of nowhere. </sentence><sentence id="4024">Mrs. Linsburg, we ran into Mrs. Linsburg. </sentence><sentence id="4025">And years later, we told the daughter who survived, who lives in Israel. </sentence><sentence id="4026">She lost her mother somewhere in Ravensbriick and she never found out what happened to her - No, her mother disappeared and she never know where. </sentence><sentence id="4027">And we told her, we saw her in Ravensbrtick. </sentence><sentence id="4028">We just glanced at her in Ravensbriick, because she was in Ravensbriick. </sentence><sentence id="4029">But what happened after, we don't know. </sentence><sentence id="4030">But I'm telling you, it was total chaos, so that it was just  6 impossible. </sentence><sentence id="4031">And people who were with each other, if they were separated, then that was the end of that. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="4048">A: No, because we had to find out from the men, you see. </sentence><sentence id="4049">It's the men from Starachowice who knew what happened. </sentence><sentence id="4050">I don't know at which point we found out about it. </sentence><sentence id="4051">I don't know, but we did have to find it out from the men. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="4056">Q: So, that's later, then? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="4058">A: Probably, I don't know. </sentence><sentence id="4059">Or maybe we already knew. </sentence><sentence id="4060">I couldn't tell you for sure. </sentence><sentence id="4061">But I know that we did find out that he perished in October, October of 44. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="4066">Q: And by the time you're in Ravensbriick, have you decided that your mother is already dead? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="4068">A: In all likelihood, we've thought that in all likelihood that she would not turn up because we'd seen too much and heard too much. </sentence><sentence id="4069">We heard too much. </sentence><sentence id="4070">You see, having now been mixed in with all the people from Auschwitz and in Ravensbriick, with the influx of people from every conceivable part of Poland, it was very easy to piece things together. </sentence><sentence id="4071">So that...we had a pretty good idea I think by then, but not a certainty, and certainly did not give up the idea that they might still be alive. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="4076">Q: Do you remember the moment when someone asked for volunteers to get out of Ravensbriick and go to a subcamp? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="4078">A: Yes, yes, I remember that, yeah. </sentence><sentence id="4079">And, not I, but Krysia and Hania, Chris and Hania, we all volunteered, and... As I'm fond of saying, we volunteered for what? </sentence><sentence id="4080">We didn't know. </sentence><sentence id="4081">It could have been going up the chimney, but we volunteered to get out of Auschwitz, not to go wherever - we didn't know... </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="4086">Q: You mean Ravensbriick? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="4088">A: Out of Ravensbriick, right. </sentence><sentence id="4089">We volunteered because things have gotten to be totally impossible, totally. </sentence><sentence id="4090">So, they said, whoever wants to go, get on the truck, but where the truck was going nobody knew. </sentence><sentence id="4091">But that was a very fine choice, because these were the first shipments out of Ravensbriick, and we ended up in Retzow, which was an empty camp, which was later to be receiving other prisoners, but we were lucky enough to staff  7 that camp. </sentence><sentence id="4092">I ended up a maid for an SS woman. </sentence><sentence id="4093">Hania ended up a maid for the - in an office. </sentence><sentence id="4094">Chris didn't have a good job - I forgot, Chris told me, she reminded me the other day how I spoke on - you know, this I have to really relate again because... </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="4102">Q: I think you should hold it because I think we have to change the tape before you begin. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="4104">So, we'll start with your talking about Chris. </sentence><sentence id="4105">End of Tape #9  8 Tape #10 </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="4108">Q: We ended the last tape with your beginning to tell us about the three jobs you had in Retzow, and in particular, Chris, you said, had a terrible job first. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="4110">A: Yes, I forgot. </sentence><sentence id="4111">She actually reminded me of it, but I remembered after she refreshed my memory. </sentence><sentence id="4112">I worked for the SS woman. </sentence><sentence id="4113">Our section, the women's section of Ravensbriick - of Retzow, excuse me - was ran by SS women, and they were a category of their own, awful, brutal people. </sentence><sentence id="4114">And they of course needed servants, and I was one of the personal servants. </sentence><sentence id="4115">She lived in a room. </sentence><sentence id="4116">I did her laundry, I brought in wood to keep the stove going, you know, and cleaned the house and so on. </sentence><sentence id="4117">She took a liking to me, but I was still a Jew. </sentence><sentence id="4118">And she would not come near me ever. </sentence><sentence id="4119">I would walk in, she would walk out. </sentence><sentence id="4120">And if she talked to me, she talked to me from another end of the - because she just wouldn't be near me. </sentence><sentence id="4121">So, then she started leaving crusts of bread for me. </sentence><sentence id="4122">She didn't like crusts. </sentence><sentence id="4123">So, she said, "I'll be leaving this crust. </sentence><sentence id="4124">If you find it on the table, that's for you." </sentence><sentence id="4125">And I said, "Thank you very much." </sentence><sentence id="4126">So, meanwhile, one day she came in and she says, "Did you find the crusts I left for you?" </sentence><sentence id="4127">I said, "Yes, thank you very much. </sentence><sentence id="4128">| eat them." </sentence><sentence id="4129">And she says, "How are things going for you? </sentence><sentence id="4130">Who are you here with? </sentence><sentence id="4131">Do you know anybody, do you have family?" </sentence><sentence id="4132">And I said, "Yes, I have one sister who works in the office, she cleans the office, and then I have another sister, but she does not have a good job." </sentence><sentence id="4133">I forgot what Krysia did. </sentence><sentence id="4134">She says, "All right, I'll get her a good job." </sentence><sentence id="4135">So, Krysia was assigned to the kitchen, and that was really a great, wonderful thing. </sentence><sentence id="4136">Of course, she was the most vicious thing, but in a very paradoxical way, I really benefited greatly toward my liberation from being her servant, because they were so - they lorded over everybody so you not only had to do for her and so on. </sentence><sentence id="4137">When the evacuation of Retzow was organized, we had to carry their rucksacks. </sentence><sentence id="4138">They took their stuff, and we had to carry - the maids had to carry - not God forbid somebody else. </sentence><sentence id="4139">So, when we were evacuated from Retzow, as the eastern front was approaching, the Russians were approaching closer and closer; the war was already going toward the end. </sentence><sentence id="4140">I think this was by then probably April - end of March, early April. </sentence><sentence id="4141">When we found ourselves on the road with all the evacuees of every stripe and of every possible persuasion, because you had the Jewish prisoners of war - Jewish - you know, prisoners from the concentration camps, and you had Polish laborers who worked on the farm, and you had German military and German out of uniform, and German civilians with dogs and cars and whatever - we had to carry their stuff. </sentence><sentence id="4142">And then when it came to a point where the road was so clogged up we couldn't move, they told us to sit down. </sentence><sentence id="4143">Well, we made a way - there were the few maids that were carrying the tucksacks - and by the way, I kept saying that there were twelve of us, but Hania reminded me it was ten, and Helena was one. </sentence><sentence id="4144">There was one woman there, Helena, she was blonde, one of the servants, or whatever. </sentence><sentence id="4145">She spoke German very well. </sentence><sentence id="4146">I think she was from Krakow or somewhere. </sentence><sentence id="4147">When we made it off the road, the main road where the evacuees were, I had this woman's rucksack with all her belongings, so in final analysis, I proved to be a skunk, because what Helena did - she was carrying somebody else's - and you know, they had those black capes, these women, they had black wool capes that they wore. </sentence><sentence id="4148">So, Helena put her cape, the cape over her clothes and put the woman's hat, and we  9 all decided... No, I didn't decide... But the ten of us, not the twelve, the ten of us who made it off the road, onto the field and away from the evacuees on the road, were supposed to pretend that we are the prisoners and Helena was our guard, and she was guiding us - no, not guiding us. </sentence><sentence id="4149">Guarding us. </sentence><sentence id="4150">She was guarding us, you see. </sentence><sentence id="4151">So, we had the paraphernalia, the German paraphernalia. </sentence><sentence id="4152">So, she probably, in the final analysis, the SS woman, who trusted me, who took a liking, she probably said, "Well, like all the Jews, she betrayed me." </sentence><sentence id="4153">She was so vicious, she was very, very... But to me, she was absolutely wonderful. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="4198">Q: And why do you think that was? </sentence><sentence id="4199">How do you explain that? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="4202">A: I cannot explain it. </sentence><sentence id="4203">I cannot explain it. </sentence><sentence id="4204">The mere fact that she didn't want to be near me but she left me crusts of bread, that she asked me if I have it well, if everything is fine, and if I have family, on the one hand. </sentence><sentence id="4205">And then on the other hand, I saw how what she did to other people. </sentence><sentence id="4206">So, I cannot explain it. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="4212">Q: You were in Retzow for, what, a couple of months? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="4214">A: From the time we left Ravensbriick, which probably was February or so, in February. </sentence><sentence id="4215">Yeah, about a couple of months, right, because the evacuation from Retzow was about early April, for 1945. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="4218">Q: And, in addition to these crumbs of bread, was the food...? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="4220">A: Well, the food was better because - I really got ahead of my story - but I didn't say that after we - those trucks out of Ravensbriick - that brought us in, all the so-called spots were filled with us, maid and this and the other, women were brought in - in fact, some of the people we knew from Poland - were brought into this camp, because there was an air force base, a German air force base, not far, and they were digging anti-aircraft ditches or whatever. </sentence><sentence id="4221">So, these laborers were supposed to be working for the - maybe not only the air force - no, airport, or whatever you call it. </sentence><sentence id="4222">Anyhow, once the camp was filled, we found that there were people who we knew from the other camps. </sentence><sentence id="4223">And, of course, we had it very fine now, because having to work for the German women who didn't really want us to mingle with the population, so we slept in separate quarters under the kitchen. </sentence><sentence id="4224">So Krysia always brought down a little more bread, and so that was really fine. </sentence><sentence id="4225">And so we got restored again before the big evacuation on the road. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="4232">Q: I'm having an association. </sentence><sentence id="4233">There was a story that Krysia told about Hania in Auschwitz that had to do with food. </sentence><sentence id="4234">Do you remember? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="4238">A: Yes. </sentence><sentence id="4239">Now, Chris remembers it much better, and I know that Hania fainted and all this, but I don't really recall this. </sentence><sentence id="4240">I only remember it because Chris told me about it. </sentence><sentence id="4241">I really truly didn't remember that. </sentence><sentence id="4242">I'm beginning, you know, as I analyze and think back, I really think I that I obliterated certain things from my mind. </sentence><sentence id="4243">Because I have a very distinct  0 recollection about certain things and none about other things, so there has to be some selective thinking here. </sentence><sentence id="4244">I don't know. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="4252">Q: So, you're now on the road with ten other people - ten others? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="4254">A: Yes, ten women, ten. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="4256">Q: Ten women. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="4258">A: No, we are, the total of us is ten. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="4260">Q: And Helena is acting like the SS guard. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="4262">A: Yes, Helena is, because she is wearing the black cape. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="4264">Q: And she has blonde hair. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="4266">A: She has blonde hair and she speaks German very well. </sentence><sentence id="4267">And we slide down an embankment. </sentence><sentence id="4268">Because, you know, the traffic came to a dead stop. </sentence><sentence id="4269">Every - you couldn't go if you tried - everything on the road. </sentence><sentence id="4270">It isn't that we stopped for our own sake. </sentence><sentence id="4271">There was no place to move. </sentence><sentence id="4272">All the cars and all the trucks and all the military equipment and all the peasants with the wagons, and everything is stopped dead. </sentence><sentence id="4273">And they are meanwhile giving out rations from Sweden - packages, Red Cross packages from Sweden. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="4282">Q: On the road? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="4284">A: On the road, in the middle of all this. </sentence><sentence id="4285">And the German women are grabbing the cigarettes like crazy - there are cigarettes then - and these German women with whom we served, they are grabbing them. </sentence><sentence id="4286">And I remember getting sardines there; we got sardines. </sentence><sentence id="4287">But anyhow, I remember, we are stuck on this road, which is completely choked up traffic, and we slide down an embankment - we don't slide, we go down an embankment. </sentence><sentence id="4288">The fields are a little lower than the road on an embankment. </sentence><sentence id="4289">And we as far as where there is like - no, not snow - cut grass piled up. </sentence><sentence id="4290">What do you call that? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="4298">Q: Hay? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="4300">A: Hay, right. </sentence><sentence id="4301">We go behind these haystacks and we sit there hoping to sit it out, to wait until they move on. </sentence><sentence id="4302">And before we know it, a person comes over, a man. </sentence><sentence id="4303">He hears us speak Polish, and he asks if we're Polish. </sentence><sentence id="4304">And we say, "Yes, we're Polish. </sentence><sentence id="4305">We ran away from this here, this evacuation route." </sentence><sentence id="4306">And he says, ""You know, there is a lot of Poles here because we're working on the, in the farm. </sentence><sentence id="4307">Why don't you go to that house over there and tell them I sent you, and they" lI put you up." </sentence><sentence id="4308">So, that's what happened. </sentence><sentence id="4309">We walked away. </sentence><sentence id="4310">Nobody ever missed us. </sentence><sentence id="4311">We got to the villa, it was a German villa, and we  1 stayed there until the Germans came That's how we were liberated - except, one of the girls among the ten was a Russian, and she said the Russians rape women, so we should not stay around, which we had no intentions of staying around, no intention. </sentence><sentence id="4312">We just were mostly here to get back and find out finally, put all of the pieces of the puzzle together to see who survived and who... So, very soon, we started toward the railroad and we got on the trains going back east. </sentence><sentence id="4313">But that was easier said than done because everybody - people were so dislocated, and everybody wanted to get east, further east. </sentence><sentence id="4314">So, we were on the train for a few stops, then we got bumped off. </sentence><sentence id="4315">And then, there were Russian soldiers riding and all sorts of other people, and then we got on the train again. </sentence><sentence id="4316">We didn't know where we were going, but we were going east, wherever the train will take us, as far as Bibgost (ph). </sentence><sentence id="4317">Bibgost (ph) we knew was sort of a - what do you call it - a cross-, no, sort of a central line crossing. </sentence><sentence id="4318">We still didn't know - we thought we were going to Starachowice, of course. </sentence><sentence id="4319">We just said, "We'll make our way to Poland and from there, we'll worry about going to Starachowice." </sentence><sentence id="4320">But we met a Russian soldier who was Jewish on the train, and he told us, if we're Jewish, not to go back, because it's not safe in those small - he asked us how big a town it was, and we said, "Small town." </sentence><sentence id="4321">And he said, "Don't go back; go to a big city." </sentence><sentence id="4322">And we said, "Big city? </sentence><sentence id="4323">But we don't anybody." </sentence><sentence id="4324">He says, "No, you go to a big city, and you can register with the Jewish agents. </sentence><sentence id="4325">And that's where you can find family, not in a small town." </sentence><sentence id="4326">Which is what we did, we went to Lodz, and he gave us an address of his sister, so we stayed overnight, and then next day we went to register, and we were given a place - not an apartment. </sentence><sentence id="4327">It was a bombed-out place, but they assigned it to us, the Jewish agency. </sentence><sentence id="4328">And I think they gave us ration cards or something like that. </sentence><sentence id="4329">And soon enough, we found out that Uncle Alexander survived, that he was in Lodz. </sentence><sentence id="4330">And, of course, then we started finding out what happened, that all these people who were resettled [shakes head] were no longer alive, because they were exterminated. </sentence><sentence id="4331">They were not resettled. </sentence><sentence id="4332">And all the people that might not show up didn't necessarily get resettled either. </sentence><sentence id="4333">They died of a million different causes. </sentence><sentence id="4334">If it wasn't starvation, it was sickness. </sentence><sentence id="4335">If it wasn't sickness, it was a bullet. </sentence><sentence id="4336">But then it came out that there were extermination camps, which served only the purpose of killing en masse. </sentence><sentence id="4337">And that was something totally new. </sentence><sentence id="4338">We knew about shootings on the highway and on the road and starvation and typhus. </sentence><sentence id="4339">We knew; we saw it; we were part of it. </sentence><sentence id="4340">We never really - of course, in Auschwitz, we also knew about Auschwitz - but we had no idea about all these other places, where all this was happening at the same time. </sentence><sentence id="4341">So, the resettlement was a euphemism, and how the secrets were kept for all those years, when the Germans were committing the most heinous crime of all history, I don't know. </sentence><sentence id="4342">I don't know how that could altogether happen without people knowing, but that's how it happened. </sentence><sentence id="4343">And we settled in Lodz, you know, after the war. </sentence><sentence id="4344">And Hania and Chris went back to Poland, and I told you about Genia (ph), that maid of ours. </sentence><sentence id="4345">She absolutely said she had nothing, and she threatened them. </sentence><sentence id="4346">And Mrs.Paliszewska - that night, the little children that came back from Auschwitz were killed in my hometown. </sentence><sentence id="4347">And Mrs. Paliszewska - one of women of the Paliszewska sisters worked at the railroad station, she sold tickets there, and they lived very near the railroad station, so she secured tickets for them and put them on the train and they came back to Lodz. </sentence><sentence id="4348">So, that was where the end of the war found us. </sentence><sentence id="4349"> 2 </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="4400">Q: Did this feel - on the one hand, you were liberated and free, and on the other hand, you find a world of tragedy - so, are you very conflicted about what you find? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="4402"> A Well, we are really in shock still, because we survived, and we still cannot figure out how it happened that we did survive. </sentence><sentence id="4403">We are not yet aware of the entire truth of everything. </sentence><sentence id="4404">Grandmother - after all, we had a tremendous family, extended family, on my mother's side especially. </sentence><sentence id="4405">Originally, there were nine children - I don't mean children - nine siblings, who had all the kids and their kids, and my father's family wasn't so large, but it was large, too. </sentence><sentence id="4406">So, eventually, we pieced it all together to find out that people perished. </sentence><sentence id="4407">But it really took many years before the truth came out because, as you know, people were reluctant to talk about it. </sentence><sentence id="4408">Everybody was busy trying to live, to return to normal life, and nobody wanted - was willing to talk about Holocaust. </sentence><sentence id="4409">They just lived through it; why talk about it? </sentence><sentence id="4410">So that, not too many things were yet known, but we knew now for a fact that Mother had perished in Treblinka, because we knew that the transport out of Starachowice, after the original evacuation of the Jewish population, from the square where they were segregated, that those trains when straight to Treblinka. </sentence><sentence id="4411">So, we knew that. </sentence><sentence id="4412">Then we knew that a lot of people perished in Starachowice camp, and then they perished right along as we got along. </sentence><sentence id="4413">So, then, of course, it came out that there were such camps where slave labor was not required. </sentence><sentence id="4414">The ultimate purpose of that camp was genocide, and that only Jews were being selected for that genocide. </sentence><sentence id="4415">So, that was a total eye-opener. </sentence><sentence id="4416">But, you know, life went on. </sentence><sentence id="4417">Chris met Miles and they got married, and they sort of adopted me, so I stayed with them. </sentence><sentence id="4418">I went to school while we were living in Lodz. </sentence><sentence id="4419">Hania, Anna, went to school of diplomacy in Warsaw. </sentence><sentence id="4420">But we lived with Uncle Alexander - Miles, Chris, I and Uncle Alexander. </sentence><sentence id="4421">Uncle Alexander went to Sweden because his wife survived - she survived in one of the camps like Retzow - but she was shipped out to Sweden because she was quite ill at liberation time. </sentence><sentence id="4422">And that was - subsequently, Miles, Chris and I went to Berlin, and I went to school in Berlin. </sentence><sentence id="4423">And we were in Berlin from about March/April of "46 until January of "47, because we arrived in America February 11", in 1947. </sentence><sentence id="4424">So, that chapter was closed. </sentence><sentence id="4425">We more or less knew how our parents perished. </sentence><sentence id="4426">We also found out from people from Ostrowiec what happened to Grandma and the aunts. </sentence><sentence id="4427">I had two aunts living there. </sentence><sentence id="4428">One was single, and the other, Regina - another Regina - Aunt Regina, who was married, and Angia, who wasn't married - they lived with the grandmother because they ran a printing shop. </sentence><sentence id="4429">And so they went - Regina with her husband and Angia and Babka - and Grandma - they all were sent to Treblinka, as well, because Ostrowiec was slated for Treblinka. </sentence><sentence id="4430">And my father's family, only my cousin survived. </sentence><sentence id="4431">One aunt, I mean, Uncle Alexander survived with his wife, and then one of my father's sister's daughter, survived, and a cousin, Angia, who lives in Israel. </sentence><sentence id="4432">And the extended family numbered - I cannot begin to tell you because I wouldn't really know, but really, a very big number. </sentence><sentence id="4433">And we did have three uncles who escaped from Poland in the 20's. </sentence><sentence id="4434">Not escaped, but made their way out, because they were going to be conscripted. </sentence><sentence id="4435">So, they made their way out, and they lived in Canada, so we eventually got in touch with them. </sentence><sentence id="4436">But as far as the Holocaust story of our family is concerned, I mean, this is in essence not just a narrative covering our survival, the three of us, but really, the extended family, how that was decimated. </sentence><sentence id="4437">Unfortunately, you know? </sentence><sentence id="4438"> 3 It was such a fine family, you know, my mother's big family. </sentence><sentence id="4439">But unfortunately that's all gone. </sentence><sentence id="4440">We've made peace with that, you know? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="4480">Q: For those, for those people who are watching this, there is a five-hour audio tape of life after the Holocaust which I think will cover an enormous amount of these years, from 1945 on. </sentence><sentence id="4481">I have one final question to ask you, and I don't know if it's too big a question or too small a question. </sentence><sentence id="4482">Do you look back - When you look back on your life, on this period, do you find a particular effect it has had on you or set of effects. </sentence><sentence id="4483">And let me give you one example from your sister Chris, because I thought was very interesting. </sentence><sentence id="4484">Someone asked her why she only has two children, and she said, "Because I only have two hands. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="4490">And if something happens, I have to be able to hold onto each child, and if I had a third arm, I would have three children." </sentence><sentence id="4491">Which I found a very interesting kind of effect. </sentence><sentence id="4492">And I'm wondering if there is something in you in terms of your life, how you have led your life since, what you feel and how it's affected you...? </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="4493">A: No, you see, I mentioned before in the interview that I felt older people had a harder time in the camps, and I also think they had a harder time after the war, whether adjusting to a new language, a new country, a new culture, or whichever, or altogether, even if they went back to stay in Europe, adjusting to the emptiness, to the horror that was still in the soil, so to say, European soil. </sentence><sentence id="4494">In my case, I found that, because I had never lived and I always wanted to taste life, I had no time. </sentence><sentence id="4495">I had absolutely - I came out of the war like a racing horse coming out of a stable. </sentence><sentence id="4496">I was ready and willing and raring to go. </sentence><sentence id="4497">I wasn't going to look back and I wasn't going to contemplate and I wasn't going to analyze, I wanted to live. </sentence><sentence id="4498">And I did. </sentence><sentence id="4499">Everything, you know that - in fact, when I was in Jefferson High School, and Dr. Horowitz, who - they gave me a big party for my ig" birthday because I'd done this and that - so, he said he wanted the newspaper to write about the party, so he brings in people from the newspapers - the Jewish paper and the Post - the New York Post was in those days a different paper, liberal paper - so, this guy is interviewing me for the Post, and he says, "I understand you have a number. </sentence><sentence id="4500">Could you show me your number?" </sentence><sentence id="4501">So, I showed him the number, and he took a picture of my arm, and that's how the Post printed it - me and they wrote about the birthday party and how the whole class was throwing me a birthday party and that I was a victim. </sentence><sentence id="4502">So, when he said for me to show him the number, I thought, "Isn't that ridiculous." </sentence><sentence id="4503">But I didn't want to disappoint Dr. Horowitz, because it was in his house and he was doing the party. </sentence><sentence id="4504">I thought it was so ridiculous to start dwelling on those things. </sentence><sentence id="4505">I am just trying to show you by illustration how I felt. </sentence><sentence id="4506">I had no time for that. </sentence><sentence id="4507">That was a closed chapter. </sentence><sentence id="4508">Now, I didn't go to school yet, I didn't finish anything, I wanted to study, I wanted to do, I wanted to live, I wanted - I loved to dance. </sentence><sentence id="4509">Here I am going to go through the thing - ""d had enough of it! </sentence><sentence id="4510">And I really think a lot of people felt that way if they were yet young enough to more or less not to have the broken spirit because they had known already grown-up life, you see. </sentence><sentence id="4511">So, I just burst right into life in America. </sentence><sentence id="4512">In fact, I already had a great time in Berlin, when I was in Berlin. </sentence><sentence id="4513">But when I came to America, that was absolutely everything, because I mean, I could now do all of these things, including going to school and going to college and having a great time and marrying and having  4 wonderful children and all this. </sentence><sentence id="4514">Of course, now, because I have translated a lot of works on the Holocaust, I discovered - I have been discovering constantly new phases of the war that I was totally unaware of, because I didn't even want to dwell on it So, now, all these years later, 50 years later, I am first finding out about, okay, I knew about the Lodz ghetto, I wrote - I translated a book on this. </sentence><sentence id="4515">So, I knew about this ghetto and I did this camp and such camp, where there is true translation or true people I know. </sentence><sentence id="4516">But there is a whole world of Holocaust experiences that I never even knew about, which I am finding out about now. </sentence><sentence id="4517">But in those days, when I came to the United States, why would I want to bother with that? </sentence><sentence id="4518">Who had the time for that? </sentence><sentence id="4519">I didn't have time. </sentence><sentence id="4520">I didn't have time for anything, only for forging ahead. </sentence><sentence id="4521">And that, I think, carried me through life, in the sense that, if I look back, of course, I always, always think of my parents and the loss of my parents and the loss of my family, the tremendous loss of the family. </sentence><sentence id="4522">But to regret the life that was? </sentence><sentence id="4523">I cannot, because, if I went back now, that life would be nothing like the wonderful life that I had in America. </sentence><sentence id="4524">So, you cannot go home again, and I don't want to go home again, because I've been to Poland twice, and believe me, that would be the last place I would want to live in, under the Communist regime, especially, you know? </sentence><sentence id="4525">So that, to sum it all up, I was lucky enough to be young enough to survive the war as a youngster, and to still be able - even though at the beginning, I did feel a little imbalanced, you know, my head was a little bit further away - higher - not higher - more progressive - my head progressed a little better than my other emotional, but eventually, it evened out, you see? </sentence><sentence id="4526">And of course, I sort of apply the experiences to my life as it's lived from day to day. </sentence><sentence id="4527">For example, everyone said, "How much do your kids know about your background?" </sentence><sentence id="4528">My kids always knew everything they wanted to know. </sentence><sentence id="4529">They knew I went through the camps, and I told them all the time, "Please ask me. </sentence><sentence id="4530">I will never set you down and say, "Sit down and I want to tell you this."" </sentence><sentence id="4531">I never did that. </sentence><sentence id="4532">That was never - I said, "But if you want to know, anything you want to know, I will tell you." </sentence><sentence id="4533">And every now and then I would relay an anecdote, and of course, they saw the films, and we're very close - our family generally, you know, our family - the Lermans and the Wilsons and the kids and the grandkids - we're very, very close. </sentence><sentence id="4534">So you know, the stories are exchanged, but not as an imposition. </sentence><sentence id="4535">I would never think of saying, "You've got to hear my story." </sentence><sentence id="4536">I myself wasn't interested in my story when the war ended. </sentence><sentence id="4537">I just wanted to say, "Okay, that's another chapter, case closed, keep on going." </sentence><sentence id="4538">So, that was my attitude and still is. </sentence><sentence id="4539">And, as you noticed, I am very short on specifics. </sentence><sentence id="4540">For example, my sister Anna, she knows a lot of specifics about the hierarchy of the camps and who was what and how the camps were run. </sentence><sentence id="4541">I don't know. </sentence><sentence id="4542">I just know the particulars pertaining to my personal survival. </sentence><sentence id="4543">And the fact that, when the war ended, everything was fresh in my mind, but I wasn't interested. </sentence><sentence id="4544">I wasn't interested in me, period. </sentence><sentence id="4545">I was interested in the new life, and the me could wait. </sentence><sentence id="4546">And of course, it waited until now, when every day I am finding out about another thing that I never knew about. </sentence><sentence id="4547">So, the other day I read in the Polish press about Dietwagner (ph), this Polish community not far from Warsaw. </sentence><sentence id="4548">Now, 60 years later, I am first, first finding out. </sentence><sentence id="4549">Now I read avidly, whether it's in Polish or in English, on the subject. </sentence><sentence id="4550">But in those years, it wasn't taboo. </sentence><sentence id="4551">When I married Victor I told him, "Anything you want to know, ask me. </sentence><sentence id="4552">But I don't have patience nor the time for that." </sentence><sentence id="4553">There were other intellectual pursuits and other pursuits. </sentence><sentence id="4554">I had to fit in all these  5 other things that I missed. </sentence><sentence id="4555">I'm going to talk about Auschwitz and about Ravensbriick? </sentence></p><p><sentence id="4556">Who needs it? </sentence></p><p><sentence id="4557"> End of Tape #10  6
