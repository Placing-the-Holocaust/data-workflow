<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3799">A: And they were looking for me, so he smuggled a note out, and it reached us, also by a miracle of God, because that was so much work, he couldn't send

</sentence><sentence id="3801">And sometimes by the -- by the Communists they were killed. </sentence><sentence id="3802">Those adulterators, they helped the Germans. </sentence><sentence

searching, and underground did that -- man delivered it to the underground, and they found Ab, the other leader. </sentence><sentence id="3805">And then it said, "Empty the P.O. box, and don't use it any more," because he had a key, and he would be afraid that he will be tortured, and if the other kept on sending, that would be heavy for him, with his hearing. </sentence><sentence id="3806">And he said, "And let Diet take another name, they know now her false name." </sentence><sentence id="3807">So then they were looking twice for me, my real name, and this name. </sentence><sentence

Paramibo is the capital, and that's Dutch territory, and they can't check that, there was no mail there, they were free. </sentence><sentence id="3818">So -- and then he said, "What job?" </sentence><sentence id="3819">And that was a problem, because I couldn't say secretary, because if they said where do you work, there was no Willie Laarman, I couldn't say nurse, I couldn't say teacher. </sentence><sentence id="3820">So I said maid. </sentence><sentence id="3821">And there was an elderly couple in there, had said, "We would love to help, but we don't know how, we are so old." </sentence><sentence id="3822">So I went to them, I said, "Now you can help. </sentence><sentence id="3823">If I am arrested, you vouch that I am your maid." </sentence><sentence id="3824">And they said okay. </sentence><sentence id="3825">So I was the maid Willie Laarman. </sentence><sentence id="3826">And then I had all that stuff from the -- from the thing on my -- in an envelope in my

in May deg44, they had -- were a whole year looking for me already, and the Gestapo still coming to our house, so they had never given up. </sentence><sentence id="3827">And then it turned out -- and that was so terrible, because normally if they thought you help Jews they came four or five times, and then they thought -- there were so many, then they gave up, but they never gave up. </sentence><sentence id="3828">And we had a spy in the headquarters of the Gestapo that was -- and he worked for us, and he looked in our files, and he found out that Mies had kept a diary, and they had found that diary, and in it said Toos brought 27 ration cards. </sentence><sentence id="3829">Toos brought 27 I.D.s. </sentence><sentence id="3830">Toos -- and Hein had been there also, but not so often because he was in other parts. </sentence><sentence id="3831">And he had given the name Dick. </sentence><sentence id="3832">Dick did this, Dick -- so they were looking for Toos and Dick that they knew were doing the robberies, or part of the robberies. </sentence><sentence id="3833">And that Jewish deal wasn't even important for them, they wanted that, that's why they never gave up for two years. </sentence><sentence id="3834">So we knew that they knew everything about us. </sentence><sentence id="3835">But they didn't know who Toos was. </sentence><sentence id="3836">And then I found out that that Bram had been there, and Bram had been, not too long before that married, and his bride was crying his ide -- her eyes out. </sentence><sentence id="3837">And later I heard that she paid the Gestapo 5000 guilders. </sentence><sentence id="3838">And they told him, you go to Germany, and your bride is crying at home. </sentence><sentence id="3839">And then, I have no proof, but he was the only one who knew who the phone number was, so he gave the phone number to the Gestapo, and he was freed soon after that. </sentence><sentence id="3840">But I've never seen him, and I -- I don't know, the guy started out good, that he wanted to help Jews, so I didn't want to make a big fuss out of that. </sentence><sentence id="3841">And I don't know if it's in the book, he's now -- I heard that he died. </sentence><sentence id="3842">I checked later out, and I didn't want to go there, because I thought if he knows what that mentioning of that phone, for -- had for results, he would live this terrible remorse or something, so I've never made any. </sentence><sentence id="3843">But he was the only one who knew my phone number. </sentence></p></dialogue>

</sentence><sentence id="4998">And then they were fed terrific by those Dutch guys, and Philips makes radios, there was no TV yet, so the Germans couldn't constantly watch, so those prisoners who worked there, they loved it, they got food from the Dutch, and if any of the German was gone, they put the BBC on, so they heard all the latest news. </sentence><sentence id="4999">And they told it in the camps, so that dentist knew all the latest news. </sentence><sentence id="5000">So it was my turn, and he starts drilling, and he said, "Would you like to know the latest news?" </sentence><sentence id="5001">I said, "Yes, please." </sentence><sentence id="5002">So he told me they were marching up at Italy, and it was going so good for us, so there was hope, you know. </sentence><sentence id="5003">And then when my turn was over -- he did the temporarily filling in it, so I had to sit back on that bench, and the next one -- but that German had to watch us, but also the dentist and the patient, so he was slowly walking up and down, and up and down. </sentence><sentence id="5004">And I was sitting at the corner, and here was a door. </sentence><sentence id="5005">And the door started slamming. </sentence><sentence id="5006">And that's such an irritating noise, so I closed it [indecipherable] and a moment later it was slamming again, and I thought, that is not coincident, so I kept my eye on it, and when the German had gone this, and was with his back to door -- the door opens a little slight, and a hand came up, so high piled with bread, much nicer bread than we had outside. </sentence><sentence id="5007">And was margarine on it. </sentence><sentence id="5008">So I grabbed it, but the German could come back, so what do you do? </sentence><sentence id="5009">I gave all the girls one, and was no time to eat, so it goes here, that's where you stuff everything. </sentence><sentence id="5010">And then the German walked again, and the hand came again, and we went in [indecipherable] and we went back to the barrack [indecipherable] down, and it was really funny. </sentence><sentence id="5011">And we knew the news. </sentence><sentence id="5012">So the next time -- the temporary, he did that three or four times, and then he said, "Now I have to put a real one in." </sentence><sentence id="5013">And I was so sorry, I thought no news, no bread, because we shared it with those eight girls, especially w-we thought were going to die. </sentence></p></dialogue>

blessed [indecipherable] Jesus. </sentence><sentence id="5127">So when I thought of that, because I knew the Bible from that -- I thought, oh that's God permission, so I said, oh let -- okay lord, I consider that I have your permission to lie, and now give me a good story. </sentence><sentence id="5128">And for months I was praying if they had interrogated me then, I wouldn't know what to say. </sentence><sentence id="5129">But every day I'd work on that story when I went to bed. </sentence><sentence id="5130">And I was born -- I thought, as little ballast as you can have. </sentence><sentence id="5131">So you have a father, no he has died. </sentence><sentence id="5132">You have a mother? </sentence><sentence id="5133">She has died. </sentence><sentence id="5134">No

</sentence><sentence id="5136">So it was really a matter of life and death. </sentence><sentence id="5137">And just when this all happened, I had my story ready, but I was repeating it every night, you know, because sometimes they shook you up at two in the night, and you had the hearing that -- in your sleep, or half asleep you may say the wrong thing. </sentence><sentence id="5138">And Freddy saw that I was called out for my hearing, and she knew that was life or death for everybody, except for this Hanny Janssen, and the officer from the Gestapo came for the hearing, had to sign me out. </sentence><sentence id="5139">And she pretended that she had diarrhea, and she stormed from her twine making, past me, and while he was signing me out she whispered in my ear. </sentence><sentence id="5140">I'm going to storm the gates of heaven for you. </sentence><sentence id="5141">And you know, me -- I say to friends, I'1l pray for you, but this was so much stronger, I don't know if you know that story -- the gay guard at -- that comic, you know, you see him with a ram going. </sentence><sentence id="5142">And you know something, another second miracle happened apart from the rain coat. </sentence><sentence id="5143">I walked out with that man, and we had to walk maybe eight minutes, or 10 minutes to the main building of the hearings. </sentence><sentence id="5144">And because I knew the Bible, and I was bombarded with God's promises. </sentence><sentence id="5145">And one of them is, not a har -- hair of your head will be harmed without the will of your heavenly father. </sentence><sentence id="5146">So they couldn't even touch a hair of my head without Him. </sentence><sentence id="5147">And the second one is something that you don't need every time, but it said also, do not fear be -- if you have to appear before authorities and kings, I will give you the words. </sentence><sentence id="5148">God promised me. </sentence><sentence id="5149">And I said, okay Lord -- like Tevye on this "Fiddler on the Roof," you know, he was always talking to God, I said, "I have broken many promises, but this is a promise, and I hold you to your word. </sentence><sentence id="5150">But you just have to give me the words." </sentence><sentence id="5151">And I walked in that building, and in that room, and there were a whole bunch of Nazi -- very high Nazis sitting behind the table, S.S."s. </sentence><sentence id="5152">I knew their ranks, and I saw their medals. </sentence><sentence id="5153">I think about seven at a green table. </sentence><sentence id="5154">And I told you about the bad food we had, one slice of bread in the morning, one in the evening, and that was [indecipherable], then the line leaves. </sentence><sentence id="5155">But once a month we got a package from the Red Cross, and that has a sandwich, and that had a little bit of toilet paper, and it had a square inch of pure lard. </sentence><sentence id="5156">And they had put some soy sauce in, so we scrape every day a bit of that. </sentence><sentence id="5157">But because of that bad food, we had all gotten phlegmones, I don't know if you know what that -- people in the first World War in the ditches in Belgium and France had it. </sentence><sentence id="5158">It started as an itch, and then you got hives, and then they became so big like strawberries, and you always had them in your face. </sentence><sentence id="5159">And your whole face was out of shape, and in the end your skin couldn't hold it any more, and it burst open, and green pus was dripping down. </sentence><sentence id="5160">And we all had that on our faces, most of us, and it was terrible. </sentence><sentence id="5161">And then it was the fifth month, I've never had shampoo, so can you imagine your hair greasy, just cold water, no towels. </sentence><sentence id="5162">And we looked a mess, and we have no mirrors, but you saw how the others -- so there I was sitting with those seven

in those months, and I'd never said one gerd of German, one word. </sentence><sentence id="5170">So I said, "TI don't know what you're saying." </sentence><sentence id="5171">So they called the translator, and he had to sit there, then they asked him the questions, but I knew it already, and then me, so it gave me twice the time to think. </sentence><sentence id="5172">And then in the end, the leader -- he had the highest rank, and he was in his 50's, and he said, "I have done nothing in my life but hearings, and I have developed a sixth sense," he says, "and I can't," -- and I was so
