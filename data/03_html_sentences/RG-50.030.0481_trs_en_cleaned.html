<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="395">A: Now, we went to church, and our denomination, Christian Reformed has two services, but my parents said one time we want you to go, the second time, you may. </sentence><sentence id="396">So there was no to force like some parents do. </sentence><sentence id="397">And they always, you know, you went to catechism, and you learned the Bible, and it was really a life thing, you know, and you had to -- and I still think, I mean words are cheap, but then you have to do, and that's why I went -- we all went in Rothenberg, and I'm really proud because after the war, years later, I had to go -- in the Netherlands after the war, the queen made a new department, like you have here, agriculture, and to -- now whatever, all the departments. </sentence><sentence id="398">And our queen said we have a department of war documentation. </sentence><sentence id="399">And usually th-they still were looking for witnesses, and by chance they found me in America, and I could help a little bit, so I was asked to come to the Netherlands, and I spoke to the big shot from this war documentation, and he told me that our denomination, Christian Reformed, and it's really small, were the highest in resistance, and also had given most of their lives. </sentence><sentence id="400">And I think we are very principled. </sentence><sentence id="401">And sometimes it goes to the -- too stiff, you know, that -- but that you have to want. </sentence><sentence id="402">But it was really [indecipherable] </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1966">A: Yeah, and he was -- we -- we were discussing what can we do, but till that time, really, the only thing we felt is spread the ne -- noi -- news of the BBC. </sentence><sentence id="1967">But then, when they started on our Jews, n -- we knew was more important stuff to do. </sentence><sentence id="1968">We still did that, but when we hid the Jews -- but then, it became difficult because an -- at the same time, because the Germans were occupying all Europe, and they had also drafted the women, they might be the first. </sentence><sentence id="1969">But in Germany itself were only very old people, and very young people. </sentence><sentence id="1970">And the war industry was going full blast, and the fields need to be worked, and there were no of that age group. </sentence><sentence id="1971">So then, in all the occupied countries, you might have heard that in Norway, and in France probably too, but was always a handsome young man, with beautiful white teeth, blonde hair, big, blue eyes, come to Germany, terrific pay. </sentence><sentence id="1972">And that was on the walls, and in the papers everywhere. </sentence><sentence id="1973">And there was a lot of unemployment, but we didn't want to go to Germany. </sentence><sentence id="1974">And then, at the same time, that was when they started on the Jewish people, and because the people didn't go to Germany, because we didn't want to go to the country where -- a few will always go, for money, you know, but that's a small percentage. </sentence><sentence id="1975">And then they got mad, and they said okay, you didn't come when we invited you, now it's forced labor. </sentence><sentence id="1976">And every male between 16 and 45 had to go, except from the Catholic church, a priest, and from the Protestant church, the pastors, and some teachers didn't have to go, but a bunch had to go, because what they did, the people didn't go, and then they surrounded, for instance, a high school. </sentence><sentence id="1977">Now, there are always boys of 16 - 17. </sentence><sentence id="1978">So they went in the morning happily to school and never came home, they were sent to Germany. </sentence><sentence id="1979">And the universities were all in that age group, so they were surrounded, and we had many Jewish professors, they have brains, and they were very beloved, and they were kicked out of their jobs, they weren't allowed to have their jobs any more, so their students went on strike, and all -- they were -- so all the students, if they were -- they surrounded the university, and they were -- so then everything closed. </sentence><sentence id="1980">And so only girls went to school, and the university were closed, also out of protest, strike. </sentence><sentence id="1981">So some of the teachers had to go to -- and then they still didn't want to go, so a lot -- just think that in America, every male between 16 and 45 has to go in hiding, and that's what happened. </sentence><sentence id="1982">And they went in hiding, but a small group didn't know where to go, mostly somewhere in your circle of family or friends, there is somebody where you can go and hide. </sentence><sentence id="1983">But those guys couldn't come in the street any more, because you didn't know if you saw a young man or a woman that they were Gestapo, so they were -- they really had to go in hiding. </sentence><sentence id="1984">But the thing was, because nobody went to Germany to work there, in the fields -- there was hunger in Germany, and they loaded in all the countries the trains full, and the food went all to Germany, and we had very little. </sentence><sentence id="1985">So they started a ration system with coupons, I have some in my -- you probably have seen them. </sentence><sentence id="1986">But anyway -- but the only way you got the coupons, and they lasted a month -- it was about a card this size, and it was so little, a German guy with an appetite wouldn't even have anything to eat. </sentence><sentence id="1987">And it was very little, but you only got it when you went to those offices. </sentence><sentence id="1988">And there were Dutch people working but the supervision all was kicked out, and all replaced by Germans. </sentence><sentence id="1989">And you only got your new card -- your new sou -- coupons if you showed your I.D. So those young men between 16 and 45 never could get coupons again. </sentence><sentence id="1990">And the farmers, because you know in [indecipherable] they helped their own group, they did not help others, really, only the dental family -- the dentist family. </sentence><sentence id="1991">But many, Corrie ten Boom, were hiding Jewish people, and many groups were hiding, many. </sentence><sentence id="1992">Catholics, and Protestants, and Communists, everybody. </sentence><sentence id="1993">So, but those guys -- the farmers had already -- who dared to, had taken Jews, but then we had to go to villages and cities and say, will you take a Dutch guy. </sentence><sentence id="1994">And that was considered less dangerous than taking a Jewish person. </sentence><sentence id="1995">But they told us we can't, because we know they don't get ration cards, and my own kid is asking for another slice of bread we can't give him, and a potato. </sentence><sentence id="1996">We can't feed an extra mouth. </sentence><sentence id="1997">If you don't have ration cards, then they don't get it. </sentence><sentence id="1998">And then from some other group, you know, at that time -- now people travel, but at that time, if a farmer and his wife lived here, and they had two sons, then they got farms close by. </sentence><sentence id="1999">They all stayed close by. </sentence><sentence id="2000">And nobody traveled, and all the mail they got might have been a bank statement, and a per -- something of their church, but they didn't get any other mail. </sentence><sentence id="2001">And here we also made a big mistake, we put a father and mother here, and a son there, and a daughter there, and they started writing each other. </sentence><sentence id="2002">And that was for the mailman who delivered it, and the second letter, or the third letter, you have somebody here? </sentence><sentence id="2003">And that was suspicious. </sentence><sentence id="2004">And then, this was big news, there was no television at that time, the radio was va -- so Farmer so and so gets all the time mail, so then they maybe think, do you have somebody, you get all the time mail, I hear from the mailman. </sentence><sentence id="2005">So they got scared, and some were arrested, farmers, and they have -- </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2048">Q: Some of the farmers were arrested? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2050">A: Yeah, because they had also a side -- see they -- we had such a well registered country, every family in every village, in wherever you lived, had a card system in every town hall. </sentence><sentence id="2051">And if a baby was born, the father had to go to the town hall, and say there's a new baby, this name and that and that, and that went in a card system. </sentence><sentence id="2052">And if somebody died, you had to go, a card was taken out. </sentence><sentence id="2053">If a whole family moved to another city, that -- you had to report it, and the whole -- but that card system, at that time -- now they can't do it any more, but everything was on it. </sentence><sentence id="2054">Your faith, your religion, your job, your whatever you were, your age. </sentence><sentence id="2055">So they had all the Jewish fing -- on their fingertips, that they knew exactly how many Jews we had. </sentence><sentence id="2056">And of course, then they saw that they were not showing up in the amount they had to show up, so they got mad. </sentence><sentence id="2057">And everywhere, like -- with -- for the labor, there were signs, if you help a Jew, you -- you will be treated as a Jew. </sentence><sentence id="2058">So then the farmers -- and some were betrayed because of the mail, and they got scared, because the I.D.s, the identification cards that we all had to have the end of 44, the beginning of deg41, that had a big, fat, black J printed on it, too. </sentence><sentence id="2059">And they had gone to the farms with this thing, and then the farmers came to us, and they said, Diet -- or, I had fal - - the false name then, "Diet, can you get us I.D.s without a J, be -- if there ever is a raid on our farm, that we can say, we didn't know they were Jewish, we thought they were city people who were hungry, came here for being -- for better food." </sentence><sentence id="2060">And then the people in the city said, "We will take the Dutch guys if you had ration cards." </sentence><sentence id="2061">And then we were in a bind, because you know, by that time, I think we had hidden about 80 Jewish people all over. </sentence><sentence id="2062">And this -- the farmers were scared. </sentence><sentence id="2063">We got together, we were a real small group, and we knew all each other from long ago, and we were a Christian group, and we went on our knees, and we prayed to God, and we had -- Lord, we can't just now say good luck and find your own way. </sentence><sentence id="2064">We have to go on, but now we don't know what to do any more. </sentence><sentence id="2065">And I remember I always was jealous of Moses, he got a manna from he -- and he got water from the rock, but the heavens did not open, and we did not get a whole bunch of cards. </sentence><sentence id="2066">And then the only way to get it was to take it, because, you know, there was no other way out, and it was really life and death for those people. </sentence><sentence id="2067">So then, after praying, it became clear to us, we had to do a robbery on the German offices. </sentence><sentence id="2068">Until that time, if you treated -- helped a Jew, you were treated as a Jew, but if you did a robbery on the German office, that was the death penalty. </sentence><sentence id="2069">And when I speak for high schools, or universities, I always say when I say this, "This is not advice kids," I said, "but if you do an ar -- a robbery, you better have arms, and revolvers." </sentence><sentence id="2070">And th-the British had, over our lakes, dumped at night, you know, big containers full of -- we had weapons, the resistance, but having a weapon was the death penalty. </sentence><sentence id="2071">So then it really became dangerous, and there were a few brave guys that were called the knockploegs, k- n-o-c-k ploeg. </sentence><sentence id="2072">And they volunteered to do that, every month again. </sentence><sentence id="2073">And we found always a village, or a somewhere, where we knew somebody was working, sa -- a Dutch person was good, and that we can make a dra -- a drawing, where are the guards [indecipherable] a guard, how many, is -- how is it locked, you know, that they had to shoot it open. </sentence><sentence id="2074">But that -- before they went in, that they knew the whole situation. </sentence><sentence id="2075">And then before -- </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="3427"> Alie, and we were alone on that country road, and there was nothing, only those beautiful trees that are in the distance. </sentence><sentence id="3428">And I heard clearly a voice, and I s -- can't explain it. </sentence><sentence id="3429">And that voice said in Dutch to me, Kijk nog mar goed naar hem. </sentence><sentence id="3430">That's in English, have a good look at him. </sentence><sentence id="3431">And I thought this is ridiculous, that is a thought that comes in my head, but I heard it again, twice. </sentence><sentence id="3432">And then I started looking at him, and he was far over six feet, so I [indecipherable] and I looked up, and he started laughing. </sentence><sentence id="3433">He said, "What are you staring at me?" </sentence><sentence id="3434">And I didn't dare to tell him, and I said, "Nothing." </sentence><sentence id="3435">And he brought me to the farm, and that was the last time I saw him. </sentence><sentence id="3436">And three days later he was in Friesland, and he was inspected in the train like many people, but men especially. </sentence><sentence id="3437">And they saw that he was a pastor, so he was safe. </sentence><sentence id="3438">But then they searched him, and they found a lot of stuff what he had there. </sentence><sentence id="3439">So he was put in a prison. </sentence><sentence id="3440">But we felt -- and I -- you saw those coupons, and those I.D.s, those identification cards. </sentence><sentence id="3441">And when we stole them, if that was found in a large quantity, you got shot. </sentence><sentence id="3442">I mean, that was the end of your life. </sentence><sentence id="3443">So we felt, all the farmers, and the people who gave us a bed, were already ru-running a risk. </sentence><sentence id="3444">It could be that three in the night there's the doorbell, and they look for us. </sentence><sentence id="3445">So we always had to find a way out, in the back door or through a window, but you know where we would go. </sentence><sentence id="3446">But we did not want to bring all this danger stuff in those homes, because it could be that I could get out, but that the papers stayed there, and that the people would be shot. </sentence><sentence id="3447">So we had rented a P.O. box somewhere, and Hein smuggled a note out, because we wrote each other, and then we gave the letters to others, and keep them till after the war. </sentence><sentence id="3448">But the last letter we always kept, it was kind of, you know, close to our heart. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3472">Q: You mean, you -- you -- you kept the last one before you got the next one? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3474">A: Yeah, before the next. </sentence><sentence id="3475">And so he had my fath -- last letter, with my false name. </sentence><sentence id="3476">And they found that, and they started looking for me. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3480">Q: And which false name was that? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3482">A: That was Dineke de Jong. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3484">Q: Uh-huh. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3486">A: And they were looking for me, so he smuggled a note out, and it reached us, also by a miracle of God, because that was so much work, he couldn't send it straight, and he had to trust a guard, it was a Dutch guy. </sentence><sentence id="3487">And the underground hated the Dutch people, especially the police who stayed and worked for the Germans. </sentence><sentence id="3488">And sometimes by the -- by the Communists they were killed. </sentence><sentence id="3489">Those adulterators, they helped the Germans. </sentence><sentence id="3490">But this guy had stayed to help. </sentence><sentence id="3491">And for some reason or another, that Hein smuggled that note out via this guy, and i -- it came via, via, via, through lots of searching, and underground did that -- man delivered it to the underground, and they found Ab, the other leader. </sentence><sentence id="3492">And then it said, "Empty the P.O. box, and don't use it any more," because he had a key, and he would be afraid that he will be tortured, and if the other kept on sending, that would be heavy for him, with his hearing. </sentence><sentence id="3493">And he said, "And let Diet take another name, they know now her false name." </sentence><sentence id="3494">So then they were looking twice for me, my real name, and this name. </sentence><sentence id="3495">So it was getting -- the net was getting closer. </sentence><sentence id="3496">And then he said, And let her warn all the guys, and then bring the documents from the -- from the thing to The Hague, and he mentioned a nickname that we called this guy. </sentence><sentence id="3497">And so I knew what he meant. </sentence><sentence id="3498">So I got my other pe -- identification card again, and then the man asked me what name do you want to have now, because he had made so many. </sentence><sentence id="3499">So I says, "Well, the name of our queen, Wilhemina," and then I just heard the name Laarman -- Laarman. </sentence><sentence id="3500">And then he said, "Where do you want to be born?" </sentence><sentence id="3501">And there was no time to put one in that town hall anywhere, and then you had to smudge it. </sentence><sentence id="3502">I says well, make it Surinam, Paramibo is the capital, and that's Dutch territory, and they can't check that, there was no mail there, they were free. </sentence><sentence id="3503">So -- and then he said, "What job?" </sentence><sentence id="3504">And that was a problem, because I couldn't say secretary, because if they said where do you work, there was no Willie Laarman, I couldn't say nurse, I couldn't say teacher. </sentence><sentence id="3505">So I said maid. </sentence><sentence id="3506">And there was an elderly couple in there, had said, "We would love to help, but we don't know how, we are so old." </sentence><sentence id="3507">So I went to them, I said, "Now you can help. </sentence><sentence id="3508">If I am arrested, you vouch that I am your maid." </sentence><sentence id="3509">And they said okay. </sentence><sentence id="3510">So I was the maid Willie Laarman. </sentence><sentence id="3511">And then I had all that stuff from the -- from the thing on my -- in an envelope in my blouse, and I had warned all the guys, and I had lunch with one of them, in Zwijndrecht, and then I had to go to The Hague, and that was a short trip, only one stop in Rotterdam, and they -- this was in May deg44, they had -- were a whole year looking for me already, and the Gestapo still coming to our house, so they had never given up. </sentence><sentence id="3512">And then it turned out -- and that was so terrible, because normally if they thought you help Jews they came four or five times, and then they thought -- there were so many, then they gave up, but they never gave up. </sentence><sentence id="3513">And we had a spy in the headquarters of the Gestapo that was -- and he worked for us, and he looked in our files, and he found out that Mies had kept a diary, and they had found that diary, and in it said Toos brought 27 ration cards. </sentence><sentence id="3514">Toos brought 27 I.D.s. </sentence><sentence id="3515">Toos -- and Hein had been there also, but not so often because he was in other parts. </sentence><sentence id="3516">And he had given the name Dick. </sentence><sentence id="3517">Dick did this, Dick -- so they were looking for Toos and Dick that they knew were doing the robberies, or part of the robberies. </sentence><sentence id="3518">And that Jewish deal wasn't even important for them, they wanted that, that's why they never gave up for two years. </sentence><sentence id="3519">So we knew that they knew everything about us. </sentence><sentence id="3520">But they didn't know who Toos was. </sentence><sentence id="3521">And then I found out that that Bram had been there, and Bram had been, not too long before that married, and his bride was crying his ide -- her eyes out. </sentence><sentence id="3522">And later I heard that she paid the Gestapo 5000 guilders. </sentence><sentence id="3523">And they told him, you go to Germany, and your bride is crying at home. </sentence><sentence id="3524">And then, I have no proof, but he was the only one who knew who the phone number was, so he gave the phone number to the Gestapo, and he was freed soon after that. </sentence><sentence id="3525">But I've never seen him, and I -- I don't know, the guy started out good, that he wanted to help Jews, so I didn't want to make a big fuss out of that. </sentence><sentence id="3526">And I don't know if it's in the book, he's now -- I heard that he died. </sentence><sentence id="3527">I checked later out, and I didn't want to go there, because I thought if he knows what that mentioning of that phone, for -- had for results, he would live this terrible remorse or something, so I've never made any. </sentence><sentence id="3528">But he was the only one who knew my phone number. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3573">Q: Diet, let me ask you a question. </sentence><sentence id="3574">If the Gestapo went to your parent's house, did they say, give us pi -- a photograph? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3577">A: No. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3579">Q: They didn't. </sentence><sentence id="3580">They never asked for it. </sentence><sentence id="3581">So they had no idea what you actually looked like? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3585">A: I don't think so, unless that there was anything in the town hall. </sentence><sentence id="3586">But they had no idea, so that is a lucky. </sentence><sentence id="3587">But I had changed my hairdo, and I did different color glasses, you know, frames, so when they were after me, I always, for the new I.D. -- </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3591">Q: Looked different. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3593">A: I looked a bit different. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3595">Q: Cause that just struck me, that if they came to your house -- </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3597">A: No, no, I was thinking, now, in this time, from DNA, and from every -- I wouldn't have a chance. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3601">A: I wouldn't have a chance, not a chance. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3603">Q: Well, only if they found you, and could check. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3605">A: No, but I think they would much easier find me. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3607">Q: Find you. </sentence><sentence id="3608">Maybe so. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3611">A: And with the TV, and with all the -- you know, that they ask for in this guy, and the 10 most wanted, and whatever. </sentence><sentence id="3612">No, I think it's -- it's a miracle. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3615">Q: Right. </sentence><sentence id="3616">So, you're under the name Willie. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3619">A: Willie Laarman. </sentence><sentence id="3620">And then I said in the train -- and there was so little fuel, before they went every how -- hour, and now they went a few times a day. </sentence><sentence id="3621">And the train was nearly empty, so I knew I would have to wait a long time, so I had a book, and I had a window seat, and I start reading. </sentence><sentence id="3622">And I still remember the title of the book, Toen De Herten Riepen, "When the deer called out." </sentence><sentence id="3623">And anyway -- </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3629">Q: When the deer called? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3631">A: When -- yeah, th-that -- in the woods, you know. </sentence><sentence id="3632">Anyway, I was reading that, and then slowly the train filled, and after maybe an hour and a quarter, it start slowly going, and I look out of the window, and I felt my heart stop. </sentence><sentence id="3633">Six gest -- the trains had those steps then, you know, and six guys stepped on that, opened the doors, Gestapo. </sentence><sentence id="3634">Four in uniform, and two in civil, but they had the insignia that I knew that was German Nazi. </sentence><sentence id="3635">And then -- several of my group had been arrested, and one got out by pretending he was a black marketeer. </sentence><sentence id="3636">Then they gave you a sentence, but everybody wants to make a buck, and that was not so serious resistance, and he had gotten out. </sentence><sentence id="3637">And he had told us, if you ever are arrested, don't show how scared you are, don't show it, they get their kicks out of the [indecipherable]. </sentence><sentence id="3638">So how -- don't -- he gave us that advice. </sentence><sentence id="3639">So I thought, I'll stay quiet, stay quiet, and then I thought the headquarters of the Gestapo is in The Hague, and this train is going there, maybe they just have to report, I don't get nervous. </sentence><sentence id="3640">And then they split out, six wagons, six guys, and they started inspecting everybody's I.D. And I had a real one from the last robbery, but still, you know, and all this stuff here, and they were a year long coming to my parent's house. </sentence><sentence id="3641">I was scared stiff. </sentence><sentence id="3642">Oh, I was so scared. </sentence><sentence id="3643">And -- but I wasn't allowed to show it. </sentence><sentence id="3644">So -- but the interesting thing was he started, and he takes an I.D., and he looks and gives it back. </sentence><sentence id="3645">And it went so fast, and then he came to me. </sentence><sentence id="3646">And my heart was pounding. </sentence></p></dialogue>

</sentence><sentence id="4601">And then they were fed terrific by those Dutch guys, and Philips makes radios, there was no TV yet, so the Germans couldn't constantly watch, so those prisoners who worked there, they loved it, they got food from the Dutch, and if any of the German was gone, they put the BBC on, so they heard all the latest news. </sentence><sentence id="4602">And they told it in the camps, so that dentist knew all the latest news. </sentence><sentence id="4603">So it was my turn, and he starts drilling, and he said, "Would you like to know the latest news?" </sentence><sentence id="4604">I said, "Yes, please." </sentence><sentence id="4605">So he told me they were marching up at Italy, and it was going so good for us, so there was hope, you know. </sentence><sentence id="4606">And then when my turn was over -- he did the temporarily filling in it, so I had to sit back on that bench, and the next one -- but that German had to watch us, but also the dentist and the patient, so he was slowly walking up and down, and up and down. </sentence><sentence id="4607">And I was sitting at the corner, and here was a door. </sentence><sentence id="4608">And the door started slamming. </sentence><sentence id="4609">And that's such an irritating noise, so I closed it [indecipherable] and a moment later it was slamming again, and I thought, that is not coincident, so I kept my eye on it, and when the German had gone this, and was with his back to door -- the door opens a little slight, and a hand came up, so high piled with bread, much nicer bread than we had outside. </sentence><sentence id="4610">And was margarine on it. </sentence><sentence id="4611">So I grabbed it, but the German could come back, so what do you do? </sentence><sentence id="4612">I gave all the girls one, and was no time to eat, so it goes here, that's where you stuff everything. </sentence><sentence id="4613">And then the German walked again, and the hand came again, and we went in [indecipherable] and we went back to the barrack [indecipherable] down, and it was really funny. </sentence><sentence id="4614">And we knew the news. </sentence><sentence id="4615">So the next time -- the temporary, he did that three or four times, and then he said, "Now I have to put a real one in." </sentence><sentence id="4616">And I was so sorry, I thought no news, no bread, because we shared it with those eight girls, especially w-we thought were going to die. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="4669">Q: Right. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="4671">A: And I was so sad, and he says to me, "But I can drill a hole in a good one," and he said, "T won't touch a nerve." </sentence><sentence id="4672">I said, "Yes, please." </sentence><sentence id="4673">And he did several of my good ones, and I was there for weeks. </sentence><sentence id="4674">And you won't believe this -- so then in the end, I think that he was -- and we heard heavy artillery in the distance, and that was your general -- we didn't know it was, but we knew they were our friends the liberators. </sentence><sentence id="4675">And the Nazis got terrible nervous, and these were our friends, and they didn't want anybody of this camp ever to be liberated. </sentence><sentence id="4676">And then they started, every sunset my barrack was right on the edge of the camp, and there was water, and they said there was electricity so you can't escape, and they said there is a mine field. </sentence><sentence id="4677">And then you had that fence with the towers and machine guns, and then there were the woods. </sentence><sentence id="4678">And the machine guns were every time at sunset, and it was in the woods close by that we could hear it. </sentence><sentence id="4679">And one day I'm doing the laundry, and there were two clothes -- and all clothes, and it was covered with blood. </sentence><sentence id="4680">And one woman from the guards -- I remember it, you were never alone, and you longed to be alone for a moment, and think and pray. </sentence><sentence id="4681">And I had to clean the little room where the guards were always sitting, and there was a [indecipherable] and I was very softly humming a -- a hymn that was really consoling to me, and this woman came in. </sentence><sentence id="4682">And she could have yelled at me, because you weren't allowed to sing. </sentence><sentence id="4683">And she said to me, and that's German again, I have to spell it, "Sie singen wie ein Heidelarche." </sentence><sentence id="4684">You sing like a heather lark. </sentence><sentence id="4685">And I was really sad, and I didn't have a beautiful voice, but I knew that she was not the cruelest, you know, she had some soft. </sentence><sentence id="4686">And she was just on duty, so -- and she could speak a little bit Dutch, they all could. </sentence><sentence id="4687">So I said to her, "What is this, all this blood?" </sentence><sentence id="4688">And you know, I had to soak it, and blood has to go in cold water, in troughs where we had to wash ourself. </sentence><sentence id="4689">And it was horrible. </sentence><sentence id="4690">And she said, "[indecipherable] two guys who have been on a motorbike, they had an accident, in the hospital, and they come out and need their clothes," so I washed them. </sentence><sentence id="4691">Two days later, I got 12 sets of bloody underwear and clothes. </sentence><sentence id="4692">And that whole 12 was filled with blood, and all the 12, and I thought this is not just something. </sentence><sentence id="4693">So I went to that spy, and they all did kind of pitiful to me, they thought you're a border case, you're not all [indecipherable], and they said -- Hanny Janssen was her name. </sentence><sentence id="4694">I said, "Hanny, I have to wash all clothes, you know, that - - that's hard to do every day, but now it's all bloody. </sentence><sentence id="4695">What would that be?" </sentence><sentence id="4696">I did real stupid. </sentence><sentence id="4697">She said, "Oh, that are guys who are, every sunset when you hear the machine guys, are executed. </sentence><sentence id="4698">They are traitors." </sentence><sentence id="4699">And it were our Dutch guys. </sentence><sentence id="4700">And you know, they dragged you from one camp to another. </sentence><sentence id="4701">And the next day I got 36 of those bloody clothes, and that trough was filled with Dutch blood. </sentence><sentence id="4702">It was so horrible. </sentence><sentence id="4703">And I didn't know if Hein had been brought [indecipherable] Ab and I started to look always when I had to wash those clothes, for names. </sentence><sentence id="4704">And I was shattered, and I don't know, I -- I cracked up, because also we had buried weapons in my parents house, under the roses, under the bushes, and I didn't know anything. </sentence><sentence id="4705">I thought, if they all the time come and search, and they dig up the yard, and they find the weapons, they've shot my parents. </sentence><sentence id="4706">I really -- I thought my -- I thought I was absolutely going crazy, I didn't know any more. </sentence><sentence id="4707">And if I didn't have my faith, I would have -- I was -- I cracked up. </sentence><sentence id="4708">I was -- the next morning I couldn't get up, I was paralyzed for three days. </sentence><sentence id="4709">And they sent the camp doctor, and he kicked the bed, he said, "There's nothing wrong with you." </sentence><sentence id="4710">But I was so weak that then they don't me -- me -- they didn't make me do the laundry any more, they gave me a broomstick, and I had to sweep. </sentence><sentence id="4711">And then I started hating them so much, you know. </sentence><sentence id="4712">We say I hate this, or I thi -- old President Bush hated broccoli. </sentence><sentence id="4713">And I think you don't know what hated is. </sentence><sentence id="4714">With every molecule in my body, hated those Nazis for what they were doing. </sentence><sentence id="4715">And I was so angry with God. </sentence><sentence id="4716">I thought, you are there in heaven, these are your people that they're killing. </sentence><sentence id="4717">They're killing my people, and you can stop this, and you don't do a thing. </sentence><sentence id="4718">And I was praying God's damnation on the whole bunch. </sentence><sentence id="4719">I was still praying, but I was praying horrible prayers, only God's damnation. </sentence><sentence id="4720">God [indecipherable] this or that. </sentence><sentence id="4721">And just then, there was one girl that I -- I said I trusted too, apart from Mrs.Verschoor, and her name was Freddy, and Freddy was a Catholic. </sentence><sentence id="4722">And just in all this stuff that you heard, that was your General Patton, who was getting closer, and closer by -- and just in [indecipherable] of my hearing, and I had -- all those months I had trouble with you may not give false witness, it was one of the things what was in the Bible, a story of a spy, Rayhab, and she lied, and she was not punished by God, but she was blessed [indecipherable] Jesus. </sentence><sentence id="4723">So when I thought of that, because I knew the Bible from that -- I thought, oh that's God permission, so I said, oh let -- okay lord, I consider that I have your permission to lie, and now give me a good story. </sentence><sentence id="4724">And for months I was praying if they had interrogated me then, I wouldn't know what to say. </sentence><sentence id="4725">But every day I'd work on that story when I went to bed. </sentence><sentence id="4726">And I was born -- I thought, as little ballast as you can have. </sentence><sentence id="4727">So you have a father, no he has died. </sentence><sentence id="4728">You have a mother? </sentence><sentence id="4729">She has died. </sentence><sentence id="4730">No brothers and sisters. </sentence><sentence id="4731">Because if you -- three months later, I didn't know how long I would have to say it, you have to tell the story exactly the same, the same dates. </sentence><sentence id="4732">So it was really a matter of life and death. </sentence><sentence id="4733">And just when this all happened, I had my story ready, but I was repeating it every night, you know, because sometimes they shook you up at two in the night, and you had the hearing that -- in your sleep, or half asleep you may say the wrong thing. </sentence><sentence id="4734">And Freddy saw that I was called out for my hearing, and she knew that was life or death for everybody, except for this Hanny Janssen, and the officer from the Gestapo came for the hearing, had to sign me out. </sentence><sentence id="4735">And she pretended that she had diarrhea, and she stormed from her twine making, past me, and while he was signing me out she whispered in my ear. </sentence><sentence id="4736">I'm going to storm the gates of heaven for you. </sentence><sentence id="4737">And you know, me -- I say to friends, I'1l pray for you, but this was so much stronger, I don't know if you know that story -- the gay guard at -- that comic, you know, you see him with a ram going. </sentence><sentence id="4738">And you know something, another second miracle happened apart from the rain coat. </sentence><sentence id="4739">I walked out with that man, and we had to walk maybe eight minutes, or 10 minutes to the main building of the hearings. </sentence><sentence id="4740">And because I knew the Bible, and I was bombarded with God's promises. </sentence><sentence id="4741">And one of them is, not a har -- hair of your head will be harmed without the will of your heavenly father. </sentence><sentence id="4742">So they couldn't even touch a hair of my head without Him. </sentence><sentence id="4743">And the second one is something that you don't need every time, but it said also, do not fear be -- if you have to appear before authorities and kings, I will give you the words. </sentence><sentence id="4744">God promised me. </sentence><sentence id="4745">And I said, okay Lord -- like Tevye on this "Fiddler on the Roof," you know, he was always talking to God, I said, "I have broken many promises, but this is a promise, and I hold you to your word. </sentence><sentence id="4746">But you just have to give me the words." </sentence><sentence id="4747">And I walked in that building, and in that room, and there were a whole bunch of Nazi -- very high Nazis sitting behind the table, S.S."s. </sentence><sentence id="4748">I knew their ranks, and I saw their medals. </sentence><sentence id="4749">I think about seven at a green table. </sentence><sentence id="4750">And I told you about the bad food we had, one slice of bread in the morning, one in the evening, and that was [indecipherable], then the line leaves. </sentence><sentence id="4751">But once a month we got a package from the Red Cross, and that has a sandwich, and that had a little bit of toilet paper, and it had a square inch of pure lard. </sentence><sentence id="4752">And they had put some soy sauce in, so we scrape every day a bit of that. </sentence><sentence id="4753">But because of that bad food, we had all gotten phlegmones, I don't know if you know what that -- people in the first World War in the ditches in Belgium and France had it. </sentence><sentence id="4754">It started as an itch, and then you got hives, and then they became so big like strawberries, and you always had them in your face. </sentence><sentence id="4755">And your whole face was out of shape, and in the end your skin couldn't hold it any more, and it burst open, and green pus was dripping down. </sentence><sentence id="4756">And we all had that on our faces, most of us, and it was terrible. </sentence><sentence id="4757">And then it was the fifth month, I've never had shampoo, so can you imagine your hair greasy, just cold water, no towels. </sentence><sentence id="4758">And we looked a mess, and we have no mirrors, but you saw how the others -- so there I was sitting with those seven well fed guys across from me, and 15 minutes before, I'd wished them all death. </sentence><sentence id="4759">And I looked at them, and I thought, there you sit, you seven, and you think that you can decide about my life. </sentence><sentence id="4760">You can't even touch a hair of my head if God doesn't let you. </sentence><sentence id="4761">And I thought you totally on the wrong side, the -- and actually, the most strange thing, I could feel pity for them. </sentence><sentence id="4762">They thought they had it all, and they had nothing. </sentence><sentence id="4763">And then they ask -- started asking me questions, but stupid really had done so stupid in those months, and I'd never said one gerd of German, one word. </sentence><sentence id="4764">So I said, "TI don't know what you're saying." </sentence><sentence id="4765">So they called the translator, and he had to sit there, then they asked him the questions, but I knew it already, and then me, so it gave me twice the time to think. </sentence><sentence id="4766">And then in the end, the leader -- he had the highest rank, and he was in his 50's, and he said, "I have done nothing in my life but hearings, and I have developed a sixth sense," he says, "and I can't," -- and I was so afraid that I had slipped up somewhere, you know, because it was very important. </sentence><sentence id="4767">But he said, "I can't put a pin in your story, [indecipherable]," -- he said, "but my sixth sense tells me it's all baloney." </sentence><sentence id="4768">And I told him, because they said I was early 20, so my father must have been in his 40's. </sentence><sentence id="4769">And they said, "What did your father there?" </sentence><sentence id="4770">I thought everywhere before I thought a -- taxes. </sentence><sentence id="4771">I said, "He worked for the taxes," because that's everywhere, in every country, you know. </sentence><sentence id="4772">And then he said, "Where is he?" </sentence><sentence id="4773">I said he died, but of course he must have been young. </sentence><sentence id="4774">He said, "What did he die of?" </sentence><sentence id="4775">I said he was bitten by a snake. [ </sentence><sentence id="4776">indecipherable].And then they asked me the date, and they have the big Sinter Klass on December five, so my father had died on December five. </sentence><sentence id="4777">And then, and your mother? </sentence><sentence id="4778">She has died, too. </sentence><sentence id="4779">I -- I felt like I was killing my own parents. </sentence><sentence id="4780">And they said, "What did she die of?" </sentence><sentence id="4781">I said, "She had a very weak heart, and when Father was brought home there, she died." " </sentence><sentence id="4782">When?" " </sentence><sentence id="4783">10 days later, 15," so I thought I could remember that. </sentence><sentence id="4784">So they asked all questions, but then in the end they started -- and I heard every word, they started discussing my case in front of them. </sentence><sentence id="4785">And they said, "But she doesn't look like a maid, she looks more like a secretary, or a teacher." </sentence><sentence id="4786">And then I heard another one say, "Well, we can check that." </sentence><sentence id="4787">And I thought, how can you ever check -- I -- I had no idea what it was. </sentence><sentence id="4788">And then they brought me -- see, that was the good thing, that I -- that they thought I didn't know German. </sentence><sentence id="4789">And then they brought me a magazine and a pad, and a pencil, and said, "Copy that." </sentence><sentence id="4790">And I thought -- I think your brains work 200 percent when you're -- it was life or death again. </sentence><sentence id="4791">And I thought, why are they with this? </sentence><sentence id="4792">And then it dawned on me, when you were a maid, by law you had to go through sixth grade, and then you could go, and mostly you were from poor families, and you were farmed out to a wealthy lady where -- or couple, that you had to have the etic -- but you don't write, you write -- and we had one hour, and some schools two hours of penmanship. </sentence><sentence id="4793">And if you see those classrooms, the capital A, the small a, the ca -- so that is what your handwriting was when you leave. </sentence><sentence id="4794">But if you're a secretary, and you take dictation, you start -- so I thought, that is the trap they put up for me. </sentence><sentence id="4795">So I sat there, and I hold [indecipherable] with my tongue sticking out like it was really unusual work. </sentence><sentence id="4796">And then they brought me back to the barrack. </sentence><sentence id="4797">And then the noise of the a-allies came sh -- all the time closer, and they got more and more nervous. </sentence><sentence id="4798">And then I remembered one of the women one time says to me -- I was called Willie. " </sentence><sentence id="4799">Willie, if you can choose what day you go out of prison, what would you choose?" </sentence><sentence id="4800">And I says, "If I would choose, I want to go in the radiant sunshine, when the world looks so happy." </sentence><sentence id="4801">I said, "On a Saturday morning, and take a soak bath, and shampoo, and take care of all that stuff on my face, clean underwear, clean clothes, and Sunday go to church and thank God for freedom," I said, "with capital letters. </sentence><sentence id="4802">We always take it for granted, but it's a gift." </sentence><sentence id="4803">I said, "But if it pours, and it's Monday morning, I'll go too." </sentence><sentence id="4804">And you know, this is so miraculous, two weeks later, on a radiant Saturday morning, I was called out by the Hauptmachtmeisterin, she was the highest, and she was a real mean woman. </sentence><sentence id="4805">And she's, "Willie, you'll go to Germany." </sentence><sentence id="4806">And the little voice here said, "You're going home." </sentence><sentence id="4807">And that's when I put the belt on, and I left sweaters I had with the eight girls, and I knew in my heart I was going out. </sentence><sentence id="4808">And I was let out with another girl, Ansje. </sentence><sentence id="4809">And Ansje didn't know it, but her husband had been executed. </sentence><sentence id="4810">And Ansje, when we had to stand at attention, you know, had always fainted the first. </sentence><sentence id="4811">And she was married for eight or nine years, and they wanted so much to have a baby, and in the camp she found out she was pregnant, so she fainted all the time. </sentence><sentence id="4812">And her husband didn't know it, but he had been executed. </sentence><sentence id="4813">But when she was let out she didn't know she was a widow. </sentence><sentence id="4814">And they let us out at the total different gate than where they had brought us in. </sentence><sentence id="4815">And there we stood. </sentence><sentence id="4816">And they had been so cruel with many things. </sentence><sentence id="4817">They once said to me that I could take a shower in Scheveningen, and then I was there, and I hadn't had any water -- I mean, that little pail with cold water, and when I stood there, and I'd undressed, and I wanted to [indecipherable] ready, I'd never [indecipherable]. </sentence><sentence id="4818">So they did all cruel things to make you happy for something, and they'd -- so we were afraid that the gates would open again and say, "Okay, all a big mistake, back in." </sentence><sentence id="4819">And we wanted to get away, but we were so [indecipherable] nervous. </sentence><sentence id="4820">And there was nothing. </sentence><sentence id="4821">It was a lot of sand, it was very arid, and in the distance were trees but you saw two wheels from a cart, and you saw some horse manure. </sentence><sentence id="4822">And this was the end of 44, and [indecipherable] our whole country does nothing any more. </sentence><sentence id="4823">If you saw a store, there wouldn't be a rubber band, there wouldn't be a paper clip, there wouldn't be anything. </sentence><sentence id="4824">And the farmers didn't get fertilizer, and this is an arid part, so they collected all the manure from their pigs, their chickens, their cows, from everything, and it went in a pit, and then they pumped it up, and they put it in the moving cart, and spread it over the field, and they did that regularly. </sentence><sentence id="4825">So they never scrubbed that cart wi -- for a few days later they filled it again. </sentence><sentence id="4826">But this was the end of "44, so you can -- and we saw -- where we were standing there, and we said, shall we go left or right, we want to get away from here, but we didn't want to walk miles for nothing, you know, so we -- and then we saw a little dot. </sentence><sentence id="4827">We said, "Let's see what that is." </sentence><sentence id="4828">So we started walking, and it was a farmer who was going to spread all that manure, and that cart was filled to the brim with you know what, and stinking, and he was walking next to it because there was a shelf or something, that -- where you could sit on behind the horse, but it was caked on everywhere. </sentence><sentence id="4829">And he was walking next to his horse. </sentence><sentence id="4830">And he's, "Hi girls, you just came out of the camp?" </sentence><sentence id="4831">And
