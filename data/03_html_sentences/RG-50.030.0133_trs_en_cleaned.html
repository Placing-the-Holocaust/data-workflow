<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="22">Q: What did your parents do? </sentence><sentence id="23">What was your father's occupation? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="26">A: My father was a photographer. </sentence><sentence id="27">He had his own studio. </sentence><sentence id="28">My father died in February of 1925; I was obviously just a few months old. </sentence><sentence id="29">And my mother continued the business until 1938, December of 1938, when all Jewish businesses had to be closed. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="34">Q: Okay. </sentence><sentence id="35">What was it like for you, until 1938, growing up in Germany? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="38">A: Well, I would say that we had a very nice family life, in spite of not having a father. </sentence><sentence id="39">My mother had three sisters. </sentence><sentence id="40">They were in business. </sentence><sentence id="41">They were in haute couture. </sentence><sentence id="42">And, it was really a very loving family. </sentence><sentence id="43">I had also my father's mother, my grandmother, who was a very elderly lady and our family life really was a very nice one. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="50">Q: What kind of school did you go to? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="52">A: Well, I entered public school like all children at age six, and I think I hated school from the first day I went there. </sentence><sentence id="53">It was made ever more difficult, because the teacher we had was even then a Nazi. </sentence><sentence id="54">And I was a child that couldn't sit still, and had my mouth open probably all the time. </sentence><sentence id="55">And was punished for it a great deal. </sentence><sentence id="56">Okay. </sentence><sentence id="57">It did not improve my love for school. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="64">Q: Did you have friends in school? </sentence><sentence id="65">Were they Jewish friends? </sentence><sentence id="66">Christian friends? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="70">A: I had a lot of friends in school. </sentence><sentence id="71">I think we were the only class, first grade class, at the time we were 24 children. </sentence><sentence id="72">Out of the 24, 12 were Jewish. </sentence><sentence id="73">Fifty percent! </sentence><sentence id="74">It was an extremely high percentage. </sentence><sentence id="75">I think that was the only class ever that had such a high percentage of Jewish  students. </sentence><sentence id="76">I went to public school until 1936 when Jewish children were no longer allowed to go to public school unless their parent or their fathers were in the First World War and were in the front lines. </sentence><sentence id="77">These were the exceptions. </sentence><sentence id="78">So I had to go to Jewish school in 1936, and I went to this school until Easter of 1940." </sentence><sentence id="79">So I really didn't have a hell of a lot of school. </sentence><sentence id="80">And after, I would say 1938, after Kristallnacht", due to the fact that we had so many Jewish -- old Jewish teachers that were taken to the concentration camp for many weeks and months, school was every other day two hours for many months until everybody had come back and there was a semblance of a normal school day. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="92">Q: Would you tell me a little bit about after 1933, "34. </sentence><sentence id="93">How, besides school, how did life change for you? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="96">A: Well, I would first like to go back before 1933. </sentence><sentence id="97">We lived and had our business next to a newspaper. </sentence><sentence id="98">This newspaper was a left-wing newspaper. </sentence><sentence id="99">And we had daily street fights, mob scenes, shooting, flag burning. </sentence><sentence id="100">These are the first of my memories as a child outside the home. </sentence><sentence id="101">It was a very violent street we lived on. </sentence><sentence id="102">These are really my first memories and my mother or someone from the household pulling me back from the balcony and as soon as they turned their backs, my brother and I were back out on the balcony watching what was going on. </sentence><sentence id="103">These are really my first memories. </sentence><sentence id="104">One of my other memories is the boycott of April 1933 where our show windows were plastered with "Jew!" " </sentence><sentence id="105">Don't go to the Jew!" </sentence><sentence id="106">And so on and so forth. </sentence><sentence id="107">These are really some of my childhood memories. </sentence><sentence id="108">Family life was great. </sentence><sentence id="109">Outside the family, it was not so good. </sentence><sentence id="110">You were insulted in the street many times. </sentence><sentence id="111">You were called "dirty Jew," things like that. </sentence><sentence id="112">For several years, I did have Gentile girlfriends and, of course, under the pressure of the Nazi time they could no longer associate with me, and I would not dare associate with them. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="130">Q: Were you taunted by your school mates? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="132">A: By some of them. </sentence><sentence id="133">And like my husband, I beat up one. </sentence><sentence id="134">And not only did I beat her, I actually tore her sweater to pieces. </sentence><sentence id="135">I was not standing, you know, not letting it happen to me all the time. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="140">Q: As the Nazi regime went on, what else happened to you and your family? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="142">A: Well, as time when on, of course, there was Kristallnacht. [] </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="145">Q: Tell me about that. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="147"> " The interviewee later corrected this date to 1939. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="148"> &gt; Crystal Night (German); Night of Broken Glass. </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="149">A: Kristallnacht, I went to school in the morning, Jewish school obviously, and something seemed wrong, yet I didn't know what. </sentence><sentence id="150">And when I came to school and I mentioned that I saw the fire engines standing in front of a building and in the back of this building was the Orthodox synagogue, I was told, "Don't you know what's going on?" </sentence><sentence id="151">And I said, "No, I don't." </sentence><sentence id="152">She said -- this one told me, "My father was arrested. </sentence><sentence id="153">His father was arrested, and it was just a terrible situation." </sentence><sentence id="154">The teachers, other than the female teachers, did not come in. </sentence><sentence id="155">They were arrested. </sentence><sentence id="156">And they sent us home, I think, after about two hours. </sentence><sentence id="157">And when I came home all our show windows had been smashed. </sentence><sentence id="158">My mother was sweeping up the street. </sentence><sentence id="159">Okay. </sentence><sentence id="160">To the taunts and harassment of the population or the people who were made to look like the population. </sentence><sentence id="161">Next to us was a store that dealt in oriental carpets. </sentence><sentence id="162">The show window is gone. </sentence><sentence id="163">Ink thrown over the carpets. </sentence><sentence id="164">It was, it was impossible. </sentence><sentence id="165">The only reason our apartment and business was not touched at the time was that they simply knew there was not a man to be arrested, so our apartment and our business upstairs remained in tact. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="183">Q: What did your family do after Kristallnacht? </sentence><sentence id="184">How did you mother manage? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="187">A: Well, we managed first of all to take care of a lot of customers at the time because every Jew needed an identification paper. </sentence><sentence id="188">To these purpose, you had to have a picture. </sentence><sentence id="189">The picture had to show your left ear. </sentence><sentence id="190">Okay. </sentence><sentence id="191">So that every person had to be taken -- the picture had to be taken from this side. </sentence><sentence id="192">Your ear was supposedly an additional identification mark. </sentence><sentence id="193">Another harassment. </sentence><sentence id="194">And so we were really very busy in the business until the very end, until we absolutely closed on the 31st of December. </sentence><sentence id="195">And, since I did not go to school because there was no school, I helped in the business as people drifted back or came back from concentration camps, many times their first stop was really with us because they were so afraid they had to get the identification paper, the photos and everything else. </sentence><sentence id="196">I saw many men with their ears frozen, their hands frozen. </sentence><sentence id="197">My mother would run pots of soup to feed these people first before they would go wherever they needed, you know, went. </sentence><sentence id="198">It was a very hard, very busy time. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="211">Q: What happened after that time? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="213">A: Nineteen thirty-nine, the three sisters of my mother who also had to close their business moved in with us because we had a very large apartment. </sentence><sentence id="214">Obviously, we shared the apartment. </sentence><sentence id="215">Half was an apartment, half was business. </sentence><sentence id="216">So there were all these empty rooms, so my aunts moved in with us because there was no more income so you had to reduce your living expenses. </sentence><sentence id="217">My grandmother had moved in with us after my brother left in 1937 because she was very old. </sentence><sentence id="218">She could no longer keep a household of her own. </sentence><sentence id="219">And so here were six women in one household. </sentence><sentence id="220">Not necessarily an ideal situation, but it functioned somehow. </sentence><sentence id="221">When the war broke out Karlsruhe was on the list of evacuation. </sentence><sentence id="222">In other words, most of the population, meaning people with small children and very old people, were evacuated. </sentence><sentence id="223">And so we evacuated my grandmother, of all places, to Mannheim. </sentence><sentence id="224">And many people went to  Stuttgart, other places where they could go; my mother decided she was not going to leave. </sentence><sentence id="225">And my mother's three sisters decided they were not going to go anywhere. </sentence><sentence id="226">We were going - - just going to stay where we were. </sentence><sentence id="227">My grandmother we sent to Mannheim because it was very hard to move her in any emergency. </sentence><sentence id="228">She was 90 years old, and so she was away from us for maybe four or five months, and then we took her back because there was actually no war. </sentence><sentence id="229">There was war, but there was no shooting. </sentence><sentence id="230">There was nothing going on. </sentence><sentence id="231">So what then was called "Drdele de Guerre," and, and so we took her back home. </sentence><sentence id="232">This went, of course, until the day we were deported on the 22nd of October 1940. </sentence><sentence id="233">I would like to interject that in the spring of 1940 I was for four months in the area of Hannover, where my mother had sent me, there was a school -- boarding school if you wish. </sentence><sentence id="234">It taught agriculture and horticulture and all sorts of things and my mother sent me up there because she didn't know what to do with me. </sentence><sentence id="235">I was hanging around the house. </sentence><sentence id="236">There was nothing to do. </sentence><sentence id="237">I could not do any apprenticeship of any kind and so I was up there for four months and, I think it was four months, maybe five, and then I came back, I think, in August of 1940 because she was not feeling well. </sentence><sentence id="238">And so I came back. </sentence><sentence id="239">And then we, of course, were deported in October. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="267">Q: Would you describe the process of that deportation? </sentence><sentence id="268">How were you notified and what did you do? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="271">A: My mother went out shopping early in the morning, as a matter of fact, and she came home in a hurry and said, "I met someone in the street who told me that we would be deported. </sentence><sentence id="272">Said everybody would be arrested and deported." </sentence><sentence id="273">She did not believe it and she went to the Jewish community, which was only two blocks away from us. </sentence><sentence id="274">And sure enough the offices were closed, and then it dawned on her that there was something to this story. </sentence><sentence id="275">And she came home and she told me, "Well, I guess we better start packing." </sentence><sentence id="276">And before she had finished the sentence, the police was there and told us that we are arrested. </sentence><sentence id="277">No, the first thing she did was, "If we really have to go I have very good friends and I promised them certain items from our household. </sentence><sentence id="278">Take them over there. </sentence><sentence id="279">Go over there. </sentence><sentence id="280">Take it, take it over there. </sentence><sentence id="281">Give it to them." </sentence><sentence id="282">And I went and it turned out that this lady's husband was really German underground. </sentence><sentence id="283">He was a lawyer, but he must have been busy in the German underground because he knew exactly where we were going to be taken. </sentence><sentence id="284">Okay. </sentence><sentence id="285">The man was later on the mayor of Karlsruhe right after the war. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="301">Q: What's his name? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="303">A: So he was, he was very clean. </sentence><sentence id="304">Was Mr. Veit. </sentence><sentence id="305">His name was Veit. </sentence><sentence id="306">They were very good friends of my mother. </sentence><sentence id="307">And so I took the items, and by the time I came back the police was in the apartment telling us to pack and, and so my mother started. </sentence><sentence id="308">And the policeman knew my mother very well. </sentence><sentence id="309">He was from the precinct. </sentence><sentence id="310">And he said to my mother, "I will see if I can get your mother-in-law to stay in a hospital and you cannot be moved out of your apartment &gt; Funny war (French); The Phony War. </sentence><sentence id="311"> until I come back." </sentence><sentence id="312">Now he knew very well that no Jewish people were accepted at this particular day in the hospital. </sentence><sentence id="313">So he gave us two hours to pack. </sentence><sentence id="314">So I packed everything for my grandmother. </sentence><sentence id="315">My mother packed for me and for herself and my aunts, of course, packed for themselves. </sentence><sentence id="316">And so six women were eventually guarded by 12 Gestapo and policemen. </sentence><sentence id="317">Six helpless women. </sentence><sentence id="318">Right! </sentence><sentence id="319">I was 16 and my grandmother was 91 and a half. </sentence><sentence id="320">Totally not comprehending what was happening. </sentence><sentence id="321">Not that she was senile. </sentence><sentence id="322">It was simply, it was something that was incomprehensible. </sentence><sentence id="323">And so we had to sign papers stating how much the apartment was worth. </sentence><sentence id="324">My aunt first refused and she was threatened that she would be sent to Dachau, and so she signed. </sentence><sentence id="325">And we had to leave and we were loaded on a truck and taken to the railroad station where everybody slowly was assembled. </sentence><sentence id="326">And I believe Karlsruhe had some 930 or 950 Jews that were deported together. </sentence><sentence id="327">All together from Baden and the Palatinate and the Saar. </sentence><sentence id="328">There were some Jews from the Saar that were also deported with us, only a few. </sentence><sentence id="329">It was 6,500 people, I believe, that were deported to Gurs at the same time. </sentence><sentence id="330">The ride to Gurs was horror. </sentence><sentence id="331">It was absolute horror. </sentence><sentence id="332">My husband has explained to you, each car had a person in charge for each car and then someone was put in charge of the train. </sentence><sentence id="333">They really had nothing to say until the Germans turned us over to the French. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="366">Q: Why was the train ride a horror? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="368">A: It was a horror insofar as we had no food or barely any food was given to us. </sentence><sentence id="369">I think the train stopped in Mulhouse. </sentence><sentence id="370">For the first time we were given some sort of soup and maybe some bread. </sentence><sentence id="371">Two of the old people, my grandmother being one of them, lost their minds. </sentence><sentence id="372">Most probably due to hunger and the strain and stress and eventually, there was a doctor on the train, the last doctor that I knew in Karlsruhe and he gave me a handful of sleeping pills to give to my grandmother and I did. </sentence><sentence id="373">And it really meant, "Put her to sleep, let her go." </sentence><sentence id="374">She didn't. </sentence><sentence id="375">And at the end of the ride, when we came to Oloron-Sainte-Marie; because she was totally confused. </sentence><sentence id="376">So was the other man, a Mr. Weil. </sentence><sentence id="377">She was taken out of the train and disappeared for at least a week. </sentence><sentence id="378">We did not know where she was. </sentence><sentence id="379">My mother offered to go, asked if she could go with this old woman and was refused. </sentence><sentence id="380">And for at least a week or two we did not know where she was. </sentence><sentence id="381">We never knew where she was. </sentence><sentence id="382">All of a sudden we were told that she was in the next block in the camp. </sentence><sentence id="383">She must have been in a hospital or someplace because when she came back, she was okay. </sentence><sentence id="384">She knew us. </sentence><sentence id="385">She could not understand her surroundings. </sentence><sentence id="386">Obviously, who could? </sentence><sentence id="387">But she was okay. </sentence><sentence id="388">She was no longer confused. </sentence><sentence id="389">So you can understand that the train ride, aside from everything else, was horror. </sentence><sentence id="390">My mother's sisters were -- the oldest was very ill and had diabetes, was in her 70s so the ages were great and having two people in the same car, not in the same train, but in the same car going -- losing their minds the same way was a little tough. </sentence><sentence id="391">When we arrived in Oloron- Sainte-Marie, as my husband mentioned to you before, it rained buckets. </sentence><sentence id="392">It rained. </sentence><sentence id="393">It was incredible. </sentence><sentence id="394">We were loaded mostly on open trucks and taken to the camp. </sentence><sentence id="395">And in the camp when we atrived, it was evening and, of course, total bedlam and confusion. </sentence><sentence id="396">And the adults, and we were teenagers at the time, were totally traumatized and in shock and functioned barely. </sentence><sentence id="397"> And so it was on us, the young, to get some semblance of -- you can't say order -- but there was a barracks where they were giving out straw. </sentence><sentence id="398">So we ran to get straw so the people at least could sleep on straw. </sentence><sentence id="399">My husband was lucky. </sentence><sentence id="400">He had even a straw mattress or whatever he called it. </sentence><sentence id="401">Later on, we were given stuff to put the straw in to make a mattress. </sentence><sentence id="402">But the first few nights we had straw and not even enough of that because some people really did sleep on the bare floor. </sentence><sentence id="403">And for the very old people it was just awful. </sentence><sentence id="404">A young person can always shift, but very old people, it is very hard. </sentence><sentence id="405">So it was the young people who had to function first and did function first. </sentence><sentence id="406">And slowly, you know, things started to fall into a pattern. </sentence><sentence id="407">Gurs was a camp full of mud. </sentence><sentence id="408">It was clay. </sentence><sentence id="409">When it rained, you sank into the clay up to your knees. </sentence><sentence id="410">The first persons we lost, or one woman we lost really choked to death in the mud. </sentence><sentence id="411">She went at night to the latrine. </sentence><sentence id="412">She fell. </sentence><sentence id="413">She could not extricate herself and she died. </sentence><sentence id="414">So our experiences were horrendous. </sentence><sentence id="415">It is not -- I would not say Gurs was Auschwitz, but it was what they called "the Little Hell before the Big One," meaning Auschwitz. </sentence><sentence id="416">Our food was minimal. </sentence><sentence id="417">France was short on food, it is true. </sentence><sentence id="418">The French felt called upon to steal much of the money that was allocated to feed us so instead of the little, there was even less. </sentence><sentence id="419">There were people in the camp who stole -- were in a position to steal and did of this little food. </sentence><sentence id="420">So it was really a very difficult, difficult survival. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="474">Q: How long were you there? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="476">A: I was in Gurs from, as I mentioned, October 25th, 1940 until the beginning of September 1941. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="478">Q: What happened--? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="480">A: My grandmother -- excuse me -- died in January of 1941. </sentence><sentence id="481">My mother's oldest sister died in February of 1941. </sentence><sentence id="482">These are the two people that are buried in Gurs. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="486">Q: You answered my question. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="488">A: Huh? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="490">Q: You answered my question. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="492">A: I answered your question. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="494">Q: What about your mother? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="496">A: My mother remained in Gurs. </sentence><sentence id="497">Her two sisters were able to leave Gurs and were lucky  enough to make their way via Marseille, North Africa to Cuba, and later on to the United States in 1948. </sentence><sentence id="498">My mother was not this lucky. </sentence><sentence id="499">And she was deported in August of 1942 to -- I suppose, first Drancy, and then Auschwitz. </sentence><sentence id="500">She was the very first transport, or with the first transport, to leave Gurs. </sentence><sentence id="501">End of July, I went down to Gurs from Le Chambon see my mother who had been very ill and the camp had given me permission that I could enter for a week to visit my sick mother and they would let me out again. </sentence><sentence id="502">And when I came to the camp, the camp was closed to all visitors. </sentence><sentence id="503">| saw my mother twice across the barbed wire, an empty field and then, of course, wire again so it was a good distance of maybe 150 feet. </sentence><sentence id="504">I saw my mother twice like that. </sentence><sentence id="505">And then I was told that the deportations are starting. </sentence><sentence id="506">I was told this by the Red Cross, the Red Cross that was active there, and by the Quakers. </sentence><sentence id="507">And that they made arrangements for me to be able to see my mother on the railroad station, the freight station at Oloron-Sainte-Marie in the train. </sentence><sentence id="508">And so I went down there from Gurs. </sentence><sentence id="509">It's about 12 kilometers, I think, 15 kilometers. </sentence><sentence id="510">I went down there. </sentence><sentence id="511">I spent the night in the street between two houses on a little -- on a low wall until very early, maybe five o'clock in the morning at which time I was allowed to enter the railroad station or the freight yards really, and I did see my mother and that's the last time I saw her. </sentence><sentence id="512">And this transport, I think, left, if I remember it right, on August 6, 1942. </sentence><sentence id="513">I went back from there to Le Chambon, first seeing my then boyfriend, now husband at Talluyers, and he told you that we discussed then if there's any danger -- because there was talk about roundups and arrests and deportations even of the people who were living outside the camps -- that he should come up to Le Chambon. </sentence><sentence id="514">I met my husband in Gurs. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="534">Q: Let us back up indeed and let us go back into Gurs. </sentence><sentence id="535">Would you describe -- you are now still in Gurs, how did you meet your husband? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="538">A: I met my husband -- Well, let's put it this way. </sentence><sentence id="539">I worked in the so-called office. </sentence><sentence id="540">Each block had, as it was called, ilot*, its own barrack for administration purposes. </sentence><sentence id="541">And his mother was working in this office and I worked in the office, worked in the office, I ran the errands. </sentence><sentence id="542">I was the messenger. </sentence><sentence id="543">I distributed mail. </sentence><sentence id="544">I did messenger service. </sentence><sentence id="545">They needed young people to walk through the mud. </sentence><sentence id="546">Okay. </sentence><sentence id="547">And I did that and this is where I got to know his mother, and when he came to visit his mother, I came to know my husband. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="926">A: Yes. </sentence><sentence id="927">Okay. </sentence><sentence id="928">When I came back from Gurs and the short stop I made to see my then boyfriend obviously having seen my mother deported and the last thing I saw of her was a white handkerchief fluttering out of the cattle car. </sentence><sentence id="929">I don't know whether you can.... No, you cannot understand what emotions you are going through, and I came back to Le Chambon and I had to bring a horrible message to my friends because most of their parents had been deported at the same time. </sentence><sentence id="930">And within -- I don't know whether it -- I do not remember whether it was the same day or several days later but it doesn't really matter. </sentence><sentence id="931">There was a get together and I believe -- I cannot be sure anymore -- it might have been in the Ceteau Fleuri where Pastor Boegner addressed the people who were there and I went there. </sentence><sentence id="932">I don't remember who went with me. </sentence><sentence id="933">It is sort of a blank. </sentence><sentence id="934">He was telling us we should be calm and confident and nothing is going to happen and so on and so forth and after having had the experience that I just had, I just became very angry and I confronted the man and said, "Instead of telling us these things, why don't you do something? </sentence><sentence id="935">Rather than talking, do something." </sentence><sentence id="936">I did not know at the time who Pastor Boegner was. </sentence><sentence id="937">He was just another man. </sentence><sentence id="938">A man who was giving a speech that to me was totally ridiculous. </sentence><sentence id="939">And so I confronted him with that. </sentence><sentence id="940">And I don't think if I had known who Pastor Boegner was, I think I would still have done the same thing. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="972">Q: What did you do next? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="974">A: Next? </sentence><sentence id="975">Well, then we went into hiding. </sentence><sentence id="976">That was after my confrontation. </sentence><sentence id="977">Pastor Trocme was very upset that day with me when I came back that I did not first report to him what had happened and it was really not on my mind to go to him and to tell him. </sentence><sentence id="978">I did not realize they had really worried if I ever even would come back and not get caught on the way. </sentence><sentence id="979">The thought never entered my mind. </sentence><sentence id="980">And I didn't go there. </sentence><sentence id="981">I just didn't see any reason actually. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="982">Now I know what he wanted to know from me. </sentence><sentence id="983">But at that time all I knew is that I had to tell my friends what happened. </sentence><sentence id="984">That was the overwhelming feeling and terrible duty I had to do. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="985">And everything else was wiped off the slate. </sentence><sentence id="986">So, he was angry with me. </sentence><sentence id="987">I learned that afterwards. </sentence><sentence id="988">And it really didn't matter. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="989"> 8 Pastor Mare Boegner </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="990">Q: You have come back and told your friends? </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="991">A: Yes. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1003">A: Well on my way back, as I mentioned, I saw my boyfriend. </sentence><sentence id="1004">I told him to come up to Le Chambon if things become difficult where he is because I was sure that there would be help, that he would be safe. </sentence><sentence id="1005">And he did come. </sentence><sentence id="1006">And he told you how he found me on the way walking from one house to the other. </sentence><sentence id="1007">And wait a minute. </sentence><sentence id="1008">Now I have to think a moment. </sentence><sentence id="1009">I lost my thought. </sentence><sentence id="1010">Excuse me. </sentence><sentence id="1011">What did we do? </sentence><sentence id="1012">Oh. </sentence><sentence id="1013">Yeah. </sentence><sentence id="1014">When I came back out of hiding, I was moved to another home, also of the Swiss Red Cross where there were smaller children. </sentence><sentence id="1015">And I helped for several months to take care of these children. </sentence><sentence id="1016">We had an outbreak in this house of lice, head lice. </sentence><sentence id="1017">Nothing unusual! </sentence><sentence id="1018">My wonderful job was to clean them up in the evening. </sentence><sentence id="1019">Have them all nice and clean. </sentence><sentence id="1020">Send them off to school the next morning, only for them to come back with a new batch, which they picked up in school. </sentence><sentence id="1021">So, it was an evening exercise to clean the children up. </sentence><sentence id="1022">And I did that for several months helped with the children, helped with whatever had to be done in the home. </sentence><sentence id="1023">In the meantime, I was in touch with my family in Switzerland. </sentence><sentence id="1024">My mother's sister was married in Switzerland since the beginning of the century. </sentence><sentence id="1025">I made it clear to them in letters; I said I wanted to leave and said I wanted to come and stay with them. </sentence><sentence id="1026">And they, in turn, found a woman who arranged for crossings into Switzerland. </sentence><sentence id="1027">What they first did, however, was to apply for a visa for me to enter Switzerland legally. </sentence><sentence id="1028">Now I could never use this visa to enter Switzerland legally as a immigrant because I could not get an exit visa out of France. </sentence><sentence id="1029">Mr. Bohny had at the time tried to get an exit visa for me. </sentence><sentence id="1030">I made the application which, of course, was turned down. </sentence><sentence id="1031">And so I could never physically take possession of this precious visa to go to Switzerland. </sentence><sentence id="1032">And so in February of 43, through this woman my family had found, a man was found very close to the Swiss border who would literally take me across the border. </sentence><sentence id="1033">I made my way alone from Le Chambon to Annemasse. </sentence><sentence id="1034">I met this guide in Annemasse. </sentence><sentence id="1035">There were three or four, five other people which he crossed at the same time, so we were a group of six that he crossed over into Switzerland that night. </sentence><sentence id="1036">His crossing over consisted of carrying us across the little stream physically so we would not be wet, depositing us on the other side and saying, "Now you have to walk in such and such a direction and you will then meet the street car that will take you into Geneva, and you get off at a certain station in Geneva and there will be a contact person who will take you to a small hotel for the night." </sentence><sentence id="1037">And this is how I entered Switzerland. </sentence><sentence id="1038">Once I was on Swiss soil, I was  perfectly legal, not like my husband who entered as a refugee. </sentence><sentence id="1039">So it was a long while my husband had a guide all the way with his friends. </sentence><sentence id="1040">I had no one. </sentence><sentence id="1041">Mr. Bohny happened to be on the train when I left the next village. </sentence><sentence id="1042">I did not board the train in Le Chambon. </sentence><sentence id="1043">I boarded the train in Tence which is the little town below. </sentence><sentence id="1044">And he was on the train; and he went with me as far as, I believe, Saint-Etienne. </sentence><sentence id="1045">And then of course from Saint-Etienne to Lyon. </sentence><sentence id="1046">From there on, I was on my own. </sentence><sentence id="1047">And the railroad station in Lyon was full of German soldiers because all of France was already occupied at this time. </sentence><sentence id="1048">This was February of 1943. </sentence></p></dialogue>
