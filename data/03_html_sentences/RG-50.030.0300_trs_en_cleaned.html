</sentence><sentence id="182">He took us to the road. </sentence><sentence id="183">And as he took us to the road -- leading us under the rifle -- and told us to meet up with the group of the Jews that were being led to be killed. </sentence><sentence id="184">The women and children were being walked, walked quietly, holding on to their children -- some carrying them. </sentence><sentence id="185">They were surrounded tightly with guards. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="186">By running out they would be shot immediately. </sentence><sentence id="187">Men were in trucks with machine

id="188"> We ran from the scene to hide in the opposite side of the forest away from the shooting and the screams. </sentence><sentence id="189">And all of a sudden as we were sitting there -- both of us frightened, hoping that we will live through the day -- all of a sudden a ranger came into the forest. </sentence><sentence id="190">He came from the road. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="191">He carried -- he came with a bicycle -- holding on to a bicycle, a rifle slung over his shoulder and an axe behind his belt. </sentence><sentence id="192">He wanted to know what we were doing in the forest and we told him that we came to collect the wood for the winter. </sentence><sentence id="193">He believed us and he let us stay. </sentence><sentence id="194">He too, came deeper into the

we done to him. </sentence><sentence id="200">Why not find the kindness to save two young girls. </sentence><sentence id="201">He was in no danger of anything. </sentence><sentence id="202">But he did not take us to the pits where they where they were killing the people. </sentence><sentence id="203">He took us to the road. </sentence><sentence id="204">He led us under the rifle to the road where the group of women and the children in a great number were being led to be killed. </sentence><sentence id="205">They were surrounded by guards tightly. </sentence><sentence id="206">Women holding on to their children, some carrying them, walking very quietly. </sentence><sentence id="207">And the men on the trucks and the trucks moving very slowly. </sentence><sentence id="208">In the back a machine gun attached to the truck. </sentence><sentence id="209">They couldn't run, they couldn't do anything to change. </sentence><sentence id="210">Nothing at all could they have done. </sentence><sentence id="211">We walked on a little walker's path that was bumpy, a lot of ice, thin ice. </sentence><sentence id="212">As we are putting our feet -- walking, it was hard for even to pull for us to get our shoes out. </sentence><sentence id="213">And when my sister turned her head back and she noticed that the ranger is a distance from us, she grabbed my hand and she told me, "Run, run in the field and run in a zigzag!" </sentence><sentence id="214">And the two of us ran wildly in the field in all different directions. </sentence><sentence id="215">Of course, the ranger in his rage threw the axe in the field. </sentence><sentence id="216">Then he began to shoot at us. </sentence><sentence id="217">As he threw the axe in the field it hit the back of my sister's leg. </sentence><sentence id="218">She had a deep cut. </sentence><sentence id="219">We had to stop in the field. </sentence><sentence id="220">We had scarves. </sentence><sentence id="221">We took off our scarves. </sentence><sentence id="222">We tied her leg and we ran in the field all the way back to the community that we started from. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="223"> And it is for you to know that no one would let us come into their homes. </sentence><sentence id="224">No one would let us come into their home. </sentence><sentence id="225">Desperately, we were walking, hoping that we can find a place to hide, a place to hide. </sentence><sentence id="226">We were practically on the outskirts of town and there were no more homes left. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="227">All of a sudden, we passed by a house and the gate to the house was open, and there was a barn in the back of the house and the door to the barn was open, and we ran to hide in the barn. </sentence><sentence id="228">And to the side of the house all of a sudden the door opened, and there was a little window in the door, and a woman opened the door and, of course, we thought she would tell us -- turn us away. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="229">And this woman with her hands clasped said to us these words; "You do not have to tell me </sentence></p><p><sentence id="230"> where you're coming from. </sentence><sentence id="231">I know. </sentence><sentence id="232">God brought you to the right house. </sentence><sentence id="233">I will save you." </sentence><sentence id="234">A saintly Christian woman opened up her house, took us in, attended to my sister's wound, gave us food, opened up a sleeping sofa. </sentence><sentence id="235">They took out the inside of the sofa, put us both in, left enough air for us to breathe and kept us there the day of the massacre. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="236"> Iam convinced I am alive today because someone cared. </sentence><sentence id="237">Someone followed their conscience. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="238">Someone had a heart. </sentence><sentence id="239">Someone did what a human being is to do to the next one that is in kind of trouble that my sister and I were. </sentence><sentence id="240">The woman said, "God, if it should happen to my girls, please somebody, help them, too." </sentence><sentence id="241">And in this house there was a father and two daughters. </sentence><sentence id="242">They were exactly my sister's and my age, and while we were lying in the sofa, people, the neighbors came and sat on the sofa, telling her, telling the woman that they are going to search the Christian homes and they will punish the Christians that hide Jews, which is true, they did. </sentence><sentence id="243">They did. </sentence><sentence id="244">But the woman never vacillated. </sentence><sentence id="245">The woman never told us to leave or anything. </sentence><sentence id="246">In fact, she told her neighbor, "This is Nazi propaganda. </sentence><sentence id="247">Don't fall for it. </sentence><sentence id="248">It is impossible to search the homes. </sentence><sentence id="249">Don't fall for it. </sentence><sentence id="250">It is not true." </sentence><sentence id="251">And at no time at all did she tell us to leave, no time at all. </sentence><sentence id="252">When evening came -- was my sister's decision -- they took us out of the sofa. </sentence><sentence id="253">And the neighbors -- they closed the doors and made sure nobody comes in. </sentence><sentence id="254">And it was my sister's decision. </sentence><sentence id="255">She was naturally the older of the two, the wiser of the two. </sentence><sentence id="256">She said, "We must leave this house in case they do search. </sentence><sentence id="257">These people were so good to us. </sentence><sentence id="258">Why endanger them?" </sentence><sentence id="259">The father of the house took with him a blanket and a pillow and took us to a bombed out house. </sentence><sentence id="260">We didn't stay in the bombed out house. </sentence><sentence id="261">As soon as it got dark --because we were afraid in case somebody would find us. </sentence><sentence id="262">We were not so sure we would meet up with such good people. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="263"> These righteous Christians are almost like beacons in this darkness, pointing the fingers at others that could have done something too. </sentence><sentence id="264">There were so few, not so many. </sentence><sentence id="265">It is our great fortune that we met up with a saintly woman that never knew us, never got paid for it, did it out of the goodness of her heart. </sentence><sentence id="266">Following her conscience and would expect others to do it, too. </sentence><sentence id="267">We came to a farm house. </sentence><sentence id="268">We knocked on the window. </sentence><sentence id="269">They let us in. </sentence><sentence id="270">We told them that we are Jewish, that we want to change our clothes with them. </sentence><sentence id="271">We'll give them our city clothes and we wanted to change into -- let us give them our farmer's clothes. </sentence><sentence id="272">They gave us. </sentence><sentence id="273">They consented. </sentence><sentence id="274">We told them that we will not endanger them, that we will stay in the barn overnight and early in the morning we will leave. </sentence><sentence id="275">And they let us stay overnight in the barn. </sentence><sentence id="276">We stayed overnight in the barn. </sentence><sentence id="277">Early in the morning before sun, we started out just walking in the woods. </sentence><sentence id="278">And we knew of a woman, a farm woman that used to come during the Russian occupation to sell butter and chickens and eggs to my mother, and she invited us many times. </sentence><sentence id="279">She said, before the Nazi occupation, "Why don't you girls sometimes come and visit me? </sentence><sentence id="280">We have a beautiful lake and it's nice and we want to really show them hospitality." </sentence><sentence id="281">Do you know I remembered the woman's village? </sentence><sentence id="282">And we decided that we would go to this woman. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="283"> However, it was such a distance in the winter so we stayed in the woods. </sentence><sentence id="284">We lived -- we never went to a farm to ask for food because we were afraid. </sentence><sentence id="285">We never knew what kind of people we would meet up with. </sentence><sentence id="286">So we lived on the berry that we could find, the mushroom that we could find and we finally made our journey to this woman's house. </sentence><sentence id="287">She took us in. </sentence><sentence id="288">She kept us there for several days. </sentence><sentence id="289">I think two days if I recall, and she kept us hidden; she was very smart. </sentence><sentence id="290">She kept us hidden and she was a very popular woman, a very popular farm house in town with children. </sentence><sentence id="291">Evidently, they were wealthy so everybody in the farm, all the young people would gather there. </sentence><sentence id="292">So she told the young people when they asked her, "Who are these two girls?" </sentence><sentence id="293">She said, "Oh, I hire two maids to spin and to weave for the winter to make wool." </sentence><sentence id="294">So, she kept us there, and we begged her if the farmers go to town to Slonim, to see maybe somebody survive. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="295">Maybe they didn't kill all the Jews. </sentence><sentence id="296">And she made it in such a way -- she was very clever, very clever -- she made it in such a way that there was no suspicion that she's hiding two Jewish girls or anything. </sentence><sentence id="297">And she told the farmer, "You know, I used to sell eggs and butter to some Jews. </sentence><sentence id="298">I wonder if somebody still survived." </sentence><sentence id="299">The man came back and he told her, "Yes, but they killed 10,000 Jews" -- he heard -- "but there are still Jews." </sentence><sentence id="300">He saw them returning from a nightshift from work. </sentence><sentence id="301">My sister and I immediately left the farm house and we walked back on foot, back to the ghetto to see if somebody from the family survived. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="302"> We never asked for a ride because we were afraid. </sentence><sentence id="303">We would see farmers and such. </sentence><sentence id="304">We wouldn't approach them. </sentence><sentence id="305">We would run into the woods to hide. </sentence><sentence id="306">You must also realize it was winter. </sentence><sentence id="307">We couldn't live in the woods. </sentence><sentence id="308">The elements -- nor did have we food, nor did we have enough clothing in sub-zero weather, in cold. </sentence><sentence id="309">We made our way back to Slonim. </sentence><sentence id="310">We came back to Slonim, and on the outskirts we saw a group of Jews returning from work. </sentence><sentence id="311">We joined them. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="312">We sort of ran into their midst. </sentence><sentence id="313">We asked them if they knew our family. </sentence><sentence id="314">Nobody knew my family because we were really refugees already in Slonim. </sentence><sentence id="315">These were most of the people were natives. </sentence><sentence id="316">Nobody knew my family. </sentence><sentence id="317">We walked in with them to the ghetto. </sentence><sentence id="318">We were not counted. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="319">We just walked in. </sentence><sentence id="320">They kept us in the middle because we didn't have any stars on us and we came into that room where the six of us lived, and as I opened the door my mother was not there to greet me. </sentence><sentence id="321">Sol knew. </sentence><sentence id="322">My mother was killed. </sentence><sentence id="323">My aunt was killed. </sentence><sentence id="324">My father and my little brother survived. </sentence><sentence id="325">And talking about courage -- I'm a parent now. </sentence><sentence id="326">I'm a grandparent already. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="327">Imagine my mother taking two girls, sending them into the unknowns so they would live. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="328">Imagine what went through her mind. </sentence><sentence id="329">My father and my little brother were hiding outside of the ghetto. </sentence><sentence id="330">My mother remained. </sentence><sentence id="331">My aunt was sick and my mother would not leave my aunt. </sentence><sentence id="332">She stayed with her. </sentence><sentence id="333">That doesn't mean were she outside of the ghetto my mother would have survived, but at least her chances would be better. </sentence><sentence id="334">Both of their chances would be better. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="335"> They shrank the ghetto. </sentence><sentence id="336">They made it smaller and we moved in on the street Operowa. </sentence><sentence id="337">We moved in. </sentence><sentence id="338">We had one room. </sentence><sentence id="339">There were two rooms, a very rundown place, but -- however it was a little brick house and it was close to the gate where the ghetto was. </sentence><sentence id="340">In one room the four of us lived, a tiny little room. </sentence><sentence id="341">We had a bed, one bed where the three of us, the children slept and Daddy slept on a little bed cot, sort of. </sentence><sentence id="342">Next door, the other room was a family, a young family, newly married and a brother that lived with them and they were wonderful to us. </sentence><sentence id="343">Wonderful. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="344"> They did not have children of their own. </sentence><sentence id="345">They shared absolutely everything with us. </sentence><sentence id="346">The little bit of extra food, the extra hot water to wash. </sentence><sentence id="347">They sort of thought that maybe, maybe one of us will survive or something. </sentence><sentence id="348">I don't know. </sentence><sentence id="349">It wasn't told to us but I somehow had the feeling. </sentence><sentence id="350">And my father went to a slave labor. </sentence><sentence id="351">I did not work in the ghetto. </sentence><sentence id="352">I was too young. </sentence><sentence id="353">In fact, my little brother would run out of the ghetto. </sentence><sentence id="354">He was blond and really, his Polish was so very good, and he did many, many times run out on the Christian side, come back, would bring some food. </sentence><sentence id="355">And it is in this ghetto where we first moved in. </sentence><sentence id="356">In December of 1941 a young man came into the house. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="357"> Next to our house was a wooden house, larger, with more rooms and naturally more people lived there -- crowded, one on top of the other. </sentence><sentence id="358">And there was a young man that I knew that I really knew yet from the Russian occupation because he went to the same school that I did, but he was older. </sentence><sentence id="359">He was in a higher grade -- came in one evening and he brought with him a fellow that was, I thought, so much older than I was, and he introduced me and he was a young man. </sentence><sentence id="360">He said his name Aron Dereczynski. </sentence><sentence id="361">They called him Arkie and he kept on coming, and there was a friendship that developed. </sentence><sentence id="362">He worked in the Verpflegungsamt(r). </sentence><sentence id="363">Did he have a chance really to have food? </sentence><sentence id="364">Do I really need to explain and to tell the value of food in the ghetto when there was such hunger? </sentence><sentence id="365">When a slice of bread meant -- when everyone aspired to have enough. </sentence><sentence id="366">And my sister liked him right away. </sentence><sentence id="367">My father sort of -- since my mother was killed, my aunt was killed, my sister really sort of took the motherly part, even though she wasn't that all -- she was so wonderful to us, so caring. </sentence><sentence id="368">She was a student before the war and I never expected her to come in and to this role, but how beautifully she did it. </sentence><sentence id="369">How kind and nice she was to us. </sentence><sentence id="370">She wasn't really that much older than we were. </sentence><sentence id="371">And as a friendship developed, Aron would come. </sentence><sentence id="372">You know, there was curfew. </sentence><sentence id="373">Nowhere could you have gone or do anything. </sentence><sentence id="374">And meanwhile, terrible things were happening in the ghetto. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="375"> People were being killed. </sentence><sentence id="376">Not in mass but they would hang somebody for bringing in food. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="377">They would kill somebody. </sentence><sentence id="378">They found a bottle of milk in his possession, and the ghetto was tense at the killings. </sentence><sentence id="379">And then --I guess it's a human quality -- people would sort of like relax and it was almost like normalcy. </sentence><sentence id="380">I really don't know why they thought it was normalcy, but the tragedy was a community tragedy. </sentence><sentence id="381">Everybody was in the same shoes. </sentence><sentence id="382">There was no family that wasn't touched. </sentence><sentence id="383">Everybody lost someone and maybe it was at this particular time easier to share the grief because everybody cried. </sentence><sentence id="384">Everybody was in the same position losing their loved ones. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="385">And I developed a friendship with Aron. </sentence><sentence id="386">It was more than a friendship, really -- more than a friendship. </sentence><sentence id="387">It was "boy and girl," even in this abnormal circumstances. </sentence><sentence id="388">As time went on in the ghetto and it was quasi-quiet. </sentence><sentence id="389">The Judenrat? </sentence><sentence id="390">had problems all the time with the slave labor. </sentence><sentence id="391">The Judenrat had problems with the terrible demands always being made on delivery. </sentence><sentence id="392">Deliver them that much gold and that much silver and the valuables. </sentence><sentence id="393">Slave labor in great numbers also the Judenrat also was faced. </sentence><sentence id="394">People did not want to go to work. </sentence><sentence id="395">They really -- I'm talking about 8 Food distribution bureau (German) deg Jewish council (German); term used for Jewish administrative boards appointed by the Nazis to oversee Jewish communities and ghettos. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="396"> Slonim -- they try to cope with it as best as they could. </sentence><sentence id="397">And I -- when I think back and I reflect and a lot of really thinking, intellectualizing and such, we always must put the blame on the enemy. </sentence><sentence id="398">They were forced to do it. </sentence><sentence id="399">When they did not do it, they were killed for it. </sentence><sentence id="400">How many of us have the fiber really to say to a stand, to take death instead of doing what you are told to do. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="401">There was no suicides in the ghetto. </sentence><sentence id="402">People did not have the means. </sentence><sentence id="403">They did not have the poison to do it with, no guns, but yet there was a tremendous urge to live, to live, that tremendous self-defense to live. </sentence><sentence id="404">People did everything that they could at the time, in their power. </sentence><sentence id="405">Whatever they could was possible for them to do to survive and it was so hard to survive. </sentence><sentence id="406">It was almost impossible to survive -- almost impossible. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="407"> This is why so few people survived. </sentence><sentence id="408">And again, when a government, an organized government -- they have to have power, an army, the money, an unfriendly population that does not want to help for most part except for the righteous, and there were not so many numbers. </sentence><sentence id="409">They can do it to any people, not only to Jews. </sentence><sentence id="410">Time went on. </sentence><sentence id="411">Time went on and meanwhile, there was -- people began to think of survival. </sentence><sentence id="412">The young, some of the young were involved in joining together in the underground. </sentence><sentence id="413">I was only not part of it. </sentence><sentence id="414">I was too young. </sentence><sentence id="415">We were refugees. </sentence><sentence id="416">I guess an underground you really have to develop strong roots to be able to trust the group as a unit together. </sentence><sentence id="417">I was too young and we were refugees and my sister was not part of the underground. </sentence><sentence id="418">Neither did she know anyone that was because also it was so terribly secretive. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="419">How would one know unless you were approached and asked and really become part of this unit? </sentence><sentence id="420">People in the ghetto began to build hiding places. </sentence><sentence id="421">They called them malines!deg. </sentence><sentence id="422">It was probably a Jewish word for a hiding place. </sentence><sentence id="423">In every ghetto that we lived everybody called it a maline, a hiding place. </sentence><sentence id="424">Where were these hiding places? </sentence><sentence id="425">People imagined every possible place that they could build a place where they could hide, where they could hide. </sentence><sentence id="426">Is it in the yard, ina hovel dug out? </sentence><sentence id="427">Is it under the floor? </sentence><sentence id="428">Is it in an attic? </sentence><sentence id="429">Is it some place in a shack, or is it even in the room concealed with a big credenza or something? </sentence><sentence id="430">People didn't have already, this. </sentence><sentence id="431">The furniture was taken away because periodically there were the men from the Gestapo for furniture. </sentence><sentence id="432">So everything that had any value of any was taken out of the ghetto. </sentence><sentence id="433">But people have these old armoires yet, broken up yet. </sentence><sentence id="434">So some people built hiding places beneath, concealed it with an armoire or with something of that sort -- anything imaginable that people could think. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="435">They did everything humanly possible to find a place to hide, because it sort of taught to the people -- the first massacre -- were people to hide even under the bed. </sentence><sentence id="436">When we came in back from the massacre, my sister and I, how much I cried and screamed. " </sentence><sentence id="437">Why didn't mother hide? </sentence></p><p><sentence id="438">Why didn't mother hide?" </sentence><sentence id="439">Little did I know that maybe it was impossible for her to hide. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="440"> But I was a child. </sentence><sentence id="441">I needed my mother. </sentence><sentence id="442">And time went out. </sentence><sentence id="443">Everybody in the ghetto had a place to hide. </sentence><sentence id="444">Everybody in the ghetto had a place to hide. </sentence><sentence id="445">In fact, between the two homes where we lived, we had a hiding place for 30 people -- for everybody there to hide. </sentence><sentence id="446">It wasn't anything so very intricate. </sentence><sentence id="447">It was under the floor. </sentence><sentence id="448">And all of a sudden on a Sunday there were already signs that something is going to happen. </sentence><sentence id="449">In between when Aron used to come to the house -- all the time, you know, he was such a wonderful spirit. </sentence><sentence id="450">He was so confident and he would tell me 10 hideout (Yiddish) </sentence></p><p><sentence id="451"> things. </sentence><sentence id="452">That he belonged to Ha-Shomer ha-Za'ir!!. </sentence><sentence id="453">I, in my town, did not belong to a Zionist organization. </sentence><sentence id="454">There were not enough really children for a group -- for a Zionist group -- but I knew about it. </sentence><sentence id="455">I read about it and I knew very well, because in the town in Suwalki where my sister went to gymnasium there were Zionists" organizations. </sentence><sentence id="456">And my cousins belonged to the Zionists" groups, so this was not strange to me. </sentence><sentence id="457">But he always -- and he told me that just before the war he was supposed to go to agricultural school in Palestine and it didn't work out for him. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="458">But one day, one day, maybe he still will get there. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="459"> And I would listen to him and it would give me confidence. </sentence><sentence id="460">I sort of looked so much forward to his visits -- to his visits. </sentence><sentence id="461">And he always also knew a little bit of news, because in the Verpflegungsamt, out by the Germans where he worked -- this was the Wehrmacht", the army, the German army that he worked for in this huge, huge depository of food. </sentence><sentence id="462">They would sometimes listen to the radio to German radio, so they approximately knew where the Front was. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="463">And then they even had, he said, they even have a clandestine radio, which was to me like something like a fairy tale thing. </sentence><sentence id="464">And our friendship grew. </sentence><sentence id="465">Our friendship grew and we really became a boy and a girlfriend. </sentence><sentence id="466">By this time June rolled around, and all of a sudden, all of a sudden on a Sunday, a strange army rolled around the ghetto. </sentence><sentence id="467">The ghetto by that time was sealed --was closed with barbed wires. </sentence><sentence id="468">There was not loose at all -- the gate and the people counted. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="469">Always guards around the perimeter of the ghetto, much smaller after the first massacre. </sentence><sentence id="470">They shrank the ghetto, made it much smaller and the congestion was much more. </sentence><sentence id="471">And a terrible panic in the ghetto. </sentence><sentence id="472">What could these people have done? </sentence><sentence id="473">Very, very little. </sentence><sentence id="474">Only to hide -- keep them there. </sentence><sentence id="475">There weren't as many Christians that would accept Jews to hide, keep them there. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="476">With an exception, I say again, of the righteous. </sentence><sentence id="477">The idea was to hide and to try and see maybe we will survive by hiding. </sentence><sentence id="478">By Sunday night the panic grew and Monday morning, early in the morning, we heard shots. </sentence><sentence id="479">We lived very close to the gate. </sentence><sentence id="480">We lived on the Operowa and the gate was on a Operowa and I learned later that it was the head of the Judenrat, Gershon Kwint that came in when this Einsatzgruppen group, and this army of killers came in to the gate to march into the ghetto. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="481"> He asked them, "What are you doing with my people?" </sentence><sentence id="482">He was shot and this is the shots that we heard because we were close to the gate. </sentence><sentence id="483">We were already by this time in hiding and the rest of the ghetto was hidden. </sentence><sentence id="484">The ghetto was hidden and we separated with my sister. </sentence><sentence id="485">The place for us, all of our neighbor, the two neighboring homes to hide was in the middle -- was under the sidewalk. </sentence><sentence id="486">And my father walked in to see at this place and he said there were children and also he said the children might start to cry, and he felt that he couldn't breathe. </sentence><sentence id="487">He said, "I don't have enough air there to breathe. </sentence><sentence id="488">I will not go there. </sentence><sentence id="489">I'll choke to death. </sentence><sentence id="490">We will not go." </sentence><sentence id="491">My sister ran across the street to find out the house, which was by the name of the Jachwidowicz house across the street from us. </sentence><sentence id="492">Well, she was never able to return because the massacre -- because the Aktion started. </sentence><sentence id="493">My father, my little brother and I remained in the house and my father, the three of us, tried to hide in the house. </sentence><sentence id="494">Where were we hidden? </sentence><sentence id="495">The kitchen had an old-fashioned oven "! </sentence><sentence id="496">youth guard (Hebrew), Zionist youth organization. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="497">Armed forces (German) </sentence></p><p><sentence id="498"> where before -- for baking bread. </sentence><sentence id="499">To the side it was a deep oven. </sentence><sentence id="500">To the side was a little opening for three people just to squeeze in where wood was kept in normal times. </sentence><sentence id="501">In normal times wood was kept. </sentence><sentence id="502">Of course, we didn't have any wood in the ghetto. </sentence><sentence id="503">The kitchen was wallpapered and it was really shreds sort of hanging. </sentence><sentence id="504">When they used to come to take people on slave labor, my father used to hide in this spot. </sentence><sentence id="505">How did he hide there? </sentence><sentence id="506">He had a piece of cardboard that he held almost, held from the inside that matched the rest of the wallpaper in the kitchen, torn the same way as the rest to conceal this entrance into this little place next to the oven. </sentence><sentence id="507">And my father said the three of us run and hide there. </sentence><sentence id="508">Monday morning when we heard the shooting already in the house, we ran in to hide behind this oven in this little space that was open. </sentence><sentence id="509">They came in. </sentence><sentence id="510">The killers came in to the house. </sentence><sentence id="511">They searched the house. </sentence><sentence id="512">They knocked on the walls. </sentence><sentence id="513">They never came to this spot. " </sentence><sentence id="514">Raus, raus, raus!!*" </sentence><sentence id="515">And then we heard cries and we heard shooting and we realized that the people next door were discovered. </sentence><sentence id="516">We remained in this place, frozen. </sentence><sentence id="517">There was no place to move. </sentence><sentence id="518">For one of us to make a turn -- all three of us had to move to be able for one of us to make a turn. </sentence><sentence id="519">My little brother was a child. </sentence><sentence id="520">It was so hard on him. </sentence><sentence id="521">It was very hard on all three of us. </sentence><sentence id="522">We stayed there the day. </sentence><sentence id="523">We survived the day. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="524"> At night my father said that we cannot stay there. </sentence><sentence id="525">It's not safe. </sentence><sentence id="526">We'll be found there. </sentence><sentence id="527">We must hide somewhere else. </sentence><sentence id="528">We did not hide any more in this place. </sentence><sentence id="529">It was open because we couldn't cover it. </sentence><sentence id="530">It was all open. </sentence><sentence id="531">The part that covered this entrance was broken. </sentence><sentence id="532">So we went in the yard. </sentence><sentence id="533">There were shacks on the side and as we went out of the house in the shacks, we realized that the ghetto is burning while we stayed in the house. </sentence><sentence id="534">We didn't know, hidden in the house. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="535">We didn't smell anything. </sentence><sentence id="536">We didn't know. </sentence><sentence id="537">All of a sudden we went in, in the yard and we saw that the ghetto is burning. </sentence><sentence id="538">But we had no alternative, so we went to the last shack. </sentence><sentence id="539">There were a row of shacks. </sentence><sentence id="540">The last shack we walked in and we saw that there was a ladder and there was a trapdoor, and we crawled up the ladder and we opened up the trapdoor. </sentence><sentence id="541">There was a loft that hardly you could squeeze in and we found two old Jewish men, the old Mr. Margolis(ph) and Mr. Fink(ph). </sentence><sentence id="542">And we asked them, "What, what -- where are all the rest of the people?" </sentence><sentence id="543">They said they did not hide in with the rest of the people, because they knew they couldn't breathe there. </sentence><sentence id="544">They were coughing and they didn't want to endanger the other people, so they did not hide with the rest of the family. </sentence><sentence id="545">They were hidden in this shack and we came to this shack. </sentence><sentence id="546">We walked up and threw the ladder away so it wouldn't be a sign that some people are hiding in the shack there on top in the loft and we stayed there. </sentence><sentence id="547">We stayed there. </sentence><sentence id="548">We didn't have any food at all. </sentence><sentence id="549">Daddy went at night and he brought water. </sentence><sentence id="550">He found he could not find any bread in the house. </sentence><sentence id="551">Nothing was in the house. </sentence><sentence id="552">He brought water so we still had water, and we stayed there Monday night, Tuesday and Wednesday and we watched the fire, the ghetto burning. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="553"> I do not know how it was possible that this shack did not catch on fire. </sentence><sentence id="554">I do not know but it didn't. </sentence><sentence id="555">And we survived in this shack. </sentence><sentence id="556">And while we were lying in the shack, my father said, "What even if we survive? </sentence><sentence id="557">All the Jews are killed. </sentence><sentence id="558">What are we going to do even if we survive? </sentence></p><p><sentence id="559">What am I going to do with my two children? </sentence><sentence id="560">Where are we going to go?" </sentence><sentence id="561">But we didn't. </sentence><sentence id="562">We stayed. </sentence><sentence id="563">We stayed in the shack hoping for a miracle. </sentence><sentence id="564">On Thursday afternoon we heard noise in 3 out (German) </sentence></p><p><sentence id="565"> the front and we -- all of a sudden we heard steps in the back and somebody calling in Yiddish. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="566">"Lisa, Lisa," and, "Jews, if anybody's hiding, answer, answer." </sentence><sentence id="567">I couldn't believe it. </sentence><sentence id="568">I could not believe it, that this was possible, and I wiggle my father. " </sentence><sentence id="569">That sounds like Aron, that sounds like his voice." </sentence><sentence id="570">My little brother opened the trap and I answered, I answered. </sentence><sentence id="571">Aron came into the shack. </sentence><sentence id="572">My little brother opened the trap and he leaned over and he said, "Yes, the three of us are here. </sentence><sentence id="573">We survived the fire and we're still here." </sentence><sentence id="574">So Aron said that the massacre -- they are still purging people but it is already much quieter and it looks like they will leave some people. </sentence><sentence id="575">They will let some people live, survive. </sentence><sentence id="576">So all of a sudden a ray of hope sort of came in and then Aron tells me, "Go down. </sentence><sentence id="577">Climb down from the loft, from the shack." </sentence><sentence id="578">I jumped down. </sentence><sentence id="579">He took me-- </sentence></p><p><sentence id="580"> End of Tape Number One. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="581"> Tape Number Two </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="582">Q: Why don't we start with hearing the voices calling in Yiddish. </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="583">A: As we were sitting there, it was in the afternoon. </sentence><sentence id="584">In fact, I'm sure it was in the afternoon. </sentence><sentence id="585">All of a sudden we heard footsteps. </sentence><sentence id="586">Of course, we froze. </sentence><sentence id="587">We thought that it's Germans again coming to find us. </sentence><sentence id="588">All of a sudden there were voices in Yiddish -- in Jewish and I heard, "Lisa, Lisa." </sentence><sentence id="589">At first I couldn't believe it and then I also heard in Yiddish saying "Jews, Yidden, Jews!If anybody is hiding, please answer, please answer." </sentence><sentence id="590">And I nudged my little brother and I said, "Daddy," I said, "it sounds like Aron. </sentence><sentence id="591">Could it be?" </sentence><sentence id="592">And I answered and as I answered, Aron walked into the shack. </sentence><sentence id="593">My little brother opened up the latch and, of course, can you imagine the kind of feeling that went through me? </sentence><sentence id="594">My wildest dream would I ever imagine that I am ever going to see Aron again? </sentence><sentence id="595">And here he came really to the rescue like. </sentence><sentence id="596">He looked at me. </sentence><sentence id="597">By this time we were sitting there already three or four days without food, only with water, being so cramped in that there was no room to turn. </sentence><sentence id="598">And it was a very hard on my little brother. </sentence><sentence id="599">He was so restless and every time he had to move all of us had to turn. </sentence><sentence id="600">I jumped down. </sentence><sentence id="601">Aron took me to the house, to the empty house. </sentence><sentence id="602">Of course, all the houses were empty. </sentence><sentence id="603">The people were gone already by this time. </sentence><sentence id="604">He took me upstairs to an attic and he looked around for a while. </sentence><sentence id="605">He looked for some clothes and he came in and he brought with him a boy's jacket and a pair of pants. </sentence><sentence id="606">Women in Europe at the time, this particular time, never wore pants, and he found a scissor and he stood there. </sentence><sentence id="607">And I was in shock, in complete shock and he said to me that he's going to dress me like a boy because women are not allowed to live. </sentence><sentence id="608">He found the scissor and he cut my hair completely. </sentence><sentence id="609">He left a little stubs on my head and I did everything that he told me to do. </sentence><sentence id="610">He put on a cap on me and as I walked down, there was a mirror and I took a look. </sentence><sentence id="611">I took off the cap and I took a look at myself. </sentence><sentence id="612">I was frightened to see what I look like without -- shaven, not shaven but practically shaven -- without hair. </sentence><sentence id="613">But I followed him and I walked out. </sentence><sentence id="614">We came to the street and four Jewish men were waiting there. </sentence><sentence id="615">They were the men that Aron worked with and already he had enough time to tell me that he has kept Miller, the head of the Verpflegungsamt that he works for, asked him to come into the ghetto and to find some valuables -- I don't know -- riches, riches to enrich himself on this tragedy. </sentence><sentence id="616">And he said -- Aron said, "It was my idea because I wanted to come to the ghetto to see if I can still find someone alive. </sentence><sentence id="617">And maybe he has had an opportunity to take you out with me." </sentence><sentence id="618">He told me that his mother and his three sisters are alive, that he left them in the hiding place because he says he could not take four people out. </sentence><sentence id="619">And he says, "I could not even decide; who would I take out of the four?" </sentence><sentence id="620">They put in -- they were carrying, -- all the men had on them it looked like chandeliers, really nothing fancy to speak about. </sentence><sentence id="621">Maybe it was old something with some wires. </sentence><sentence id="622">They took off-- one man gave me a chandelier sort of -- I don't know, you call it a chandelier -- something that resembles a chandelier, and he put it over my shoulder and he put some wires around my neck, and we walked out. </sentence><sentence id="623">All of us walked out. </sentence><sentence id="624">We came to the gate and the guard was at the gate and Aron very confidently -- all of us carried something. </sentence><sentence id="625">Some of the men carried something in pillowcases. </sentence><sentence id="626">I didn't even know what they carried there. </sentence><sentence id="627">I learned later that all of it was for Miller, and all of us walked out. </sentence><sentence id="628">Aron waved confidently his slip of paper that Miller gave him to come into the ghetto. </sentence><sentence id="629">They came in into the ghetto with Fritz which was one of the Wehrmacht, regular soldiers that worked in the Verpflegungsamt and he waited for them. </sentence><sentence id="630">Across the way from the ghetto directly across was the house where the men that the German Wehrmacht that ran this Verpflegungsamt lived there. </sentence><sentence id="631">It was Captain Miller, the head of the Verpflegungsamt and Bauer also a captain and one more, a German, and two regular German men. </sentence><sentence id="632">So I was absolutely numb. </sentence><sentence id="633">I didn't really know except to follow and to do what I was told to do. </sentence><sentence id="634">Aron took me into the German's house. </sentence><sentence id="635">I could not believe why he would do it, but he didn't take me to the upstairs. </sentence><sentence id="636">He took me to the basement. </sentence><sentence id="637">He left me in the basement within a pile of old furniture that was lying there and I hid behind the furniture. </sentence><sentence id="638">All of a sudden a young Jewish boy came down and he searched for me. </sentence><sentence id="639">And he said to me, "Don't be frightened, don't worry. </sentence><sentence id="640">I will help you. </sentence><sentence id="641">I will do everything that needs to be done for you," he said. </sentence><sentence id="642">And the first thing what he did is he brought me food. </sentence><sentence id="643">He brought me food. </sentence><sentence id="644">And when I looked at him, he was a child. </sentence><sentence id="645">He looked to me like he was not older than 12 or 13 years old. </sentence><sentence id="646">And he said, "Don't worry, I'll take care of you." </sentence><sentence id="647">And he did. </sentence><sentence id="648">He did everything what he could. </sentence><sentence id="649">He said to me, "There are maids working here, but I will not let them go in the basement. </sentence><sentence id="650">Everything that they need, I will run and get it so that they won't come down in the basement to find you." </sentence><sentence id="651">And he did. </sentence><sentence id="652">But all of a sudden as I was sitting there hidden, Bauer walked in. </sentence><sentence id="653">I didn't know anything about Bauer. </sentence><sentence id="654">Can you imagine how frightened I was?Here was a German came in and he found me. </sentence><sentence id="655">I was sure he was going to shoot me right there on the spot, but behind him was Aron. </sentence><sentence id="656">And Bauer tells me, "Stand up." </sentence><sentence id="657">And I stood up. </sentence><sentence id="658">I stood up and he said, "Do you have girl's clothes?" </sentence><sentence id="659">And I said "Yes, underneath I have girl's clothes." </sentence><sentence id="660">Because I still had the clothes that I went into hiding. </sentence><sentence id="661">And he said -- then the little boy ran down, the Jewish boy, and he brought me a babushka. </sentence><sentence id="662">He said, "Take off your Boise's clothes. </sentence><sentence id="663">Put on this babushka and come with me. </sentence><sentence id="664">I'll take you to the Verpflegungsamt." </sentence><sentence id="665">And he walked -- we walked out. </sentence><sentence id="666">I learned later that Aron asked Miller -- he said, "I'm hiding -- I brought here my sister. </sentence><sentence id="667">Please do something for her to save her." </sentence><sentence id="668">And Miller pounded on the table saying, "My place is no place to hide Jews. </sentence><sentence id="669">Take her out of here immediately." </sentence><sentence id="670">So then Aron approached Bauer, evidently while the ghetto was burning, and when Bauer passed by and saw the shooting and the killing...he was a decent human being and that he was terribly upset. </sentence><sentence id="671">And he said, "How could I believe it that my people can do something like this?" </sentence><sentence id="672">And so Aron approached Bauer. </sentence><sentence id="673">He had no alternative. </sentence><sentence id="674">He had to take me out of this German house. </sentence><sentence id="675">He approached Bauer and Bauer walked with me. </sentence><sentence id="676">Do you know the house where they lived was across the street from the school, the high school that I went to before the invasion? </sentence><sentence id="677">It was recess and the children were walking out of school during recess and I thought to myself, "Why am I so cursed? </sentence><sentence id="678">My parents were such good people. </sentence><sentence id="679">I am equal to all of these children. </sentence><sentence id="680">Why is it done to me? </sentence><sentence id="681">What have I done? </sentence><sentence id="682">Then this befell me. </sentence><sentence id="683">What have I done? </sentence><sentence id="684">They are free and here I am being taken to the unknown, maybe to death for nothing that I have done." </sentence><sentence id="685">I always thought the Jews were good people. </sentence><sentence id="686">All the people that I knew were Jewish were good. </sentence><sentence id="687">I am sure there some maybe that were not so good, but maybe I didn't know them as a child. </sentence><sentence id="688">I walked with Bauer. </sentence><sentence id="689">He told me to walk on the sidewalk. </sentence><sentence id="690">I did not have my yellow stars. </sentence><sentence id="691">I walked with him. </sentence><sentence id="692">We came to the Verpflegungsamt and there already the man that worked the Verpflegungsamt waited for me to come and to hide me somewhere. </sentence><sentence id="693">They made a hiding place for me. </sentence><sentence id="694">The hiding place was; they took out two sacks or three sacks and they covered it. </sentence><sentence id="695">They found a piece of plywood, put a piece of plywood -- put a sack to cover the plywood or two sacks to cover the plywood and marked it because it was a huge warehouse, with hundreds and hundreds of sacks of flour, of corn, of oats, of everything. </sentence><sentence id="696">It really supplied the entire area around Slonim -- that there rations were given out to the Germans, to the Pole, to everybody from this warehouse. </sentence><sentence id="697">They marked it in such a way so that they would know where I was hidden. </sentence><sentence id="698">They made just enough space in this little tiny place where they took out the several sacks for me to crawl in and to lie there, and they left enough space of air to come in so I could breathe and I stayed there. </sentence><sentence id="699">I stayed there. </sentence><sentence id="700">When night came everybody left, and I remained all by myself in this warehouse, hidden. </sentence><sentence id="701">And as I said, I remained in the warehouse. </sentence><sentence id="702">All of a sudden I was being scratched by rats, lying there. </sentence><sentence id="703">And I was afraid that I was going to be devoured by them, that they will scratch me, eat me practically. </sentence><sentence id="704">And with all my might that I possessed, I pushed the sacks back and I crawled out of this space. </sentence><sentence id="705">And all night long I was sitting on top and running away from the rats. </sentence><sentence id="706">Then when morning came and I knew that they were going to open up the warehouse, I was afraid for them to find me. </sentence><sentence id="707">Maybe the Germans would come before the Jews would come into this warehouse. </sentence><sentence id="708">I crawled in again and I was able, not very well, but to cover myself again, pulling that sack to cover as I entered. </sentence><sentence id="709">It wasn't very well concealed but enough not to notice. </sentence><sentence id="710">And anyway, if the Germans didn't know that I was hidden some place where they would go and check thousands of sacks of flour to find me. </sentence><sentence id="711">The next day they already allowed for people to live. </sentence><sentence id="712">They allowed for people to live. </sentence><sentence id="713">The people that still remained hidden were told to go out from the hiding place. </sentence><sentence id="714">They took them all to the jail, the people, and they started there the selection left and right, who to live and who to die. </sentence><sentence id="715">To the left and to the right and to the left and to the right. </sentence><sentence id="716">I was not there but I learned about it from my father and my little brother, because my father and my little brother still remained hidden. </sentence><sentence id="717">And then they heard that there was a reprieve and you can really go out. </sentence><sentence id="718">They came out and were told that they were going to be given a Schein, this certificate to live -- this I.D. card to live. </sentence><sentence id="719">But they were taken to the jail first and there they would be given the certificate. </sentence><sentence id="720">And there they started the selection and somehow, somehow my father was given the card, was sent to the right side to live and my little brother remained on the other side, and he ran and he tried to beg this Nazi, to beg him that he wants to be with his father. </sentence><sentence id="721">He wants his father and I guess in his, with all of his viciousness and with all of his thoughts of inhumanity, he found really a trace of caring. </sentence><sentence id="722">He threw my little brother. </sentence><sentence id="723">He grabbed him and he threw him to my father, and he survived. </sentence><sentence id="724">He was let out of the jail with my father. </sentence><sentence id="725">And I knew about it because one of the men came to the Verpflegungsamt and told me, "I saw your father and I saw your little brother and they were alive, and they survived the selection in the jail and they are alive." </sentence><sentence id="726">And here they said that women already can live, too. </sentence><sentence id="727">Women already can live, too. </sentence><sentence id="728">I did not stay in the Verpflegungsamt. </sentence><sentence id="729">They put us up in the Beutelager!*. </sentence><sentence id="730">It was a really a huge army barracks that were built for the Polish Army way before the war, and there they collected all the surplus of broken up, damaged arms from the war, Russian arms that they "4 Warehouse of confiscated goods and valuables (German) collected. </sentence><sentence id="731">And this is really where the young Jews that were involved in the underground work were able to steal the arms and to smuggle them in piece by piece into the ghetto. </sentence><sentence id="732">Or in some way, Germans that were -- some of them that were bartering with Jews even brought it in under boxes of soap, hidden under soap that was brought in into the ghetto. </sentence><sentence id="733">Approximately, not more maybe between 800, 900 maybe 1,000 people remained from the entire ghetto, from 20,000 people. </sentence><sentence id="734">And they left a little small little ghetto, besides the people that lived in the Beutelager. </sentence><sentence id="735">The Beutelager where were all the young people that still worked in the Beutelager or the Verpflegungsamt, and every day, every morning there was an appell! </sentence><sentence id="736">&gt;, we had to go out to be counted. </sentence><sentence id="737">They would come in the middle of the night with lights, have us all come out and to be counted. </sentence><sentence id="738">The people that lived on the last ghetto, the several homes around the river on the street that's called Mostawa were given an identification, a little tiny piece made out of clay with a number that you had to wear around your neck all the time -- all the time besides your round badge. </sentence><sentence id="739">I stayed at the time in the Beutelager, and my father and my little brother stayed on Mostawa. </sentence><sentence id="740">I used to go -- I too had this badge that I wore and you were allowed to go from the Beutelager to Mostawa. </sentence><sentence id="741">Already my father was thinking that we must leave this ghetto, we must run away from here. </sentence><sentence id="742">And my father evidently went out of the ghetto and found a farmer, a woman, a farm woman that he still had some means to pay her with. </sentence><sentence id="743">I really do not know what he gave this farm woman. </sentence><sentence id="744">I don't remember what daddy still had but he still had some valuables. </sentence><sentence id="745">I know because he still had it in Wilno -- the ghetto that he managed to hide. </sentence><sentence id="746">And this woman, we traveled by horse and buggy. </sentence><sentence id="747">We went out of the ghetto. </sentence><sentence id="748">We were not caught of course, otherwise I wouldn't be here to tell you the story. </sentence><sentence id="749">And we were hidden under a big wagon with hay. </sentence><sentence id="750">We were under the hay until we came out of the outskirts of Slonim. </sentence><sentence id="751">Then she told us that we can be in the open. </sentence><sentence id="752">Neither of us looked Jewish. </sentence><sentence id="753">My little brother was blond with blue eyes. </sentence><sentence id="754">He was almost a towhead. </sentence><sentence id="755">I was blond with blue eyes and my father did not look Jewish either. </sentence><sentence id="756">No, he didn't. </sentence><sentence id="757">So, she really relaxed and told us we can even be on the open and we came in. </sentence><sentence id="758">We came into a village to a farm house and we were hidden. </sentence><sentence id="759">We were hidden, and while we were hidden Partisans came into the village and my little brother begged, "Daddy, let's go with the Partisans." </sentence><sentence id="760">But my father said to him, "My child, I am too old. </sentence><sentence id="761">They won't take me. </sentence><sentence id="762">They won't take you either. </sentence><sentence id="763">You are a child and your sister is a girl. </sentence><sentence id="764">You entertaining an idea that is just a dream. </sentence><sentence id="765">They won't take us. </sentence><sentence id="766">We must continue to another ghetto." </sentence><sentence id="767">We came to Volkovysk. </sentence><sentence id="768">We came to the Judenrat. </sentence><sentence id="769">We told them that we want to go to Grodno. </sentence><sentence id="770">The whole idea of Grodno --because Grodno was still annexed to the Third Reich, and the killings in 1942 in the summer of "42 they were unheard of in the Third Reich. </sentence><sentence id="771">And we somehow heard by way of people coming -- I don't know really -- Daddy heard that they are not killing people in -- the Third Reich. </sentence><sentence id="772">The Jews are still going to work in the Third Reich and maybe they are not going to kill the people in -- the Jews in the Third Reich. </sentence><sentence id="773">In the beginning Daddy thought so. </sentence><sentence id="774">Then we finally came to Volkovysk and we got passage and we came to Grodno. </sentence><sentence id="775">We came to Grodno to a world that already for us did not exist -- already since occupation. </sentence><sentence id="776">Everybody was killed in pits. </sentence><sentence id="777">And here the ghetto was quasi -- sort of free --the first ghetto, the second ghetto -- the working ghetto -- the ghetto that people did not work. </sentence><sentence id="778">You were able to walk from one ghetto to another. </sentence><sentence id="779">In fact, my mother had a cousin that lived in Grodno. </sentence><sentence id="780">She was in the second ghetto with a husband and wife and two children "S roll call (German). </sentence><sentence id="781">that my brother and I adored. </sentence><sentence id="782">And as soon as we came we ran. </sentence><sentence id="783">We found out that they lived in the second ghetto. </sentence><sentence id="784">We ran to them to see the family, to tell them about our misfortune, that my mother was killed. </sentence><sentence id="785">My sister was killed. </sentence><sentence id="786">I didn't mention really that my sister was killed in the second Aktion. </sentence><sentence id="787">In June of 1942 they found the place where she was hiding. </sentence><sentence id="788">They took all the people out and my sister knew what to expect, and she ran to the barbed wires to run out on the Christian side and she was shot on the barbed wires. </sentence><sentence id="789">I lost my wonderful sister, the one I loved so much. </sentence><sentence id="790">We shared with them our misfortune, telling them what happened. </sentence><sentence id="791">And we lived. </sentence><sentence id="792">We came back to the first ghetto. </sentence><sentence id="793">We came back to the first ghetto. </sentence><sentence id="794">I had -- my mother had another cousin in this ghetto but they did not have enough food for us. </sentence><sentence id="795">They lived in -- they had one bed for three people; husband, wife and a child. </sentence><sentence id="796">We were assigned a room. </sentence><sentence id="797">We came to the Judenrat. </sentence><sentence id="798">We told them that we are survivors of Slonim, that everybody was killed. </sentence><sentence id="799">They sort of took it, almost, they didn't believe it. </sentence><sentence id="800">And when my father used to retell it and we retold, they say, "Enough already. </sentence><sentence id="801">Enough already." </sentence><sentence id="802">And you know we were sort of convinced that this would happen here too. </sentence><sentence id="803">We were convinced and we tried to -- Daddy especially, tried to do something. </sentence><sentence id="804">To do what he can do with the children to survive but what could he have done? </sentence><sentence id="805">He was considered an old man. </sentence><sentence id="806">My father was in his early 50's, not quite 50, I think. </sentence><sentence id="807">And we were assigned a room in the ghetto with a family. </sentence><sentence id="808">There were two rooms. </sentence><sentence id="809">Three families in two rooms. </sentence><sentence id="810">In one room there lived a family -- Lipszyc. </sentence><sentence id="811">Herschel Lipszyc with his father that was very orthodox, and a cousin of his, that her family was already killed in a small town. </sentence><sentence id="812">They drove in all the Jews from a small town in a barn and they set the barn on fire. </sentence><sentence id="813">She was visiting grandparents in another place and she escaped. </sentence><sentence id="814">So she lived with them. </sentence><sentence id="815">In the next room lived a family with two children and they assigned us to live in this room. </sentence><sentence id="816">We had a bed. </sentence><sentence id="817">That was the extent of the living that we had in this house in Grodno in the ghetto. </sentence><sentence id="818">And shortly after we came to the ghetto, all of a sudden, one day Aron showed up. </sentence><sentence id="819">Aron showed up. </sentence><sentence id="820">I parted with him thinking I will never see him again. </sentence><sentence id="821">I left with my father and my little brother and he -- all ofa sudden Aron showed up and he told me -- we discussed. </sentence><sentence id="822">In fact, when we left I told him that my father knows of a farm woman that would take us. </sentence><sentence id="823">He said that he knows somebody, a neighbor of theirs that he was very, very good friends with told him of a woman that is going to take them and then he'll give me the names so he can come too -- run away with his mother and three sisters. </sentence><sentence id="824">And then he told me in tears that he parted with them in Volkovysk, because he said, "By staying together we only perish together." </sentence><sentence id="825">He said, "If I want to have any hopes of survival it is only in the underground -- the woods, and if I will stay with my mother and my sisters, all of us will perish. </sentence><sentence id="826">So I decided to run away to come to Grodno." </sentence><sentence id="827">And in Grodno we lived with the Lipszyces, and Herschel Lipszyc was wonderful. </sentence><sentence id="828">He would sing. </sentence><sentence id="829">He would bring a little bit of respite and life. </sentence><sentence id="830">It was not terrible hunger at the time yet. </sentence><sentence id="831">No, it wasn't. </sentence><sentence id="832">I couldn't believe it, that something like this still existed under Nazi occupation. </sentence><sentence id="833">And Aron went to slave labor with Herschel. </sentence><sentence id="834">My father did not go to slave labor outside of the ghetto. </sentence><sentence id="835">He worked in the ghetto, but my little brother would run out all the time, back and forth. </sentence><sentence id="836">He really had a tremendous courage and sense of adventure, running out all the time. </sentence><sentence id="837">And it is in this    ghetto while Herschel Lipszyc took Aron on slave labor to remodel a house for the Gestapo that Aron befriended a Pole. </sentence><sentence id="838">His name was Tadek, they called him, but his real name really was Tadeusz Soroka. </sentence><sentence id="839">Tadeusz Soroka came very often to barter with them. </sentence><sentence id="840">He would bring them food and they in turn would take out -- they would wear an extra pair of pants and extra jacket on them and trade for food. </sentence><sentence id="841">He was a good friend of Herschel Lipszyc. </sentence><sentence id="842">Herschel knew him much longer than Aron. </sentence><sentence id="843">And all of a sudden, all of a sudden November first rolled around and they sealed the ghetto. </sentence><sentence id="844">They sealed the ghetto and transports started to resettle it, to resettle people in the East supposedly. </sentence><sentence id="845">And rumor started in the ghetto where are they resettling the people. </sentence><sentence id="846">No one at the time thought of gassing people. </sentence><sentence id="847">No one at the time thought of Auschwitz, Treblinka, Majdanek -- merely fear of resettlement. </sentence><sentence id="848">You were told to take a certain amount of clothes, to take your toothbrush, to take all your necessary things that you would need to go and to be resettled. </sentence><sentence id="849">And you will even get better rations and better food. </sentence><sentence id="850">People tended to believe it because they thought maybe they'll be better. </sentence><sentence id="851">By this time already there was more hunger in the ghetto and anyway, the Jewish -- the Judenrat was forced to make a list of so many people for resettling. </sentence><sentence id="852">And it was a sign of resettling much more so only the ghetto because they start to bring all the Jews from the small towns from around Grodno. </sentence><sentence id="853">And Grodno had really hundreds of small little towns and villages where Jews lived, surrounded with small towns and little villages where Jews lived. </sentence><sentence id="854">They took them all in and brought them into a detention camp in Kelbasin and from there the people from Kelbasin were sent first to Auschwitz and to Treblinka and Majdanek, beknown to them where they were going, beknown to them, lists were being made and transports. </sentence><sentence id="855">They finished with Kelbasin and they started with the ghetto. </sentence><sentence id="856">Naturally, we were outsiders. </sentence><sentence id="857">We were not natives and we were always the first people on the lists. </sentence><sentence id="858">But to our advantage was our past. </sentence><sentence id="859">By being in Slonim and being in the ghetto and surviving two kinds of massacre and surviving practically -- sole survivors in a ghetto of thousands, of close to 20,000 people. </sentence><sentence id="860">Out of 20,000 people, eight -- 900 people survived. </sentence><sentence id="861">We really realized that we have to do everything that we already learned and the first thing is hiding. </sentence><sentence id="862">And we started to make places to hide and decided that we would just hide. </sentence><sentence id="863">We would not come with a suitcase to be taken to go to Auschwitz. </sentence><sentence id="864">Aron helps people find -- build hiding places. </sentence><sentence id="865">They knew that he came from Slonim and he knows, and the word traveled. </sentence><sentence id="866">It spread by word of mouth. </sentence><sentence id="867">So here he knew of a lot of places that he helped to build. </sentence><sentence id="868">So when we knew that we were on the lists, we began to hide. </sentence><sentence id="869">And we would come to one place and try to hide and all of a sudden, "No, this is not safe. </sentence><sentence id="870">No, no, no, we must leave the place right away. </sentence><sentence id="871">It's not safe." </sentence><sentence id="872">We went to another place and we didn't stay -- to a third place -- I remember one night we changed five places. </sentence><sentence id="873">It was -- we were going crazy from fear not to be caught while running out from one place to the other, four people, the three of us and Aron. </sentence><sentence id="874">We survived this transport. </sentence><sentence id="875">After we survived this transport again it was sort of quite for a while. </sentence><sentence id="876">Respite came to the ghetto. </sentence><sentence id="877">And Herschel Lipszyc with a very dear friend -- oh, my God, I forgot his name -- Lutek. </sentence><sentence id="878">Lutek were approached by Tadek and he told them that, "You know, you don't look Jewish. </sentence><sentence id="879">I know of a Polish family or a Lithuanian family in Wilno that will keep you as Christians. </sentence><sentence id="880">I will take you to Wilno." </sentence><sentence id="881">And Herschel consented to go with Tadek and Lutek to Wilno. </sentence><sentence id="882">What were the alternatives? </sentence><sentence id="883">Another transport? </sentence><sentence id="884">If you have a chance you do it and it is for really to know that people tried to do it. </sentence><sentence id="885">They took every possible chance. </sentence><sentence id="886">The chances were so few, so few. </sentence><sentence id="887">You needed the looks. </sentence><sentence id="888">You had to look Aryan to be able to survive on the Christian side. </sentence><sentence id="889">You had to meet the right people what would keep you. </sentence><sentence id="890">You have to think about years, it's not days. </sentence><sentence id="891">This is why the righteous that saved, that kept Jews, some of them for years, are really people that are an exception in this society. </sentence><sentence id="892">They're giants. </sentence><sentence id="893">They are giants. </sentence><sentence id="894">They are to emulate -- a whole world must learn to emulate. </sentence><sentence id="895">They were the people with morals with consciousness and they wanted to help and to do -- do not kill. </sentence><sentence id="896">Do not kill. </sentence><sentence id="897">Be your brother's keeper. </sentence><sentence id="898">Aron -- Herschel parted with his father and his niece and his cousin. </sentence><sentence id="899">Aron went with him to the barbed wires. </sentence><sentence id="900">By this time already Aron knew Tadek, and the idea was when Herschel and Lutek will arrive to Wilno that they will send back a note with Tadek to tell everyone that they had arrived safely. </sentence><sentence id="901">Well, they arrived safely but they did not send the note, and Aron didn't know about it. </sentence><sentence id="902">So he was reluctant to believe Tadek. </sentence><sentence id="903">Tadek gave him the kind of story that either you want to believe it or not. </sentence><sentence id="904">He said he took them to the Polish family. </sentence><sentence id="905">They were afraid to keep them because even though Lutek, his Polish was perfect, but he had Semitic looks, which is true by the way. </sentence><sentence id="906">It was true. </sentence><sentence id="907">And the family was afraid to keep them. </sentence><sentence id="908">So he said, "I took them to the ghetto, to the perimeter of the ghetto." </sentence><sentence id="909">He says, "I show them where the ghetto is and they walked into the ghetto. </sentence><sentence id="910">They told me that they would come and give me a note to give back to Aron." </sentence><sentence id="911">Says, "It poured, it rained. </sentence><sentence id="912">I waited and waited for the note and they never showed up. </sentence><sentence id="913">Here I come to tell you that they are in the ghetto but I don't have a note." </sentence><sentence id="914">Well, Aron already had hesitations, "Should I believe him or should I believe him?" </sentence><sentence id="915">But he left it. </sentence><sentence id="916">Tadek kept on coming and kept on coming and bartering and the ghetto was not quiet any more. </sentence><sentence id="917">There were talks about transport and people already expected this transport, and already they begin to loom that these people are not going to be resettled. </sentence><sentence id="918">That there is some thought, "They're sending them some place, to concentration camps. </sentence><sentence id="919">And do you know what they do to most of them?That they gas them. </sentence><sentence id="920">Gas them in 20th century? </sentence><sentence id="921">It must be. </sentence><sentence id="922">How could it be? </sentence><sentence id="923">How could it be?Yes, yes, yes, yes, it can be, it can be." </sentence><sentence id="924">And it already begin to work on people and people already begin to believe. </sentence><sentence id="925">But so little could they have done to avoid the transport. </sentence><sentence id="926">So little could they have done to avoid the transport. </sentence><sentence id="927">One day Tadek came and tells Aron at work, "Aron, the ghetto is sealed. </sentence><sentence id="928">They are taking out the ghetto -- the Jews." </sentence><sentence id="929">We escaped the first transport of 5,000. " </sentence><sentence id="930">They are taking the Jews to resettlement and I doubt if you will have a chance to survive. </sentence><sentence id="931">Come with me to Wilno. </sentence><sentence id="932">I'll take you. </sentence><sentence id="933">I'll take you today. </sentence><sentence id="934">Come with me. </sentence><sentence id="935">Don't go back to the ghetto." </sentence><sentence id="936">Well, Aron listen to Tadek and he said, "What should I do? </sentence><sentence id="937">I have nobody in the world left. </sentence><sentence id="938">I left a mother and three sisters in Bialystok -- on the way to Bialystok. </sentence><sentence id="939">The only person," he says, "that I really have ties to is Lisa. </sentence><sentence id="940">Should I leave her too and go to Wilno, to go to the unknown?" </sentence><sentence id="941">By this time already he almost has said he resigned. </sentence><sentence id="942">He said, "What is life altogether? </sentence><sentence id="943">What if I survive? </sentence><sentence id="944">I have no one. </sentence><sentence id="945">All the one -- all my dear ones are gone. </sentence><sentence id="946">They are killed. </sentence><sentence id="947">What is --I still -- I think I'll go back to the ghetto." </sentence><sentence id="948">And by this time already the people that he worked with sort of were suspicious that he might go away with this Christian, and they worried because they were counted. </sentence><sentence id="949">And this too -- was a tragedy that we are responsible one for another. </sentence><sentence id="950">If 10 people walked out of the ghetto, 10 had to return. </sentence><sentence id="951">If nine returned, they took hostages and they killed people. </sentence><sentence id="952">And you had this tremendous responsibility of the whole community, and it's not only said that they would take hostage. </sentence><sentence id="953">They did take hostages and they killed people. </sentence><sentence id="954">They killed people. </sentence><sentence id="955">They came to a house and they didn't find a person. </sentence><sentence id="956">They found this woman outside of the ghetto in Grodno. </sentence><sentence id="957">They dragged her into the ghetto and they took out the people, the person in the room that she lived with. </sentence><sentence id="958">And both of them were hanging on the gallows for days for the Jews to see what's being done when they catch Jews outside of the ghetto and if they're not reported that they are missing. </sentence><sentence id="959">So there was a communal responsibility. </sentence><sentence id="960">You were responsible not only for yourself but for others. </sentence><sentence id="961">That too kept a lot of people from maybe running away or doing something. </sentence><sentence id="962">Families clung together and they perished together. </sentence><sentence id="963">Tadek came and told Aron that he -- the ghetto is surrounded. </sentence><sentence id="964">He better go with him, as I said. </sentence><sentence id="965">But Aron decided to go into the ghetto. </sentence><sentence id="966">He came into the ghetto. </sentence><sentence id="967">He was immediately arrested, taken into the Synagogue, and he looked for me. </sentence><sentence id="968">He didn't find me, because when this came -- that the transport that are coming to grab people again, my father, my little brother and I went to hide again. </sentence><sentence id="969">We really did not have a very good place to hide. </sentence><sentence id="970">So in our yard where we were living was a courtyard. </sentence><sentence id="971">Again, there were shacks where before the war people kept wood. </sentence><sentence id="972">And again, my father and my little brother and I crawled up in a little shack, in a wooden shack and we stayed there. </sentence><sentence id="973">Police came and knocked, "Your number is up. </sentence><sentence id="974">Come out. </sentence><sentence id="975">Come out. </sentence><sentence id="976">Anybody hiding come out." </sentence><sentence id="977">Of course, we froze. </sentence><sentence id="978">We didn't answer. </sentence><sentence id="979">The Germans came in and knocked and searched around. </sentence><sentence id="980">They did not come with sniffing dogs. </sentence><sentence id="981">Were they come to sniffing dogs though, they would probably would find us. </sentence><sentence id="982">And we remained there. </sentence><sentence id="983">Aron searched for me in the Synagogue, in the Synagogue. </sentence><sentence id="984">He didn't find me in the Synagogue so he didn't know -- either I was killed or hiding or whatever had happened to me. </sentence><sentence id="985">The massacre -- the transport went on for quite a few days and finally, it came to astop. </sentence><sentence id="986">A handful, about 800 maybe, people survived, maybe close to a 1,000 people, and as we were sitting -- you see the shack where we were sitting faced the Synagogue and we saw all the thousands of people being led to the trains, being led, this march, this endless march of people being taken to the trains, to Auschwitz, Treblinka and Majdanek. </sentence><sentence id="987">We -- all of a sudden we saw Jews running and carrying a little bundle and we realized -- and they were talking loud and we could hear. </sentence><sentence id="988">We realized that it's over and, you know, the talk was -- evidently -- people that wanted for other people that were hiding, to know that it's safe to come out. </sentence><sentence id="989">So in Yiddish they would say, "Come out. </sentence><sentence id="990">Come out. </sentence><sentence id="991">It's safe, it's safe. </sentence><sentence id="992">Git aroys, Yidden. </sentence><sentence id="993">"deg Git aroys, git aroys."" </sentence><sentence id="994">Come out, come out." </sentence><sentence id="995">When we heard this, my father said, "It's safe to come out." </sentence><sentence id="996">And we came out. </sentence><sentence id="997">We were practically numb for lying like this all curled up. </sentence><sentence id="998">We came down and we came and we realized that the house where we lived in -- it was a two story, it was a building really. </sentence><sentence id="999">There were two buildings together -- that people were running to these buildings. </sentence><sentence id="1000">So we realized evidently that these are the buildings they left for the Jews. </sentence><sentence id="1001">Yes, it was. </sentence><sentence id="1002">There were three buildings that were left and one of the buildings was our building, where we lived before. </sentence><sentence id="1003">So we went upstairs and as I came in upstairs, I found Aron there. </sentence><sentence id="1004">I could not believe that it could be true. </sentence><sentence id="1005">I could not believe. </sentence><sentence id="1006">For sure I thought that he is already taken in a transport and I never, ever see him again. </sentence><sentence id="1007">He came with another man, that he told me the story how he was saved when this man let him build a hiding place under the coal. </sentence><sentence id="1008">And that now we have to do something very fast, to run 16 "Get/come out, Jews." ( </sentence><sentence id="1009">Yiddish) " Get/come out (Yiddish) away from here and our only salvation is Tadek, that we must get in touch with Tadek and run out of here. </sentence><sentence id="1010">Well, my little brother went out and made -- Aron had the address. </sentence><sentence id="1011">He was always ahead in his thinking so he knew where Tadek lived and the address. </sentence><sentence id="1012">And my little brother went out to meet Tadek, and Tadek told him that he would take him and my father to Wilno. </sentence><sentence id="1013">He would take them on freight cars that are traveling between Grodno and Wilno and he would let them -- if they arrived safely, hoping that they would arrive safely, he would bring them into the gates of the ghetto. </sentence><sentence id="1014">Let them walk into the ghetto. </sentence><sentence id="1015">And it was a designated day that my little brother and my father left the ghetto to go and to meet Tadek. </sentence><sentence id="1016">They came to Tadek and Tadek said that on that day he could not take them. </sentence><sentence id="1017">That he would take them the next day, that there was no transport going. </sentence><sentence id="1018">So they went to hide. </sentence><sentence id="1019">They were hiding in the second ghetto that was completely empty overnight. </sentence><sentence id="1020">And the next day they met Tadek as he told my little brother where he would be and they would travel to Wilno. </sentence><sentence id="1021">Tadek again told them to stay in a ditch -- to stay in a ditch that was right next to the yard to the railroad yard, and then when the train begins to move a little bit to jump on and to try to crawl on to the roof. </sentence><sentence id="1022">Well, my father listened and when it was time to run out, he did. </sentence><sentence id="1023">He did as he was told, but he would not step on to the two couplers and try to go up to the top of the roof, and he said, "Even if I have to be caught and killed, I cannot go to the top of the roof. </sentence><sentence id="1024">I cannot do it." </sentence><sentence id="1025">So they were hidden on a flat car that had a tank that was traveling to the front -- German tanks that were going to the Russian front and covered with tarps, so they were hidden under the tarps and they somehow made it. </sentence><sentence id="1026">They somehow made it. </sentence><sentence id="1027">They were searched. </sentence><sentence id="1028">They searched -- there were stations where the trains -- the flat cars were being searched to see if there was anybody. </sentence><sentence id="1029">By this time already there were Partisans. </sentence><sentence id="1030">There was already danger of Partisans. </sentence><sentence id="1031">But they didn't find them. </sentence><sentence id="1032">They arrived to Wilno. </sentence><sentence id="1033">They got in into the ghetto. </sentence><sentence id="1034">They found Herschel and Lutek in the ghetto and my daddy send a note with Tadek to Aron to tell that he found Lutek in the ghetto and Herschel and that Tadek is for real and to come to Wilno. </sentence><sentence id="1035">And then it was our turn to go to Wilno. </sentence><sentence id="1036">I went out of the ghetto. </sentence><sentence id="1037">By this time the ghetto was very small and guarded, and I went out of the ghetto to establish a contact with Tadek. </sentence><sentence id="1038">I came -- I found him and he told us to come on a designated day, on a Sunday and then he would take us. </sentence><sentence id="1039">I came back to the ghetto and I told Aron that I met Tadek. </sentence><sentence id="1040">He consented to take us and we'll go out to meet Tadek. </sentence><sentence id="1041">But not only Aron and I, but we were eight or nine people. </sentence><sentence id="1042">One of the people that we met was Elkie Jezerski, that knew -- he said that he knows of a janitor that used to be a janitor in their building where he lived, and maybe we can hide there and wait until Tadek can take us. </sentence><sentence id="1043">Eight people went out, not with the idea of all of us to go but maybe Tadek would take them one-by-one. </sentence><sentence id="1044">Meanwhile, they would establish a contact and they know Tadek and they will stay with this janitor. </sentence><sentence id="1045">Elkie had a feeling that the janitor is fine and he would keep us. </sentence><sentence id="1046">All of us came to the janitor's house, and at midnight the janitor decided that he does not want to keep that many Jews. </sentence><sentence id="1047">It is dangerous. </sentence><sentence id="1048">We must leave his house. </sentence><sentence id="1049">He said, "But I'll keep the girl." </sentence><sentence id="1050">He wanted us to leave right away and it was curfew so we begged him. </sentence><sentence id="1051">We begged him to let us stay until it gets a little in the morning before sunrise, while it is still dark. </sentence><sentence id="1052">And he kept -- he let us stay and all of us went out of this house. </sentence><sentence id="1053">He took us -- the janitor took us to a bombed-out house. </sentence><sentence id="1054">I went with them with the idea that I can stay in the janitor's house. </sentence><sentence id="1055">I stayed in the janitor's house. </sentence><sentence id="1056">I met Tadek at church. </sentence><sentence id="1057">Tadek told me that he would take us on a Tuesday. </sentence><sentence id="1058">Here it was Sunday. </sentence><sentence id="1059">I came back to the janitor's house and the janitor sent out his wife and the children, and I was not thinking at all, not knowing. </sentence><sentence id="1060">I was a child yet. </sentence><sentence id="1061">He wanted to rape me or to kill me because he was sharpening knives. </sentence><sentence id="1062">I had the presence when I heard knives being sharpened, that even though I was locked in a room -- I was locked in a room when he sent out his wife and two girls, I had the presence to run out. </sentence><sentence id="1063">I ran from the house, and in my chase running out of the house, the doors were flimsy even though the door was closed and with a latch, but I went out with all my strength. </sentence><sentence id="1064">And I slammed the door in such a way that by the time he opened the door, I was already a distance from him, from the janitor, and my luck was that there were stairs. </sentence><sentence id="1065">It's hilly. </sentence><sentence id="1066">It was very -- it was hilly and there were stairs and there were homes on the sides of the stairs. </sentence><sentence id="1067">He ran to chase me. </sentence><sentence id="1068">I was faster than he and when he came about the middle like, of the stairs and where there were homes, he was afraid because they shouldn't tell that he's chasing a girl or maybe it's a Jewish girl or something, so he left. </sentence><sentence id="1069">Iran to the house where the rest of the Jews -- Aron and the others were hidden -- to tell them what happened. </sentence><sentence id="1070">That we cannot leave tonight. </sentence><sentence id="1071">That Tadek will take us Tuesday and that the janitor, either he wanted to kill me -- I did not realize that he wanted to rape me -- that he wanted to kill me. </sentence><sentence id="1072">And I ran away, and what are we going to do? </sentence><sentence id="1073">We decided that we have to return to the ghetto. </sentence><sentence id="1074">We cannot stay there until Tuesday, until Tadek would meet us. </sentence><sentence id="1075">We had to return to the ghetto because there was an empty yard and children were playing ball. </sentence><sentence id="1076">It was a bombed out house and the windows were open and we were about to fall in into this basement, into this hovel where we were all of us hiding. </sentence><sentence id="1077">The children would run home and say, "The Jews are hiding there, so many of them." </sentence><sentence id="1078">We were afraid that they would give us out. </sentence><sentence id="1079">We had to wait until night came and we went back to the ghetto. </sentence><sentence id="1080">We could not remain one day of the danger that loomed outside. </sentence><sentence id="1081">We came in back to the ghetto and Tuesday as Tadek told us to meet him -- told me -- to meet him in the public washroom at seven o'clock at night in the evening, and he would take us -- when he said would take us, he only meant Aron and myself but five people went out -- not, not two. </sentence><sentence id="1082">One of them was Ruby Loren, the man that Aron was saved in the synagogue, his cousin, and another young man. </sentence><sentence id="1083">And the reason the five went out, because we wanted the other people to have this contact to be able to go with Tadek another time -- to know him and where he lives and so forth -- to establish a contact. </sentence><sentence id="1084">Five of us came. </sentence><sentence id="1085">It was dark. </sentence><sentence id="1086">We came to the public washroom. </sentence><sentence id="1087">Dark, seven o'clock. </sentence><sentence id="1088">Tadek was there. </sentence><sentence id="1089">He told me that he would be dressed in a uniform like a railroad worker. </sentence><sentence id="1090">He would have a flashlight. </sentence><sentence id="1091">He would light the flashlight so I would know that that was the man. </sentence><sentence id="1092">Exactly there, seven o'clock, the men were in a public washroom in the middle of Grodno on the Christian side, naturally. </sentence><sentence id="1093">I waited for Tadek. </sentence><sentence id="1094">Tadek came and I tell Tadek that we are five people. </sentence><sentence id="1095">When they were hidden in the public washroom, they looked out of a little window and when Aron saw that Tadek is there, he went out to talk to Tadek and he begged Tadek to take another person. </sentence><sentence id="1096">He tell them that, "I was saved with this man. </sentence><sentence id="1097">I really don't want to part with him. </sentence><sentence id="1098">He was good to me. </sentence><sentence id="1099">I want to be good to him. </sentence><sentence id="1100">I want to take him with me." </sentence><sentence id="1101">But Ruby didn't want to go because he tells Aron, "The only person in the world is left is my cousin. </sentence><sentence id="1102">I don't want to leave my cousin. </sentence><sentence id="1103">I want to be with him. </sentence><sentence id="1104">I have no one left in the world. </sentence><sentence id="1105">Everybody in my family is gone already." </sentence><sentence id="1106">Aron tells him, "Look, Ruby . </sentence><sentence id="1107">They will come Thursday. </sentence><sentence id="1108">Tadek promised to take them Thursday. </sentence><sentence id="1109">You have an opportunity. </sentence><sentence id="1110">Come. </sentence><sentence id="1111">They will come. </sentence><sentence id="1112">You'll be in the ghetto already. </sentence><sentence id="1113">Come." </sentence><sentence id="1114">And Ruby was standing there sort of halfway with his cousin, halfway, when Aron grabbed his hand and took him with and he went with us. </sentence><sentence id="1115">The others returned to the ghetto. </sentence><sentence id="1116">They never were able to make the trip because for them, death came. </sentence><sentence id="1117">Resettlement came before they were able to go out of the ghetto and to meet Tadek again. </sentence><sentence id="1118">I walked with Tadek. </sentence><sentence id="1119">Aron and Ruby followed. </sentence><sentence id="1120">They were both very Semitic looking. </sentence><sentence id="1121">They wore Polish looking hats called maciejwka"(r), a kind of hats that Poles wear. </sentence><sentence id="1122">We were not stopped. </sentence><sentence id="1123">We came to the railroad station. </sentence><sentence id="1124">Tadek pointed out to us the train, the freight train that was going to Wilno -- from Grodno to Wilno. </sentence><sentence id="1125">Within the freight train, also there were passenger cars that the Wehrmacht -- that the Germans traveled. </sentence><sentence id="1126">But we were to travel -- Tadek told us that when the train began to move already at a little speed to jump out, to try and grab, to run up between two boxcars and the couplers and find a little ladder and try to crawl up to the top of the roof. </sentence><sentence id="1127">I listened and I had it all in my mind to do it the way Tadek said. </sentence><sentence id="1128">Aron went out first and he was able to do it and went up to the top of the roof, I learned later, and Ruby, I guess, did the same. </sentence><sentence id="1129">I remained in the ditch, or lying in the road, I remained in the ditch. </sentence><sentence id="1130">I turned my head and I saw so few cars left. " </sentence><sentence id="1131">Oh, I will remain. </sentence><sentence id="1132">It's the end. </sentence><sentence id="1133">It's the end. </sentence><sentence id="1134">I survived until now but I won't survive anymore more." </sentence><sentence id="1135">I ran out and I have not been able to find the two box cars with the couplers, but I saw a boxcar with a door and, you know, it had a handle, a little ledge, and I grabbed on and I stood on the ledge. </sentence><sentence id="1136">I held on to the handle. </sentence><sentence id="1137">I have not been able to go on to the top of the roof, and there I was standing with my feet, wearing mittens in sub-zero weather, holding on. </sentence><sentence id="1138">The train began to accelerate, add speed. </sentence><sentence id="1139">I was already frozen. </sentence><sentence id="1140">The wind tore off my babushka and I couldn't hold on much longer. </sentence><sentence id="1141">I couldn't and I couldn't do anything. </sentence><sentence id="1142">By this time already I wish to be killed so it would be over with. </sentence><sentence id="1143">And all of a sudden I heard a noise on top. </sentence><sentence id="1144">I heard a noise and it sounded like somebody is sort of on top. </sentence><sentence id="1145">And then it got quiet and I still was holding on. </sentence><sentence id="1146">I learned later that Tadek came to find his passengers on top. </sentence><sentence id="1147">He found Ruby and he found Aron lying on one roof on the same boxcar. </sentence><sentence id="1148">He didn't find me. </sentence><sentence id="1149">He asked, "Where is the girl?" </sentence><sentence id="1150">They said they don't know. </sentence><sentence id="1151">They still left her in the ditch and they don't know what happened to the girl. </sentence><sentence id="1152">Tadek did not give up. </sentence><sentence id="1153">As the train was moving and moving very fast already, he jumped from one boxcar to another until he came almost to the end of the train, the almost of the end, and he saw me standing there holding on yet. </sentence><sentence id="1154">He ran for the car where Aron and Ruby were on. </sentence><sentence id="1155">The three of them jumped boxcar after boxcar. </sentence><sentence id="1156">Youth was with them. </sentence><sentence id="1157">They were young. </sentence><sentence id="1158">They were able to do it. </sentence><sentence id="1159">My father could not do it and a lot, a lot, a lot, of people could not do. </sentence><sentence id="1160">Children and woman could not do it either. </sentence><sentence id="1161">You had to be young to be able to do it and to know that there was a Tadeusz Soroka. </sentence><sentence id="1162">This were not that many Tadeusz Soroka. </sentence><sentence id="1163">They came to the boxcar that I was still standing and Tadek leaned over, gave me a hand and told me to hold on to his hand, that they will pull me up. </sentence><sentence id="1164">I had a vision that he will grab my mitten and not my hand. </sentence><sentence id="1165">And I said "I must do everything that I possess not to lose his hand." </sentence><sentence id="1166">And I managed. </sentence><sentence id="1167">The three of them pulled me up to the top of the train on the roof and I 18 visored cap (Polish) traveled with them, the three of us on this boxcar for 180 kilometers in sub-zero weather. </sentence><sentence id="1168">I was at the time 16 years old. </sentence></p></dialogue>

id="1775">He told us to cover our faces with soot so we would look like railroad workers coming from work or something, and he said, "As soon as you see a group of Jews returning from the nightshift, from work, try to jump in, in their midst and walk into the ghetto." </sentence><sentence id="1776">And we walked with Tadek for awhile and all of a sudden we see a group of Jews. </sentence><sentence id="1777">Of course, worker Jews because they walked in the street, not on the sidewalk and they all had yellow stars. </sentence><sentence id="1778">We went into their midst and we walked in into the ghetto. </sentence><sentence id="1779">This was the last time on this voyage that we saw Tadek. </sentence><sentence id="1780">We came in into the ghetto and Jewish police immediately took us over. </sentence><sentence id="1781">And as the Jewish police took us over they took us into Dessler!(r) and to Gens" in order for us to receive rations, a piece of bread that everybody needed and a bowl of soup and also, a place where to put your head down. </sentence><sentence id="1782">I'm not talking about a room, but a place, a piece of floor to put your head down. </sentence><sentence id="1783">You had to be registered within the Judenrat. </sentence><sentence id="1784">Dessler cautioned us not to tell anyone. </sentence><sentence id="1785">Of course, we told him the story, that we are -- about the transports and we still had a story to tell him about Slonim and then Grodno about the transports. </sentence><sentence id="1786">Also, he said, "You have to be very quiet, not to tell people, not to put the ghetto in a panic. </sentence><sentence id="1787">Not to put the ghetto in a panic. </sentence><sentence id="1788">Here it's different. </sentence><sentence id="1789">Here it's different, and don't jeopardize your ration cards and do as we tell you to do." </sentence><sentence id="1790">Needless to tell you, neither of us listened to what he had to say. </sentence><sentence id="1791">We spoke our mind and told people exactly what happened in Slonim, what happened in Grodno, and by this time already people in Wilno knew too, because it was already after Ponar and a lot of killings in Wilno but the situation there was still different. </sentence><sentence id="1792">The ghetto was still vital. </sentence><sentence id="1793">There was still quite a large ghetto. </sentence><sentence id="1794">Icame in. </sentence><sentence id="1795">I was immediately -- I was told where my father and my little brother are and I immediately ran there to be with them. </sentence><sentence id="1796">Can you imagine the joy of my father to have me come to Wilno? </sentence><sentence id="1797">Now, Aron immediately found a group of people that came from Grodno. </sentence><sentence id="1798">They were together with me. </sentence><sentence id="1799">There were nine men and a girl. </sentence><sentence id="1800">I was the only girl. </sentence><sentence id="1801">So they all lived together and they were called in the ghetto "The Grodno Group." </sentence><sentence id="1802">They all sort of were dressed the same and they were called "the Grodno Group" and they all lived ina room. </sentence><sentence id="1803">They had one room with another married -- with a couple and the couple's sister. </sentence><sentence id="1804">So you can imagine how many people in one, in one room lived. </sentence><sentence id="1805">The ghetto -- people went out to work and there was a lot of cultural activity in the ghetto that came to me as a total surprise. </sentence><sentence id="1806">There was a library where you could go and take out books or sit and study. </sentence><sentence id="1807">There were children playing ball. </sentence><sentence id="1808">There were competition and there was a theater in the ghetto. </sentence><sentence id="1809">I couldn't believe it, that this was possible. </sentence><sentence id="1810">There was a restaurant in the ghetto. </sentence><sentence id="1811">This was such an unknown experience to me that I felt like it was a different world. </sentence><sentence id="1812">My father worked outside of the ghetto. </sentence><sentence id="1813">So did my little brother -- used to go out and I too, for the first time went out to work outside of the ghetto. </sentence><sentence id="1814">I worked in hothouses where they raised vegetables for the Germans. </sentence><sentence id="1815">For --I guess for the German elite, whoever, the Gestapo, or "? </sentence><sentence id="1816">Saulk Dessler, head of the Vilnius ghetto's Jewish police.2deg Jacob Gens, head of the Vilnius ghetto's Judenrat. </sentence><sentence id="1817">whoever. </sentence><sentence id="1818">The leader there was a -- the foreman there was a Lithuanian man and he knew some of the Jews that worked there, so he wasn't very harsh on us. </sentence><sentence id="1819">And the Germans didn't watch us. </sentence><sentence id="1820">We somehow could always, always finagle a little bit, where we could steal a radish or a carrot and eat it real fast and try to get rid of the green part of it. </sentence><sentence id="1821">And it is there where I worked. </sentence><sentence id="1822">The man that was our foreman, the Jewish foreman, always used to go away and leave us. </sentence><sentence id="1823">I was very, at times, angry. </sentence><sentence id="1824">I say, "Why does he do it? </sentence><sentence id="1825">Why does he do it?" </sentence><sentence id="1826">Little did I know. </sentence><sentence id="1827">Much later in the underground where I met him that he was part of the Jewish resistance. </sentence><sentence id="1828">But I didn't know when I worked with him. </sentence><sentence id="1829">The man never told us or anything. </sentence><sentence id="1830">He evidently was trying to do something for the resistance on the outside of the ghetto. </sentence><sentence id="1831">So I worked -- Aron worked inside of the ghetto and very much our hope was only the resistance and the underground. </sentence><sentence id="1832">We knew that we can not survive in the ghetto. </sentence><sentence id="1833">And because it was still a large ghetto in numbers and there was still quite a young people in the ghetto, we tried to look every possible way to get in touch with the resistance. </sentence><sentence id="1834">Do you know, before the war was known for this -- it was called "the Wilno Jerusalem of Lithuanian." </sentence><sentence id="1835">There was such a strong nucleus, culture in Jewish and in every, every aspect of Jewish life in Wilno that we were convinced that there must be an underground there. </sentence><sentence id="1836">And when Aron worked with one of the men in the shop in the ghetto he realized that he's -- that they do something there. </sentence><sentence id="1837">That it's always producing a part, a part, a part and the minute the foreman, the German foreman, would walk in they would immediately hide. </sentence><sentence id="1838">He learned later that they were making some parts for armaments in this shop, that they were really working for the Germans. </sentence><sentence id="1839">And besides Aron there was another man that had contacts in Wilno and from both sides, somehow, they contacted the Jewish resistance and the resistance took us in because they were all young men, unattached with no families, and we became part of the resistance. </sentence><sentence id="1840">It was very, very secretive. </sentence><sentence id="1841">I could not tell my father, neither I could tell my little brother. </sentence><sentence id="1842">And then the story of Wittenberg"! </sentence><sentence id="1843">developed in the ghetto where a Communist, a Polish Communist was caught on the outside of the ghetto and within his torture he gave out Wittenberg as the leader of the Jewish resistance in the ghetto. </sentence><sentence id="1844">Now, the Judenrat played both ends of the picture. </sentence><sentence id="1845">They were with the resistors and they were with the Gestapo. </sentence><sentence id="1846">Gens had a notion because in 1943 when we came to Wilno in March, then April, May, June, the Germans had big defeats on the Russian Front already and Gens had a thought that if the resistors do not bring in the destruction of the ghetto, the people might survive. </sentence><sentence id="1847">Maybe liberation will come and everybody will be liberated, not only the couple of hundred young people, resistors. </sentence><sentence id="1848">So he wanted to convince the resistance to "don't rock the boat." </sentence><sentence id="1849">And even though he knew there was resistance, so he played both ends. </sentence><sentence id="1850">But he convinced the population of the ghetto that, "the resistors will bring down your end." </sentence><sentence id="1851">And the population of the ghetto was with Gens, unfortunately, not with the resistors. </sentence><sentence id="1852">And then this tremendous play with Wittenberg developed and as we know from history now from the Wilno ghetto that Wittenberg was turned over to the Gestapo. </sentence><sentence id="1853">He committed suicide and Abba Kovner" took over the leadership, but at a time when the leadership decided not to &gt;! </sentence><sentence id="1854">Yitzhak Wittenberg (1907-1943), leader of Jewish underground in Vilnius.2 Abba Kovner(1918-1988), Jewish-Lithuanian resistance fighter and Israeli poet. </sentence><sentence id="1855">give out Wittenberg. </sentence><sentence id="1856">They called us to come in the barricades and to fight, to raise a fight with the Germans. </sentence><sentence id="1857">Of course it was futile. </sentence><sentence id="1858">We all would have been killed. </sentence><sentence id="1859">And when we came to this designated place I realized the strength that the resistors had because they were so big in numbers. </sentence><sentence id="1860">They really did not have much to fight with in arms. </sentence><sentence id="1861">Of course not. </sentence><sentence id="1862">It's a David and Goliath fight. </sentence><sentence id="1863">I mean there was an army with tanks, with all the supplies in the world, and we only had our bodies, a few grenades and something that we wanted to give our lives -- to show the Jews fought back, that we fought back, that we achieved at least something. </sentence><sentence id="1864">And as history tells, Wittenberg and I tell, Wittenberg was given -- there was a big discussion among the leadership. </sentence><sentence id="1865">We learned all of it later after it was over. </sentence><sentence id="1866">We were not in the leadership position. </sentence><sentence id="1867">I was a 16-year-old girl doing what I was told to do and really being so grateful that I was part of the resistance and did absolutely everything that I was told to do, and I knew very little except what I was told to do. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1965">Q: This time when you all came together, tell me more about when and where that was. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1967">A: That was in Wilno in the ghetto that faced the outside of the ghetto, and it was at midnight like, late at night. </sentence><sentence id="1968">From all sides group start to converge to this place, and as we came it was dark. </sentence><sentence id="1969">Maybe there weren't as many numbers, but I conceived it as a tremendous number, two -- 300 young people that came there and some of them were walking. </sentence><sentence id="1970">Some of them had a grenade and somebody had a pistol. </sentence><sentence id="1971">And we already, our group, too already possessed couple of pistols that we really bought on the outside of the ghettos, smuggled it in and paid with hunger by not eating, by not having that slice of bread to be able to obtain the pistol. </sentence><sentence id="1972">It was an exhilarating experience to be there, even though that we knew that we would all die, because we were no match, we were no match. </sentence><sentence id="1973">All of a sudden we were sent home, to go back home. </sentence><sentence id="1974">We didn't know the drama at the time until the next day when it developed that Wittenberg decided that -- they came to him with the thought and told him what it entails. </sentence><sentence id="1975">And Gens told the leadership, the resistance leadership, that if he doesn't give himself up, they are going to come and destroy the ghetto. </sentence><sentence id="1976">And there was a lot of people, Jews, running in the ghetto screaming "Wittenberg, Wittenberg," for him to give up. " </sentence><sentence id="1977">He's bringing the end to us. </sentence><sentence id="1978">He's bringing the end to us." </sentence><sentence id="1979">Little did they know that the end was coming anyway. </sentence><sentence id="1980">But when I was in the ghetto, my thoughts were altogether different. </sentence><sentence id="1981">I was the enemy of these people that said for Wittenberg to give up and to -- not to rage and to fight, not to fight back because the ghetto will be destroyed. </sentence><sentence id="1982">I thought they would be destroyed anyway. </sentence><sentence id="1983">The end will come anyway. </sentence><sentence id="1984">But for the ones in the ghetto that still had children, every day meant something and Gens kept on saying, "If we live through this period, maybe we can still live through the liberation." </sentence><sentence id="1985">I began to appreciate it many years later when I had a family and children. </sentence><sentence id="1986">And I know that you were to be responsible, not only for yourself but you're responsible for your family too. </sentence><sentence id="1987">You cannot run out. </sentence><sentence id="1988">You can only do it when you are a youngster, leave your parents. </sentence><sentence id="1989">You cannot do it when you are a parent. </sentence><sentence id="1990">There is much more responsibility expected of a parent. </sentence><sentence id="1991">And then the decision was, after the Wittenberg affair, of course, Wittenberg was taken into the Gestapo and he was given poison and he committed suicide. </sentence><sentence id="1992">So they really got nothing out of Wittenberg as far as questioning him and for him to give out secrets or anything. </sentence><sentence id="1993">And then the thought was that we cannot wage a war -- warfare -- in the ghetto. </sentence><sentence id="1994">The population is not with us, is not with us, and the only solution would be to send the resistors into the underground in the woods in the forest to fight from the forest. </sentence><sentence id="1995">And little by little, groups began to leave. </sentence><sentence id="1996">How did they go? </sentence><sentence id="1997">It was a 180 kilometers. </sentence><sentence id="1998">The closest the Naroch woods where we went to. </sentence><sentence id="1999">Groups of 25, 28 or so were sent with guides. </sentence><sentence id="2000">Who were the guides? </sentence><sentence id="2001">The guides were Jewish Partisans already that were in the underground and were already, so to say, "free people." </sentence><sentence id="2002">They took upon themselves the risk of being killed to go into the ghetto and to lead groups of Jews out of the ghetto. </sentence><sentence id="2003">What courage! </sentence><sentence id="2004">What heroism to do the kind of, really, thing that you risk with your life to do it. </sentence><sentence id="2005">They were giants, giants of men. </sentence><sentence id="2006">Giants, lions, young dedicated, fearless, that came to the ghetto. </sentence><sentence id="2007">Some of them were even arrested in the ghetto and then let out. </sentence><sentence id="2008">And they took groups. </sentence><sentence id="2009">Some of the groups that went out before us met up with an ambush and were killed. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2054">Q: Why don't we actually start with, let's start with the resistance to take taking you with them because you were a girl. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2056">A: After we contacted the resistance, I really was not one of the people that contacted the resistance, but it came from two different sides. </sentence><sentence id="2057">Aron knew somebody and our friend -- another friend of ours that was from Grodno, that knew the resistance, knew somebody in the resistance already, and finally we were able to join the resistance. </sentence><sentence id="2058">When it came the time to really go to the forest, there was a discussion that among the Grodno group there was a girl and they were not so keen of taking the girl, to leave the girl behind. </sentence><sentence id="2059">Little did they know that I could do everything that these men were doing, even more, and I was really at no time at all any liability to anyone in the underground -- just the opposite. </sentence><sentence id="2060">But Herschel Lipszyc, our dear friend Herschel Lipszyc, stood up and he say -- they call me Liska(ph) -- "If Liska doesn't go, none of us are going. </sentence><sentence id="2061">All of us are going and Liska is going too, and this is the way it is going to be." </sentence><sentence id="2062">And because he was so very positive and naturally, Aron very much wanted me to go, no question. </sentence><sentence id="2063">I mean, I joined in group because Aron was part of it. </sentence><sentence id="2064">On my own, | don't think I could have reached the underground. </sentence><sentence id="2065">So finally they consented that they'll take me too. </sentence><sentence id="2066">We would be going to the underground to Naroch and we would go with a group of 28 people. </sentence><sentence id="2067">So on a designated day there came a call that it's time for us to leave for the underground. </sentence><sentence id="2068">All the Grodno people, the 10 of them lived together, so the call came to them. </sentence><sentence id="2069">And early in the morning, about three or four o'clock in the morning, there was a knock on the little window. </sentence><sentence id="2070">In Wilno we lived in a room with three more families. </sentence><sentence id="2071">There were practically corpses all over the floor, to walk out. </sentence><sentence id="2072">It was time for me to go to the underground. </sentence><sentence id="2073">I have not been able to walk out because I would wake up all the people that want to know, "Where are you going in the middle of the night at four o'clock in the morning? </sentence><sentence id="2074">You can't go to work that early." </sentence><sentence id="2075">I slept in the bunk with my brother, and Aron knocked on the window and he said, "It's time to go." </sentence><sentence id="2076">I have not been able to go through the door, so I had to slip out in the tiny piece of the window, the little window that opened up for air. </sentence><sentence id="2077">Luckily, I was so thin and so small that I was able to get out. </sentence><sentence id="2078">I have not been able to tell my father. </sentence><sentence id="2079">Neither did I tell my brother. </sentence><sentence id="2080">I only told him, "When I am gone, tell daddy that I have left -- that I left." </sentence><sentence id="2081">And he says daddy will know where I went. </sentence><sentence id="2082">So that my little brother was intelligent enough to know. </sentence><sentence id="2083">Can you imagine?I left without telling them because it was so secretive. </sentence><sentence id="2084">I wasn't able to tell them. </sentence><sentence id="2085">Were I to remain, who knows if I would have survived and I wanted to go so much. </sentence><sentence id="2086">The leaders were the two men. </sentence><sentence id="2087">It was Shlemke Hilczyk and Motke de Geller -- Motke the Red. </sentence><sentence id="2088">Really, I can only speak about them in superlatives. </sentence><sentence id="2089">Only super giants, men that were ready to give their lives to help other Jews in need. </sentence><sentence id="2090">They were already free people when they were in the underground. </sentence><sentence id="2091">Of course, they could have been killed but they were not in the ghetto. </sentence><sentence id="2092">Their dream was already accomplished. </sentence><sentence id="2093">They were there. </sentence><sentence id="2094">They were fighters. </sentence><sentence id="2095">They came to take out groups of Jews from the ghetto to lead them in into the underground. </sentence><sentence id="2096">It took us seven nights to walk to the underground. </sentence><sentence id="2097">Twenty-eight people left. </sentence><sentence id="2098">Among them were women too. </sentence><sentence id="2099">I wasn't the only woman. </sentence><sentence id="2100">I was the youngest, that much I'll say. </sentence><sentence id="2101">I was the youngest in the group. </sentence><sentence id="2102">The first night when we came out we went out of the ghetto as a group going to work. </sentence><sentence id="2103">We came to the outskirts of town. </sentence><sentence id="2104">We were hidden in a little wooded area, hardly wooded enough not to be seen. </sentence><sentence id="2105">There were shepherds with the flock. </sentence><sentence id="2106">We took them with us. </sentence><sentence id="2107">We kept them the whole day. </sentence><sentence id="2108">We did not harm them. </sentence><sentence id="2109">We blindfolded them and we kept them there, and when night came, when we left this little forest, we let them go home. </sentence><sentence id="2110">And we told them under no circumstances are they to tell that they were in the woods with some Jews, because they will be punished severely. </sentence><sentence id="2111">We showed them that we had weapons, and we left. </sentence><sentence id="2112">We walked with this man that took us -- that supposedly knew the road and they got lost. </sentence><sentence id="2113">They had no compasses, only by the sight. </sentence><sentence id="2114">We tried to go with side roads, so we would not be seen and identified. </sentence><sentence id="2115">But as we were going on the side roads we only got lost. </sentence><sentence id="2116">We got lost and we had to cross a railroad track on the other side of the railroad tracks. </sentence><sentence id="2117">So he decided to go on the main road where Germans were traveling, and every time, he told us, we see approaching cars with lights to drop in the ditches and to hide. </sentence><sentence id="2118">And one by one we crossed the railroad tracks while German guards were standing. </sentence><sentence id="2119">Every time the guard would turn to the back towards us, one of us would slip out. </sentence><sentence id="2120">Twenty-eight people had to cross. </sentence><sentence id="2121">Imagine the danger. </sentence><sentence id="2122">And all of us crossed safely. </sentence><sentence id="2123">Part of the way when it began to get light we were running, not walking, but running to hide. </sentence><sentence id="2124">The day we hid in a little forest we started out walking again and we had problems again. </sentence><sentence id="2125">The road wasn't so clear to them. </sentence><sentence id="2126">They came back from the forest. </sentence><sentence id="2127">Somehow they knew their way but they had to -- maybe --had to change the way. </sentence><sentence id="2128">They took another road and two nights in a row we were lost. </sentence><sentence id="2129">They never lost their cool. </sentence><sentence id="2130">They always kept us convinced that they know what they're doing and they will bring us in a safe place. </sentence><sentence id="2131">And we had the total confidence, total confidence, in these two young men. </sentence><sentence id="2132">Finally, they decided after the second or the third day they decided to take farmers to lead us, to be our leaders. </sentence><sentence id="2133">And the farmers knew the way and we told them to bring us to the next stop. </sentence><sentence id="2134">They told them to bring us to the next stop, and the farmers listened. </sentence><sentence id="2135">The farmers listened and brought us to the next stop. </sentence><sentence id="2136">They were cautioned not to give out the Jews, that this is a pack of Jews. </sentence><sentence id="2137">The farmers knew very well and somehow we made it. </sentence><sentence id="2138">We had to cross two rivers, and one river a farmer took us and we were all walking all the way up to our waists. </sentence><sentence id="2139">Some of them didn't know how to swim. </sentence><sentence id="2140">They were worried that they would drown. </sentence><sentence id="2141">And we made it. </sentence><sentence id="2142">The farmers said, "The river is not very deep. </sentence><sentence id="2143">You will make it." </sentence><sentence id="2144">And he was right, we made it. </sentence><sentence id="2145">We came to cross the big river, the Viliya, and the Germans were standing guard on the bridges, and when they heard the splashing of the water from so many people walking. </sentence><sentence id="2146">They began shooting at us. </sentence><sentence id="2147">Fortunately, their aims were poor. </sentence><sentence id="2148">Nobody was killed and we crossed, and finally the two leaders start taking wagons with farmers, wagons, and they put us up on the wagons. </sentence><sentence id="2149">And we traveled on wagons already, until we came to what is called "Partisan Territory" where there was a tremendous number, already, of Partisans and it was safe. </sentence><sentence id="2150">This was Partisan Territory so it was safe. </sentence><sentence id="2151">And it is there, while we were on the wagons traveling, all of a sudden we were stopped. </sentence><sentence id="2152">We were stopped by a Jewish Partisan riding on a horse with an automatic rifle. </sentence><sentence id="2153">Can you imagine our joy? </sentence><sentence id="2154">I will never forget this moment. </sentence><sentence id="2155">Never, never. </sentence><sentence id="2156">Leibke Gordon on a horse with a rifle, with a machine gun, greeting us, falling all over us, kissing us, we kissing them. </sentence><sentence id="2157">He was like Messiah. </sentence><sentence id="2158">We came to the Promised Land and they brought us into the truck. </sentence><sentence id="2159">The guides waiting for permission. </sentence><sentence id="2160">They didn't know the password. </sentence><sentence id="2161">You had to know the password. </sentence><sentence id="2162">They didn't know the password. </sentence><sentence id="2163">They were stopped. </sentence><sentence id="2164">They told they are going to the ghetto to bring Jews to the Partisans, so they were let in and then we were let into the base. </sentence><sentence id="2165">We came to a place that it's -- how could I describe this place. </sentence><sentence id="2166">It was like Robin Hood. </sentence><sentence id="2167">There's people walking around with rifles. </sentence><sentence id="2168">Sides of cows are hanging that were being slaughtered for the food. </sentence><sentence id="2169">Huts -- we lived in huts that were built. </sentence><sentence id="2170">It was hilly so they were built in the hills made out of logs, dug out, you know, made out of logs. </sentence><sentence id="2171">And there were bunks. </sentence><sentence id="2172">A long bunk that was not for twelve -- how could I describe to you the scene as we came down the hill. </sentence><sentence id="2173">I seen a Robin Hood. </sentence><sentence id="2174">People walking around with rifles, sides of beef hanging, huts, people coming out of the huts milling great number of people. </sentence><sentence id="2175">I never could have believed that this is the way the underground, the resistors, worked. </sentence><sentence id="2176">I thought they lived hidden in some kind of a small little place away where nobody could ever find them or such. </sentence><sentence id="2177">This seemed to be so open. </sentence><sentence id="2178">It seemed so open and we were welcomed right away. </sentence><sentence id="2179">The leader -- we came to a Jewish unit that was called "Revenge" -- ""Nekamah" in Hebrew -- and the leader was Joseph Glazman**. </sentence><sentence id="2180">He accepted us with warm arms and right away everybody wanted to know who we saw, the last people that we saw in the ghetto. </sentence><sentence id="2181">And we learned that it wasn't that simple for Jews to be in the underground, in the Jewish unit. </sentence><sentence id="2182">That the Russians would not give them any arms, enough in the unit, and the thought was they met up -- they told us they already met up with Antisemitism and the Russian unit is separately, and they look down upon these Jews that came from the ghetto. </sentence><sentence id="2183">After all they are ghetto Jews. </sentence><sentence id="2184">Little did they know that these ghetto Jews knew how to fight and were better fighters at times than the others were too. </sentence><sentence id="2185">And very shortly, very shortly -- the spirit was wonderful. </sentence><sentence id="2186">It was sort of free. </sentence><sentence id="2187">You felt free even though you knew there were dangers, that there were Germans all the way around. </sentence><sentence id="2188">But you felt free and I kept on thinking, "If people in the ghettos would only know that something like this 3 Joseph Glazman, Jewish partisan and leading member of the F.P.O. existed, they would all run, they would all come." </sentence><sentence id="2189">But I knew very well that they couldn't run and they couldn't come. </sentence><sentence id="2190">It's only the select youth that were able to do it. </sentence><sentence id="2191">I knew it but you thought both ways. </sentence><sentence id="2192">Very shortly, very shortly this Jewish unit was disbanned, was disbanned under the pretext they are training the Soviet Union, all the nationalities mixed together. </sentence><sentence id="2193">There isn't such a thing as a Jewish unit -- it must be integrated unit. </sentence><sentence id="2194">And, of course, they sent away most of the group to be in a family camp. </sentence><sentence id="2195">Actually, it wasn't so much a family camp because there were hardly -- we did not have any children in this group. </sentence><sentence id="2196">But also the artisans are people that knew how to sew. </sentence><sentence id="2197">They made them because this was the Jewish elite that came from Wilno, the Jewish elite. </sentence><sentence id="2198">They send them in to bake bread, for the woman to peel potatoes and to sew, to make boots for the Partisans. </sentence><sentence id="2199">I don't know -- sew their uniforms. </sentence><sentence id="2200">I really don't know and there was a tremendous anger among the group. </sentence><sentence id="2201">Tremendous. </sentence><sentence id="2202">People felt so rejected. </sentence><sentence id="2203">They felt it was so unjust to do it. </sentence><sentence id="2204">Here people came to fight and they were sent to be ina group. </sentence><sentence id="2205">They gave some of them weapons so they can defend themselves in case they are attacked and also to go out to the farmers and get food -- to get food. </sentence><sentence id="2206">After a while there was no alternative. </sentence><sentence id="2207">People got adjusted, but they felt it was a tremendous injustice. </sentence><sentence id="2208">All of us felt it was a tremendous injustice. </sentence><sentence id="2209">We remained in the unit and we were the first among the Russian units, in a lot of Russian units. </sentence><sentence id="2210">But our group, that were in this Jewish otriad(tm), remained with the Russian unit and it was called the Kalininski Otriad and, of course, we met up with Antisemitism. </sentence><sentence id="2211">With Antisemitism women had a very special strike against them. </sentence><sentence id="2212">Nobody thought, the leadership and even the soldiers, the resistors, did not think that women know how to fight, know how to do -- when you need to go on a mission or something of this sort. </sentence><sentence id="2213">And they told them, you know, to do kitchen work, to do this and all sorts of menial jobs. </sentence><sentence id="2214">And some -- then Glazman took a group of really the most outstanding young men and women and they left. </sentence><sentence id="2215">They were so really hurt that this could happen to a group that was so dedicated, that was so knowledgeable, that had all the potential to do everything that was asked of resistors to do, that they left. </sentence><sentence id="2216">They left to go to the other groups that left Wilno and went to Rudniki to the forests, to the "Pushcha"&gt; Rudniski" it was called. </sentence><sentence id="2217">In English they call it Rudniki. </sentence><sentence id="2218">And on the way they ended up, they met up with an ambush and they were all killed. </sentence><sentence id="2219">One young woman escaped and she came back and told us what happened. </sentence><sentence id="2220">How they were killed and things and exactly what happened to them. </sentence><sentence id="2221">Very shortly after, we were dispersed within the groups. </sentence><sentence id="2222">I was always within the Russian unit with the Jews that were remained in the Kalininski Otriad and whatever it was asked of us to do, we did. </sentence><sentence id="2223">We did it very well. </sentence><sentence id="2224">What do the Partisans do? </sentence><sentence id="2225">They really made it impossible for the German Army to move. </sentence><sentence id="2226">We cut down trees and blockaded the roads. </sentence><sentence id="2227">We mined the entrances to where the resistors lived and this was called an otriad, the units where they lived. </sentence><sentence id="2228">They cut down telephone wires and they made ambushes at times; dynamiting the roads, dynamiting also trains that went to the front. </sentence><sentence id="2229">In the very same token, we helped Jews that were hiding in the woods because there were Jewish, young children and also elderly people, women that escaped, wanting a family that ran out of a ghetto that either burning or everybody was being killed, and quite a few children. </sentence><sentence id="2230">I mean not in large numbers, no. </sentence><sentence id="2231">And we saw -- they lived at first almost like wild -- running from place to place and hiding and never having enough food. </sentence><sentence id="2232">Some of them even died. </sentence><sentence id="2233">But when we came into the forest, we made sure &gt;4 military detachment (Russian) deg5 virgin forest (Russian) that the farmers keep them and they watch over them for their safety because we threatened the farmers. </sentence><sentence id="2234">If something will happen to their safety, you will be punished and punished severely. </sentence><sentence id="2235">And you'd be surprised, they listened. </sentence><sentence id="2236">Because they knew that we had power. </sentence><sentence id="2237">There were sieges every so often. </sentence><sentence id="2238">There was one tremendous siege in the fall, a little bit later in the fall in 1943, where the Germans that were going to the front had to come through the woods, and we lost a lot. </sentence><sentence id="2239">A lot, a lot of Partisans were killed. </sentence><sentence id="2240">A lot of them were killed. </sentence><sentence id="2241">They systematically walked through. </sentence><sentence id="2242">We were hiding on an island that was covered. </sentence><sentence id="2243">We thought was safe. </sentence><sentence id="2244">It wasn't at all. </sentence><sentence id="2245">After we came out of there we realized that we could even be seen from the road. </sentence><sentence id="2246">But somehow we survived, but 20 -- we survived but at least between 20 and 30 percent of the Partisans we lost in the siege that were killed, that were lost. </sentence><sentence id="2247">We returned back to the base. </sentence><sentence id="2248">The base was not touched. </sentence><sentence id="2249">They never came to the base and nobody was on the base. </sentence><sentence id="2250">Now, the leadership, the leadership took it first a group of Jewish young men and I was left to guard, to stand guard for the leadership. </sentence><sentence id="2251">And after the danger really came that they realized that they cannot travel in a group with more than two or three of them. </sentence><sentence id="2252">They ran away hiding some place with farmers. </sentence><sentence id="2253">They changed their clothes. </sentence><sentence id="2254">They were after all, they were Russians. </sentence><sentence id="2255">They were Christians so they didn't have this danger of being Jews and hiding among farmers. </sentence><sentence id="2256">They left. </sentence><sentence id="2257">They left, disbanned all of us, and told us each and everyone to go and look out for ourselves and it will be over to come back to the base. </sentence><sentence id="2258">We came back to the base and we found, for a while, no one. </sentence><sentence id="2259">After a while the leadership came and they start dropping now leaders from behind the enemy lines to be our leaders, and we begin to grow in numbers and everybody was armed because the arms were being dropped from behind the enemy lines. </sentence><sentence id="2260">We made an airport and air drone like where we cleared out part of a forest. </sentence><sentence id="2261">And at night on four corners of this meadow, we would light fires for the planes to identify where to drop the shipment of arms. </sentence><sentence id="2262">So Jews and no Jews, everybody got armed. </sentence><sentence id="2263">The others always were armed. </sentence><sentence id="2264">It's just Jews, always the Jews. </sentence><sentence id="2265">And time went on and at big battles they would organize two or three or four units to come out together. </sentence><sentence id="2266">At times we just walked and walked for days not knowing what they were doing and what was going to be done. </sentence><sentence id="2267">But somehow we always came back to the base, and later we would learn that this was sort of an exercise of a sort. </sentence><sentence id="2268">Nobody questioned. </sentence><sentence id="2269">Nobody questioned. </sentence><sentence id="2270">We did what we were told to do. </sentence><sentence id="2271">Time went on and I have to tell you that one day as I was on the base, somebody came running to me to tell me that my father came into the woods. </sentence><sentence id="2272">I left my father and my little brother in Wilno. </sentence><sentence id="2273">When one of the groups went -- guides went to Wilno I begged one of them, begged to tell my father that I am alive and that I am in the Naroch woods. </sentence><sentence id="2274">He told my father; he went to my father. </sentence><sentence id="2275">I told him the floor. </sentence><sentence id="2276">I told him the house where we were, and my little brother was caught in the street in Wilno while they were grabbing the people and was sent to a labor camp in Estonia, and then added up in Stutthof concentration camp. </sentence><sentence id="2277">My father was home and he remained all alone, and when he learned that I was in the underground in Naroch, he walked all by himself, dressed as a Pole. </sentence><sentence id="2278">Luckily, he came to the underground. </sentence><sentence id="2279">He lived in a hut that we provided him. </sentence><sentence id="2280">He and three, four more people that lived there. </sentence><sentence id="2281">We provided food for them and safety. </sentence><sentence id="2282">They knew that they were safe as long as we are in the woods around them. </sentence><sentence id="2283">And my father lived there until liberation and he was liberated together with me. </sentence><sentence id="2284">Liberation came. </sentence><sentence id="2285">There were battles. </sentence><sentence id="2286">I did not participate in the battles because it was really the big units that it was done, combing through the woods. </sentence><sentence id="2287">We remained on the base and the last time before liberation some of our closest friends were killed, while they were combing the woods, to put up, to catch some of the Germans that were escaping from the front or something. </sentence><sentence id="2288">And we lost quite a number of men, and the men that we lost were our close friends. </sentence><sentence id="2289">There were battles that the Russian Army waged and summer of 1944 we were liberated. </sentence><sentence id="2290">We were liberated and we immediately -- most of the men were drafted into the army, to the Russian Army. </sentence><sentence id="2291">We -- my father and I and Aron asked for permission just to go to Slonim to see somebody survived maybe from his family. </sentence><sentence id="2292">He was granted the permission. </sentence><sentence id="2293">In the Soviet Union you couldn't travel as you wished. </sentence><sentence id="2294">You needed a permit and you had to show the permit everywhere you went. </sentence><sentence id="2295">We were given the permit and we came to Slonim. </sentence><sentence id="2296">I knew that I would not find anybody in Slonim but we still had hoped. </sentence><sentence id="2297">Daddy told me that my little brother was caught on the street, that maybe he survived. </sentence><sentence id="2298">Maybe he's alive somewhere. </sentence><sentence id="2299">Maybe he wrote to the house that we lived in Slonim. </sentence><sentence id="2300">So we came to the house and the man of the house that we lived in was killed by the Nazis because he was a Communist. </sentence><sentence id="2301">The wife and the two children survived. </sentence><sentence id="2302">We left a lot of our belongings -- when we went to the ghetto -- was left there. </sentence><sentence id="2303">We were absolutely, penniless, without anything to change -- anything to wear, only what we had on our backs. </sentence><sentence id="2304">And we asked to try and give us something that was left in the house that belonged to us. </sentence><sentence id="2305">The landlady, the woman of the house said, "Nothing at all is left and everything was taken away." </sentence><sentence id="2306">The only thing she gave me is a slip, an embroidered slip of my mother's that I treasure "til this day. </sentence><sentence id="2307">It was the only thing that I remained with, the hand-embroidered slip. </sentence><sentence id="2308">We left Slonim immediately. </sentence><sentence id="2309">There were no Jews in Slonim. </sentence><sentence id="2310">However, I found a note from a cousin of mine that was saved deep in Russia, in Kazakstan, looking for us, if anybody survived from the family. </sentence><sentence id="2311">So I immediately was able to get in touch with my cousin Harold Brenner that lived, that was still survived in deep in the Soviet Union. </sentence><sentence id="2312">We left Slonim. </sentence><sentence id="2313">We stayed in Baranovichi for a short while. </sentence><sentence id="2314">We were taken in by Jews that survived and all the survivors became like a family. </sentence><sentence id="2315">Everybody took in everybody. </sentence><sentence id="2316">Everybody shared with a piece of bread. </sentence><sentence id="2317">You were so happy that somebody survived, because whoever survived thought that he was the only person that survived -- that everybody's killed. </sentence><sentence id="2318">The joy that you found something. </sentence><sentence id="2319">I came to Baranovichi and my Hebrew teacher survived and he met us on the street. </sentence><sentence id="2320">The joy of having Meyer Chalasnowicz survive. </sentence><sentence id="2321">He took us into his room. </sentence><sentence id="2322">He shared his food with us. </sentence><sentence id="2323">And as Poland was liberated, we left the Soviet Union as Polish citizens. </sentence><sentence id="2324">We were allowed to do it. </sentence><sentence id="2325">Aron left first on New Year's Day of 1945. </sentence><sentence id="2326">My father and I followed right after, right after, and we came to Bialystok and in Bialystok there was danger again of being killed, again, after the war by pogroms. </sentence><sentence id="2327">They talked about pogroms. </sentence><sentence id="2328">They talked about killing. </sentence><sentence id="2329">It didn't materialize in Bialystok but it was in other places that we knew. </sentence><sentence id="2330">And it is in Bialystok that we start searching a way how to get out. </sentence><sentence id="2331">There must be a way to get out and to get to the West. </sentence><sentence id="2332">And Aron especially, we met in Bialystok. </sentence><sentence id="2333">We came right after and Aron had a room, a house, a room in a house and he took us in and we stayed there and Herschel Lipszyc stayed there, and whoever survived from the Grodno guys stayed with us and we were like family, like family. </sentence><sentence id="2334">What I wanted to add that before we came to Bialystok we went to Grodno. </sentence><sentence id="2335">We went to Grodno to tell Tadek that we survived. </sentence><sentence id="2336">When we came to Grodno, my father, Aron and I -- Herschel Lipszyc was already in Grodno -- and Herschel Lipszyc said, "Well, we came to Grodno." </sentence><sentence id="2337">We said, "We came really to tell Tadek that we survived." </sentence><sentence id="2338">He said, "Yes, I already talked to him and he knows." </sentence><sentence id="2339">He says "imagine." </sentence><sentence id="2340">So we made a party. </sentence><sentence id="2341">A party, really a reunion. </sentence><sentence id="2342">Tadek came. </sentence><sentence id="2343">We kissed and we hugged and the men drank. </sentence><sentence id="2344">There were other people. </sentence><sentence id="2345">He brought some vodka and there and the men drank, and there were other people, the Jews that survived, that everybody really shared in our joy. </sentence><sentence id="2346">And everyone made a tremendous to do over Tadek, to tell him how much we appreciate what he did, even though it was only one night in the chain of events. </sentence><sentence id="2347">If it weren't for this night, who knows if we would have survived. </sentence><sentence id="2348">The same goes for the first woman that kept my sister and myself in the couch. </sentence><sentence id="2349">If it weren't for her, I don't know if I would survive. </sentence><sentence id="2350">If 1 would be here to tell you all this. </sentence><sentence id="2351">Was only one day, and by Tadek it was only one night. </sentence><sentence id="2352">What are the other nights and the other years that it took to survive? </sentence><sentence id="2353">Yet, without this chain, were the little link broken, I probably would not maybe be here. </sentence><sentence id="2354">You needed somebody to give you a helping hand. </sentence><sentence id="2355">The tragedy was there were not many helping hands, and the ones that helped, again, are the giants in society. </sentence><sentence id="2356">They had the moral fiber. </sentence><sentence id="2357">They had the conscience, the feelings. </sentence><sentence id="2358">They were real people. </sentence><sentence id="2359">The way I would expect people to do in case of need. </sentence><sentence id="2360">And in general, to have morality because were the Germans moral, this would not have happened. </sentence><sentence id="2361">And it is in Bialystok that we began to look a way to come out. </sentence><sentence id="2362">And again, there were rumors that there is an organization that came, people came from Palestine. </sentence><sentence id="2363">They're trying to lead the survivors, get the other survivors and see if they can takes them to Palestine. </sentence><sentence id="2364">This was something sort of unbelievable. </sentence><sentence id="2365">How could it be possible? </sentence><sentence id="2366">But you know, after a while we learn that it is true. </sentence><sentence id="2367">People told us by word of mouth and it wasn't that, really, secretive. </sentence><sentence id="2368">It wasn't announced in the opening, but neither was it secret because they were very anxious to help. </sentence><sentence id="2369">And Aron through Ha-Shomer ha-Za'ir, again contacted the B'richa"(r) and with the help of B'richa we start to getting out, to getting out. </sentence><sentence id="2370">We left Poland. </sentence><sentence id="2371">My father remained behind for the simple reason that he had still hopes to find my little brother. </sentence><sentence id="2372">He said, he will stay and see what he can humanly possible to see if he can find his little brother. </sentence><sentence id="2373">He said already, "I will manage to get to you later." </sentence><sentence id="2374">We came to -- from Bialystok we came to Lublin. </sentence><sentence id="2375">In Lublin we met a greater number of young men and women that Aron knew that were members of the Ha-Shomer ha-Za'ir and that were friends of his and his sister's friends. </sentence><sentence id="2376">And we traveled with them. </sentence><sentence id="2377">We were given passports as Greek Jews, and we began to travel from Lublin to Krakow, from Krakow we went to Czechoslovakia to Bratislava, from Bratislava we went to Hungary and where ever we went we met by the B'richa. </sentence><sentence id="2378">They somehow arranged. </sentence><sentence id="2379">There were other trains. </sentence><sentence id="2380">The entire European continent, people were traveling in en masse, going home, going home. </sentence><sentence id="2381">Everybody had a place to go, but the Jews. </sentence><sentence id="2382">They were going home to Italy, to Czechoslovakia, to Rumania. </sentence><sentence id="2383">Everywhere people were traveling. </sentence><sentence id="2384">The trains were full. </sentence><sentence id="2385">You 6 flight (Hebrew), organized underground evacuation of Jews from post-war Eastern Europe. </sentence><sentence id="2386">grabbed on. </sentence><sentence id="2387">People were hanging on the outside of the boxcars and in the passenger cars. </sentence><sentence id="2388">There were no tickets. </sentence><sentence id="2389">People just traveled. </sentence><sentence id="2390">The Red Cross announced, too that they had facilities, whatever. </sentence><sentence id="2391">We were given really passports by Red Cross as refugees, and we came to Graz. </sentence><sentence id="2392">From Hungary we came to Graz and in Graz we had to cross the river, and to cross to get to the western zone of occupied Europe. </sentence><sentence id="2393">We did it with the help of the B'richa. </sentence><sentence id="2394">They led us. </sentence><sentence id="2395">A group before us when to go through to swim through the river. </sentence><sentence id="2396">Some of them drowned and they decided to hold off and to send the rest of the groups through the Alps. </sentence><sentence id="2397">And we went through the Alps with leaders that led us. </sentence><sentence id="2398">And we came to Tarvisio. </sentence><sentence id="2399">Tarvisio was already Italy. </sentence><sentence id="2400">It is in Tarvisio that we met up with the Jewish Brigade. </sentence><sentence id="2401">The Jewish Brigade was part of a Palestinian Jews that volunteered and they had a hard time to be accepted as a unit to the British Army. </sentence><sentence id="2402">And they were wearing these insignias here, the English insignias, but here on the sleeve they had a Magen David -- a Jewish star. </sentence><sentence id="2403">Can you imagine from wearing the star in the ghetto to come to Tarvisio and to see Palestinian Jews wearing it proudly on their sleeve? </sentence><sentence id="2404">The transition that it took in us. </sentence><sentence id="2405">They were absolutely -- they did everything humanly possible to do everything for us. </sentence><sentence id="2406">They fed us to the point where all of us were sick, because we were not accustomed to the rich foods that they tried to feed us. </sentence><sentence id="2407">And they did everything possible that they could to alleviate our worries. </sentence><sentence id="2408">I immediately found somebody that knew my sister that came from the town rejoining me, Slovaki (ph) and he was able to send a telegram to my grandmother in America and my aunt and uncle and my aunts and that I survived and my father survived. </sentence><sentence id="2409">And we did not stay long in Tarvisio because it was like a detention place. </sentence><sentence id="2410">Groups were coming and leaving further into the coast, into Italy. </sentence><sentence id="2411">We went to Bologna. </sentence><sentence id="2412">From Bologna we didn't stay there long at all. </sentence><sentence id="2413">We came to Florence, and the first night when we came to Florence we slept in that magnificent Synagogue, but we slept in the Sunday school that was adjoining the Synagogue. </sentence><sentence id="2414">They took the benches that the children used for sitting on, people used for sitting. </sentence><sentence id="2415">We put the benches and they brought something to lay on top and the first night in Italy we slept in Florence on the benches. </sentence><sentence id="2416">Besides Tarvisio was Italy too but really already away from it. </sentence><sentence id="2417">And we were immediately helped by UNRRA7" by the United Nations, where they gave us food, and we were registered with UNRRA and the struggle started how to go to Palestine. </sentence><sentence id="2418">The shores of Palestine were closed and you couldn't go. </sentence><sentence id="2419">Meanwhile, my family in America contacted me and they very, very much wanted me to come to the United States, even if I don't live there merely to come to see them. </sentence><sentence id="2420">They wanted to see me. </sentence><sentence id="2421">And since we could not go to Palestine, we decided to go to the United States. </sentence><sentence id="2422">My uncle and Aron's made affidavits for us to come. </sentence><sentence id="2423">They send us passage and everything and we came under the Refugee Act in 1947. </sentence><sentence id="2424">We came out to America. </sentence><sentence id="2425">We were married in Rome. </sentence><sentence id="2426">We lived from 1945 to "47, we lived in Florence and in Rome. </sentence><sentence id="2427">And Aron and | lived with an Italian family, a Christian family in Rome that took us in as a family. </sentence><sentence id="2428">And we shared our food with them because it was hunger in Italy at this time. </sentence><sentence id="2429">And we remained close friends until today. </sentence><sentence id="2430">Shortly we were married in Rome in this magnificent Synagogue with 10 witnesses that we brought with us so the Rabbi could marry us, and we came to the United States. </sentence><sentence id="2431">We came to a loving family that could not do enough for us. </sentence><sentence id="2432">We settled in Chicago. </sentence><sentence id="2433">First we came to New York. </sentence><sentence id="2434">My father's brother and sister lived in New York. </sentence><sentence id="2435">We visited with them and then we came. </sentence><sentence id="2436">We stayed for a while in Indianapolis and then we settled in Chicago. </sentence><sentence id="2437">The families were absolutely wonderful, loving, caring and giving to help us in any possible deg7 United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration way. </sentence><sentence id="2438">We had a wonderful life and we're so grateful, because we raised three sons that are wonderful human beings -- Howard, Gordon and Daniel --that are married. </sentence><sentence id="2439">We have three lovely daughter-in-laws; Barbara, Carol and Miriam. </sentence><sentence id="2440">And we have eight magnificent grandchildren; Courtney, 17, that is a Merit Scholar on the way to college. </sentence><sentence id="2441">Lindsey, charming and beautiful and lovely and giving, that told me they went on Thanksgiving Day to serve the hungry dinner, and the homeless. </sentence><sentence id="2442">Ari, Benji and Yalie, the joy, all of them. </sentence><sentence id="2443">Evan, bright, wonderful. </sentence><sentence id="2444">Rachel, beautiful, gorgeous to look at, and Gabie, our little Gabriel that is going to be two years old in December. </sentence><sentence id="2445">We tried to instill in them consciousness, good values, morality. </sentence><sentence id="2446">And our sons are physicians, try to prolong human lives, not to take away human lives. </sentence><sentence id="2447">Try to help. </sentence><sentence id="2448">Aron and I are both very active with the Holocaust Memorial Foundation in Skokie. </sentence><sentence id="2449">I am the chairperson of the speakers bureau and I truly do what I think I can do to see as a survivor that this never happens to any people on earth. </sentence><sentence id="2450">I feel only by education and only by perpetuating what we experienced and what we know to leave a legacy for future generations to come. </sentence><sentence id="2451">And I very much felt that this Museum really, truly will do the job when we will not be here anymore. </sentence><sentence id="2452">This is why we came and we want to give this testimony so it remains for generations to come. </sentence><sentence id="2453">For that, I thank you. </sentence></p></dialogue>
