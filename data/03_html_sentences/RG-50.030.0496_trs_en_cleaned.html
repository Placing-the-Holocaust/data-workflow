<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="45">Q: Right. </sentence><sentence id="46">Now, I -- I have no idea whether it's possible to do this, but as we're speaking, since you were such a young person, if there's a way for you to distinguish what you really remember </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="47">A: Mm-hm. </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="48">Q: -- as that kid, versus what you were told later, if there's a way of doing that as we speak -- </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="49">A: Mm-hm. </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="50">Q: -- it would be -- it would be very helpful. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="52">A: I think so. </sentence><sentence id="53">Of course, it's anybody's guess how accurate I am about that. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="56">Q: Right. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="58">A: But it's -- it's certainly true that I am able to at least comment about what I think are later deductions as opposed to early memories, mm-hm. </sentence><sentence id="59">Be glad to do that. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="62">Q: Let's talk a little bit about your family, your -- let's talk first about your father, who has one of those longest names that I've ever heard in my life. </sentence><sentence id="63">Can you give us his full name? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="66">A: Jacque Theobold Alfred Karl Cohen. </sentence><sentence id="67">Did I leave out one? </sentence><sentence id="68">Oh, Frederick -- </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="69">Q: Jacque Theobold Alfred Karl -- </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="70">A: I may have left out -- </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="71">Q: Frederick. </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="72">A: Frederick, right, Cohen. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="74">Q: Right. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="76">A: Right. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="78">Q: Where do all these names come from, do you know? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="80">A: I don't know because my paternal grandparents had already died when I was old enough to remember anything as a toddler. </sentence><sentence id="81">So I have no idea where they came from. </sentence><sentence id="82">It may also have been the fashion at the time to give people more than -- although that's not really true because my uncle who was born in Vienna, only had one name. </sentence><sentence id="83">So maybe it had to do with Sephardic as opposed to Ashkenazic Jews. </sentence><sentence id="84">Maybe it had to do with Holland versus Austria. </sentence><sentence id="85">Maybe it had to do with whatever the background of my father's parents was, which I don't know. </sentence><sentence id="86">I don't know what their occupation was or anything. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="95">Q: Do you remember if he was called Jacque? </sentence><sentence id="96">Was he known by his first name, or -- </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="97">A: Yes. </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="98">Q: He was? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="100">A: He was. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="102">Q: And what did he do? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="104">A: He actually was a baker, but a baker in American parlance has sort of -- sort of a vague meaning, but the kind of baker he was, was one of these European bakers who did all these specialty desserts. </sentence><sentence id="105">And he -- I only recently learned from my sister, my older sister, that he was a baker on the Holland-America line. </sentence><sentence id="106">And apparently before he was married, he -- that's what he did. </sentence><sentence id="107">And at some point, I don't exactly know where in -- in the yearly chronology, he decided he wasn't going to do this any more. </sentence><sentence id="108">And they prevailed on him to do it once more, and do it once more, and I guess he did it, he did -- went one more trip and they said we want you to take one more trip, and I -- I guess he put his foot down and said, I'm not doing it any more. </sentence><sentence id="109">And the -- that voyage, that ship that he said no to apparently was detonated by some torpedo that was left over from World War I. So that whatever it was, fate, whatever, saved him when he decided no, he wasn't going to do this any more. </sentence><sentence id="110">But that's what he did. </sentence><sentence id="111">And he had a bakery in Amsterdam, but I was never there, and we had already moved from there when I was born. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="120">Q: So when you were born, did he have the bakery? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="122">A: I think he still owned the bakery, but he didn't work at it. </sentence><sentence id="123">And I -- I know that he left the house every day, but I'm not really sure where he went. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="126">Q: Uh-huh. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="128">A: And the only baking that I was familiar with was what he did on Sunday mornings. </sentence><sentence id="129">It was traditional that he baked a pound cake. </sentence><sentence id="130">And so the house was always filled with this wonderful smell of baked goods, and his pound cake was incomparable. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="134">Q: Really? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="136">A: [have spent my life trying to find one like it, but it is impossible, it seems. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="138">Q: Is that one of your earliest memories -- </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="139">A: Mm-hm. </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="140">Q: -- of your father, is -- is baking at -- the pound cake? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="142">A: Well actually, the more prevalent and early memory is probably one of -- of him playing games with me. </sentence><sentence id="143">Being left at the dinner or breakfast table with my father is an early memory, because I didn't eat. </sentence><sentence id="144">And they used to say I lived off the air. </sentence><sentence id="145">I just was not a child who ate a lot, and I -- or at all, and so he was the one elected to amuse me and tell me stories. </sentence><sentence id="146">And he would pull out the contents of his pockets and make up stories, and then occasionally try to slide a spoonful of something or other in my mouth. </sentence><sentence id="147">And that -- that's sort of my earliest recollection, it -- it's one of the very early ones. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="154">Q: Huh. </sentence><sentence id="155">You took walks with your father also. </sentence><sentence id="156">Was -- was that after the occupation, or do you remember [indecipherable] </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="157">A: I very much remember it before also. </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="158">Q: Also. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="160">A: It was sort of our special time of day together, and he would come home from -- as I say from wherever, I don't know from where. </sentence><sentence id="161">And -- and then he and I would go for a walk just the two of us, and we would walk in the neighborhood, around the block or whatever, and it -- it was both before the occupation and for a short time after. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="164">Q: Did he also walk with your sister, or was this very special for you? </sentence><sentence id="165">Do you know? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="168">A: Ifhe walked with my sister I don't know about it, but he may have been one of these wonderful parents who knew how to make each child feel very special and -- and he probably did something with her, or maybe a walk or something else with her. </sentence><sentence id="169">I-I don't know, I actually never asked her. </sentence><sentence id="170">But there was always this little bit of time for us, and it was generally -- I don't remember if it was after or before supper, but it was either very late in the afternoon, or early evening. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="174">Q: And you'd have conversations? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="176">A: Mm-hm, mm-hm. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="178">Q: And would you tell -- would he ask you what your day was like, was that the -- or was it different? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="180">A: I don't think he asked me what my day was like. </sentence><sentence id="181">My sort of recollection, and as I say here, I'm not really sure this is a recollection or whether I imagined this, that we talked at a child's level about something very present. </sentence><sentence id="182">There wasn't stuff about what did you do, or what are you going to do, but more -- more about do you hear that bird singing, or s-something rooted in the present that a -- a -- rooted in the experience we were having together at that time. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="186">Q: Was his way of behaving with you, it -- as -- from what you can remember, different from other fathers? </sentence><sentence id="187">It doesn't sound like the usual story of a father being so concerned about the kids. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="190">A: | -- if I say this is unusual, it comes from a -- a long backwards and adult perspective and certainly not a child's memory because I had no idea what another father might have been like. </sentence><sentence id="191">But I would say yes. </sentence><sentence id="192">I would say for several reasons. </sentence><sentence id="193">Number one, he was an extremely gentle and patient man, which is the reason he took -- took all the stuff out of his pocket forever and ever and ever, and in fact one of those things sort of backfired, because I knew that among the treasures he had in his pocket was a small pair of scissors. </sentence><sentence id="194">And one time he and I were sitting in the living room of our house, and we had very heavy oak, dark, dark oak furniture, sort of dark, dark -- you know that heavy European furniture. </sentence><sentence id="195">And over the big, big table in the middle of this living room -- w-why this living room had this great big table sort of like -- more like a dining room table, I don't know, but that's the way it was set up. </sentence><sentence id="196">And the table had these heavy crosspieces underneath. </sentence><sentence id="197">And there was a plush tablecloth, if you can imagine, it's more the kind of thing you can imagine over a piano, but it was over the table, and it had long fringes on it, and it was over the table in such a way that the points of the cloth were on the ends and so forth. </sentence><sentence id="198">And it was great place for me, I always had my little hideout there, it was a little -- like a little house, and I asked to borrow the scissors one day, and I climbed under there and I gave the tablecloth a haircut. </sentence><sentence id="199">Not fun at the time. </sentence><sentence id="200">But was he different? </sentence><sentence id="201">I think he was also different because I think my mother was probably an early feminist in many ways, although I don't think she called herself that at the time. </sentence><sentence id="202">She was the working partner in the hou -- in the home at the time that I remember, anyway, and she had, apparently, a very unusual and important job for a woman in some kind of financial activity. </sentence><sentence id="203">Just exactly what it was, I never really knew or understood, and - - so she was out of my circle for much of the day. </sentence><sentence id="204">She was also not the one who was either as patient or as fun loving as I re-remember my father being. </sentence><sentence id="205">Not that my father was necessarily fun loving, but he was -- h-he smiled readily, as opposed to maybe yelling at me, which is more what I remember from my mother. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="223">Q: Uh-huh. </sentence><sentence id="224">So she was the disciplinarian. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="227">A: Probably, although from my point of view it wasn't -- you know, it was never fair, and it was never -- </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="228">Q: Right. </sentence><sentence id="229">So who took care of you during the day then, if you -- both of your parents are out -- you don't know what your father's doing, but your mother's certainly working. </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="230">A: Right. </sentence><sentence id="231">Well, it wasn't unusual for people of even modest means to have help in those days. </sentence><sentence id="232">I mean, this is now the 30's we're talking. </sentence><sentence id="233">And we did have what was known as a meisje, or a girl, who -- who worked for us, and -- and in fact I remember -- I -- I remember s -- being served, when I was still in my crib, I remember her bringing me breakfast in the crib, and the breakfast consisted of these things called Dutch rusk. </sentence><sentence id="234">I don't know if you know what those are, but it's sort of a light and airy kind of toasty thing of about a half an inch thick. </sentence><sentence id="235">And she always had them drenched in honey. </sentence><sentence id="236">And so she would bring me these things in the crib, and the honey would be all over the place, and I hated it. </sentence><sentence id="237">I just despised it, and everything was st -- then sticky and drippy, and you know, and you can imagine a toddler in the crib, and the honey. </sentence><sentence id="238">So yes, I think she was probably one that took care of us. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="248">Q: So how old do you think you were when you were in the crib? </sentence><sentence id="249">Two, three? </sentence><sentence id="250">Ye -- ye -- I mean, that's a clear memory for you. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="254">A: It's a very clear memory, and since it was a crib, I must have been two or so. </sentence><sentence id="255">Couldn't -- couldn't leave that sticky memory behind. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="258">Q: And your sist -- tell me what your mother -- what -- what was your mother's name? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="260">A: Rosa, Rosa Schwarz. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="262">Q: And was there difference in your parent's age, do you know? </sentence><sentence id="263">Or were they pretty close together? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="266">A: I-I'm not really sure. </sentence><sentence id="267">It's possible that my mother was maybe a year older or so. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="270">Q: I see. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="272">A: Or maybe more. </sentence><sentence id="273">I-I don't really know. </sentence><sentence id="274">I know my mother was a very -- with me was a very late parent -- mother. </sentence><sentence id="275">I mean, there are eight years difference between my sister and me. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="280">Q: Right. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="282">A: And I think that she married rather late, as well, so I'm -- yeah, I'm -- I'm sort of guessing that she was in her 40's when I was born. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="284">Q: Right. </sentence><sentence id="285">Hm. </sentence><sentence id="286">Was pretty late then. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="290">A: Mm-hm. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="292">Q: And your sister Betsy was eight years older than you. </sentence><sentence id="293">And do you have a recollection as a kid, of this older sister? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="296">A: Oh yes, very clearly, because I -- in addition to -- to a meisje who was taking care of us, she obviously as the big sister was often put in charge, and I always resented that terribly. </sentence><sentence id="297">And I think my poor sister suffered horribly because of that, because I would probably always giver her a hard time. </sentence><sentence id="298">I guess I was fairly headstrong. </sentence><sentence id="299">I'm not above throwing a temper tantrum and screaming, yelling and crying, and my poor sister had to put up with all that. </sentence><sentence id="300">So -- yeah, and -- and basically, I think my sister and I are -- are -- are somewhat different personalities to begin with. </sentence><sentence id="301">So I don't think that was an easy thing for her, and -- and it wasn't fun for me, you know, and there was -- it created this sister sibling sort of irritation. </sentence><sentence id="302">I because I didn't want to be told that I couldn't do something, and she because I didn't want to do what she said I had to do. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="310">Q: Right, right. </sentence><sentence id="311">What was the house like where you lived? </sentence><sentence id="312">Did you live in an apartment, did you live in a house? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="316">A: No, actually we lived in -- we lived in this very, very -- I guess bourgeois is probably the English equivalent word for it, but in a -- a very, very nice residential area, not too far from the Rijksmuseum, on the Pieter de Hooch Straat. </sentence><sentence id="317">And it was all residential, so there was no commercial activity going on there at all, which makes the presence of what was going on in our house even more puzzling, because my mother worked in the house, in -- in two rooms of our house was this contore or -- or office, as she would call it. </sentence><sentence id="318">And in Holland as you -- well, certainly in Amsterdam, all the houses are built so that they are smack up against each other. </sentence><sentence id="319">And there is no sort of stand alone housing. </sentence><sentence id="320">And it goes all the way around the four sides of a block that way. </sentence><sentence id="321">And what you have is people living on the ground floor, people living on the first floor, and another couple second, and another on the third. </sentence><sentence id="322">And then the house part, what we called ground floor, or caw -- or house, has access to the backyards. </sentence><sentence id="323">And the backyards are all pretty private, all surrounded by wooden fences, both in the middle and on the sides. </sentence><sentence id="324">So you really have a-again, a -- a greater European sense of privacy, while at the same time you can see into those yards from the first, second and third floor, not only of your building, but the one next to you on either side, and the one behind you from the other street. </sentence><sentence id="325">So there's -- yes, there is privacy, and no there isn't privacy in -- in some way. </sentence><sentence id="326">And this house that we had was brick, as most houses were, and there is not the front lawn kind of thing, and there's not the -- the curb lawn and so forth as we know it here, but -- but a city street, really, although it was residential. </sentence><sentence id="327">And we had -- that was unusual too, we had the ground floor, the house part and the first floor. </sentence><sentence id="328">But the first f -- two rooms of the ground floor were this office. </sentence><sentence id="329">But there was nothing on the front door, there was no mark of any kind, or title, or -- or -- or whatever. </sentence><sentence id="330">So I'm still a little bit at a loss as to what this outfit was, I'm only learning now from my sister who were the name -- what were the names of some of the -- well, I did know one of the names, th-the boss was Mr.Halle. </sentence><sentence id="331">And I know that my mother disappeared in these two rooms for much of the day, but that's about the extent of it. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="350">Q: So sh -- you don't know if she was an accountant, or she was a -- noth -- you have no idea? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="352">A: N-No. </sentence><sentence id="353">My sister might actually know that better. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="356">Q: She might. </sentence><sentence id="357">Uh-huh. </sentence><sentence id="358">But she didn't come out, for the most part, during those -- </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="359">A: No, she might come out, you know, for -- briefly for a couple of minutes during the day. </sentence><sentence id="360">At least that's my memory. </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="361">Q: Yeah, yeah. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="363">A: You know, I don't know -- </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="364">Q: Right. </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="365">A: -- actually if -- </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="366">Q: Right. </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="367">A: -- if it's accurate. </sentence><sentence id="368">For all I know she spent considerable time outside of it with me, only I don't remember it. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="371">Q: You don't remember it. </sentence><sentence id="372">But you weren't as comfortable with your mother as you were with your father at all, were you? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="375">A: Mm-mm, mm-mm. </sentence><sentence id="376">No, I th -- I think partly because -- I mean later on becoming a working woman myself, I had a little more sympathy for that. </sentence><sentence id="377">Because you may have limited time, you're trying to spend it with your child, the child doesn't understand that urgency of the moment. </sentence><sentence id="378">You want him or her to do x, y and z before you go back to the office, and they're not doing it. </sentence><sentence id="379">It creates a lot of stress and strain. </sentence><sentence id="380">And I always had the sense somehow that my mother was very nervous, that she was anxious, that she was tense. </sentence><sentence id="381">And I never had that with my father. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="390">Q: With your father. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="392">A: Now, as I say, that may all be -- I mean, the older I got the more appreciation I had of all of the difficulties that these adults were going through, right throughout. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="394">Q: Yeah, right throughout the period. </sentence><sentence id="395">W-Were there kids around in the neighborhood so you had friends? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="398">A: Well, the only child I remember being around was the child next door. </sentence><sentence id="399">And this child lived I - - it was either the second or the third story apartment next door. </sentence><sentence id="400">But because as I explained you can look into these yards, very often I would run into the yard and call up to her and she would come running out to the veranda, and so forth, and then she'd say, oh I will come over, or whatever. </sentence><sentence id="401">And she'd come over and play in our yard because we had the yard and they didn't, they only had the veranda. </sentence><sentence id="402">And -- and of course one of my very earliest hurtful and -- and shocking memories is of me doing exactly that, running out one day, as I did so many days and calling up to her to come out and play and she came to the edge of the veranda and she yelled dirty Jew at me and spat on me from the veranda. </sentence><sentence id="403">And I think it was the first really sort of crushing childhood blow for -- for what that means when someone does that to you. </sentence><sentence id="404">And something that we sort of underestimate always in terms of its impact when we, for example, deal with kids in school and their interactions and the bullying that takes place and the yelling and the -- y-you know, the sticks and stones line doesn't hold. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="412">Q: Right. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="414">A: Words can and do hurt. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="416">Q: That particular scene between you and -- and your friend, was that -- that's after the occupation of 1940, that you remember [indecipherable] happened -- </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="417">A: The thing that I have trouble with of course, is the chronology here. </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="418">Q: Yeah, yeah, sure. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="422">Q: Cause you would have been four years old. </sentence><sentence id="423">During the occupation you would have been four, right? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="426">A: Yeah, right. </sentence><sentence id="427">So my guess is it was some -- it would have to be after. </sentence><sentence id="428">It would have had to be after, I'm guessing. </sentence><sentence id="429">What I don't remember is exactly when and where this happened in relation to my starting school, which was more of a -- what do you call that, sort of a marker, y -- a time, chronology marker for me. </sentence><sentence id="430">I just have the recollection of that incident, and -- and it's sort of a -- a little bit -- perhaps out of sequence maybe now. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="436">Q: But it doesn't matter, it doesn't matter. </sentence><sentence id="437">You started s -- so y-your -- y-you don't have a clear perception of the occupation, beginning of the occupation, or do you? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="440">A: [have a clear recollection of the beginning of this sort of -- what I later understood as a really sort of maniacal way of building up the fear in the population. </sentence><sentence id="441">So the first time that I was aware that there was a major difference going on outside my home was the fact that I had started school, and then I had stopped school. </sentence><sentence id="442">So that was probably the first, although it might have been preceded by taking one of these walks with my dad, and the same wonderful walks that we used to take, and going down the street, I remember the -- there was a school opposite our house. </sentence><sentence id="443">It wasn't the school that I went to, but it was some other school, and again there was no lawn in the front, but they did have these sort of both ornamental and -- and physical heavy iron chains. </sentence><sentence id="444">And L used to love to sit on those and swing on them. </sentence><sentence id="445">But I wasn't doing that with my father, we were </sentence></p><p><sentence id="446"> -- we were going out for a walk and going down the block and turning right as we did, and I remember there on the opposite, diagonally opposite side of the street used to be an empty lot. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="447">And all of a sudden this particular day we went there, and it was all surrounded in wooden fencing, but not your attractive fencing or whatever, but in these -- it's the stuff that they used to have around baseball -- corner lot baseball thing -- I mean, I don't know -- exactly know how to say it, but you couldn't -- there were these vertical planks next to each other and you couldn't look through them. </sentence><sentence id="448">And so all of a sudden there is no empty lot except for this wooden fencing all around, and all of a sudden there is an opening in the fence, a door and a -- and a Nazi soldier walks out. </sentence><sentence id="449">And he is striding down the street and he comes towards my father and he asks him for a light for his cigarette. </sentence><sentence id="450">And I -- I remember almost as if it was yesterday, that my father, this patient, gentle man, really tensed, and lit the soldier's cigarette. </sentence><sentence id="451">And the soldier very politely said thank you and walked on. </sentence><sentence id="452">And my father swore under his breath. </sentence><sentence id="453">And I could sense this man's behavior was so out of character from how I knew him, that I knew that there was something amiss, but I, again had no -- no -- certainly no knowledge at the time what that meant. </sentence><sentence id="454">And what he said under his breath was Rotmof. </sentence><sentence id="455">Rotmof being the -- mof being the derogatory term used for the Nazis, and the rot meaning rotten. </sentence><sentence id="456">You know, so he was saying basically, rotten Nazi. </sentence><sentence id="457">And I didn't know what Nazi meant, and I couldn't understand why he would be saying this. </sentence><sentence id="458">I -- when I saw this soldier coming out I didn't know s -- I didn't know from soldiers, I really didn't understand anything. </sentence><sentence id="459">If you're asking me what was my childhood memory, I knew he was a soldier, that was -- </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="460">Q: That was it. </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="461">A: -- that was it. </sentence><sentence id="462">And I only knew he was called a Rotmof, because that's what my father said. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="465">Q: Did you know at the time that it was a swearword, or -- or was it -- </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="467">A: Yes, yes. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="469">Q: Y-You did. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="471">A: Well, hard to say, I -- I knew that it was something that was probably not good because he didn't say it out loud. </sentence><sentence id="472">And I knew that it was probably something that I wasn't supposed to copy, because he didn't say it out law -- loud. </sentence><sentence id="473">I don't think -- I don't remember, but I don't think I asked him what he said. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="510">A: Right, right. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="512">Q: And as I understand it, that was really upsetting to you, because you very much wanted to go to school, yes? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="514">A: Yeah. </sentence><sentence id="515">Well, in talking -- in referring back to this tension between my sister and me, I mean here she was not only this big girl who had all this responsibility and this power over me, and she was a schoolgirl and she had time set aside for doing homework and it was very much respected what she did, and -- and actually she was in the -- a student in the gymnasium, which is the Dutch so -- college preparatory, and the heavy duty curriculum of history and geography and algebra and geometry and German and French and English and Greek and Latin. </sentence><sentence id="516">And here she was partaking of these mysterious disciplines and this must have something to do with the fact that she had the responsibility for me. </sentence><sentence id="517">So I thought, well if I can access that also, then she won't have to do this any more, maybe. </sentence><sentence id="518">So I was very excited about starting school. </sentence><sentence id="519">I thought this was just going to be, you know, this was -- this was my way to heaven. </sentence><sentence id="520">And -- and -- and I couldn't wait, I really couldn't wait, I was so excited. </sentence><sentence id="521">And I don't think I really had more than a couple of weeks when I was no longer allowed to go to school. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="532">End of Tape One    </sentence></p><p><sentence id="533"> Beginning Tape Two </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="534">Q: Hedy, do you have any recollection whether your sister was as unhappy about school stopping? </sentence><sentence id="535">Cause obviously she couldn't go to school either. </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="536">A: Right. </sentence><sentence id="537">I don't have any real recollection, but having just visited her, as we are always wont to do, we tend to try to spend some time both reminiscing and sort of corroborating memories. </sentence><sentence id="538">And we've tried to make that a little bit more formal project, but that hasn't worked too well because of our individual lives sort of diverging and so on. </sentence><sentence id="539">But she shared with me, and I actually have it, I haven't had a chance to look at it, a book that was written about what happened at that time, to her school and her schoolmates. </sentence><sentence id="540">And -- and herself for that matter. </sentence><sentence id="541">What -- what happened was that before the stopping of school, what -- what was done was one of these many decrees that was offered. </sentence><sentence id="542">And the decree was that no -- that all the Jewish children had to go to the Jewish school -- to a Jewish school, or a school that was set aside as a Jewish school. </sentence><sentence id="543">Now, why they didn't do that with the elementary school kids, I don't know, and for all I know they did, except perhaps it was too far, or it -- my folks didn't think it was important, I don't know. </sentence><sentence id="544">But for the high school, they did set aside something wa -- which they called the joodse -- I think it was called the joodse lyceum. </sentence><sentence id="545">And so -- so all the Jewish kids were sort of pulled out of their s -- respective schools and told to go to this one school. </sentence><sentence id="546">And then they were tol -- and then were told there wasn't going to be any more school at all for the Jewish kids. </sentence><sentence id="547">And then, what I just learned, which I didn't know, was that apparently many of the teachers continued to try to teach these kids, and that the kids were meeting at respective parent's homes, as many of -- of them as could. </sentence><sentence id="548">And this book that she showed me was a book that was written by her -- one of her teachers from the gymnasium, who came with these kids and -- and taught them. </sentence><sentence id="549">I think I have this correct. </sentence><sentence id="550">And the book is basically not only a story of how this unfolded, and how they moved from whose home to which home and where it was located, and what happened when a particular student wasn't there, and everyone knew what had happened, which was that that family had been called up and deported. </sentence><sentence id="551">So there was this constant threat that ran through the meetings for however long they were able to -- to -- to carry on, about people disappearing, and the students being quite aware of this, and the teachers being very aware of this. </sentence><sentence id="552">And yet, trying to continue to keep going and to keep going, and then as I say, I have not had a chance to look at this book, but the book has since -- she was also interviewed for that. </sentence><sentence id="553">And one of the appendices in the book has the lists of all the students by the year that they should have been in -- in this school, and basically tells you what, to the best of this man's a-ability, happened to each of these, and -- and how -- how this all just came to pass. </sentence><sentence id="554">And it's -- it's all there documented and the -- and the difficulties of meeting in the homes, and the -- and the effort on people to try to create some sense of normalcy for these kids, who were clearly much, much, much more aware of what was happening than I certainly was. </sentence><sentence id="555">I mean, I had not a clue that she was even doing this at the time. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="577">Q: Right, and she would have, at your -- when you're five, she's what? </sentence><sentence id="578">Thirt -- </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="579">A: Mm-hm. </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="580">Q: -- five, six, seven, eight, nine, 10 - 11 -- 13 - 14. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="582">A: Right. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="584">Q: 13 or 14 years old. </sentence><sentence id="585">So she's much -- she's clearly much older. </sentence><sentence id="586">Do you not have any schooling then? </sentence><sentence id="587">The school stops, there's no tutoring, there's nothing? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="592">A: Nothing. </sentence><sentence id="593">But then again, it wasn't very long until -- until it stopped for everybody. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="596">Q: Yes. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="598">A: For my sister, as well. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="600">Q: Right, right. </sentence><sentence id="601">Now, I -- as I understand it, your father is picked up on a number of occasions and then comes back. </sentence><sentence id="602">Do you have recollections of his being taken? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="606">A: Yes. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="608">Q: Were you in the house and saw it? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="610">A: Yes. </sentence><sentence id="611">I do remember seeing it, I do remember being aware of it. </sentence><sentence id="612">I had, for example a very -- I have still, to this day, very clear memories of not being able to move about without wearing a jacket that had the Jewish star on it. </sentence><sentence id="613">And I can't remember in the order of things when this came, but I do distinctly remember that -- th-that our walks had to stop because we weren't allowed -- after dark we weren't allowed to come out -- s -- go outside. </sentence><sentence id="614">And I do remember him being taken, and I remember the anxiety and the tension. </sentence><sentence id="615">And I do remember him coming back, and this imme -- enormous relief when he came back. </sentence><sentence id="616">And this happened several times, and it's -- again in -- in reflecting about this time, and thinking about it over these many, many years, I'm just struck by another psychological manipulation of the population, you know, th-this constant instilling of some activity that would raise the level of anxiety, certainly among the Jews. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="624">Q: Do you remember learning later where your father went? </sentence><sentence id="625">I-I'm sure they didn't say anything to you when he came back, but do you have any idea where he was taken? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="628">A: [have no idea where he was taken except I remember being told or hearing -- overhearing them say that he was being taken away for questioning. </sentence><sentence id="629">And I have no idea why they took my father, I have no idea what they were questioning him about. </sentence><sentence id="630">I don't know whether my sister knows that, or whether this conceivably was now coinciding with the beginning of the deportation of the eastern European Jews who had fled to Holland in an effort to escape what was going on on the eastern front. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="634">Q: Right. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="636">A: And -- and so many of these people were originally housed at Westerbork and -- cause there was no place to keep them. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="638">Q: Right. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="640">A: And so they, in a sense, were sort of sitting ducks for being the first de -- deportees. </sentence><sentence id="641">And -- and that then later became a kind of holding camp, really. </sentence><sentence id="642">It's possible that they were trying to do this kind of random questioning in order to make sure that the rest of the Jews didn't flee. </sentence><sentence id="643">I mean, Holland being what it is, and where it is, there wasn't really a lot we could do on -- as was the unfortunate fate of those who fled to Holland. </sentence><sentence id="644">It's a tiny country, about the size of New Jersey, I think, flat as a pancake, a lot of it reclaimed land from the sea. </sentence><sentence id="645">You know, you can kind of look -- stand in one place and look to the beach and the shore and so forth. </sentence><sentence id="646">There were no hills and mountain caves or thick forests where people could flee or hide. </sentence><sentence id="647">So you were in as -- ina sense a captive, you know, with your back against the sea. </sentence><sentence id="648">And I know that all these countries made a desperate ef -- or at least the Jews in those countries made a desperate effort to get across the channel, get across the sea and -- and -- and go someplace else. </sentence><sentence id="649">But unfortunately that didn't work for a lot of people. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="660">Q: D-Do you remember that you didn't have very much food during this -- this is -- "m -- "m now asking before your father is actually arrested and you don't see -- </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="661">A: No, I have no memory of not having enough food at that time. </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="662">Q: You don't. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="664">A: No. </sentence><sentence id="665">Of course not -- not being a big eater, I might not have registered that. </sentence><sentence id="666">But I -- I re -- don't have any recollection of not having food at that time. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="670">Q: So you remained not a very good eater, which -- which ended up, I suppose, being fortunate. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="672">A: Perhaps. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="674">Q: In the e -- </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="675">A: Perhaps. </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="676">Q: In the end. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="678">A: Yeah, I think that a -- in fact, I have an early memory -- I have early memories and they probably were beforehand, before occupation -- maybe not -- of going to the market with my mother, but then again, that was one of the things that became forbidden. </sentence><sentence id="679">We couldn't go to the public market, but I remember going at some point in this time with my mother, and I always loved animals, and I always wanted to pet the horses. </sentence><sentence id="680">I mean, the -- the market consisted of all these horse drawn carriages lined up and -- and people peddled their wares from the -- from these carts. </sentence><sentence id="681">And she was always, forever pulling me away from the horses, and I -- that was not where I wanted to be. </sentence><sentence id="682">But I -- I always wanted to talk to the animals and pet the animals and so forth. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="688">Q: Did you have an animal? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="690">A: No. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="692">Q: You didn't. </sentence><sentence id="693">Did you want one in your house? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="696">A: At -- I think at that time I was so young that I didn't know that that might be a possibility. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="698">Q: I see. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="700">A: Also I'm not sure whether -- whether that was frequently the possibility in the city. </sentence><sentence id="701">Certainly would have been very happy to have one, but I don't -- I don't know. </sentence><sentence id="702">My -- my limited world at that time did not make that something I wanted, cause I didn't know it was possible. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="706">Q: Do you remember being bored, or did you -- did you have all sorts of things that you were doing in the course of the day, so not going to school wasn't too bad? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="708">A: You mean, when I could no longer go to school? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="710">Q: Yeah. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="712">A: That time I think was fairly short, between the time that we had to go into hiding, and the time that I was out of school. </sentence><sentence id="713">I -- I think there was a brief period I might have been bored. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="716">Q: Uh-huh, not so -- </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="717">A: But I don't remember it too well. </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="718">Q: Right. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="720">A: [remember a little bit sort of rummaging around the garden and sort of finding things to do. </sentence><sentence id="721">I- I don't remember toys at this time at all, no recollection of -- of things that were mine, I only had recollections of things in the house, or things in the yard. </sentence><sentence id="722">I remember there must not have been good and adequate refrigeration space because my parents kept limburger cheese in the coalhouse in the backyard, you know, the house that contained the coal for the heating and so on. </sentence><sentence id="723">And so it must be that that was because it was cold. </sentence><sentence id="724">Or maybe it was because it was smelly, I don't know. </sentence><sentence id="725">Or both? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="732">Q: Right. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="734">A: So -- and no, I -- actually it must have been refrigeration because I have this vague recollection sometimes of a pitcher of milk -- </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="735">Q: Being put there. </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="736">A: -- also going back there. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="798">A: It was th -- well, this is what I have to do, and it was also a way in which I began to put pieces of the puzzle together in a way, in the sense that I did realize there was some connection between what the girl said to me -- what this child spat at me, and the word on the jacket. </sentence><sentence id="799">There was a connection and I did realize that there was -- that I basically was now being labeled, that I was, you know, that I was Jew, and that that was -- that that was a way of making sure that everyone else knew I was a Jew. </sentence><sentence id="800">And th-that left a kind of -- what's the word I want? </sentence><sentence id="801">Sort of an unclear, but an -- a -- a -- it left a feeling of understanding what was happening, but not -- there was no understanding of why and how come and who was making us do that. </sentence><sentence id="802">I d -- I just began to sense that there was a connection between what was on the jacket, and what the child had said, and that there was some reason that people needed to be able to recognize me and knew that -- and know that I was a Jew. </sentence><sentence id="803">And why, or how come, or what was it about being a Jew that needed demarcation labeling, I had no idea. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="810">Q: So, when you're given the jacket with the Jew -- you -- it says Jood? </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="820">A: I don't remember. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="822">Q: Do you remember seeing other people wearing it? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="824">A: [remember my -- yes, I think I did, actually. </sentence><sentence id="825">I certainly remember my family wearing it, and I think that the -- there were -- I -- we were not actually living in a Jewish area, in a pronounced, predominantly Jewish area, so I didn't really know about the whole Jewish section of Amsterdam until I was an adult and went back to Amsterdam and -- and actually toured that area and saw the synagogues and was in the Jewish museum and saw the statue commemorating the uprising and the strike and so forth. </sentence><sentence id="826">I -- I knew nothing of that as a child, so that may account in part for why I didn't see more of that. </sentence><sentence id="827">And it wasn't really until I was an adult and I s-studied lots of stuff, including the whole psychological phenomena of -- of labeling and what that means. </sentence><sentence id="828">And -- and I'm sure you're familiar with a very, very powerful piece that was done right after Martin Luther King died, by the teacher in Riceville, lowa, which "Frontline" featured on PBS, and I have since used with my students a good many times, which is just basically having the children experience what happens when you do -- do label and stigmatize people. </sentence><sentence id="829">Sometimes it's called -- the program is called, "Blue Eyes, Brown Eyes." </sentence><sentence id="830">There's another version of it that also takes this woman into prisons and other areas of -- in -- of human interaction where she tries the same thing with adults, and it works almost more successfully even. </sentence><sentence id="831">And -- and that's called, "The Eye of the Storm." </sentence><sentence id="832">I've forgotten which one comes first, but -- and then she also has another -- she has a reunion with that first class with whom she tries it, and it is incredible how positive the influence on these people this early exercise was, where, you know, she -- she makes the attempt to have the children understand what it's like when you do that to people. </sentence><sentence id="833">And she separates them according to the color of their eyes. </sentence><sentence id="834">And then she says to the children, you know, I understand that -- first she tries it with whatever, blue eyes, and she says, I understand that you -- | -- I have just learned that -- that blue eyed people are just not as smart as brown eyed people. </sentence><sentence id="835">And then later in the day she says, you know, they're not even as attentive, and they're not as good as -- you know, she goes on and on with this. </sentence><sentence id="836">And then she said, you know what, we should label these people so that we can more easily recognize them, and then we don't have to choose them on the team, and we don't have to play with them, because they're not as smart as we are. </sentence><sentence id="837">And so why don't we put collars on them. </sentence><sentence id="838">And then you see this whole effect of what this labeling does to these third or fourth graders. </sentence><sentence id="839">And -- and i-i-it's -- it's an eye opener. </sentence><sentence id="840">It's shocking. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="859">Q: Do you think that that's -- that happened to you, that -- that having this star on you made you feel inferior, or you -- because you describe it as not really knowing what's going on. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="869">Q: Right. [ </sentence><sentence id="870">indecipherable] right. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="873">A: And of course the -- the things that you associate with the label also have something to do with it. </sentence><sentence id="874">If you put the collars on and you tell people they're smarter, then you get the reverse effect. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="877">Q: Right. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="879">A: And you do, you do. </sentence><sentence id="880">You tell the kids they're smarter, they behave, th -- I mean that this is -- a lot of educational research is out there. </sentence><sentence id="881">You tell the kids they're smarter, they perform better. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="885">Q: Right. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="887">A: But -- but that was not the intention here by the Nazis, clearly. </sentence><sentence id="888">And actually this is the kind of thing that -- that when I was talking to you earlier about sharing recollections of the war year, the pre-war years with my Dutch friend, who became the professor of religion at Smith, he remembers when this was being -- this was going on in the town where he grew up, I think it was Breda. </sentence><sentence id="889">And he said all of a sudden the kids, his buddies at school took this as formal approval of doing stuff like yelling epithets at people who were wearing the star. </sentence><sentence id="890">I -- I mean, th-they took this as open season, essentially, so that there was a yi -- and he -- he recalled -- I remember this very clearly, he recalled when we were doing our joint recollections, walking home from school with a bunch of his friends, and there was an old man who was wearing the star and was clearly elderly and so forth and so on, and that the boys who the day before had been perfectly polite and passed this man without any events happening at all, started to stone him. </sentence><sentence id="891">Now, you know, here you have this kind of institutional approval because as -- you now say to everybody, we've labeled these people as untermenschen, as dirt, as people that you can do anything you like with. </sentence><sentence id="892">I mean, it's unfortunately a little bit of I think what we did in Vietnam is we socialized the soldiers to be willing to do unheard of, inhuman things. </sentence><sentence id="893">I mean, what these guys did in My Lai didn't come about because someone wanted to have a heyday. </sentence><sentence id="894">So -- so the dehumanizing effect that you can create, that you can program essentially, you can socialize people to participate in, even though their teachings and everything else would have you believe that they wouldn't and shouldn't. </sentence><sentence id="895">And happily there were people who didn't, and who stood up. </sentence><sentence id="896">But then -- then you see then the Nazis come in and they manipulate that, so they arrest the people who were protecting Jews, or they have a shooting in the square to basically call attention to anyone who was trying to live up to his or her Protestant or Catholic teachings, and not do this to their fellow human beings. </sentence><sentence id="897">But it's -- it's -- it makes you think about how incredibly thin the layer of civilization really is. </sentence><sentence id="898">And when the chips are down, you know, the scapegoating, the stereotyping, the labeling all play one against, another against, but with the other, to -- to create -- I don't know what it is about us that we always have to feel better than somebody, and in order to feel better we have to put someone else down. </sentence><sentence id="899">And that's what they were successfully doing. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="914">Q: Do -- do you remember any other instance before you go into hiding where somebody calls you a dirty Jew, or uses an epithet, or -- or is that the one incident that you recol -- </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="915">A: No, it's really the one incident that I do remember. </sentence><sentence id="916">I d-don't know whether my sister had more. </sentence><sentence id="917">It's the only incident I remember before the war. </sentence><sentence id="918">The next one that I remember actually came after I came to America and went to elementary school, and I was -- I was always a bit of an activist I guess, and I was anxious to fit in and blend in and do all the things that all the other kids do, and lose my accent and learn to play baseball and all those kinds of things. </sentence><sentence id="919">But I was on the safety patrol, and so I was -- my job was to see that the little kids got on the bus first and weren't trampled by the big kids, and all that stuff on the school bus. </sentence><sentence id="920">And -- and I remember I was in sixth grade by then, and there was a boy who was trying to sneak into line and get on the bus and I yanked him out and said he couldn't do this, or whatever, whatever, he had to let the little kids go first. </sentence><sentence id="921">And he turned around and he called me a dirty Jew. </sentence><sentence id="922">He was a classmate of mine. </sentence><sentence id="923">That was my first experience with it in America. </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="924">Q: Did you respond? </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="930">Q: Mm-hm. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="932">A: And of course, then you get in -- then you get caught up into something else which is by the time you're 12 years old and you get the message that you don't want to be a squealer and you don't want to this and that and the other. </sentence><sentence id="933">And I don't think I responded, and I don't think I told anybody. </sentence><sentence id="934">But I don't remember. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="958">Q: Do you remember? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="960">A: I do remember because I remember it so distinctly, and at first I thought that it was maybe in my memory that had been clouded over or colored by the nature of the events. </sentence><sentence id="961">But that was in fact not the case because it's been corroborated that in fact it was twilight. </sentence><sentence id="962">It was early evening, and again that's sort of not a time when you expect people to come to the door. </sentence><sentence id="963">A-Again, I -- I sometimes think about these things much -- much -- I mean way after the fact in the sense that when I first remembered that -- th -- or any of these experiences, I didn't remember them with all of the stuff that I bring to it now, which is to say, lord, just think about the minds that devised all these schemes. </sentence><sentence id="964">So usually by the time you think you're -- you know, you're in the evening, and unless you're expecting company you sort of think you're safe inside your house. </sentence><sentence id="965">Well -- and I think this was the first time that he was called up by these Gestapo that was in the evening. </sentence><sentence id="966">The - - the other times had all been daylight. </sentence><sentence id="967">So they came in the evening and they knocked on the door, and I remember -- I think I was somewhere not far behind, watching the scene. </sentence><sentence id="968">And they asked for my father very politely, and they said to my mother, "We'll be back for you later." </sentence><sentence id="969">And to this day, I think and think of -- about this, and I keep asking myself, were these soldiers trying to give my mother the high sign? </sentence><sentence id="970">Were they trying to give her an opportunity to do something?Were they ineffective and inefficient Nazis and slipped, and shouldn't have said that? </sentence><sentence id="971">You know, what -- what was going on here in the minds of these guys? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="986">Q: Right. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="988">A: Pll never know. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="990">Q: I'm going to continue asking you about this, but we have to change the tape, unfortunately. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="997">Q: They were def -- they were definitely -- </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="998">A: There were no s -- to my knowledge there were no soldiers in Dutch uniform around at this time. </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="999">Q: Uh-huh. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1001">A: The -- the capitulization -- capitulization of the Dutch to the Nazis, as I understood it -- and I've only just recently begun to look at this, because for so many years, I felt this was not an area I wanted to study, this was not an area I wanted to look at as a scholar and so forth. </sentence><sentence id="1002">Now, I'm beginning to have a little different sense, and -- and actually for a number of reasons. </sentence><sentence id="1003">But a -- as I understood it, it was somewhere around this time that -- that the Dutch government basically was a sort of government under the aegis of a Dutch -- a -- no, I think it was a Dutch Nazi general some -- some sort of person like that, named Seyss-Inquart, who was basically put in charge, where the -- whereas the queen -- I guess the queen and the -- and the royalty wasn't exactly the tuling figure anyway, given the Dutch combination of a constitutional monarchy, and so on. </sentence><sentence id="1004">But the queen left for England and the prince and princess and their children left for Canada. </sentence><sentence id="1005">And -- and actually later on I-I remember hearing some broadcasts of the queen speaking to us from England and so on. </sentence><sentence id="1006">But so this -- this -- putting this person in charge again, was -- was one of these pieces that I didn't -- I wasn't aware of at the time. </sentence><sentence id="1007">I mean, what does a little kid know about government and how it operates? </sentence><sentence id="1008">I didn't know where the rules were coming from that were being asked -- well, were being laid down. </sentence><sentence id="1009">I knew that there was something about the fact that we were not any longer having lots of red, white and blue flags out, and orange streamers on    the flag poles, which all represented Holland and the House of Orange. </sentence><sentence id="1010">I don't remember seeing Nazi flags either, but I didn't see the Dutch flags. </sentence><sentence id="1011">And -- and it was again one of these ways of making things seem like they were normal. </sentence><sentence id="1012">So there was a government and it was issuing decrees, and this was a Dutch, presumably -- th-there was a fair amount of collusion among the Dutch. </sentence><sentence id="1013">Something that only has come to my knowledge somewhat from the experiences I had, but much more -- more real when I became an adult and read a little bit more, and heard a little bit more, because I'd always grown up thinking, you know, the Dutch were so wonderful, and the Dutch basically saved me, and my sister and my mother. </sentence><sentence id="1014">And they did that also to some other Jews. </sentence><sentence id="1015">But there was also a lot of collusion going on. </sentence><sentence id="1016">The NSB was -- the NSB was known as the party that was in collusion with the Nazis. </sentence><sentence id="1017">And it was -- i-it was probably a way in which -- in which all politics and occupation works, and which uncomfortably I'm aware of, the United States does likewise, which is you find your way in to some society by a group of people with whom you associate and with whom you vision a common goal and you infiltrate, basically. </sentence><sentence id="1018">And so the -- the amount of collusion there was rather shockingly high, from my perspective. </sentence><sentence id="1019">Not one I'm tremendously proud of. </sentence><sentence id="1020">Holland, on the other hand, has had a long, historical tradition of religious freedom, going back to William of Orange, and was probably also one of the reasons that the Jews found receptive ground and receptive society, because they fled from so many places of persecution, including Spain. </sentence><sentence id="1021">So -- and actually my -- my grandparents, my father's parents came -- now | don't know if they directly or their parents came up from Spain, but then actually that's something that I'm hoping at some point to get back to The Netherlands and do some of that research, because Holland and all other countries besides the U.S. have, of course, this incredible record keeping and documents, archive stuff going back to the Middle Ages, and so I'm hoping to do some of that research myself. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1044">Q: Right. </sentence><sentence id="1045">Now, when -- when you remember back to that twilight when your father was taken, y- yi -- do you -- you remember these soldiers as being, or gestap -- we don't know what they are, you don't th -- what th-they are. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1048">A: I think they were Gestapo, yeah. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1050">Q: You think they were Gestapo. </sentence><sentence id="1051">They were polite with your father, so they weren't rough with him? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1054">A: They very -- with -- these men, in my recollection were polite, they were soft-spoken, they were not m -- you know th -- a -- I don't remember at that particular time whether there was a heil Hitler associated with the interaction. </sentence><sentence id="1055">I don't remember if it was German or Dutch at that time. </sentence><sentence id="1056">I do remember at other times that it was German. </sentence><sentence id="1057">And I do remember at other times -- a- and this is something now again, I can't swear to. </sentence><sentence id="1058">I don't remember now whether I really heard this, or whether my current knowledge fills in the heil Hitler, I don't know, but I am pretty sure that some of those other times when he was arrested, I did hear it. </sentence><sentence id="1059">I don't remember it the night that he was arrested this time. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1066">Q: Did he say goodbye to you when he was arrested, do you remember? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1068">A: I don't think so. </sentence><sentence id="1069">O-Or if he did it was probably -- again, I don't know if this was because he, as a parent he was trying not to create greater anxiety, or because he really thought he might be coming back again, the way he always had in these past times. </sentence><sentence id="1070">But I don't remember it. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1074">Q: But -- so does he leave with anything, or he simply leaves -- he just goes out? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1076">A: He just goes out. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1078">Q: He just goes out. </sentence><sentence id="1079">So the door closes, and your mother now makes a very radical decision. </sentence><sentence id="1080">And what is that? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1084">A: Well, in retrospect, I don't know how radical it was, but she basically grabbed a bag, and I still remember the looks of the bag, it was sort of a yucky brown, n-no -- not an attractive bag, but some sort of satchel [indecipherable] satchel of some sort of plastic or leather, or something, and throws in a hairbrush, and a toothbrush and -- for each of us, grabs our jackets, takes us by the hand and walks out the door, literally walks out the door and closes the door behind her. </sentence><sentence id="1085">And we walked -- a -- a -- and we -- she -- we had to come down steps, it was up a couple steps, and we came down s -- and walked into the street and I remember being aware of the fact that it was curfew, because Jews were not allowed on the street, because there was a curfew. </sentence><sentence id="1086">They were not allowed on the trolleys, they were not allowed in the libraries, they were not allowed in the parks. </sentence><sentence id="1087">Alla -- aya -- they were not allowed in school. </sentence><sentence id="1088">And -- and these decrees, by the way, were not given all at once, they were -- this is why I keep reminding m-myself and others about the mind that was operating to keep upping the ante, to keep this level of normalcy, but just enough fear and enough intrusion into the way of life that it was clear who was in charge. </sentence><sentence id="1089">So one decree would be about you can't use the libraries, and you -- so you say to yourself, well, alright, we can get along without the library. </sentence><sentence id="1090">Next time it's the park. </sentence><sentence id="1091">Well, you know, we'll play in the backyard, we go -- we won't take walks. </sentence><sentence id="1092">So it -- always it's also somehow to contain the population you're affecting, by making them adjust all the time. </sentence><sentence id="1093">And -- and that adjustment, which is again something that if I -- if I can I may come back to later, but it's -- on the one hand, it's a peculiar characteristic of us humans, that we can adjust to an incredible amount of stuff before we say stop. </sentence><sentence id="1094">And in one sense we should have said stop right there, and we should have risen up and we should have said we won't take this. </sentence><sentence id="1095">And of course there were efforts at doing that, sporadically here and there. </sentence><sentence id="1096">But by and large, the effect of this layering is to keep the people from not boiling the waters, and doing what I think Jewish populations have done since time immemorial as guests in new societies, which is to say, well, you know, if we do what they ask, if we just comply with what people are asking us to do, then they" II leave us alone. </sentence><sentence id="1097">But they didn't leave us alone. </sentence><sentence id="1098">And so that's -- that always is something that comes to my mind when things happen, and I say, well should we accept this, or should we stand up and fight right here?And it a -- and one of these things happened in my town in Massachusetts where the question came should we make a noise about this or should we not. </sentence><sentence id="1099">And -- and the general feeling of the Jewish community was led by the rabbi, which was, w-w-well, you know, we'll just let this go by kind of thing. </sentence><sentence id="1100">And mine, s -- much to my surprise, cause I'm not necessarily a person who makes waves, but I said this is wrong. </sentence><sentence id="1101">It's not right, and we should be -- here in America we should be calling attention to the fact that this is wrong. </sentence><sentence id="1102">But anyway, the effect of this layering, as I say, was -- w-was t-to keep people in compliance, and to, at the same time instill this modicum of fear and anxiety. </sentence><sentence id="1103">And -- and I -- I -- I don't know what my father's feeling was at that point when he was taken away. </sentence><sentence id="1104">I don't know whether he himself had an inkling that this was different, or whether he really did think he was coming back, or -- I -- I -- I really don't know what they thought, and whether this is a question of radical behavior on my mother's part, yes and no, and it's probably a dual answer because as we walked across the city, and I longingly looking at the trolleys, I remember that cause I was little kid and I was tired and I wanted to ride. </sentence><sentence id="1105">And the trolleys, I remember this eerie feeling as the trolleys were going by and I was -- they were totally empty. </sentence><sentence id="1106">There would be one person sitting in the trolleys, because -- not that -- that the non-Jews weren't allowed on the trolleys, but the general tenor in the -- in the country was beginning to be much more concerned and so people weren't out going to the theater and doing stuff. </sentence><sentence id="1107">And I remember us walking through the archway of the Rijksmuseum, which is a gorgeous Victorian building with all its towers and spires and so forth and part of it is arched over a roadway which at that time still had the old fashioned heavy cobblestones that were like little miniature hills, each one of them. </sentence><sentence id="1108">And our steps were re-echoing in that archway as we walked through, and I remember feeling a certain amount of fear. </sentence><sentence id="1109">Cause I knew we were not supposed to be out. </sentence><sentence id="1110">And I knew that my mother was afraid and that she was anxious and we had to hurry and we had to be quiet. </sentence><sentence id="1111">And I knew that we couldn't help ourselves, there was this clatter of the footsteps. </sentence><sentence id="1112">And so the sense that somebody might be coming for us, or coming after us was definitely there, in -- in my head at that time, because I remember the feeling. </sentence><sentence id="1113">I didn't know why, but I had the feeling. </sentence><sentence id="1114">I knew that we were leaving and that we were going someplace else and we -- we -- the -- where we lived was called Amsterdam South, it was the southern part of the country, and -- o-of the city, and we went to Amsterdam West, which was across town,

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1218">Q: If -- as a -- [indecipherable] yeah. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1220">A: That's true. </sentence><sentence id="1221">Well, that's true, and of course there was this whole other activity that was going on, that I only learned about later, which was -- well, some of which I n -- I was aware of, which is that everybody had to have identity cards, and the Jewish ones had a big J stamped on it. </sentence><sentence id="1222">And I also knew, and I -- this was before, I believe before my father was taken, that a friend of the    family, who was a minister, actually provided us with fake baptism papers. </sentence><sentence id="1223">Because -- I-I remember that at the time, and I remember sort of hearing about it, and perhaps even be -- being given one of those t-to have on my person. </sentence><sentence id="1224">And of course, initially it was, I think as I mentioned, first when they started doing the calling up of Jews -- first of all, they also instituted another one of their pieces of madness. </sentence><sentence id="1225">They started this thing called Joods Raad, which was basically translated as the Jewish councils. </sentence><sentence id="1226">They -- they took various |-leaders within the Jewish community and created a kind of a self governance piece, so that essentially they gave them the orders of what they wanted done, and they made them responsible for carrying it out. </sentence><sentence id="1227">So now what you're doing is you're creating this horrendous thing between people of the same marked, steri -- stigmatized group and saying, you do the dirty work, you choose who's going to be called up next. </sentence><sentence id="1228">You are the ones that promulgates the decrees of n-not -- no access of the schools and this and that and the other. </sentence><sentence id="1229">So the Jewish councils were having to do this to their own people. </sentence><sentence id="1230">And the -- the -- the tendency to first of all condemn these people roundly, I think is very great, because you're saying, you know, what the hell were you doing tell -- sending us off to the -- be slaughtered. </sentence><sentence id="1231">By the same token, I don't think they were all doing it from that perspective. </sentence><sentence id="1232">I think some of them were doing it because, as I said before, they thought that well, if we just comply with that they're asking, and maybe I can help to keep my people sort of understanding that if we just keep calm and do what they ask, we can get through this all right. </sentence><sentence id="1233">I think they were doing it from that perspective, some of them. </sentence><sentence id="1234">I think others probably were doing it to save their own skins, sort of either realizing whatever was happening it wasn't good, but if they volunteered to do this, then maybe they would not have to go. </sentence><sentence id="1235">And I have to say that, coming through this experience, I don't think any of us is ever able to say what we would or would not do under any circumstances such as these. </sentence><sentence id="1236">I don't think you know what you're capable of doing, I don't think you know what you're capable of tolerating, I don't think you're cap -- yo-you have any sense of the reality of w-what you might do if you or your family members were under siege or in peril of losing their lives. </sentence><sentence id="1237">I just think it's impossible. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1263">A: I don't know if I was carrying it or whether my parents had them, to be able to produce them. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="1264">But the reason for these certificates also was that initially -- oh, I guess I lost track of the flow of this, initially they called up the refugees from eastern Europe and deported those, and made nice space available in Westerbork and so forth, and then they began to deport various among the Jews. </sentence><sentence id="1265">Now who they were and why these people were chosen, I don't know. </sentence><sentence id="1266">And I don't know if perhaps my father was instrumental in perhaps helping other people get papers or something like that, I don't know. </sentence><sentence id="1267">This went -- first they started calling up the people who were full blooded Jews. </sentence><sentence id="1268">And then, when there were no more of those -- and of course, you say, or you might say, how did they know who those people were? </sentence><sentence id="1269">Well, this is where this incredible record keeping. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="1270">All they had to do was go to the municipal offices and get the birth records and the this and the that and the other. </sentence><sentence id="1271">And -- and they did that. </sentence><sentence id="1272">They did an incredible amount of this kind of spade work. </sentence><sentence id="1273">So they would s -- first call up the ones who were hundred percent Jewish, and then they would call up the people who were 75 percent Jewish. </sentence><sentence id="1274">And then they would call up the people who were 50 percent Jewish. </sentence><sentence id="1275">And then they would call up the people who had -- the one ha-half of a couple who had intermarried, and they would leave the others. </sentence><sentence id="1276">And this -- this is what gave rise to the papers. </sentence><sentence id="1277">Could you show that you had not -- no -- were no longer Jewish? </sentence><sentence id="1278">But it didn't help, because after awhile they said it didn't count, that -- you know, at first, yes, they'd leave </sentence></p><p><sentence id="1279"> you alone, cause now you were not Jewish. </sentence><sentence id="1280">But then they would say, anybody who was born Jewish. </sentence><sentence id="1281">I mean they just -- </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1282">Q: But yo -- but your parents had a certain kind of foresight -- </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1283">A: Yes. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1293">A: This would have had to be before -- </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1294">Q: Yeah. </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1295">A: -- because he couldn't have gotten out, nor could they have gotten out. </sentence><sentence id="1296">And apparently it was my mother who didn't want to go, at least that's my recollection of the way this was told. </sentence><sentence id="1297">And I - - I could be wrong about that, but -- and I often thought about this afterwards, and I thought, why would she not want to go when this was on the horizon? </sentence><sentence id="1298">And I think it was just such an incredible disbelief that this would ever. </sentence><sentence id="1299">I mean, it's like so many things that face us, and you kind of think, no, I mean it's -- it's probably just in human nature that you ke -- you have to either get your head in the wave rolling over you, or you have to be enormously courageous, or maybe a little bit crazy, or even stupid by some people's judgment, to drop everything, to drop </sentence></p><p><sentence id="1300"> this good job that she had, to leave this lovely house and all the -- the material things and take off for no man's la -- | mean, America? [ </sentence><sentence id="1301">indecipherable] not that it was no man's land, in fact she had an uncle I know who came back and brought her s -- her brother some gifts and brought her some things from the United States and so on. </sentence><sentence id="1302">So she knew about the United States. </sentence><sentence id="1303">But she apparently said no, but then my father -- so the story goes, my father who took my uncle to the boat, apparently said to him, if anything ever happens to us, will you see to my children? </sentence><sentence id="1304">And, you know, I've heard this story repeated from my uncle, and then also from my sister, but I didn't know about it. </sentence><sentence id="1305">So if there was something pre-thought, or predicted, or anticipated, it must have come from both the news and reading what happened around Europe and this was coming closer and closer, and then actually having my father arrested. </sentence><sentence id="1306">So, between my brother fleeing -- my -- her brother, my mother's brother fleeing, and saying to his sister, why don't you drop everything and come, and the actual things that happened after he left, they must have done some things, including the fact that when we finally ended up at the home where we -- where we were hidden for the war, and led into the basement, there in the basement were two beds that I recognized as having come from my home, and a quilt and some blankets that I knew were from home. </sentence><sentence id="1307">So -- </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1308">Q: So you haven't noticed that they were not in your house? </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1309">A: No, I didn't notice that they were missing at all. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1311">Q: Oh. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1313">A: Had not registered this at all. </sentence><sentence id="1314">Well, one of them was a trundle, and it was the bottom part of the piece that would have gone under something. </sentence><sentence id="1315">So that might be easy to miss. </sentence><sentence id="1316">I'm not sure where the other bed came from. </sentence><sentence id="1317">I did not ever miss it, I didn't see it going out of the house. </sentence><sentence id="1318">And that must have been some doing cause it came off the first floor of the house, it had had to go down the stairs, it had to be trucked. </sentence><sentence id="1319">I-I don't know when that happened. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1328">Q: Right. </sentence><sentence id="1329">I think that's what I mean when I say that's a kind of radical move, because while your mother was not willing to leave to go to America, she saw something as soon as your father -- that was a real arrest. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1332">A: Yeah, I think so. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1340">A: Where she was going. </sentence><sentence id="1341">And she must have done something to prepare for that eventuality. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1344">Q: Right. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1346">A: And I have no idea when those beds went there, because I never saw them go. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1348">Q: Right. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1350">A: I don't know whether they were there right after my uncle left for America, when they could still move stuff without alerting anybody. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1352">Q: Right. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1354">A: Whether they were clandestinely moved in the middle of the night and I was asleep. </sentence><sentence id="1355">No idea. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="1356">None. </sentence><sentence id="1357">And the interesting thing about those things that were there also, was -- I mean there was no question that this quilt was from our house, and -- then of course there were three of us sharing these two beds then. </sentence><sentence id="1358">There was something else there that I recognized. </sentence><sentence id="1359">Upstairs in the lower shelves of the buffet were not only some staples that had been put there, which apparently my folks had been responsible for putting there, there was also my mother's best china. </sentence><sentence id="1360">It was a beautiful set of china that I adored. </sentence><sentence id="1361">It was sort of an ivory colored Rosenthal china with little    </sentence></p><p><sentence id="1362"> roses on it. </sentence><sentence id="1363">And I thought it was simply beautiful. </sentence><sentence id="1364">And here my mother has chosen, of all the material things, to bring that china. </sentence><sentence id="1365">Not with her when we fled there -- </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1366">Q: Right. </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1367">A: -- but obviously at some point beforehand. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1369">Q: And again, you hadn't noticed that that china was not in your house, or at least maybe she had some pieces, so you wouldn't be confused. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1371">A: It's not something we used every day, it was only sort of -- </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1372">Q: I see. </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1373">A: -- for those special couple of big dinners that I remember. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1394">A: It was much longer than I wanted to be walking. </sentence><sentence id="1395">It was dark, it was clearly not any longer twilight, it was really dark, there were st -- there were the lights of the tram that I remember. </sentence><sentence id="1396">I'm thinking to myself how ghostly it was because they were all so empty. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1400">Q: And you were holding onto your mother's hand, and --    </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1450">Q: And this noise that you were hearing, was this only around the Rijksmuseum, or were -- there are a lot of cobblestones in Amsterdam. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1452">A: Ah, you're right. </sentence><sentence id="1453">I think it was only because the cobblestone -- walking in the archway, re- echoed in that enclosed space. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1518">Q: Your sister knew the person [indecipherable] </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1519">A: My sister also knew her, but I don't think she knew of these preparations. </sentence><sentence id="1520">I don't think so. </sentence><sentence id="1521">In any case, we were basically whisked inside and -- a-and shown to -- through the store, into the back of the store, which was sort of -- these people were of very modest means, they were people who were living in back of the store, which was not usually what people did. </sentence><sentence id="1522">They had an apartment someplace else in town, or perhaps upstairs above the store, but they tended not to have as their permanent residence, the little bitty living spaces in the back of the ha -- of the store. </sentence><sentence id="1523">And when we came to the back of the store, and went out of the actual store part, there was a little, small sort of in-between room, and in one end of the wall there was -- it's -- it's often spoken of as a typical Dutch arrangement with the bed inside the wall. </sentence><sentence id="1524">And in that recessed bed was a much elderly man, and much older than the woman, and it was her husband, and he was also ailing in some way, I don't remember exactly what. </sentence><sentence id="1525">And -- and his name was Uncle John, I mean he was referred to as onc -- ome -- ome -- Oome Sjon. </sentence><sentence id="1526">And then w-we were shown another door, and the door led down into the basement. </sentence><sentence id="1527">And we went down the stairs in the basement, </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="1537"> and there was a basement that ran all the way from underneath the storefront, all the way to the backyard. </sentence><sentence id="1538">And in the part underneath the storefront, this is how modestly, if not poor these people were, their only son had a curtained off area that was his room, his place. </sentence><sentence id="1539">And there were very few material things there, or anyplace else in the house. </sentence><sentence id="1540">And then we turned to go towards the part that was closest to the backyard, and to these two sort of recessed, if you will, windows. </sentence><sentence id="1541">I mean, it was sort of like -- I guess it's what you call a bulkhead, out in the yard. </sentence><sentence id="1542">And instead of a door there were these glass windows. </sentence><sentence id="1543">But it meant that there was a sort of sunken well with -- with -- with some iron bars across the top where people stepped i-in the yard. </sentence><sentence id="1544">And -- and the only way to get any light or air would be to open those. </sentence><sentence id="1545">And of course, it rains a lot in Holland as it did then, and these wells would fill up with water, up to the top practically, and we had to -- I remember we took turns trying to siphon that out, by mouth, literally, to get the water out of those things so that we could open them and have some air. </sentence><sentence id="1546">But anyway, when we came into this cellar and went towards the yard part, that's where I saw two beds covered in quilts and blankets, or a quilt and -- and blanket that I remembered from my home. </sentence><sentence id="1547">So that's when it first registered on me, even at that young age, that somehow this was part of what the grown-ups had in mind, something that they'd already planned. </sentence><sentence id="1548">And that first night we just went to bed, that I remember. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1561">Q: Did -- did this woman ex -- do you think your mother called her before you left? </sentence><sentence id="1562">Cause she clearly was not surprised when you came. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1565">A: No -- </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1566">Q: Cause you just -- </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1567">A: -- she wasn't surprised. </sentence><sentence id="1568">I don't know. </sentence><sentence id="1569">I really -- I have no recollection and I have also very little recollection of the use of the telephone the way we have it today. </sentence><sentence id="1570">Well, never mind today, but even some years ago, it just -- y -- </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1575">Q: But you had one? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1577">A: I don't even know that. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1579">Q: Ah. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1581">A: I don't even know that. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1583">Q: And who knows if this person had it, so I don't -- </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1584">A: Likely not. </sentence><sentence id="1585">Likely not. </sentence><sentence id="1586">I don't remember any use of the telephone in either family at any time, so it's very possible there wasn't one. </sentence><sentence id="1587">And -- and I -- I do remember that there was no qu -- I -- I can't say that we were expected, but it was sort of -- y -- she opened the door very quickly, and sort of very quickly saw us inside and closed the door. </sentence><sentence id="1588">And then in the next few days, we were down in the basement and we were -- the store was still operating, so the store was open and there were people coming and going and so on. </sentence><sentence id="1589">And -- and the -- the woman of the house, whose name was Katoos Koolhaas Revers, who we called Tante Toos, or cut -- it's a short form of Katoos, and tante, of course, is aunt. </sentence><sentence id="1590">And she took care of the infirm husband, and the young son, who was a few years older than my sister, so a teenager, and -- and the store, as long as it ran. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="1598">And we were in the basement and then for a fairly short period of time, we were, every few days or so, were allowed to kind of come up in the yard and sit and have a cup of tea or something, for a short while, as if to say to the neighbors who might have been looking in from three sides of this block, if you remember how I spaced this out, who might have been wondering who were these people that were suddenly over there. </sentence><sentence id="1599">So we looked like visitors, or we were trying to act like visitors. </sentence><sentence id="1600">And during this period there were still lots of people on this commercial street. </sentence><sentence id="1601">Every day the stores would open, and of course you had your butcher and baker and gr- greengrocer, and stationary store. </sentence><sentence id="1602">| mean, you didn't go to the market there, th -- you went to the individual stores, and you didn't have supermarkets, certainly, or grocery stores. </sentence><sentence id="1603">And -- well, you, yes you had grocery stores, but they only dealt with, let's say, dry good and so on. </sentence><sentence id="1604">So at first it was decided that -- that it was okay for me to go out and meet -- mix and mingle with the crowd because I -- and this is when I heard it said, that I looked the least Jewish. </sentence><sentence id="1605">Now, what did that mean? </sentence><sentence id="1606">Uh-huh, and my guess is that since my sister is somewhat darker haired than I am, and also older, and might have been less comfortable pretending to be someone she wasn't, they thought it was okay for me to get out there and play and then just pretend that I was visiting an aunt, in case I was stopped. </sentence><sentence id="1607">And this was also when I was supposed to be somebody other than Hedy Cohen, which was, of course, my maiden name, and in -- and I was drilled, actually, before being allowed out, to say that my name was Hedy Vermeulen, and that I lived at, you know, some other place, but that I was visiting my aunt over here. </sentence><sentence id="1608">That stopped fairly soon, that I wasn't allowed to go out any more. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1621">Q: Weeks, months, days? </sentence><sentence id="1622">Do you have any recollection? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1625">A: I think weeks, but I certainly don't think it was months. </sentence><sentence id="1626">In -- </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1627">Q: It was very dangerous for these people to keep you in the house. </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1628">A: Oh, extremely dangerous, and there was a I-lot of -- and I didn't notice at the time, but having talked to my sister about this in the meantime, there apparently was a lot of family dissension about the fact that she had agreed to do this. </sentence><sentence id="1629">And she apparently had a brother who was openly and outspokenly against it, and told her that she should just, you know, turn us in, that she couldn't do this and shouldn't do this and so on. </sentence><sentence id="1630">And somehow she prevailed. </sentence><sentence id="1631">And -- and actually, when you asked before -- or maybe you didn't ask, but I said something about this -- the business of the yards, and people being able to see. </sentence><sentence id="1632">At this time the Nazis were doing something else which is actually pretty well documented in -- in what's his name, Wyman's book. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1638">Q: David Wyman? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1640">A: David Wyman's book where he actually has photographs of these -- these broadsides that would be appearing on corner kiosks and so forth, of which there were many, and it would announce things like rewards for any tips that would lead to the arrest of someone who was either harboring Jews, or who was seen consorting with Jews, or who knew of Jews who were someplace or other. </sentence><sentence id="1641">So the business of being seen, and the business of being in the yard, and the bi -- i-it -- it was a tremendous danger not just for us, but for the family who was sheltering us. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="1642">And so this proved to be an enormous burden for -- for -- not only for the people who were doing the hiding but the people who were being hidden, to the point that there is a lot of evidence of people who apparently couldn't tolerate putting this kind of danger on the people they loved, and they would get themselves arrested. </sentence><sentence id="1643">They would either run out during a search, and run into the street somewhere far away from the house that they had been in. </sentence><sentence id="1644">And they were usually shot, or rounded up, or brought in or whatever. </sentence><sentence id="1645">But that was not an infrequent phenomenon, because it was so terrible to -- everybody knew what was going to happen. </sentence><sentence id="1646">And then the rewards were such that, I mean, when you think of the pettiness of, you know, something the equivalent of a dollar, or five dollars, would be the reward if you could give the Nazis a tip that would lead to some arrests or other. </sentence><sentence id="1647">And people were out doing this. </sentence><sentence id="1648">They were out trying to collect these rewards. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="1649">And you didn't know who would and who wouldn't. </sentence><sentence id="1650">So -- and in some cases I know it happened within families where -- and this might have been the case here, but it wasn't, where the brother was so opposed to having his sister do this. </sentence><sentence id="1651">But, to our knowledge he never -- </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1652">Q: He never did anything. </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1653">A: He never did anything about it. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1655">Q: Once you are not allowed outside, because they were concerned, that meant you were inside for a few years. </sentence><sentence id="1656">Couple years. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1659">A: Right. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1661">Q: Right? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1663">A: Well, was all told about th-three and a half. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1665">Q: Three -- three and a half years. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1667">A: Mm-hm. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1669">Q: Wh-What was Tante Toos like? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1671">A: Well -- </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1672">Q: Can you -- can you distinguish the -- the time when th -- that first year, cause unfortunately your mother dies in 1944. </sentence><sentence id="1673">So you're there for almost two years. </sentence><sentence id="1674">And what is it like in the house with all of you? </sentence><sentence id="1675">The elderly father, Hans, the teenage boy, your sister, who is a teenager, your mother and this other woman. </sentence><sentence id="1676">And the other woman is younger than your mother? </sentence><sentence id="1677">Or about the same? </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1678">A: Yes. </sentence><sentence id="1679">No, she's younger. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1682">Q: She's younger? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1684">A: She's younger. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1686">Q: Okay. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1688">A: Well, some of it actually is to be expected, in the sense that many people have the experience as parents of doing something together with other parents and there is a -- a disagreement about what youngsters can be allowed to do or not to do. </sentence><sentence id="1689">So there was some of this tension between the two mothers. </sentence><sentence id="1690">A-About what, I don't remember, do I have an example, no. </sentence><sentence id="1691">I just knew it was there. </sentence><sentence id="1692">And because there was such a spread in ages, it was also difficult. </sentence><sentence id="1693">There was s -- at least then, before my mother died, there was this. </sentence><sentence id="1694">There was also a kind of o-obvious -- and I -- and I have to confess that this is a thought that came long after and not before. </sentence><sentence id="1695">I knew there was tension between the two parents as mothers, and kids have an intuition about that stuff. </sentence><sentence id="1696">But there was something else and that had to do with the fact that clearly my mother -- my mother's freedom as a mother and a parent, and her freedom as far as objecting to and disagreements, and -- mean to -- to the kinds of disagreements, was severely limited because of the nature of this relationship. </sentence><sentence id="1697">We were totally and completely dependent on this family. </sentence><sentence id="1698">So my mother must have, many, many times, been severely pressed for patience and understanding and compromise and so on. </sentence><sentence id="1699">There was nothing she could do. </sentence><sentence id="1700">I mean, basically her only alternative was to be quiet and acquiesce, or to leave. </sentence><sentence id="1701">And -- and clearly she surely didn't want to do that, because there were the two of us also. </sentence><sentence id="1702">I don't know what she would have done if it was just herself. </sentence><sentence id="1703">So there was probably no real outlet for all that kind of frustration. </sentence><sentence id="1704">Plus the fact that we were getting -- we were getting some letters from my father, and they c -- apparently came from different camps as he was being transported from one to the other, to the other, and then eventually the last I-letters came from Auschwitz. </sentence><sentence id="1705">And the letters were always censored. </sentence><sentence id="1706">They were alway -- they had heavy, heavy black lines drawn through writing, and there was no way -- I remember my mother holding them up to the light and putting them over a bright light and on -- so forth and so on. </sentence><sentence id="1707">They could not see what was -- what was under that. </sentence><sentence id="1708">And they came to us via a very roundabout route, having to do with some of Tante Toos's family. </sentence><sentence id="1709">I don't know if it was brother or brother- in-law, or how we got some of these things, but we did get these letters. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1733">Q: Because your father couldn't have sent them to you directly. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1735">A: Exactly. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1737">Q: Right? </sentence><sentence id="1738">They would have had to have been sent -- so obviously, there are a number of people who know where you are. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1741">A: Yes. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1743">Q: There's -- there's some system going on. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1745">A: Yes. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1747">Q: And your parents must have been in touch not just with this woman, but within a context of a system, no? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1749">A: Within context of the system, I think that my mother or parents were only in touch with Tante Toos. </sentence><sentence id="1750">I think that she then did the -- </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1751">Q: Did the rest, I see. </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1752">A: -- next steps and so on. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1754">Q: I don't know this for positive, but I sort of think so. </sentence><sentence id="1755">I-I -- I know that my sister has mentioned it several times, something of the family dynamic between the brothers and Tante Toos and -- and how often there was friction because of the fact that they were not wanting the sister to do this and so on. </sentence><sentence id="1756">Then there was another dynamic that took place here in this confined quarter. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="1760">First of all there was probably this -- this little kid who was always sort of -- sort of in-between and in the way and what have you. </sentence><sentence id="1761">There was another dynamic going on between my sister and the young boy, after a fairly short time. </sentence><sentence id="1762">And every time I think about this whole experience, and as I then moved on in my life later and worked with young people and studied young people and everything else, I am always caught by the uniqueness of that ad-adolescent era that each of us has, but which in my sister's case was so totally rent asunder, so that just at the point when life opens up for you and you're no longer quite a child and you're now moving into domains of knowledge and you're beginning to have some feeling of what the world's about, and when you start thinking about future and making plans and having relationships, and having groups of friends, and beginning to pull away from your -- your parental u-unit as the kids used to say. </sentence><sentence id="1763">And this must have been so hard for her to have this cut off. </sentence><sentence id="1764">Yes, I was disappointed I couldn't go to school and so on, but the -- to compare that to what must have happened to my sister, it must have been so awful, to have everything just kind of collapsed, to have everything just sort of literally having the rug pulled out from under you and now you are in this sort of prison, sort of confinement, really. </sentence><sentence id="1765">And then the knowledge that our very lives and futures depended on being able to s -- to make the most of what we have here, and to be able to get along, and to be able to make it work. </sentence><sentence id="1766">And -- and some of this has been written quite beautifully by Anne Frank, and -- where she talks about some of these dynamics between the rescuer and the protectors, and the family and the internal stuff. </sentence><sentence id="1767">And yeah, there was a lot of that going on. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1777">Q: So was there a kind of romance between Hans and Betsy, your sister? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1779">A: Yeah, I think so -- </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1780">Q: Or the beginnings of one, yeah. </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1781">A: -- it -- certainly the beginnings of one, and I think certainly by the time the three and a half years ended, there was more of it, and I think then, for that one year that we were still there after the war, I think there was more of it, and then some knowledge of -- of some new people her age that she -- his good friend and so forth. </sentence><sentence id="1782">I th -- I think that this was really tough. </sentence><sentence id="1783">A-And I think there were expectations on her part when we came to America that this might continue and it didn't and she had sort of no place to go with her feelings. </sentence><sentence id="1784">So that -- that was terribly difficult. </sentence><sentence id="1785">Terribly difficult. </sentence><sentence id="1786">And I think that the -- the sense on the part of Tante Toos was very -- I mean, I think she really -- she cared, if not immediately, she certainly came to care for us very deeply. </sentence><sentence id="1787">And -- a-and again, as they say, afterwards, when my mother died, there was a new set of tangents, because she felt, I think in a very real sense, that it was her role as the adult maternal figure, to be the caretaker and caregiver. </sentence><sentence id="1788">I think my sister felt, as the person closest to me, and now the older, responsible adult, that she should be the one to basically kind of take the initiative about what I should do or not do and what things I might be criticized for or not, as the case may be. </sentence><sentence id="1789">So there's the tension between those two. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1800">Q: Between those two. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1802">A: During much of this time when we were in hiding, again my poor sister was put to the task of teaching me, because here I had two weeks of school and no schooling again, so it was her job to teach me basic arithmetic and reading and writing and -- and so forth. </sentence><sentence id="1803">We -- and she did a great job with that, and I'm not sure I could have equaled doing that, cause I must have been a real pain in the neck to -- to -- to deal with. </sentence><sentence id="1804">And there was no television and no VCR and no computer, and no Gameboy and no, you know, record player, n-no radios, we weren't allowed to have radios, al-although we did have a radio, it was not permitted. </sentence><sentence id="1805">Now again, really another example of -- of this madness and planning. </sentence><sentence id="1806">Here you have a -- an occupied population and you cut off all their means of getting news from the outside. </sentence><sentence id="1807">You tell them they have to turn in all the radios. </sentence><sentence id="1808">So this -- this clandestine radio virus was already a first move of rejection of these decrees that our host family was part of, because there was -- no one was allowed radios, not just Jews, no one. </sentence><sentence id="1809">And initially there were -- there were beginning to be food shortages after the beginning of this time when we were -- we -- we literally ducked under -- the Dutch word onderduiken is -- is to duck under, and that's literally what we were doing. </sentence><sentence id="1810">And -- and -- </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1811">Q: What does that mean? </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1812">A: Onderduiken means to duck under. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1890">A: I don't have a -- any recollection that there was a particular time. </sentence><sentence id="1891">I don't even remember what actually transpired in those sessions. </sentence><sentence id="1892">I don't think that they lasted all of the time that we were in hiding, but they lasted long enough to get me to be able to read. </sentence><sentence id="1893">And -- and I'm sure she did some -- s-see again, we ha -- we had nothing, we ha -- we even had no paper. </sentence><sentence id="1894">You couldn't get anything any more. </sentence><sentence id="1895">You couldn't get crayons, you couldn't get colored -- well, we didn't really have crayons like they have Crayolas here. </sentence><sentence id="1896">We had colored pencils and we had a few because when the newspapers were still being published -- which also stopped, but while they were being published we didn't have the comic section like you do here, but we did have one which I recognized later was a political cartoon and -- and it was on the back of the front page of De Telegraaf, which was the sort of -- s-sa -- probably right of center newspaper. </sentence><sentence id="1897">And I would cut out -- after people had gotten through with the paper, I would cut out this little two or three frame thing and -- and color it with a few colored pencils that we had and that's one way I kept busy. </sentence><sentence id="1898">And I loved these characters, I thought they were just so much fun, but again, I was an animal lover. </sentence><sentence id="1899">And this was tom poes, which was tomcat, and Ollie B. Bommel. </sentence><sentence id="1900">And Ollie B. Bommel was a bear, and he was a pretty dumb bear. </sentence><sentence id="1901">And so it was always the smart cat who was rescuing him out of awkward situations or correcting his erroneous thinking. </sentence><sentence id="1902">And so the political stuff kind of came through that. </sentence><sentence id="1903">And this was my p-precious possession from -- from all of those years, and it's one of the few things that I had at the end of the war, cause I collected all these things until they stopped publishing, and I took them with me to America, and I kept them in the attic and so forth and so on, and then at some later date many years later when I met my husband and he came to visit at the house and so forth, and I told him about this. </sentence><sentence id="1904">And he said, "Oh," he said, "do you have those around?" </sentence><sentence id="1905">I said oh yeah, and so I brought them down from the attic, and he opened the box and he grabbed them and the first thing he did was flip them over on the other side, because there were the headlines of what was going on during those early years. </sentence><sentence id="1906">And I haven't tried to piece those headlines together, but I have started to do some research now on -- actually on the original newspapers, to see what was the context within which all of my personal experience was taking place. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="1945"> the severely confined circumstances in which we were, and if you remember, I mentioned the fact that these people were not very well off in this little daytime place for -- for the proprietors of the -- of the shop, th -- but the shop was part of the Chrispijn liquor store chain. </sentence><sentence id="1946">It was a big, well-known company, and -- and Tante Toos was the proprietress of this -- this particular one store. </sentence><sentence id="1947">But part of what -- what was also very difficult is that because it was only meant for daytime habitation, there was only a little half bathroom. </sentence><sentence id="1948">There was only a toilet with a little teeny sink, just enough to wash your hands, as most toilet rooms are in -- in Europe. </sentence><sentence id="1949">An-And there was no shower, and there was no bathtub. </sentence><sentence id="1950">So matters of hygiene had to be taken care of rather differently, in basins and lots of hand washing and so on. </sentence><sentence id="1951">And lots of washing, I mean. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="1952">And also, I think what was -- I mean, this actually took time, I mean you had to carry water in basins and bring it downstairs and so on. </sentence><sentence id="1953">And I remember my mother i-in very short order, decided I had to cut my -- or she was going to cut my long hair, cause I had long pigtails. </sentence><sentence id="1954">And I remember not being very happy about that, but there wasn't any question, it wasn't do we have to, it was just -- it was done. </sentence><sentence id="1955">Because she saw no way to keep washing hair in this difficult, confined situation. </sentence><sentence id="1956">The other thing that happened during this time is when I learned to read, I found that Hans, our gentle, young man in the house, probably the only thing the guy owned was a set of books that was in his part of the cellar, which had been curtained off, and it was on a shelf in his part of the cellar. </sentence><sentence id="1957">It was a series of books about the American Indians, about the Apaches in particular. </sentence><sentence id="1958">And it was a series written by what I understand is an Austrian author, who apparently never set foot in the States, and I understand has done amazingly accurate writings and portraits of what went on among the Apaches. </sentence><sentence id="1959">And I devoured those books, probably -- </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1960">Q: This is Karl May, I think, yes? </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1961">A: Yes -- </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1962">Q: Yeah. </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1963">A: Exactly, Karl May, and -- and the -- the image in my mind was always of this proud, courageous American Indian, of course, the Apache. </sentence><sentence id="1964">And I just read those books over and over and over again. </sentence><sentence id="1965">There wasn't anything else, there was no paper, there were no magazines. </sentence><sentence id="1966">There was not a collection of children's books in the house. </sentence><sentence id="1967">There was not -- there were very few books of any kind around the house. </sentence><sentence id="1968">So this series, this whole series was just, you know, very precious to me, and -- and I spent a lot of time reading that. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="2008"> huddled around this clandestine radio, or a s -- in fact, I seem to remember that we did not eat upstairs, so -- and -- and speaking of the eating as -- I think I was telling you about the potato peel soup. </sentence><sentence id="2009">You know, after that -- after that stopped, there was nothing. </sentence><sentence id="2010">There was absolutely nothing, and everything was shuttered and everything was a ghost town, all the stores were completely shuttered down with wooden protection shutters and so on. </sentence><sentence id="2011">And -- and we heard stories about people doing all kinds of desperate things, you know, hunting down pets that belonged to somebody [indecipherable] or something, in the streets, and -- and going out to the country to try to find rabbits and so on. </sentence><sentence id="2012">And another element of my parent's planning for this possible eventuality came in the sense that aside from the beds that I saw there, and the quilts that I saw there, when I came upstairs one day and saw also this set of dishes that I mentioned before, there were, next to the set of dishes were bags, large bags of staples. </sentence><sentence id="2013">Just the way you find them in a natural food store, they were sacks of raw beans and peas and -- and barley and rice and -- I don't remember specifically which ones, but ther -- there were all these staples, which really saved all of our lives, because I was fr -- I-I was quite stunned, actually, to read in one of the papers I had been looking at, that they figured that some -- something between 1700 and 2500 people died simply of starvation in the city. </sentence><sentence id="2014">And we were just very fortunate to have had this that we could then share with our family. </sentence><sentence id="2015">Which -- which certainly saved us. </sentence><sentence id="2016">But then that ran out, and that was still -- the war was still on. </sentence><sentence id="2017">Also my -- my mother was a bit of a -- probably natural food type vitamin person and she had had -- also saved and put aside vitamins and -- and especially calcium pills, which -- I -- I -- I -- I've had rather troubles with teeth, which are thought to have had some basis in the war deprivation. </sentence><sentence id="2018">But that -- that was part of what was there, and then when that ran out, then also electricity was out, gas was out, so you had nothing to cook on, you had n-no lights. </sentence><sentence id="2019">There was -- for awhile there was wood for the woodstove, the coal stove, i -- of course, coal was long gone -- in the living room, but then Hans would go out to the countryside and -- and dig peat, blocks of peat that he would really, literally drag back to -- u-undercover at night. </sentence><sentence id="2020">And then after that, a-and there was no more food, he went out in the fields and dug up sugar beets and tulip bulbs, which we basically ground into some kind of mush, and tried to cook, as long as we had anything to cook on. </sentence><sentence id="2021">And -- and that's how we survived during -- during this time. </sentence><sentence id="2022">It was horrible stuff, but it was what kept us going. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2055">Q: Mm-hm. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2057">A: And ran in sort of a semi-circle from let's say the length of this room wall, and extended back maybe three feet or so. </sentence><sentence id="2058">And then starting at the height of the display window were mirrors embedded into a wooden screening. </sentence><sentence id="2059">In other words, it was wood to the house side, and it was m- mirror to the street side, so that all these bottles were mirrored in -- and when you walked by you saw this profusion of bottles and so on. </sentence><sentence id="2060">But this wall of mirrors only came up to about five feet, </sentence></p><p><sentence id="2061"> so you could look over it and see people, and see into the living quarters in the back. </sentence><sentence id="2062">So there was never any movement above that height, or in the back of the house during the daytime. </sentence><sentence id="2063">And at night it was only by -- by being lower than those things in the back or having the lights off -- once the lights were off anyway because there was no electricity, it was a little bit easier for us to move around. </sentence><sentence id="2064">But that's also when we were having these terrible street searches and house searches, where these Gestapo would be patrolling and -- at random, or based on some word that they got from somebody, would actually go and do a house search. </sentence><sentence id="2065">You know, tear the place apart, and -- </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2066">Q: Was your house ever searched, the house where you were staying? </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2067">A: Several times, actually, and when the worry about this became so great that we were afraid to be in the cellar -- again, I don't know whose idea it was, I don't know how the grown-ups planned this and talked about it, but it was decided that we should hide under this display window in this three foot wide stretch that was under -- that -- that was, you know, probably three feet off the ground and three feet wide, but maybe 10 or 18 feet long. </sentence><sentence id="2068">I don't know how long, 18 feet maybe. </sentence><sentence id="2069">And there was a little door in the store side to this, and the little door could open up and then they usu -- usually they kept cases of empty bottles there, or beer -- extra beer supplies, or whatever. </sentence><sentence id="2070">So what they did is they took those bottles and crates out of there, we would go in there at night and they would put the empty crates back behind us and then close the door. </sentence><sentence id="2071">So the three of us would be in there, and on the street side it was just a -- you saw brick up until the level of the display window, and there were two little grates where you could get some air in this part, and my recollection was always that we were either hunched over, or somehow in some, you know, very uncomfortable position, cause there were three of us in this tiny space. </sentence><sentence id="2072">And that one of us was always sort of on the alert that no one else would make noise. </sentence><sentence id="2073">I know my    guess is that my mother was always on the alert. </sentence><sentence id="2074">Because the noises, the breathing, the sneezing, what have you, the snoring, could be heard through these vents outside. </sentence><sentence id="2075">And you never knew if somebody was actually patrolling the streets, or was out on the street and being silent because they were waiting to catch you, or waiting to have -- to be able to observe one misstep, based on some, you know, intuition they might have had. </sentence><sentence id="2076">So you never knew whom to trust, you never knew what was going on, you never had -- you always had this sense of watchfulness, of -- and - - and I'm sure that that was part of the anxiety, was probably watchfulness that I was feeling on the part of the adults. </sentence><sentence id="2077">And -- and we spent a lot of time in there, and it was a good thing because some of those searches did, in fact, th -- the soldiers went into the basement. </sentence><sentence id="2078">It was a logical thing, there was a door. </sentence><sentence id="2079">I mean, you know, they would have been stupid not to open that door. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2109">Q: Were you more frightened by having to go into this little crawl space than you were -- I mean, did you become more -- did you become more anxiety prone because of that, or was it all just sort of nerve-wracking in some way? </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2126">A: So I do remember that very distinctly. </sentence><sentence id="2127">And I also remember that -- that several things then happen as the war got worse and worse. </sentence><sentence id="2128">And I remember sitting in the dark and huddled around the -- the radio, and sitting by moonlight, and -- and I remember listening to the BBC, and I remember, you know, occasionally hearing something from the queen, and then hearing something from Churchill. </sentence><sentence id="2129">And I also began to recognize, even as a child, that somehow I made the deduction that if you heard the words Churchill and Montgomery and Eisenhower and Roosevelt that things were going better, and the adults seemed somewhat less anxious. </sentence><sentence id="2130">And if you heard Hitler and Himmler and Goebbels and -- I could always -- I knew that they were going to be tense and upset. </sentence><sentence id="2131">And -- and we did hear, actually, a fair amount of bombing, although Amsterdam was not flattened the way Rotterdam was. </sentence><sentence id="2132">There were certainly constantly air raids and sirens and planes flying overhead and some areas were bombed because the -- I know some part of the hospital was bombed, and I know the hospital had -- and the reason I know that,    because after the war I became very ill, and I had to go to that hospital. </sentence><sentence id="2133">But -- but during this time, there is that well documented difference in the way the allied planes sounded from the way the axis planes sounded, that -- the Nazi planes. </sentence><sentence id="2134">And I remember the first time going to some film that had that in it, that -- that sort of unnerved me because there it was, there were those sounds that I remembered. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2503">Q: Did you ever find the -- where they buried your mother? </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2509">A: There is a real grave. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2511">Q: And she's identified? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2513">A: Yes. </sentence><sentence id="2514">Now, I don't know if my aunt and uncle took care of that part. </sentence><sentence id="2515">I don't know if they had her reburied, I don't know if she was originally buried right there but not marked. </sentence><sentence id="2516">I don't know. </sentence><sentence id="2517">I know that they gave money for her care, for the care of the grave in perpetuity because they did tell me that at some point. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2523">Q: Right. </sentence><sentence id="2524">Di -- this is a question I don't think you can answer, cause I don't even know if there is an answer to the question, but when you're -- when -- do you have any idea when your mother received mail from your father when he was in Auschwitz? </sentence><sentence id="2525">I'm just wondering, and maybe you </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="2529"> can investigate it at some point, is there some connection between getting that letter, and her f -- realizing what Auschwitz was, which you wouldn't have known, but maybe she did. </sentence><sentence id="2530">And -- </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2531">A: I can't believe that she didn't know what Auschwitz -- which -- what Auschwitz meant then. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2533">Q: Right, no, I'm s -- I'm assuming she did. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2535">A: She did, and I think what you're sort of implying is was this finally her real confrontation with the meaning and what this meant for her husband, which is very possible, and -- and -- and then the reason it may be possible is because the -- the -- when she died and -- and the adults, the remaining adults in the family said she died of a broken heart. </sentence><sentence id="2536">Y-You may be onto something, that that's in fact -- did create some kind of emotional stress, physical reaction, I-I don't know. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2539">Q: But you could not, a-as a kid, have detected for a moment. </sentence><sentence id="2540">And it could have been -- </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2541">A: I-I know that she was very, very distressed with the last -- I don't know if it was a letter or letters. </sentence><sentence id="2542">But -- but it was very clear to me that there was a progression of news that got worse each time. </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2543">Q: Uh-huh. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2545">A: And I don't know if it was actually what was in the letter, or whether it was the postmarks on the letter, because I don't think they let anything stay in the letter that was of any use. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2547">Q: Yeah, right. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2549">A: Or -- or any news. </sentence><sentence id="2550">And the other thing that -- I -- I know that even papers, radio, whatever notwithstanding, I know that there was a lot information that we got by word of mouth that was being -- for example the fact that after we went into hiding and the round-ups continued, we -- I know that we got word of the fact that all my father's family was wiped out. </sentence><sentence id="2551">He had five brothers, each of whom had families and children and wives, and we got word of the fact that they had all been deported, and everybody knew -- seemed to know what that meant. </sentence><sentence id="2552">I didn't, but I knew that they knew. </sentence><sentence id="2553">They got word of the fact that my grandmother, her husband had died before we went into hiding, and I remember my grandmother at our house, sitting Shiva in a black -- black dress and -- and on a wooden bench and -- and so forth. </sentence><sentence id="2554">So I knew what that meant long before I knew any connection to Judaism or anything. </sentence><sentence id="2555">But I knew that she was in mourning. </sentence><sentence id="2556">And I spoke a little German for those early years, I must have been three years old at the time. </sentence><sentence id="2557">But then she was in a nursing home when we went into hiding. </sentence><sentence id="2558">And the word came back to us that -- th-that there had been a round-up of that nursing home, that the trucks had just pulled up in front, that they threw people out the doors and out the verandas like so many chickens going to slaughter. </sentence><sentence id="2559">I know we heard that, cause I heard that then. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2572">Q: You heard it then? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2574">A: And so I -- In -- I-I don't think that there was -- that -- that's why it's so hard to listen to people saying that they didn't know what was going on in that time. </sentence><sentence id="2575">I th -- I think you -- you couldn't help but know what was going on. </sentence><sentence id="2576">And -- and some of the p -- some of the writers who have written about these experiences also -- partly you knew what was going on because there was -- there was the knowledge that happened in the east. </sentence><sentence id="2577">You knew about the -- you know, they -- they pr -- they were first perhaps not extermination camps, but you knew that people were put to death. </sentence><sentence id="2578">And th -- and this -- this came up in this film about Dachau for example, what people said, th-the residents said, well this was not -- this was not an extermination camp. </sentence><sentence id="2579">Well the -- some of the first efforts of extermination were done in Dachau. </sentence><sentence id="2580">And I -- I'd -- I know there wasn't television and so forth, but th -- but people knew, people knew. </sentence><sentence id="2581">And -- and America knew. </sentence><sentence id="2582">America knew. </sentence><sentence id="2583">And -- and again, in David Wyman's book, that's all documented line by line, what they knew. </sentence><sentence id="2584">That just wasn't expedient to get involved. </sentence><sentence id="2585">Just wasn't where they wanted to go at that time. </sentence><sentence id="2586">But it's -- it's -- I don't -- I-I -- I don't know -- I don't know what you do about that, you know, I didn't -- I -- I mean here and now -- and this -- when you see these parallels of which is so horrible when you see the European nations apologizing to the Bosnians about the fact that they didn't act when they should have to stop that bloodshed. </sentence><sentence id="2587">W-W-Why don't we do that? </sentence><sentence id="2588">Why do we -- why don't we take action about values that are right and wrong instead of well, you know, you have to play the political game, and I -- I think I used to be a whole lot more optimistic than I am now, but I think when the whole Bosnian crisis broke, I just -- | -- I felt as if the bottom had g-gone out from under my stomach, and I just kind of felt -- w- w-we just aren't going anywhere. </sentence><sentence id="2589">I mean, how these families that could -- that intermarried, these families that were neighbors and friends. </sentence><sentence id="2590">You get the right manipulator out there doing the right PR stuff, and everybody loses everything that they supposedly claim is -- is what they believe. </sentence><sentence id="2591">It's very hard. </sentence><sentence id="2592">It's very hard to accept that. </sentence><sentence id="2593">And -- and I think the -- I think when I first came here, of course, people asked me all kinds of questions. </sentence><sentence id="2594">I was still a little kid when I came, I mean when ha -- when the war ended, of course, there was such a sense of -- a-again, what did I as a child know? </sentence><sentence id="2595">It's very difficult to know. </sentence><sentence id="2596">I knew that we were being liberated. </sentence><sentence id="2597">I knew that freedom was once again back in Holland, and I knew what it meant for me. </sentence><sentence id="2598">I knew that I could run in the street, I knew I could open the door, I knew I could talk in a regular voice. </sentence><sentence id="2599">I knew that I could find friends to play with on the street, and I did. </sentence><sentence id="2600">There was a child across the street who - - whose father was also a baker, but an only child who was a year older than I, and we -- we neither of us knew about each other for -- for nearly three and a half years here. </sentence><sentence id="2601">And -- and I went to school, and she and I walked to school, and I had that life that had been on hold, that I had been waiting for as a small child. </sentence><sentence id="2602">And then about December, I got very sick. </sentence><sentence id="2603">I had bronchitis, I had pneumonia, I had whooping cough. </sentence><sentence id="2604">I had -- I've forgotten, something else. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2637">Q: All together? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2639">A: All together at the same time. </sentence><sentence id="2640">I was really very sick and they finally took me and put me in the hospital. </sentence><sentence id="2641">And I was on a ward, a huge room that was just filled with cribs, mostly infants and toddlers, I was the oldest child by far on that floor, because most kids my age, I guess, wouldn't have gotten whooping cough. </sentence><sentence id="2642">And it's kind of funny because I don't know whether I missed getting vaccinated or whether that's not a hundred percent foolproof. </sentence><sentence id="2643">But I was so sick they weren't sure I was going to make it. </sentence><sentence id="2644">And I certainly wasn't sure I was going to make it, although I don't know what that meant in my child's mind. </sentence><sentence id="2645">But every night there would be children carried -- dead children carried out of these cribs and I would see this around me all day long and all night long. </sentence><sentence id="2646">I mean, that was a huge ward just -- just lined up crib after crib after crib. </sentence><sentence id="2647">And you would hear these babies convulsing and coughing, as I was also. </sentence><sentence id="2648">And then not be able to breathe, and die. </sentence><sentence id="2649">And I was in the hospital about three months, or at least I was sick for a very long time. </sentence><sentence id="2650">And during this time there was some -- some effort made at -- at ca -- well, actually the effort made to contact us ha-happened be -- prior to the time I got sick. </sentence><sentence id="2651">But during -- but backtracking a little bit to the -- to the freedom thing, I remember the feeling of freedom. </sentence><sentence id="2652">I remember being able to throw open the door and running down the street to this street we were trying to find, the Hooftweg, which means basically, the headway. </sentence><sentence id="2653">And running along with every citizen who could walk or crawl, to line those streets to welcome the allied troops. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2669">Q: Mm-hm. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2671">A: And you know, the joy, it -- it's -- on one of the pages of that newspaper e -- edition that I gave you, everybody who was anybody, as I say, who could get there, was there on the street. </sentence><sentence id="2672">And the -- and the soldiers, mostly actually Canadian and British, not too many U.S., threw candy in the crowds and stockings for the girls and the cheering went on and on and on, and I    don't know if I knew what I was doing and exactly what it meant to me at that time, except this incredible sense of freedom, just -- just physically feeling it. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2676">Q: Well sure, because physically, whatever you knew about the politics, or didn't know, was irrelevant in a way, because you were stuck. </sentence><sentence id="2677">And now you weren't stuck any more. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2680">A: True, true, but that I could really feel that and participate in this -- it was incredible. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2682">Q: Mm. </sentence><sentence id="2683">We're going to have to change the tape. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="2686">End of Tape Six    Beginning Tape Seven </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2689">Q: Hedy, when your mother dies, are you and Betsy afraid that Tante Toos will not keep you there, or do you have no fear? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2691">A: I don't remember fear as an emotion at all during this time, other than this constant anxiety kind of thing that something is going to happen and I don't know what that something is, which is why we have to be quiet and so forth, and that's why we can't be seen. </sentence><sentence id="2692">I hadn't -- I don't -- don't think, at least I don't remember, personally thinking about what's going to happen to us now. </sentence><sentence id="2693">I didn't -- I don't know if I was just so young it didn't occur to me that this might be an issue. </sentence><sentence id="2694">Whether my sister thought something else, I don't know. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2699">Q: Right. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2701">A: And there was certainly some change and shift in the dynamic now, because now Tante Toos feels even more responsible for -- for us -- for both of us, and for me in particular, I think, and my sister felt that she needed to rise to the occasion, because she was the -- the -- the next, the closest relative. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2703">Q: Right. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2705">A: And therefore she felt she needed to act in this mature, responsible way and -- and set the limits for me and do all those kinds of things. </sentence><sentence id="2706">And sometimes they clashed, and I was aware of that. </sentence><sentence id="2707">And I think this was very hard for both. </sentence><sentence id="2708">I'm sure it was difficult for this adult who had done all this for us and -- and so on, and -- and then therefore probably had occasional mixed feelings. </sentence><sentence id="2709">And that was very hard for my sister, who must have had to walk a thin line between also being a child, but also being the one that felt dutifully responsible for me, and -- and how to behave in a way that was not ungrateful, and yet try to put her perspective out there. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2715">Q: Right, right. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2717">A: A-And I -- and this must have been extremely difficult. </sentence><sentence id="2718">I-I certainly was aware of it, but I don't remember specifics. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2721">Q: Do you remember any -- anything that would be like a mourning period? </sentence><sentence id="2722">I mean, do you remember your sister being depressed because your mother is gone, or do you remember a change in the -- in the house because this happened? </sentence><sentence id="2723">Or is it all a blur now? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2727">A: Is -- it's pretty much a blur. </sentence><sentence id="2728">I don't remember -- as I say, the -- when you're asking me about memory, I don't remember there being a mourning period. </sentence><sentence id="2729">I don't remember there being a time that was different from another time except my mother wasn't present. </sentence><sentence id="2730">I-I don't remember any markers, or any things that I can hitch any kind of response to. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2735">Q: Right. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2737">A: Just don't know. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2739">Q: Do things get physically -- the winter of 1944 is -- or is it "45 that's particularly bad in Holland, I can't remember now. </sentence><sentence id="2740">Is it -- do things get worse physically for you all? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2743">A: Well, the things get worse in the sense that we now have, as they say, we've gone through all of the food, all of our supplies, there is nothing H-Hans can't really go out in the country any more, because th -- he runs the danger -- </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2744">Q: Right. </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2745">A: -- of getting picked up, so yeah, I think I was a total of -- I've forgotten how many pounds, but I was one very skinny little kid at the end of the war, and I suppose probably when you ask me did the fish hook thing cause an infection, it's probably quite a miracle that it didn't. </sentence><sentence id="2746">But I sort of made up for it by being so very sick at that time. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2749">Q: Yeah. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2751">A: And -- and my sister, who was trying to run around and -- and take care of the bureaucracy stuff while I was in the hospital, and getting passports, and papers signed, and so forth, broke out into the -- first of all, she had terrible, terrible stomach problems right after the war, and I'm sure that they had to do with -- well, I'm not sure, but I think they had to do with all this suppressed anxiety and fear, and trying to walk this delicate line between things. </sentence><sentence id="2752">And she had -- I remember having terrible, she had terrible, terrible cramp attacks, and I remember being dispatched to go down to the Hooftweg, to this [indecipherable] and -- and trying to find the open -- the only one pharmacy that was still open, and get her Valerian, I remember Valerian drops. </sentence><sentence id="2753">Valerian I guess is still occasionally used, but it's some kind of -- it has some sort of sedative reaction on the muscles of the stomach and so on. </sentence><sentence id="2754">And I remember when I got so sick and sh -- and I was in the hospital -- in fact, I had my 10" birthday in the hospital, I remember this. </sentence><sentence id="2755">And I remember this new little friend I had made from across the street, I remember her not being allowed into the ward, and there were some glass doors at one side at sort of roughly the same level where I was, except I was way into the center of the ward. </sentence><sentence id="2756">And she was -- this is February now, she's looking at -- and her face pressed against the door, holding up a sign, happy birthday, and so forth, coming to see me. </sentence><sentence id="2757">But my sister had these terrible, what probably were staph infections, just these running sores and one terrible one on her -- on the top of her foot and she couldn't get a shoe on, and she had to keep going and she had the shoemaker cut out some hunk of the shoe leather for her, so that she could continue to -- to go about her business and so on. </sentence><sentence id="2758">Because by this time in that -- immediately after the war, the first thing that --that we got right after the war, after we had this incredible jubilation on the Hooftweg, was that everybody hauled out their clandestine radios and their record players and their hidden Dutch flags, and the orange streamers for the House of Orange, and 0 -- suddenly this stuff came out of nowhere, and we had three day block parties, essentially, the whole city that I remember, everywhere there were loudspeakers running, music, and there was dancing in the street and there was just unbridled joy. </sentence><sentence id="2759">And the only people who were not unbridled in their joy were those -- especially the woman who were known to have consorted with the Nazi soldiers. </sentence><sentence id="2760">And they were rounded up and shorn in public and ended up having to wear scarves over their heads to hide their shame, and so on. </sentence><sentence id="2761">That was pretty awful. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2774">Q: Did you see that? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2776">A: Yeah, I did see it. </sentence><sentence id="2777">I did see that. </sentence><sentence id="2778">But there was this just -- this incredible, you know, there's -- there's n -- there are no words to describe this sense of freedom and this jubilation that took place during this liberation time. </sentence><sentence id="2779">And of course now we were seeing army uniforms and -- and -- and the allied soldiers who were headquartered wherever they were, and -- and the soldiers were -- were walking the streets and my girlfriend and I had a little tiny pad each, because there was still not stuff in the stores, they were still basically shuttered. </sentence><sentence id="2780">And the two words of English -- actually, I knew three by the time I came to this country, but the first two words I learned were signature please. </sentence><sentence id="2781">And it -- we invented this activity, we would go to a soldier and hand him this pad an-and little stubby pencil and ask for his signature. </sentence><sentence id="2782">And I still have those too, someplace. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2790">Q: You do? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2792">A: Little pad of signatures, even some X's where they didn't -- couldn't obviously write. </sentence><sentence id="2793">And again, mostly British and Canadians. </sentence><sentence id="2794">And I remember that the other one was candy and please. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="2795">So we would give them, we'd ask for their signature and then we would ask for candy, please. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="2796">Because, of course, they had thrown the stuff from the -- </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2797">Q: Right. </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2798">A: -- trucks as they came through, on the tanks and so on. </sentence><sentence id="2799">And -- and there was this great loving, and -- and -- and rejoicing and -- and great love for the Americans and British and everyone. </sentence><sentence id="2800">And then w-we had -- we had these block parties, but we had them -- we -- I seem to remember that we had three big ones in -- in fairly rapid succession, like with -- within two or three weeks there was another one, and then there was another one. </sentence><sentence id="2801">And what I think was happening is that th -- that they were celebrating different things happening as the war was really, completely ending. </sentence><sentence id="2802">And -- and then I -- I started school, there was a -- a neighborhood school, and I went -- walked with my girlfriend and she and I became great buddies and spent lots of time together. </sentence><sentence id="2803">And after the war she asked if I might -- would like to come on vacation with her and her parents, they were going to a farm. </sentence><sentence id="2804">And I was so excited, and I just loved going, and I was allowed to go, and it was a week. </sentence><sentence id="2805">And I fell in love with the rooster's feathers, those sort of blue green feathers. </sentence><sentence id="2806">And the whole chicken yard was covered with these feathers, and I collected them. </sentence><sentence id="2807">And I came back - - this was my great, you know, souvenir from this trip, which I just adored. </sentence><sentence id="2808">I loved being on the farm with the animals and everything, and I had this great bag of feathers which I took with me, which I also brought to America, which then got eaten by the moths somewheres along the way and had to get tossed. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2820">Q: They allowed you to bring these in? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2822">A: Yes, yes. </sentence><sentence id="2823">How, I don't know, but they did. </sentence><sentence id="2824">Well, I'll tell you how in a -- in -- in a minute, but the -- that -- the happy days of this thing were then also made happier by the fact that we got air lifts from the Swedish Red Cross, we got air lifts of bread, and -- primarily bread, and then powdered milk were among the first things that came. </sentence><sentence id="2825">And that was the first time that I tasted this sort of soft, whitish bread. </sentence><sentence id="2826">I don't know why they -- maybe it was because it kept well, so that that's why they -- cause it really wasn't bread I was familiar with. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2832">Q: Right. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2834">A: And then we'd began receiving parcels from both an -- my aunt, the other aunt, who was -- had meanwhile come to America, and my uncle and aunt. </sentence><sentence id="2835">And they sent packages with clothing and food and peanut butter. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2838">Q: How did they know where you were? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2840">A: That I'm not sure of, but I know that they contacted -- initially they contacted the American, what's now I guess called the American Jewish Joint Distribution Committee. </sentence><sentence id="2841">I think then it was called the American Joint Distribution Committee. </sentence><sentence id="2842">And they conti -- tacted them because that organization was in -- was somehow infiltrated with the troops, in fact they traveled -- their workers traveled in American uniforms. </sentence><sentence id="2843">And they apparently did a lot of -- of rounding up of refugees in all the countries, and were the -- the -- the agency that you got in touch with if you wanted to know if your relatives were still alive, and they -- they located us, and found us, and gave -- and to serve as the intermediary and so forth. </sentence><sentence id="2844">And then they helped to arrange for us to go to America. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2850">Q: Did you want to go? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2852">A: No, no, I didn't want to go. </sentence><sentence id="2853">I mean, if you can imagine how eager I had been before the war started, to go to school, to have a life and so forth and so on, and now I come through this period of intense confinement and containment and -- and life picks up again, and I can wave the flag and I can put the picture of Queen Wilhemina over my bed -- which I also brought to America and also had over my bed in Rochester, New York. </sentence><sentence id="2854">And I could do the things that I had looked forward to doing, you know, and I loved school, and I did very we -- I did very well in everything in school except handwerken. </sentence><sentence id="2855">And handwerken is embroidery and knitting and that kind of stuff, and I always either flunked it or was borderline. </sentence><sentence id="2856">I could somehow never get my hands to do what they were supposed to do. </sentence><sentence id="2857">And I remember -- I remember my teacher, [indecipherable] and I remember having school trips to the Rembrandt house and to the museum and seeing the night watch for the first time, and all these things were very exciting to me. </sentence><sentence id="2858">And now, all of a sudden we should stop again, and -- and go somewhere where -- all I knew about were the Apaches, and that was sort of a saving grace, but I didn't -- I-I didn't know this aunt and uncle or if -- if they had seen me as a baby, I didn't remember them. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2892">A: It was terrible, and I was aware that it was terrible. </sentence><sentence id="2893">And she was very unhappy. </sentence><sentence id="2894">I don't think sh -- to my knowledge, she didn't try to stop this, but I am pretty sure that she offered to foster us. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2927">A: I don't know, partly because for him also, liberation meant liberation, and he later on became a photojournalist. </sentence><sentence id="2928">I don't know exactly what were the goings on between him and my sister. </sentence><sentence id="2929">I know they were very close, and then there was a very close friend of his with whom the two of them were very close, so it was kind of a tre -- a threesome. </sentence><sentence id="2930">I -- I -- I think it was very hard on my sister for a variety of reasons, not the least of which was leaving what now had become her -- her -- maybe more than just a very close relationship. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2935">Q: Right, right. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2937">A: And -- and that was very hard, and -- and then the -- the JDC, the Joint Distribution Committee also funneled food and clothing and so forth. </sentence><sentence id="2938">And then they sent a representative in uniform whose name was Mrs. Roosevelt, if you can believe it. </sentence><sentence id="2939">And I f-fell in love with her, I thought she was just a lovely, lovely person, you know. </sentence><sentence id="2940">Rich, dark hair and -- and this wonderful American uniform. </sentence><sentence id="2941">I mean, this American uniform was -- I-I -- I don't know how to say how hard it was for me during the anti- Vietnam times, when I took a strong anti- Vietnam stand. </sentence><sentence id="2942">And I was a girl scout leader at the time, and we were invited to march in the Memorial Day parade, and I had such a difficult time. </sentence><sentence id="2943">And I actually sat the -- the kids down and explained to them that they had been invited, and this is what Memorial Day was all about, and so forth and so on, and that I myself owed something to the American soldiers, but at -- at this particular time, this also meant something that I did not want to share, that I didn't believe in, and that I felt was wrong. </sentence><sentence id="2944">And I wanted them to have two things out of that. </sentence><sentence id="2945">One was, not a disrespect for Memorial Day, in fact, understanding that I owed my life to these men, and that I recognized that, and that I was very torn up about this dilemma. </sentence><sentence id="2946">And I also wanted them to understand that if you believe that these values are important, then you have to do what this means for you, but you don't impose it on someone else. </sentence><sentence id="2947">So I made it clear to the 10 to 13 year old kids there that if it was important to show your respect, and you did not have a reason not to do that, that they should go ahead and do that. </sentence><sentence id="2948">That just because I wasn't marching, I wasn't telling them that they shouldn't. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2962">Q: Mm-hm. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2964">A: And I think it was a lesson that went home to a number of them. </sentence><sentence id="2965">But it was very upsetting to me. </sentence><sentence id="2966">It was very upsetting to me, and I've often thought of Memorial Day times during these difficult times, and now here we are back again in a situation that is just so horrible to me, so horrible to me, and I don't know what to say because every day you see not only all these Americans -- all these young Americans and old Americans being killed, and thousands of Iraqis being killed, and each of these, like me, has a family, has a mother, a father, has children, some of them, brothers and sisters, and we just wipe them out, like so many ants, you know? </sentence><sentence id="2967">And the farther away we can do our destruction, it seems, the easier it is. </sentence><sentence id="2968">We don't have to look these people in the eye, we can just drop a bomb. </sentence><sentence id="2969">And -- and I just can't over that. </sentence><sentence id="2970">I just cannot get over that. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2983">A: And the uniform mattered. </sentence><sentence id="2984">And apparently this is -- this uniform travel for these refugee workers was done on purpose so that they would have more freedom of movement and so on. </sentence><sentence id="2985">So she gathered us up and made arrangements for us to go by train to Paris, and -- </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2986">Q: Do you remember leaving Tante Toos? </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2987">A: Yes. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2995">Q: There was crying, yes. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2997">A: And then I remember us going to Paris on the train, and I was very excited to be on a train, and -- and she -- ar -- I don't know where this all came from, and how wonderful it was that it happened, but we were in Paris for a few days and she took us around Paris -- </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2998">Q: Really? </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2999">A: And she took us to the amusement park outside of Paris, or wherever it was, and -- and it was wonderful. </sentence><sentence id="3000">And I'm sure especially wonderful to my sister, who had studied French and studied about France and on -- so forth. </sentence><sentence id="3001">And then she took us on the train from Paris to Marseille, and in Marseille we were put under the aegis of a French orphan group, whose name | can't quite remember, but was initials, OCS or something like that, I don't remember what it was. </sentence><sentence id="3002">And they put all the children -- I mean, we were the only two, as far as I know, who didn't belong to that French group, but there were hundreds of -- hundreds of children of all ages, and they put them all in the hold of this ship on these layers of canvas and gave every child a dirty blanket and said that you're a number so and so on the thing. </sentence><sentence id="3003">And I didn't speak French, but every other child did, and my sister did and so on. </sentence><sentence id="3004">And all I remember is seeing this big opening on -- big s -- huge square opening and seeing the sky from the hold of this ship, which had been originally a Greek troop sh -- a Greek freighter, which had been ta -- taken over and converted into a troop ship, and was now converted into a passenger liner. </sentence><sentence id="3005">So the passengers, the other passengers were really all adults, and the kids were all in the hold. </sentence><sentence id="3006">A-And I don't know if there was any other cargo. </sentence><sentence id="3007">And we go across the waters of the Atlantic and sail, and the -- part -- partway into this trip I get sick again, and I get this pneumonia and the bronchitis and the stuff all over again. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3018">Q: So it comes back? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3020">A: Some sort of resmi -- respiratory stuff comes back, bronchitis, which I had fairly often after that. </sentence><sentence id="3021">And my sister, in the best of efforts, took me to the ship's dispensary, which had a Greek doctor, who was kind of -- I -- I don't know where his training was from, but what they did to me there was cupping. </sentence><sentence id="3022">And I don't know if you've ever heard of or read about cupping, but cupping is taking something the equivalent of maybe a shot glass -- no, a little bigger, whatever, cocktail glass or something, and you create a vacuum in the glass by lighting a match into it, and you use up the air and the oxygen, and before you have a chance to fill that back in again, you press it down on the back. </sentence><sentence id="3023">And they put rows and rows of these glasses on my back. </sentence><sentence id="3024">And then, of course, because there's a -- a vacuum in the glass, the glass pulls the skin and everything with the skin into the glass. </sentence><sentence id="3025">And then you yank these glasses off. </sentence><sentence id="3026">So this provides -- what I decided the -- the reason for this was, to make you focus on some other pain, of such intensity that you forgot about what you really came for. </sentence><sentence id="3027">But it probably came from the medieval notion that if you get the blood moving, that you could get the ill humors out, or something. </sentence><sentence id="3028">And I was in huge pain, terrible pain, and I sat on a -- some -- some chair or other, some corner of the deck, swathed in blankets and the tears streaming down my face, for days. </sentence><sentence id="3029">And the sa -- the -- the sailors kind of took pity on me, and they would bring me an occasional piece of fruit or so -- the food on this boat was all spoiled. </sentence><sentence id="3030">The only thing that was edible was some of the fruit. </sentence><sentence id="3031">I -- I didn't eat anything except the fruit that they brought. </sentence><sentence id="3032">And meanwhile I wasn't getting any better, so I had to report back to the dispensary and they would do it again and again. </sentence><sentence id="3033">And I cried so bitterly and pleaded with them to stop doing it, that they finally stopped doing it, but then they did something </sentence></p><p><sentence id="3034"> somewhat similar which is -- which is, if you can imagine plaster that is like an emery board on the other side, is like sandpaper. </sentence><sentence id="3035">And they put this plaster on you with the sandpaper side towards the skin, and then they rip it off in rapid succession. </sentence><sentence id="3036">So you have again, a similar thing going on, but it's just horrendously painful. </sentence><sentence id="3037">At least it wasn't as bad as the cupping. </sentence><sentence id="3038">So partway across the ocean, one of the engines dies, and then I became sort of aware of the fact there were all these adults on the boat, because then there was a lot of chaos, and a lot of crying, and a lot of people who were certain we were never going to make it, and I saw how upset these people were. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="3039">And I don't think it registered on me what it meant that one of the motors died and you couldn't do anything. </sentence><sentence id="3040">Well, we did make it over that ocean and we did get to New York, and when we arrived in New York there was a dock strike. </sentence><sentence id="3041">So now we're on this boat, twirling around in the harbor day after day after day with this dock strike going on, and -- </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3042">Q: Are you any better? </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3043">A: N -- I must have been because I didn't -- don't remember any more of these treatments, and I remember coming into the harbor and I remember seeing the -- that big neon sign, that horse with -- the winged red horse, I don't know if it was Texaco or Mobil or s -- </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3044">Q: Texaco, I think. </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3045">A: Texaco? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3047">Q: Yeah. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3049">A: And I remember a huge, lit-up sign for Lorna Doone cookies, and all the city all lit up and these skyscrapers looming up the air and so on. </sentence><sentence id="3050">Anyway, finally, apparently the health department stepped in and decided that this was a very bad situation, have all these children in the hold of the ship. </sentence><sentence id="3051">So they took just the children off on -- on one of these sightseeing water boats, or several decker boat things. </sentence><sentence id="3052">And ki -- when we came into Ellis Island and unloaded, and my aunt and uncle had both come to New York, but my uncle had had to go back, because of the dock strike, he couldn't take off from work so long. </sentence><sentence id="3053">So we came into this enormous processing hall of some sort or other, and walked in there, and I remember my sister had her arm around me, and she was carrying whatever little baggage we had. </sentence><sentence id="3054">And as we came in at either side of the -- this enormous doorway, were women standing with a stack of presents, and each child was given this beautifully wrapped box. </sentence><sentence id="3055">Now, what's in this box? </sentence><sentence id="3056">A set of three handkerchiefs, and some white handkerchiefs for the -- for the boys. </sentence><sentence id="3057">Well, not everybody -- ther--there wasn't the sort of universal prevalence of Kleenex, I mean yes they were on the market, but not the way they are now, and women -- proper women carried handkerchiefs. </sentence><sentence id="3058">And although these were not elegantly embroidered, they were -- they were beautifully stamped with pretty flowers and so forth and so on. </sentence><sentence id="3059">And I thought how wonderful that I'm coming to this new country, and they don't even know me, and they're here to say welcome with a gift? </sentence><sentence id="3060">This made an indelible impression on me, that they would think enough to -- to -- to welcome me to the country. </sentence><sentence id="3061">I don't know who the agency was, I don't know who inspired that idea because it was both useful as well as a kind of a luxury. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3076">Q: Right. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3101">A: I-I certainly didn't have anything to do in the discussion that I remember. </sentence><sentence id="3102">And I'm sure that it was -- | -- | -- I'm not sure how much my sister cared about the china, but I -- I think it was mi -- y-you know, it would have been improper somehow, to take something like that, which clearly would have been a lovely thing for Tante Toos, who couldn't have afforded to have had it -- to go out and buy it or whatever. </sentence><sentence id="3103">And I -- and how do you ever thank someone for having done what she did? </sentence><sentence id="3104">I-I -- I know my sister has entered her papers and story and background and everything in the Yad Vashem Righteous Gentile history and archives and so on. </sentence><sentence id="3105">But you know, first of all, this is coming along after the fact, and -- and sh-she is now gone, although I was able to go back to Holland and meet with her and introduce her to my husband and -- </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3106">Q: [indecipherable] </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3107">A: -- two small children. </sentence><sentence id="3108">And I -- I -- oh, I had such trepidations about this meeting, but it went just flawlessly, even though she doesn't speak a -- didn't speak a word of English. </sentence><sentence id="3109">But she's now gone also, and whatever honors and so forth, and so on -- which is not what she did this for in the first place, but -- but how do you rev -- repay someone for that kind of gift, for that kind of sacrifice? </sentence><sentence id="3110">It's impossible. </sentence><sentence id="3111">I c -- I couldn't even begin to brainstorm ideas about anything. </sentence><sentence id="3112">And the older I get, the more I understand it, and the more I admire here. </sentence><sentence id="3113">She was not a complicated woman, she was not well educated. </sentence><sentence id="3114">She, as I say, worked for my father in the bakery as a salesgirl, and they must have somehow kept in touch because even when she was -- m-my sister did indicate that there was -- that they had kept in touch and so forth. </sentence><sentence id="3115">I don't know if there was any socializing back and forth. </sentence><sentence id="3116">But that's -- y-you know, I -- I -- why did she do this, did she do it because there was money to be had? </sentence><sentence id="3117">I'm sure that wasn't an issue. </sentence><sentence id="3118">Did she do it -- there may have well passed money, but I'm sure this was not the reason. </sentence><sentence id="3119">Did she do it for religious reasons?I don't think so. </sentence><sentence id="3120">I don't remember them being very religious -- I mean, I remember -- I remember the neighbors after the war, I remember that the neighbors who ran the embroidery store next door were two -- two ladies who seemed -- who then seemed elderly to me, they probably weren't, and -- and they were very religious, and they asked if I would like to go to Catholic mass with them the following whatever, whatever, and -- and I was a child who really kept away from religion. </sentence><sentence id="3121">Now why? </sentence><sentence id="3122">It's not so easy to say. </sentence><sentence id="3123">People make an easy assumption that it's because of my -- my experiences. </sentence><sentence id="3124">I'm not sure. </sentence><sentence id="3125">Somehow these experiences are in a separate category. </sentence><sentence id="3126">Whereas I was never a child who had great notions of -- of God and -- and so forth, I had -- religion made me uncomfortable, and I just wasn't very keen on it. </sentence><sentence id="3127">But -- but I don't think that that was the motivating factor w-w-wh-why would she respond so differently than the other siblings with whom she was raised? </sentence><sentence id="3128">So I think some of that had to do, perhaps, with the personal relationship that she had with my father. </sentence><sentence id="3129">He had been very good to her, I understand, and maybe -- m-maybe that's sort of what I always preach about, which is that when -- when people get to know each other, when people rub elbows together, when you see that -- that, you know, this person is not some stereotypic, stigmatized non -- untouchable kind of person -- I-I don't know, m-maybe she had a crush on my father when she was young. </sentence><sentence id="3130">I -- I -- I have no idea why she did it. </sentence><sentence id="3131">Did she do it as wi -- what you said earlier, that she perhaps wasn't wild about Jews, but this is a Jew she knew personally and she felt that she -- that he didn't deserve, and his family didn't deserve this. </sentence><sentence id="3132">I -- I don't know, and I'll never know. </sentence><sentence id="3133">She never, to my knowledge, talked about, either then or later. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3168">A: That wa -- might well be the case. </sentence><sentence id="3169">And I -- I -- whether it was a spontaneous action on her part, I think it might well have been, but she stayed with it, and she, you know, could easily have sort of changed her mind along the way, anywhere along the way, and -- and didn't. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3549">A: I mean, in spite of the fact that I didn't speak a word of English, and she did, because she had studied it. </sentence><sentence id="3550">But it was heavily accented, and she was clearly older and more mature, and clearly a very good student, which doesn't always endear you to other high school peers. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3598">A: But I -- I think that this may have been out of a certain respect of understanding that we needed to kind of grow and develop our relationship and -- and so forth, that I-I -- maybe they felt this was not a -- a good thing emotionally to do. </sentence><sentence id="3599">I-I don't know exactly why. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3602">Q: But they seem like very sensitive people. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3604">A: Mm-hm, mm-hm. </sentence><sentence id="3605">They were, and -- and they also were very old world people in the sense that they had trouble sort of understanding high school life as it existed here. </sentence><sentence id="3606">And so I think that created a lot of problems for my sister. </sentence><sentence id="3607">And also what I pointed out earlier is that she was so much older, and had had so much freedoms, and now suddenly -- </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3608">Q: Right. </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3609">A: -- you know, you have to be in by x hour and -- and whatever. </sentence><sentence id="3610">And -- and there was some tension even later when she went through college at the University of Rochester and she would bring home, or some boy would come calling for her, and he happened to be German. </sentence><sentence id="3611">And they apparently gave her the business about that. </sentence><sentence id="3612">I don't re-remember too much about it except she was pretty unhappy about it. </sentence><sentence id="3613">They basically sort of said to her, how can you -- how can you    consider going with this boy when, you know, you've lost your entire family. </sentence><sentence id="3614">And -- I mean that -- that whole issue is a very tough one anyway. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3622">Q: Right, right. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3624">A: But I think at that time, it just was -- it -- I think it was extremely difficult -- it was extremely difficult for her. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3626">Q: And less so for you. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3628">A: And less so for me. </sentence><sentence id="3629">And again, par-partly the age, and partly the type of person. </sentence><sentence id="3630">I mean, if they were critical of her, and my -- my uncle was -- tended to be super-critical, he was a very demanding father figure, a -- he was very bright, he couldn't understand why you didn't understand your math. </sentence><sentence id="3631">And when I would bring a report card home and it would have all excellents and one satisfactory, he would say, what happened here? </sentence><sentence id="3632">Why didn't you get -- you know, it wa-was never isn't this a wonderful report card, but rather -- </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3633">Q: What's wrong. </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3634">A: What's the pe -- he would always see the piece that was lacking. </sentence><sentence id="3635">By the same token they both were very strongly committed to the importance of education, and that was not something you took lightly. </sentence><sentence id="3636">And long decades afterwards, I understood from the story that he lived, that they lived, how important that was. </sentence><sentence id="3637">They would have been in the poorhouse otherwise, if he hadn't been able to -- </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3638">Q: Right, right. </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3639">A: An-And they always impressed on us the importance of education is something -- part of it is the fact that it's not something anyone can take away from you. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3641">Q: Uh-huh. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3643">A: And I -- it was long after, when I was doing my doctoral dissertation and I finally got to the point where I was writing the -- the dedication, that I acknowledged that early teaching, because it hadn't actually registered on me, but I realized I had sort of come slowly to a point where I understood that they were in part responsible for my continuing to -- to go there, go that route. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3645">Q: Were they religious? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3647">A: N -- Lwouldn't say they were -- I think my aunt was less religious than my uncle. </sentence><sentence id="3648">I think that they believed in the importance of maintaining certain traditions. </sentence><sentence id="3649">They believed in the importance of supporting the Jewish people as a people. </sentence><sentence id="3650">They became founding members of the synagogue in Westport, actually, and helped to -- to -- to set that up. </sentence><sentence id="3651">They insisted that I go to Sunday school, and I guess when I was an absolute, miserable person -- child, when I was little, and -- and given to tantrums, I guess that's the biggest one I ever threw, was when they said I had to go to Sunday school. </sentence><sentence id="3652">I instinctively didn't want Sunday school, I instinctively didn't want part of that, I instinctively rejected any notion of religiosity and religious stuff and all the rest of it, and I probably also rejected any other entrapment for being different again. </sentence><sentence id="3653">I don't know how cognizant I was of that, but I think intuitively I was. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3661">Q: So you're not a religious person at all, do you think? </sentence><sentence id="3662">I -- I don't mean in a traditional way, even in some metaphysical way, believing that there is a higher power of some kind. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3665">A: I'm not an agnostic -- I mean, I'm not an atheist, but I'm probably an agnostic, if -- if you have to pigeonhole me at all. </sentence><sentence id="3666">But I -- </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3667">Q: I don't want to if I don't have to. </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3668">A: I mean in -- in one sense, I have felt that the things that have been done in the name of religion are so reprehensible throughout history, with no religion left outside of that blanket indictment, that I think it has not done good, it has done bad. </sentence><sentence id="3669">And I -- it's only continuing that way. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3673">Q: And when you went to Sunday school, was it terrible for you? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3675">A: Well, it wasn't terrible, it was sort of ineffectual as far as I was concerned, it was, you know, I couldn't sleep late on Sunday and I had to go there, and blah, blah, blah, and I hated it, and I went. </sentence><sentence id="3676">And I got -- I made some friends, and most of the Jewish kids didn't live in our neighborhood, so any friendships I made were difficult to follow up on because they were in other parts of Rochester. </sentence><sentence id="3677">And they themselves were members of the Conservative Temple in -- in Rochester, but they felt okay with me going to the Reformed synagogue, which was interesting. </sentence><sentence id="3678">But when it came to the high holidays, they walked, and they celebrated them, and they wanted me to do likewise, and I was supposed to go to services with them, and walk to Temple, and not being a great lover of walking from the days I went through the alley at the -- at the wax museum, I always sort of resented that, and I thought that the whole idea was crazy and foolish and you know, it just seemed to me sort of -- and then of course I was out of school on those days, and I didn't like that, and I had to go back and explain why wasn't I in school. </sentence><sentence id="3679">And those were not the days when you were given to be excused because it was religious absence and stuff, so that was always a pain. </sentence><sentence id="3680">On the other hand, by the time I got to about the eighth grade, I had a very good teacher, and we had some real history, and the history of the Jewish people. </sentence><sentence id="3681">And I ended up actually valuing that because I did learn something here, and because I always found myself in the position of being the only Jewish kid in a large gathering of non-Jews. </sentence><sentence id="3682">And so I was always the spokesperson, a not particularly willing] -- willingly, but people put me there. </sentence><sentence id="3683">So I would have to answer questions about what do Jews believe and -- and why did they kill Christ, and all these kinds of things. </sentence><sentence id="3684">And it made me rather unhappy, but I felt better having had the class, so that I could in fact answer some questions. </sentence><sentence id="3685">And so actually I stayed on, and stayed in the Confirmation year, which was yet another year, and then I learn even more about what Jews believe and why they do what they do. </sentence><sentence id="3686">And then I was Confirmed and I went on and stayed in -- I-I was -- I sang in the choir in the synagogue and then I stayed on and did two more years of what was called post-Confirmation class. </sentence><sentence id="3687">And we did comparative religion, and we did study of the Torah and so forth, wi-with Rabbi Philip Bernstein who'd been a -- a chapel -- chaplain at -- during the second war. </sentence><sentence id="3688">And I think that there was a lot that I began to appreciate about what then became something more meaningful. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3704">Q: Mm-hm. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3706">A: And as my life continued, it was always in this vein of being, for example, out of 1800 in the high school, there were probably 10 or fewer Jewish kids at that particular high school. </sentence><sentence id="3707">S -- and then I was -- I was very active in the girl scouts, and I was selected to represent New York state at a national encampment, and I was back in the same pool of, you know, well tell us about Jews. </sentence><sentence id="3708">Now they didn't ask me stuff about the war yet, and -- and -- or -- well, some people did, but I sort of kept that still pretty much closed. </sentence><sentence id="3709">But I did appreciate that, and I -- but I had such a commitment to trying to improve the whole Sunday school experience for children that I volunteered to teach Sunday school. </sentence><sentence id="3710">I -- I had this presumptuous sense that I could do it better than these other people. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3716">Q: Were you right? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3718">A: And I think I did. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3720">Q: Yes. </sentence><sentence id="3721">You did? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3724">A: Yeah, well was a little bit -- little bit difficult. </sentence><sentence id="3725">I mean, on the first year I was teaching, a -- one of the little kids of -- first or -- kindergarten, first grade or something, came up to me and said, "You know, Mrs. Cohen, I saw God on television last night." </sentence><sentence id="3726">And the -- things like that were a little difficult to cope with, but there was definitely a sense on my part that I felt a -- a -- a-- a reason to be a teacher, to -- to teach kids something, and to not disperse or dispel any notions of God, or the existence of God, which I would never do, but to bring in what is important about religions, and beliefs and values. </sentence><sentence id="3727">Wh- What -- what is there that's really worth fighting for here?And I think that that really was the sort of connecting thread to most of what I did all my life. </sentence><sentence id="3728">Going into education with a strong belief in -- in the value of education for teaching, and for opening up horizons and for having people learn to live with each other and so forth. </sentence><sentence id="3729">I was a -- a one world candidate, and in high school I was, you know, preaching -- or not preaching, but I was s-supporting those kinds of organizations. </sentence><sentence id="3730">I remember some very narrow-minded high school teachers with whom I challenged their viewpoints and so forth. </sentence><sentence id="3731">I was never afraid to stand up or to speak out, and as turns out, neither are my kids. </sentence><sentence id="3732">But I didn't need to be pigeonholed, and I didn't want to be pigeonholed, and -- a-and it was -- it was -- it was a very much longer time before I began talking about the war, and as I said earlier, I -- I never thought of myself as a survivor. </sentence><sentence id="3733">I thought only those people who had survived the camps, the people -- th-th-the -- the displaced persons, the people who had the numbers carved on their arms. </sentence><sentence id="3734">I didn't have that, and I was alive, and I was -- I was with a family, and I guess I was hidden, but -- so -- and -- and I remember the first time, the very first time that I saw any movie that related to anything having to do with the war. </sentence><sentence id="3735">I-It was -- it -- it packed an enormous emotional wallop, and it was, "The Pawnbroker." </sentence><sentence id="3736">And I don't know if you remember the film. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3752">Q: I do, yeah. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3754">A: But this -- and this whole struggle of this poor man, who himself had been a displaced person, and you get that message as you see his arm and so forth. </sentence><sentence id="3755">And he suspects this young, black guy of stealing from him. </sentence><sentence id="3756">And then the struggle within himself about not wanting to stereotype and not wanting to make assumptions because this kid's black. </sentence><sentence id="3757">And then his head running over with the re -- memories of the camps, and -- and then having this interspersed with the actual newsreels of that period of the -- of the camps. </sentence><sentence id="3758">I went home, I was wiped out. </sentence><sentence id="3759">I had se -- Peter had told me some months before, I don't think you want to see that, but I went to see it anyway. </sentence><sentence id="3760">And by then I had one or two kids and we were at Smith, and I had a babysitter and wanted to go to the movies on the campus. </sentence><sentence id="3761">And I came back and this babysitter opened the door, and she didn't see the fact that I was really still speechless. </sentence><sentence id="3762">And she sort of bubbled over and said, "Oh hi, Mrs. Rose, how'd you enjoy the movie?" </sentence><sentence id="3763">And I was just stunned by her use of the word enjoy, and I -- she didn't see my face, didn't notice anything, and I said, "Well, I don't think enjoy is the word you want to use with that film." </sentence><sentence id="3764">And she said, "Well, y-you know, my roommate and I kind of th-thought about going to see it, but then we figured it was so much Hollywood make-believe." </sentence><sentence id="3765">And this is in the early 60's and that's when I had one my early, sort of comeuppances about the fact that I have to speak, I can't remain silent if people are thinking that. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3779">Q: Mm-hm. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3781">A: And another time the same thing happened with when I was driving between Syracuse and Rochester, or wherever, or Ithaca, and I was listening to a -- it mus -- must have been around Passover time, and I was looking for some station on the dial and twisting the dial and I heard this rabbi speaking, and I -- something either made me stop -- maybe I put my hand on the wheel, and the rabbi said something like, someday we're going to have the story of the Holocaust between the covers of a little book, and we will have a holiday to commemorate that it happened, and everyone re -- will read what it says in the book and they" II say, this couldn't possibly have </sentence></p><p><sentence id="3782"> happened. </sentence><sentence id="3783">And all of a sudden I made the connection between the Hagadah and the story of the plagues and the exodus of -- from Egypt, and my own reaction at the table at home where I thought, oh this could never have happened. </sentence><sentence id="3784">I'm thinking, oh my God. </sentence><sentence id="3785">Y-You know, he's absolutely right. </sentence><sentence id="3786">And this was long before we had the holiday and long before we set aside this time, and -- and so forth, and I thought -- and that -- these two incidents, I think, sort of propelled me to get over my reluctance to speak, and when this girl -- this babysitter said to me -- she's finally re-registered something of my face -- </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3787">Q: Right. </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3788">A: -- and she said, would I be willing to come and speak to them in the dorm? </sentence><sentence id="3789">And I said of course, and that was sort of the beginning of it. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3792">Q: Uh-huh. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3794">A: And then I was asked in classes and assemblies and so on. </sentence><sentence id="3795">So then many years followed of that. </sentence><sentence id="3796">But -- </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3797">Q: And was this before you got your degree? </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3798">A: Before I got my doctorate, yes -- </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3799">Q: Yes. </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3800">A: Yes. </sentence><sentence id="3801">It started before then. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3829">Q: Did he find out very quickly about your war years, or did it take you a few years to be able to tell him as well? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3831">A: I think it was more gradual with him. </sentence><sentence id="3832">I think things came out piecemeal over time and discussion and as we grew to know each other more, and so forth. </sentence><sentence id="3833">And it was a -- after all, it was three years before we were married, but yeah, it -- it -- well, it did not all come at once. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3837">Q: Right. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3839">A: And -- and it was not -- and it was not a public thing, either, it was very much more private. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3841">Q: Mm-hm, mm-hm. </sentence><sentence id="3842">So it doesn't become public for you until the 60's, until these -- </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3843">A: Exactly. </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3844">Q: [indecipherable] first time. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3848">Q: Right. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3850">A: Right. </sentence><sentence id="3851">And -- </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3852">Q: Do you now consider yourself a survivor? </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3853">A: I do now, and I also realize that more and more of us are gone. </sentence><sentence id="3854">And that er -- that the -- the littlest bit that I can do to bear testimony to this event is probably the only thing I can do to justify that I am among the living, and so many are among the dead. </sentence><sentence id="3855">And if I'm not willing to do that, then I'm really doing a grave disservice, both to humankind and to those who died, because no one was there to speak for them if it's not coming from us. </sentence><sentence id="3856">And the -- the dilemma about not only studying this whole human element to -- to realize -- well, I made mention for example of the -- of "The Eye of the Storm," or the -- the, "Blue Eyes, Brown Eyes," and all of those. </sentence><sentence id="3857">Yes, we can isolate those particular behaviors and we can call them by names and we can study them. </sentence><sentence id="3858">Stanley Milgrim, a social psychologist at Yale did these studies that are probably more telling about what happened and why people and how people were able to do these terrible things. </sentence><sentence id="3859">If you know the -- I'm -- I'm sure you do, but he -- he basically put somebody in a white coat in a lab with a one way mirror, and he brought people in off the street, and said we're running this experiment. </sentence><sentence id="3860">We're going to see how much pain these -- how much shock these subjects are willing to endure. </sentence><sentence id="3861">And below the one way mirror was a group of actors in a studio. </sentence><sentence id="3862">And there was a fake set of dials and people turned up the electricity. </sentence><sentence id="3863">Up and up and up. </sentence><sentence id="3864">And it didn't matter that the actors were writhing on the floor and screaming and calling and saying stop, stop. </sentence><sentence id="3865">It apparently did not affect most of the people, not every single one. </sentence><sentence id="3866">And now you couldn't do that kind of experiment any more because of the upset to the people who -- who came to recognize what they were capable of doing. </sentence><sentence id="3867">But if we're capable of doing that, and we keep doing it, and we keep doing it, and we keep turning our backs to what's going on in areas where other people are doing it, we're not advancing at all. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3883">Q: So what good is it to talk about, do you think? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3885">A: Well, I think that if there are enough people who hear it, and if there are enough people who are struck by the fact that this kind of behavior can lead to this kind of event, the Holocaust, that maybe it behooves them to do something before we get there. </sentence><sentence id="3886">Maybe. </sentence><sentence id="3887">I -- I think th -- I only -- I have to continue to believe that, because otherwise I can't continue to go on. </sentence><sentence id="3888">And this is also back to what I said earlier about the fact you never know what you're able to sustain, you never know what you are able to do, or what you'd be willing to do in a situation where your life depends on it, or the lifes of your loved ones. </sentence><sentence id="3889">But the bottom line is that we should perhaps not be so adaptable. </sentence><sentence id="3890">We should not be able to do what these Jews did for so long, throughout history, which is to adjust to the behavior that was imposed on them, and the restrictions imposed on them, and the tortures imposed on them. </sentence><sentence id="3891">What can you do? </sentence><sentence id="3892">You can't stand up and fight. </sentence><sentence id="3893">I know that they -- they were helpless, they had no weapons, they had no allies, they had nothing. </sentence><sentence id="3894">So the question about why didn't they stand up and fight becomes a -- a moot question, really. </sentence><sentence id="3895">But when you find yourself in a situation where we really must stop, I don't know why we, as a nation, aren't in the streets, and I consider myself equally guilty, because I don't know what to do. </sentence><sentence id="3896">But why are not in the street demanding that we stop killing? </sentence><sentence id="3897">How far have we come if we can't sit around the table and try to work things out. </sentence><sentence id="3898">Why can't we -- I took training in mediation. </sentence><sentence id="3899">Much of my work has been in -- in law in education, and first amendment rights. </sentence><sentence id="3900">And those liberties and freedoms that we have fought for in this country, since time immemorial as far as the history of this country, why are we suddenly making different rules for different people? </sentence><sentence id="3901">I -- I don't know how to adjust to that, it -- it -- it's -- I think when people used to ask me, you know, do you wa -- well, how do you feel about this country and so forth, and I always had felt this is the country where people can talk, where people can argue, where you can have a dialog, where we have an open press. </sentence><sentence id="3902">And yet things keep coming out, and keep coming out and keep coming out. </sentence><sentence id="3903">In the papers every day, in the -- the general news. </sentence><sentence id="3904">I don't have access to any private news any more than anybody else. </sentence><sentence id="3905">But finally it's getting to people in the streets that this president lied to us, and for whatever personal reasons went to war, killing not only Americans, but also Iraqis, or Afghanis, and the -- and the justification for af -- Afghanistan, I think, is certainly greater than Iraq. </sentence><sentence id="3906">But there were no weapons of mass destruction. </sentence><sentence id="3907">Why do we support a world organization? </sentence><sentence id="3908">Why do we say other countries have to adhere to the decisions of the world organization, but we're outside the law. </sentence><sentence id="3909">This doesn't make any sense. </sentence><sentence id="3910">That doesn't move us forward. </sentence><sentence id="3911">It doesn't put us in the situation of -- of making unacceptable certain ways of warfare and torture and behavior. </sentence><sentence id="3912">We -- we ti -- we say Amnesty International is wrong. </sentence><sentence id="3913">They come in -- the Red Cross is bamboozled, just as they were by the Nazis. </sentence><sentence id="3914">The Nazis came into the camps, into some of those camps, and there is data that I have just seen this spring, actually, at Hoover, indicating what the men were told, what the soldiers were told, in order to dress up the camp so that the Red Cross could come in and be impressed. </sentence><sentence id="3915">How they had casual music groups, how they had cafes set up, they shipped half of the camp population off to another camp because they -- the -- otherwise the Red Cross would say you have too many people per square bed, or whatever. </sentence><sentence id="3916">Well, such as you might call it. </sentence><sentence id="3917">It's unbelievable what these people did. </sentence><sentence id="3918">And here, first person accounts that I am now finding in the original languages about what the Nazis did in order to bamboozle the Red Cross. </sentence><sentence id="3919">But we are in similar situations, uncomfortably similar situations. </sentence><sentence id="3920">And I can't live with this, I am finding this nightmarish. </sentence><sentence id="3921">My daughter and I talk on the phone and we're either in tears, or we're so upset every phone call that I finally said to her, we've got to put this off limits, we can't do this. </sentence><sentence id="3922">I c -- I can't -- I can't do this. </sentence><sentence id="3923">But I am -- lam just as bad as everybody else. </sentence><sentence id="3924">I haven't done anything except signing petitions and trying to get people to listen and read. </sentence><sentence id="3925">But I haven't gone off in the street and demonstrated. </sentence><sentence id="3926">I ha -- I don't know what to do. </sentence><sentence id="3927">And of course this -- this public relations campaign about making every difference of opinion seem like an unpatriotic act has a very familiar ring to me. </sentence><sentence id="3928">I heard this before. </sentence><sentence id="3929">And there -- here we are celebrating 60 years til the end of the war. </sentence><sentence id="3930">Where are we now?That was the war to end all wars. </sentence><sentence id="3931">So it tastes very bad. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3982">Q: The taste for you after the war, is a very bad one. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3984">A: Well, it's only bad because as I say, this -- this was -- this was our hope for the future. </sentence><sentence id="3985">We were not going to as a world, let this kind of thing happen again. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3988">Q: But that's not true. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3990">A: And I don't see it as true, and I s-see such -- so many similar means. </sentence><sentence id="3991">Yes, not all. </sentence><sentence id="3992">You know, there -- there aren't extermination camps, but we're doing many of the things in very similar ways, that have to me a ring of danger. </sentence><sentence id="3993">And I never thought that I would feel this way in this country, because -- and this is why I'm such a strong believer in an absolutely free and independent press. </sentence><sentence id="3994">Because the press is the -- is the -- the only guide we have through darkness. </sentence><sentence id="3995">And we depend on the press to lead us there so that we can ask the question and say to the administration, how can you explain this? </sentence><sentence id="3996">How can you explain that? </sentence><sentence id="3997">And as long as there is light on the subject, then you can stop it. </sentence><sentence id="3998">But if you force people underground, you don't know what in God's name they're doing underground. </sentence><sentence id="3999">You don't know what the Ku Klux Klan is doing, what the neo-Nazis are doing, what the terrorists are doing if you force them underground. </sentence><sentence id="4000">And if you -- if you contain the press and -- and sever its freedom, and -- or make it shut up and make it become an arm of the government PR, then you can no longer trust the press to do that for you. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="4012">Q: Wow. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="4014">A: I'm not sure if you were particularly interested in this last, but this is why I'm feeling so -- I -- I don't know what to do with my feelings about this. </sentence><sentence id="4015">And -- and yet my commitment all through my professional life has been to support Constitutional liberties, the Bill of Rights, to teach my students, both elementary teachers and high school students, the importance of listening and respecting the opinions of the children in their classes, whether they abide by them or not. </sentence><sentence id="4016">But that the essence of a free society is to listen and respect. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="4020">Q: Right. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="4022">A: And you stop your respect at a certain point of course, if that other side is preaching your death, or somebody else's death, then you say, that's it. </sentence><sentence id="4023">I don't have any compunction about saying at a certain point that you have to restrain that freedom if that person or group is preaching that doctrine that certain people should be killed. </sentence><sentence id="4024">But ne-nearly up to that point, I'm saying you -- this -- this is the only guide we have to remain a -- a country with the ideals that presumably we have led the world in and -- and have tried to teach others. </sentence><sentence id="4025">I mean, what good is it to talk about democracy and then go in and behave the way we're doing and besides which there's another piece of this teaching democracy, which right now I don't think this administration has -- has reckoned with, and that is that if you really preach democracy, you may end up getting an election someplace with people that you don't really want. </sentence><sentence id="4026">But if you believe in democracy, if that's what those people want, that's -- you have to respect that. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="4032">Q: Right. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="4034">A: But we -- we're not ready for that. </sentence><sentence id="4035">Can't deal with that. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="4064">Q: I'm going to ask you given what you -- what you've just been talking about and talk about at various points in the interview, about what's going on, what -- how you see the world now, you talk particularly a-about this administration, but of course in your lifetime, there was Cambodia, there was Rwanda -- </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="4065">A: Absolutely. </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="4066">Q: -- there was Bosnia and Kosovo, and ti -- East Timor, and now Darfore, I mean it goes on and on. </sentence><sentence id="4067">When you think about it, do you think more about Tante Toos and what she did? </sentence><sentence id="4068">That she took a very particular kind of action. </sentence><sentence id="4069">She didn't save the world, but she engaged in such a way that she risked her life, and her family's life to try to save three people. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="4074">A: Mm-hm, mm-hm. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="4076">Q: I mean does -- does -- do you think more about how d -- how difficult it must have been? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="4078">A: No --    </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="4080">Q: Nobody knocked on your door yet -- </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="4081">A: Mm-hm, mm-hm. </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="4082">Q: -- to say take me in. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="4084">A: Mm-hm, mm-hm. </sentence><sentence id="4085">No, there's -- there's no question about that, I -- I do think about that enormously. </sentence><sentence id="4086">I -- I think all the ti -- and -- and also actually all the years that I was getting older and so forth, I kept thinking about what it must have been like for my mother -- when I was 45 or something. </sentence><sentence id="4087">You know, I would think, oh my God, my mother was such and such and age, and this is what was happening, and what would I do, and so forth. </sentence><sentence id="4088">And I was also -- and I think I had very strong, not only values, but ideas, and also at the same time, I think, wanted very much for my children to have as normal -- whatever that really means, but as normal a childhood as possible. </sentence><sentence id="4089">And so I -- I know I'm veering off your question a little bit, but I felt on the one hand that they needed to learn what I could express about this from a learning point of view. </sentence><sentence id="4090">So we did very little by way of Jewish tradition in the home, partly because I didn't like the pulling apart of some members of the Jewish community and I didn't like the sort of exclusiveness that one particular rabbi had -- had communicated. </sentence><sentence id="4091">So we didn't really want our kids exposed to that, so ours was by contrast a much more inclusive home, and there was -- it wa -- it's really interesting because l-Leas, my daughter has often said, you know, this community, or that community, or this group of people is -- is really the example of the kind of values that you and Dad taught us. </sentence><sentence id="4092">And so clearly there was a -- a -- a very clear understanding of what those values were. </sentence><sentence id="4093">And so we neither the kids likes this exclusiveness that some communities will -- will -- will send out, will radiate. </sentence><sentence id="4094">And at the same time, I didn't want them to have the burden that so many children of survivors seem to carry. </sentence><sentence id="4095">And I got to know about that, because as I was speaking around, so many of the people came to me and said, oh now I understand what my parents didn't want to tell me, or now I understand why it's so difficult to talk about the second World War, or whatever, whatever, whatever. </sentence><sentence id="4096">And likewise in Europe, where I've spoken in a number of places, including Austria, to high school teachers, who said, we cannot speak to our parents, they will not answer questions, they will not tell us where they were, and so on, or what they did. </sentence><sentence id="4097">And at the same time I see that this presents a special kind of burden, and I didn't want to have our kids have that. </sentence><sentence id="4098">Now this commitment to normalcy, is that sort of -- that's probably not that unusual, I imagine any parent wants only the happiest and the best f-for their kids, and it's not always the happy situations that build character, necessarily, but at the same time I made sure that the kids had a sense of -- of inclusiveness, of one world ideas about respect for other people. </sentence><sentence id="4099">So much so that the kids were actually quite -- took on an activist role in school on behalf of other kids. </sentence><sentence id="4100">Not Jewish kids, necessarily, but I -- you know, speaking up on behalf of someone that the teacher was picking on. </sentence><sentence id="4101">The teacher probably didn't even know he was doing it, and so on. </sentence><sentence id="4102">And then also, I think, reflecting on the present role of Israel, vis-a-vis the Palestinians, taking classes in Israeli-Arab dispute. </sentence><sentence id="4103">Trying to be informed and to not be afraid to express an opinion in opposition to the Israeli government. </sentence><sentence id="4104">Sometimes putting themselves at -- on the outs with other Jews, perhaps. </sentence><sentence id="4105">But I felt that that was terribly, terribly important. </sentence><sentence id="4106">Now the same goes for putting yourself out for some of these people. </sentence><sentence id="4107">And so far, I have not been able to do that in a personal sense -- back to your original question, other than in the monetary sense. </sentence><sentence id="4108">And w-we have as a family, and as -- and my husband and I personally, have made big commitments to IRC, the International Rescue Committee, which seems in a major way to be helping refugees without any respect to what their country or their nationa -- their nationality or their religion is, but going to those places in the world where people are desperate, where people are suffering because of what's going on, whether it's internal or external strife, and so on. </sentence><sentence id="4109">So we have done as much as we could, maybe not as much as we can do, but still hope to be able to continue to do, in those terms, which -- which are important. </sentence><sentence id="4110">And my husband, especially, I think in a professional way, has brought the plight of the refugees to students, involved students in the work that's necessary to save these people around the world. </sentence><sentence id="4111">To do even small things, like volunteer to teach English as a second language in the local church or school, wherever the classes are being held. </sentence><sentence id="4112">To -- one of -- one of -- wo -- actually she wasn't a student of mine at Hampshire, but a -- a na -- a student, who became a student of Peter's, and worked in the refugee camps and extended herself to the point of taking a small inheritance that she had from her grandmother, and bringing three Cambodian women back, who had been raped and tortured and so forth. </sentence><sentence id="4113">And adopting them, bringing them back, getting them settled, getting them set up. </sentence><sentence id="4114">Yeah, we're not saving the world, but we are trying, and -- and I think sometimes when I have this great urgent sense of why am I sitting here in a classroom, I think, well, somebody has to sit in the classroom and try to keep part of the mission going that -- that we have got to change, and how do we do that. </sentence><sentence id="4115">And that not everybody can run in the field, and do the medical stuff, or do the actual whatever. </sentence><sentence id="4116">And somehow I've often felt that in my small way, given the values that I think I've been able to communicate, even at the level of simply teaching teachers to have respect for the child, which sounds as if it should be nothing anyone would argue about. </sentence><sentence id="4117">But if you watch clearly, you see that not every adult, and not every person who's teaching, has that respect for that child. </sentence><sentence id="4118">Even if they are church-going and religion loving, and anti-abortion and so forth. </sentence><sentence id="4119">Respect for that other life, and the fact that that life has a will and some sense and justification for some freedom is not there a -- often, in spite of the espousal of these other, so-called values. </sentence><sentence id="4120">So I feel sometimes that maybe this is a rationalization, but it is something I do believe I could do, and I could do it quite well. </sentence><sentence id="4121">And so I felt that to throw in the towel was not the right thing for me to do, at least at tho -- in those years of my life. </sentence><sentence id="4122">I would like very much to be out in the field now, and -- and now is probably not a good time, having since had cancer and so forth. </sentence><sentence id="4123">And I have to say that when I was first diagnosed with the cancer, a friend of mine said, oh Hedy, you're a survivor, you're going to make it. </sentence><sentence id="4124">And I have to say, although I understood perfectly where she was coming from, I quietly said to myself, why do I have to keep proving it all the time? </sentence><sentence id="4125">But I -- I feel now somewhat medically compromised about going out in the field, but it is something that I thought about. </sentence><sentence id="4126">I thought seriously about joining the Peace Corps after my kids were grown. </sentence><sentence id="4127">And -- and I still remember the horrible, horrible feeling I had during the Kosovo time, and when there was talk about the draft and my son was draft age, and I thought to myself -- and I didn't say it out loud, but I just was devastated with the thought that I lost the family behind me, and now I was going to lose the family in front of me. </sentence><sentence id="4128">It was something I could barely confront myself. </sentence><sentence id="4129">And now I'm looking at my grandson. </sentence><sentence id="4130">And if this continues, he will be draft age. </sentence><sentence id="4131">Jordy and Robert are the two sons of my son. </sentence><sentence id="4132">And I-I just -- I can't face that. </sentence><sentence id="4133">I just can't face that. </sentence><sentence id="4134">I just can't face that.
