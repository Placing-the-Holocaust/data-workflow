<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="99">Q: Excuse me. </sentence><sentence id="100">The six-month extension meant what? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="103">A: The six-months extension meant that after six months, we have to, we cannot live in, in, not only Jasina, in Hungary. </sentence><sentence id="104">We must leave. </sentence><sentence id="105">We would be left, they would come for us forcibly and take us, and take us away and ship us over to Poland. </sentence><sentence id="106">So, of course, at this time we knew already what the plan would be, so, so we escaped. </sentence><sentence id="107">My brother helped us to escape. </sentence><sentence id="108">He had meantime, he went, he went ahead of time. </sentence><sentence id="109">He had already dental office and he knew already the police. </sentence><sentence id="110">We, were still -- he didn't wait "til the six months. </sentence><sentence id="111">Let's say after four months he went and established himself there and got to know the police. </sentence><sentence id="112">And then we had to leave. </sentence><sentence id="113">The way we left is we just -- we had three tenants in our house. </sentence><sentence id="114">We didn't even tell the tenants that we are leaving. </sentence><sentence id="115">We just walked out of the house and -- like we would go for a walk. </sentence><sentence id="116">We left everything. </sentence><sentence id="117">We just walked out in our, in, in our only clothes -- except for, for a pocketbook -- so that nobody should know that we are leaving. </sentence><sentence id="118"> And we boarded a train; and we came first to Chust because you have to come to Chust by train in order to get to Horinc. </sentence><sentence id="119">But when we arrived to Chust, there was, they made the police was making selections -- not selections; they were rounding up the people who didn't have papers, who didn't have, who didn't have citizenship papers. </sentence><sentence id="120">They were shipping them to, to Poland. </sentence><sentence id="121">So we came at a very bad time. </sentence><sentence id="122">However, my brother waited for us at the train station and he got -- and he got somebody that let us stay in a, in a -- it was like a bunker, a basement, in a basement for, until, until, -- we stayed there about one week, until this will blow over and the people, you know, will calm down again. </sentence><sentence id="123">Because once they made their, their arrests, it was -- it, it quieted down; because it wasn't, it wasn't not yet -- when -- Hungary was not bothering yet the Jews, only the ones that didn't have citizenship papers, and only from the part that they occupied. </sentence><sentence id="124">But deep in Hungary, the Jews were still having their businesses and, and had all the, the freedom. </sentence><sentence id="125">So after that, he got us to Horinc, where we, were staying about -- because I was approximately 16 years old when I, when I left Horinc, so we, were staying there at least a year. </sentence><sentence id="126">But then my brother -- the police had warned him, because he became very friendly with the police-- </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="151">Q: Just a--I need to slow down a little bit. </sentence><sentence id="152">You were staying for a year. </sentence><sentence id="153">You were hiding in this room? </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="161">Q: Can you slow down and tell us what it was like to hide? </sentence><sentence id="162">We have plenty of time. </sentence><sentence id="163">Slow and tell us -- what it was like to hide in that room for a year. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="167">A: I was very content, except I was very lonely because I had no friends. </sentence><sentence id="168">I could not have any friends. </sentence><sentence id="169">I had only my mother and my sister, who got married in the meantime so that she would have, not -- she was anyway engaged to be to be married but she wouldn't have probably that young -- she was only 17 years old that she married, or, or close to 18. </sentence><sentence id="170">She married so that she should have citizenship papers; and she married with whom she was anyway engaged, but she got engaged that young because of the circumstances that we had, that, that we had experienced. </sentence><sentence id="171">So he, he got married to a dentist who had citizenship papers and she could at least be -- live freely, and she lived in Chust. </sentence><sentence id="172">So she left Horinc, and she lived in Chust. </sentence><sentence id="173">And I, and then I was just, I was just with my mother. </sentence><sentence id="174">But she would come to visit, to visit us. </sentence><sentence id="175">My brother would try to keep us occupied. </sentence><sentence id="176">He would bring games into the house, and play with us. </sentence><sentence id="177">He, he used to play, the guitar. </sentence><sentence id="178">He would come and play the guitar after he finished his office work; and he tried, -- he was one of the best people that, that lived on this, under the sun, because he -- not only that he, helped, he was so -- I mean, that he gave up his life for his family; but when he was a young, a young boy, he would he would take the children. </sentence><sentence id="179">And when he was even working as a dentist, whoever didn't have money he wouldn't charge. </sentence><sentence id="180">He would do free dental work. </sentence><sentence id="181">I mean, it was not just that he was helping us, but he, he'll helped other people. </sentence><sentence id="182">And what I'm trying to describe that what kind of people they, they killed; and, and that people are really not only, that could make contributions to  this world and what they did to, to such wonderful people, eventually. </sentence><sentence id="183">So, so my brother tried to keep us occupied. </sentence><sentence id="184">However, he was informed by the police that in two weeks he will be taken away on forced labor, on forced labor. </sentence><sentence id="185">That meant, meant nobody knew where they are going to send him. </sentence><sentence id="186">Without him, we could not stay and continue to be in Horinc; because we would be -- we, were stateless, so what he did is he used to send his dental work to Nyiregyhaza -- which was a big city in, deep in Hungary. </sentence><sentence id="187">That was not from the occupation, but that was really Hungary. </sentence><sentence id="188">So he got in touch with the this the owner of that laboratory. </sentence><sentence id="189">It was a large labora-- dental laboratory. </sentence><sentence id="190">And he asked him that he could rent for us a cheap room in some, in a secluded neighborhood. </sentence><sentence id="191">He explained him the situation, and he was a Jewish man; and he asked him that he should accept me as an apprentice to learn the dental work. </sentence><sentence id="192">He gave us all the money that, that he had to, you know, to tide us over. </sentence><sentence id="193">So, and then he left. </sentence><sentence id="194">So, you can imagine with all this, this parting -- which I described in my book -- when my, when my brother was leaving, and we never knew what's going to happen to us and we never knew what's going to happen to him. </sentence><sentence id="195">And, the, the last, day, we all -- when he came to say good- bye, my mother, my mother fainted because she couldn't -- he, he knew that.... First of all, she felt terribly guilty that we let him stay when he could be in Palestine, and now he's being taken away from us; and forced labor meant, that also you didn't know whether they will ever return. </sentence><sentence id="196">And, unfortunately, he didn't. </sentence><sentence id="197">So, but, I, I-- and, and he kept, he came three times back to, you know, to say good-bye to us and finally he had to leave; and, and this was the last time that we, we saw my brother. </sentence><sentence id="198">We came to Nyiregyhaza, and we had all the, you know, we knew exactly where we are going to, to stay -- which was one room by a very poor widow. </sentence><sentence id="199">It had, no hot water. </sentence><sentence id="200">It was a very dilapidated, room, where we, were staying, and....But I was accepted by this into that laboratory; and everyday I would, I would go, you know, to learn to become a dental technician. </sentence><sentence id="201">And my mother was always at, at home and she tried to make a home for me. </sentence><sentence id="202">However, eventually her money was, was running out; and we, no matter how we, were trying to, to save and to live, economically, eventually our money ran out and she had to, and she was, would go to stand in line for, it was like, you know, like soup kitchens and, and it was the most horrible experience for my mother, because she was a very proud person and, and she was used to help other people. </sentence><sentence id="203">I will just describe you the type of a mother my mother was. </sentence><sentence id="204">We had a house; and, and we, were not, by all means we, were not rich people. </sentence><sentence id="205">We, were almost poor ourselves, especial she had lost her husband. </sentence><sentence id="206">And we had -- so we rented out in order to make ends meet, we rented out to tenants; we rented out three, we had three tenants, and not even one could pay the rent. </sentence><sentence id="207">They were all poor. </sentence><sentence id="208">And we, were always, you know, we, were children. </sentence><sentence id="209">We wanted to be able also to buy ice cream and to buy chocolate and to buy nice clothes; and natural my mother never had any money. </sentence><sentence id="210">We would always tell her, "Why when you have to rent to, to people that cannot pay? </sentence><sentence id="211">Look. </sentence><sentence id="212">There are other rich  people. </sentence><sentence id="213">Why don't they take them?" </sentence><sentence id="214">And my mother always said, "Let them learn from me. </sentence><sentence id="215">I don't want to learn from them." </sentence><sentence id="216">And, and she always said, "We will see that because we are doing all this good deeds, that God will help." </sentence><sentence id="217">And, and, and, anyway, she believed in God that whatever she is doing that God will reward us. </sentence><sentence id="218">She even used to send us as children to, to collect, for poor families that, that needed, that were needy families. </sentence><sentence id="219">And this is how she taught us to, to help other people. </sentence><sentence id="220">So now you can imagine that now she had to stand -- yeah, she would even cook much more than we needed and bring to those poor tenants, so that they should have enough to eat -- and now she was standing in, in a line for a little soup. </sentence><sentence id="221">And she was so embarrassed about it that she would not let me -- she didn't even tell me. </sentence><sentence id="222">I didn't even know; because when I would come home, you know, the, the food was there. </sentence><sentence id="223">And I always said, "Oh, it's, it's so," you know, "it tastes so bad." </sentence><sentence id="224">So then she found a place where she would wash dishes to get in a restaurant, to get one meal, one meal for, for washing dishes and even this she didn't tell. </sentence><sentence id="225">She would say she brought it. </sentence><sentence id="226">He, he, there was a certain pride in the way we, were brought up, you know, that this, that it's embarrassing. </sentence><sentence id="227">And she would, she would put a pot of hot water what the landlady should think that she is cooking, in order not to let her know our dire need and in what bad circumstances we are, because this landlady didn't know that we have no papers and that we are just in hiding. </sentence><sentence id="228">And I always, and I couldn't go no place because again, in case somebody would ask me for papers, I was without papers; and everybody had to have papers in Hungary. </sentence><sentence id="229">The policemen, they came over and they asked you for you to show your papers, and if you didn't have them you were right away arrested. </sentence><sentence id="230">So I would always go straight home from the laboratory. </sentence><sentence id="231">And I was working between nine boys and they would always, you know, wanted to escort me home, or to ask me to a movie; and I never wanted to go no place because, because I could not afford to be too visible in case, because I couldn't tell nobody that, that why.... The only person that knew that I am in hiding was the, owner of the laboratory. </sentence><sentence id="232">But then one day my sister arrived from Chust, and it was my -- I was -- it was my 17" birthday. </sentence><sentence id="233">She arrived on my birthday, and I was so excited. </sentence><sentence id="234">I thought that she came because it was my birthday. </sentence><sentence id="235">And she told us that my sister, the one that was --I had a sister that was married and had three children with a husband -- that they were arrested for over.... She had a store, and at that time you could not just take away a store without any reason because it was not yet you know, it, it was not yet, the Germans, the Nazis weren't, weren't yet in Hungary. </sentence><sentence id="236">They were only in all the other places, but not in Hungary; so they did yet have the right to go and, and take away your store, your house. </sentence><sentence id="237">So, so they, they paid up one, one person that wanted her store went to the police and said that, that she over-charged. </sentence><sentence id="238">It was just a you know, something to pin on you. </sentence><sentence id="239">So they, the police came, took away my brother-in-law to a forced labor camp; and my sister was arrested. </sentence><sentence id="240">And the three children remained alone, so the, from our from our tenants, they -- my -- the tenants that were in our house, she left the children. </sentence><sentence id="241">He, he begged them to let to let the children that somebody should come and pick up the children. </sentence><sentence id="242">So the children were taken by, by one of our tenants until somebody from Romania, a cousin of hers, came to Jasina to take care of them; and, and she moved in with her three children into our house that we had, you know, that, that we had went away from. </sentence><sentence id="243"> So now my sister was in Budapest in a in a prison; and my brother-in-law was in, somewhere took him to some forced labor camp. </sentence><sentence id="244">So my sister came to tell us that good news, from, from Chust. </sentence><sentence id="245">This was the -- so we started to, to plan how we could help my sister. </sentence><sentence id="246">Somebody has to go to Budapest and try again, you know, to get a lawyer and to find out where, where she is and, and to help her. </sentence><sentence id="247">Maybe we could, get her out. </sentence><sentence id="248">So my mother, when I came back from, from the laboratory, my mother told me that we cannot be anymore together, that I must go to Budapest and try to see what I can do for my sister. </sentence><sentence id="249">I, I started -- I, I panicked. </sentence><sentence id="250">I started to cry, "What am I going to do there? </sentence><sentence id="251">How am I going to...2" You know, I, I was never, I was never by myself. </sentence><sentence id="252">I was never independent; and now I, and also I had to go, to get to Budapest it's, it's, it's a danger because if I am asked for, for a, for papers and I don't have them, I'm arrested too. </sentence><sentence id="253">So we, decided on our plan, that I'm going to buy an anti-Semitic papers. </sentence><sentence id="254">There was, there was a paper that was, that came out specially, you know, they had the, the that they had like they had Nyilaskeresztes," they were called. </sentence><sentence id="255">it, it was like they had in Germany the Nazi Party, they had also a Nyilaskeresztes Party; and they were printing a very anti-Semitic paper. </sentence><sentence id="256">So I was going to buy an anti-Semitic paper and travel first class; so because this way nobody would will suspect that, you know, a Jew without papers was going to travel first class and read an anti-Semitic paper. </sentence><sentence id="257">And this is perhaps how I'm going to, you know, to be able to get to Budapest. </sentence><sentence id="258">And once I'm in Budapest, it's a very big city. </sentence><sentence id="259">It's easier to hide out there. </sentence><sentence id="260">But my mother couldn't remain any more in, in Horinc. </sentence><sentence id="261">Of course, she didn't have the money and she didn't and you know, she didn't have papers and there was no, no reason for her to stay anymore. </sentence><sentence id="262">She stayed only because as long as I was there and I was learning to become a dental technician. </sentence><sentence id="263">So my sister took my mother along with her, to stay with her in Chust; and she was going to hide there, because there my, my brother-in-law was a, a dentist and he also had, you know, was friendly with the police. </sentence><sentence id="264">As long as they got, you could always buy off the police at the time, you know, until it was still possible. </sentence></p></dialogue>

because we all said, "If they wanted to lall us, they could have killed us here. </sentence><sentence id="1201">Why would they bother taking us from, from the ghetto?" </sentence><sentence id="1202">So, we made up that whoever will -- in case we are separated -- because there was always the chance of being separated -- then we will eventually meet in Budapest. </sentence><sentence id="1203">So we, this, this was our -- that what I remember the last that we told each other. </sentence><sentence id="1204">Now we are -- the journey was a very long journey, at least about three days and three nights it took, that journey. </sentence><sentence id="1205">And we arrived to Auschwitz. </sentence><sentence id="1206">As soon as they opened the doors, prisoners in striped uniforms came on to the train and they started to, to yell that we should all leave everything and go down -- we all must get out, leave everything in the train. </sentence><sentence id="1207">My brother-in-law by some miracle had still a watch. </sentence><sentence id="1208">So he -- you know, he asked them first, "Tell me what's going on here." </sentence><sentence id="1209">And downstairs we just heard a lot of screaming and, and yelling in, in German. </sentence><sentence id="1210">"What's going on here?," </sentence><sentence id="1211">he said to him. </sentence><sentence id="1212">My sister -- as soon as they opened the door, she ran  down with her little boy; because Danny was crying and, and it was suffocating in, in that train. </sentence><sentence id="1213">It was a terrible, terrible journey. </sentence><sentence id="1214">People were fainting. </sentence><sentence id="1215">We, we, were pulling out you know, that -- smelling salts to revive people. </sentence><sentence id="1216">It was unbelievable to describe just the journey itself, so we, were already very glad when we arrived, at the arrival. </sentence><sentence id="1217">We thought, "This is, this is -- at least can't be worse than, than what we experienced." </sentence><sentence id="1218">So my brother-in-law asked them, "What's going on here." </sentence><sentence id="1219">So he, of course, didn't answer. </sentence><sentence id="1220">So he had a watch, and he goes and he slips him the watch; and he tells him -- and my sister was in the meantime downstairs, and I was always sticking next to my mother. </sentence><sentence id="1221">So he said to her, "Listen, if you have, children, then give it away to, to either older people or, or the women with children, because women and children and, anybody older is going to be killed. </sentence><sentence id="1222">They are killing the same night, the same day. </sentence><sentence id="1223">There is no chance, chance for these people to survive." </sentence><sentence id="1224">I couldn't even believe it. </sentence><sentence id="1225">And my mother had the presence of mind to, as soon as she, heard that -- she didn't know, this was my mother -- then this man said it, she ran down with me, and, and I ran after her; and she goes over to my sister, and, and she has the presence of mind to tell her, "Listen, Darling, I just found out that women and children will have it very easy. </sentence><sentence id="1226">All they will, all they are going to do is take care -- is take care of the children. </sentence><sentence id="1227">But -- and, and if I don't have a child, then they will send me in hard labor. </sentence><sentence id="1228">And you know I will never survive hard labor. </sentence><sentence id="1229">But you are young, and you'll be able to survive." </sentence><sentence id="1230">And before she has a chance even, you know, and, and before my sister had a chance, you know, to go not to give the child, my mother moved the child from her arms. </sentence><sentence id="1231">And, and, and as soon as she removed -- she had the child in her arms, she was pushed to this other side, you know, with all the women and children. </sentence><sentence id="1232">And me and my sister were, were pushed to other side. </sentence><sentence id="1233">And my mother still yelled out, she yelled out to me, not to my -- "Cillinka, take care of your sister!" </sentence><sentence id="1234">Because she knew, she knew that my sister will suffer when she'll find out where she took her grandson. </sentence><sentence id="1235">And then I had a double challenge to keep my sister alive, because my sister eventually -- we -- there was not too long before we found out the truth -- where we are, and what is happening. </sentence><sentence id="1236">Because when they, they took us to a big room where we had to, where we had to undress and there were, and they took everything away from us. </sentence><sentence id="1237">And just on the other side was the same big room, only that it had gas -- only gas were coming out. </sentence><sentence id="1238">This is where my mother and all the others were, in that gas chamber. </sentence><sentence id="1239">And we, were in another place that we had to undress and dress and they took everything away from us. </sentence><sentence id="1240">And they shoved us in to, to the showers, that we have to -- but what they did is, they first opened the hot water so we got scalded and then they opened the cold water; so as we, were running out, we, we, were we, were beaten with the, with the whips to go under it. </sentence><sentence id="1241">And then when we came out we, were all so -- and first they shaved us. </sentence><sentence id="1242">No, first we, were shaved. </sentence><sentence id="1243">This was after -- I can't even remember whether this was after the shower or before the shower, but we, were completely, you know, they shaved our hair and they shaved our, our private parts; and, and then they shoved us in into that shower, and then they gave us -- each one got some rag to put on. </sentence><sentence id="1244">Not a striped uniform, but just a rag -- as 1f somebody could get a size six that needed a, a size 15, and somebody got a, a size -- and visa versa. </sentence><sentence id="1245">And so that when we, were lined up, we didn't  even recognize each other. </sentence><sentence id="1246">We, we, were just -- I was looking for my sister, and my sister was standing next to me; and we, we, were looking for each other. </sentence><sentence id="1247">And we, were so scared with that piece of soap, because they were they were searching, that I, we threw away the soap with, with the diamond earrings because we, were not supposed to have anything in our hands. </sentence><sentence id="1248">And we even had a hard time throwing it away, because we, were afraid they would they would say, "Well, what is this?" </sentence><sentence id="1249">You know? </sentence><sentence id="1250">So when we, finally we, were lined up and they marched us to Birkenau; and, and these were stables that housed -- and there were three layer bunks. </sentence><sentence id="1251">Each layer bunk, each bunk housed -- they pushed on each bunk 10 people. </sentence><sentence id="1252">Five this way, five this way. </sentence><sentence id="1253">And we just got a blanket to cover ourselves; and we just got -- the, the food -- I don't think I have to describe the food. </sentence><sentence id="1254">So we are, finally -- yes -- and was we, were lined up. </sentence><sentence id="1255">And, and as we, were marching, and as, as they marched us, there was the camp; and we saw flames are shooting out, and there was such a putrid smell. </sentence><sentence id="1256">And we asked those, those Kapos" or Blockaltesters" -- whoever was leading to the to our camp -- we said, "What is this?" </sentence><sentence id="1257">And you know what they said? </sentence><sentence id="1258">This: "There are your, your mothers, your sisters, your fathers. </sentence><sentence id="1259">They're all burning there." </sentence><sentence id="1260">I, and, and my sister -- and I said, "Menuko"," in the Jewish" I said, "they are only trying to scare us," I said. " </sentence><sentence id="1261">Don't, don't listen to what they said." </sentence><sentence id="1262">Then we are finally already in our, in our in our bunks; and we had to stand roll call. </sentence><sentence id="1263">They counted us. </sentence><sentence id="1264">And they -- and we, were, they send in each one -- there were 30 in that C Lager* and each one housed 1,000 girls, 1,000 girls. </sentence><sentence id="1265">And now it started the, the routine. </sentence><sentence id="1266">We, were, at before five o'clock we, we would be, we had to line up, be counted; and we got some, some coffee -- which it was just some kind of colored water -- and, and, and at lunch time we got some soup, and in the evening we got bread. </sentence><sentence id="1267">This was all the, the portions. </sentence><sentence id="1268">But my sister, he, he just didn't want to live. </sentence><sentence id="1269">She refused to eat. </sentence><sentence id="1270">He, he came, she became very depressed. </sentence><sentence id="1271">She did not want to live; and, and she only would tell me -- because we, were surrounded by electrified wires, she only wanted we should go and kill ourselves. </sentence><sentence id="1272">She would say, she would say she doesn't want to live. </sentence><sentence id="1273">She wants to go to the wires. </sentence><sentence id="1274">I always told her, "You tell me when you want to go," because this way I felt I have control and I can talk her out of it. </sentence><sentence id="1275">So each time she would say, "Let's go today," I would always tell her, "Not today. </sentence><sentence id="1276">Look, today we got -- it's, it's too warm. </sentence><sentence id="1277">Why don't we wait? </sentence><sentence id="1278">Then it was very cold. </sentence><sentence id="1279">We won't be able to -- we won't be able to take it any longer. </sentence><sentence id="1280">Let's wait. </sentence><sentence id="1281">We always have time to kill ourselves." </sentence><sentence id="1282">But I wanted very much to -- I wanted to live. </sentence><sentence id="1283">I, I had a lot of, you know, zest and a lot of life in me; and, and, and also, I felt that somebody must remain alive to tell all this. </sentence><sentence id="1284">Because just like we don't know, we thought nobody else knew in this world, just like we didn't know, you know. </sentence><sentence id="1285">And this is how * Foreman (German); term used in concentration camps for prisoners appointed by SS to supervise labor squads. </sentence><sentence id="1286">deg Barrack senior (German); deg Czech diminutive of "Mina." </sentence><sentence id="1287">7 Yiddish * Camp (German)  I, I kept her -- each day I would force, open her mouth -- I would, because it would get like one day a piece of margarine with the bread, and one day a piece of, of wurst so I would change the wurst for margarine so that I could push in; and, and push in the margarine in her mouth, it should melt, that she should swallow. </sentence><sentence id="1288">Because she didn't want to -- she, she didn't want to eat. </sentence><sentence id="1289">She didn't want to --he, he just didn't care any, any more. </sentence><sentence id="1290">And I was there a, a few months. </sentence><sentence id="1291">After, after -- no -- after four weeks I met somebody that, that she had she was in the children's Block"; and she told me that I should go and be with her, that it would be much easier for me because her cousin is a Stubeniiltester"(r). </sentence><sentence id="1292">That means that she takes care of the Block, and she has a little bit more to eat; and she could help us out. </sentence><sentence id="1293">So -- but she said that the Blockaltester has would, would have to agree to it, and she likes talented children. </sentence><sentence id="1294">She will get that I write poems. </sentence><sentence id="1295">This is what I said, that these girls sort of saved me for, for quite a while... </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1501">A: Yeah. </sentence><sentence id="1502">I, this -- I always could express myself more in writing than in any other way and I, I liked poetry and so I, I wrote poems. </sentence><sentence id="1503">I wrote them even there. </sentence><sentence id="1504">I, I would -- anything that bothered me, I could express in a poem. </sentence><sentence id="1505">So she told me, she asked me whether I had composed any poems; and I said, "Yes, I-- about my mother, about the -- and about the, the camp." </sentence><sentence id="1506">I had quite a few poems by then already. </sentence><sentence id="1507">So she told the Blockaltester, and she called me. </sentence><sentence id="1508">And she said from her, from the children's Block, from the children's Block--not from my Block. </sentence><sentence id="1509">And she said, "Okay. </sentence><sentence id="1510">you tell me your poems. </sentence><sentence id="1511">I heard that you write poems." </sentence><sentence id="1512">I said, "okay," and I told her the poems. </sentence><sentence id="1513">She said, "okay." </sentence><sentence id="1514">She said, "I would like you, you can come and, and stay in, in my Block." </sentence><sentence id="1515">So I said, "All right, but I have a sister in there with me." </sentence><sentence id="1516">She said, "All right, your sister cannot be -- you look still like...." You know, they were like up to 15 -- like 14, 15, 16. </sentence><sentence id="1517">She said, "But your sister doesn't look any more the age that I could pass her off as a children's, Block." </sentence><sentence id="1518">I said, "Well, then I wouldn't go." </sentence><sentence id="1519">So she said, "Okay, bring your sister." </sentence><sentence id="1520">And, and I brought my sister, and she passed her off. </sentence><sentence id="1521">Like if they had a selection, so she would stand between the Stubendltester -- and these were all orderlies, you know, orderlies. </sentence><sentence id="1522">Between the orderlies. </sentence><sentence id="1523">And that's how she wouldn't go through the selection, because every few weeks they would make a selection for the gas chambers. </sentence><sentence id="1524">They would select people; and if you were already deteriorated, which we started to deteriorate very fast on the on that menu that we, were given and, and under the treatment that we received. </sentence><sentence id="1525">Because we, we had to, to stand for hours and hours every day. </sentence><sentence id="1526">People would faint, and we, we started to get dysenteria, and we couldn't -- we had no sanitary facilities. </sentence><sentence id="1527">We could not drink water when we wanted. </sentence><sentence id="1528">We would be taken only once a day to drink water, deg Billet (German) (c) -o0m senior (German);

and she would hide there me and my sister so that we shouldn't go, get through the selection. </sentence><sentence id="1541">Because if, if we would have been sel- to be selected, they would select us to the gas chamber because we, were already not in very good shape. </sentence><sentence id="1542">So one, one day, they took us to those you know, to, to have our clothes disinfected. </sentence><sentence id="1543">So they took, they took us to, to disinfect the clothes, and so we had to undress naked and wait for our clothes to be disinfected. </sentence><sentence id="1544">And the SS was waiting there with us, you know, with the dogs. </sentence><sentence id="1545">We, were surrounded by SS and the dogs. </sentence><sentence id="1546">And, the Blockaltester wanted to keep them occupied, and she li-- and so she thought -- she di-didn't do it maliciously. </sentence><sentence id="1547">I mean, he, he just thought, to maybe to divert their, their attention maybe from other disaster. </sentence><sentence id="1548">So we had amongst our midst a very talented, 14 year old girl. </sentence><sentence id="1549">She was a ballet dancer, a professional ballet dancer from, from Budapest; and her parents were, in show business too. </sentence><sentence id="1550">And she was beautiful. </sentence><sentence id="1551">Even with, with her cropped hair, she was a beautiful, girl. </sentence><sentence id="1552">So she said, she asked them whether they would want to see, a girl dance ballet -- one of her children dance ballet. </sentence><sentence id="1553">They said, "All right." </sentence><sentence id="1554">So she asked this girl to, to dance. </sentence><sentence id="1555">And this girl really, she danced beautifully. </sentence><sentence id="1556">And, and as she was dancing, you could see tears were running down her cheeks; because she imagined herself, I'm sure, at a time when she was dancing on stage, you know, to the applause of an audience and the people. </sentence><sentence id="1557">And, and, and I, I just saw that whole scene in my mind because I wrote about her a poem. </sentence><sentence id="1558">And, and then when we got our clothes, they took away this girl. </sentence><sentence id="1559">They didn't give her the clothes -- I mean, they gave her the clothes back. </sentence><sentence id="1560">But the SS took her with them; and we never expected to see her again, because if they took somebody out, they usually killed them. </sentence><sentence id="1561">But a few days later they brought her back, and you couldn't recognize her. </sentence><sentence id="1562">They had raped her. </sentence><sentence id="1563">They, they had tortured her. </sentence><sentence id="1564">And she was completely -- she wasn't even, all there. </sentence><sentence id="1565">I'm sure she didn't know what was going on with her. </sentence><sentence id="1566">So for the next three days -- because only three days was before there was that selection -- she, for the next three days she was -- I, I was always waking her up -- she should come with us and stay between me and my sister. </sentence><sentence id="1567">When, when they were having the roll call, for roll call. </sentence><sentence id="1568">Because if she wouldn't show up, they, they would kill her. </sentence><sentence id="1569">But then three days later, there was a selection. </sentence><sentence id="1570">And they selec--  she was among them selected. </sentence><sentence id="1571">From, they selected that time at least more than, more than half. </sentence><sentence id="1572">From, from the thousand maybe 600 children were, were selected, and she was among those among these girls. </sentence><sentence id="1573">And, and all of a sudden she tried to remove her to outside, you know? </sentence><sentence id="1574">Because if she were to ever -- it was a reflex, I'm sure, because she knew there was no chance of run-- of running out there; because it was only a more horrible death to die. </sentence><sentence id="1575">So as, as she would try, as she tried to run over the side where the girls was standing that were not selected, the SS caught her and they beat her to death with the butts of their rifles. </sentence><sentence id="1576">And the screams I couldn't forget for many years. </sentence><sentence id="1577">That why I always get this in. </sentence><sentence id="1578">I always get this in. </sentence><sentence id="1579">I, I always tell about it whenever I speak; because I always feel maybe this child had nobody left, nobody maybe survived because apparently, nobody could -- if she was there and, and she was among the children -- these were young people, then she was probably the oldest and her whole family probably was wiped out. </sentence><sentence id="1580">So I always remember this girl. </sentence><sentence id="1581">I always light a candle for her. </sentence><sentence id="1582">I wrote a poem about her, and I always tell about her. </sentence><sentence id="1583">Because her screams, as she was screaming, "Mommy, help me!" </sentence><sentence id="1584">and "God, help me!" </sentence><sentence id="1585">And I only was asking God he should -- he should take her quickly, that, that it, it should end. </sentence><sentence id="1586">Because it takes a long time to beat somebody to death, and this -- but she was not an isolated case that was beaten to death. </sentence><sentence id="1587">The, the things that we have witnessed is, is unbelievable, what human beings can do to other human beings. </sentence><sentence id="1588">Even animals have a tendency to, to kill only -- they would kill only for food. </sentence><sentence id="1589">But they killed for pleasure, they could -- they for -- they would make a sport out, out of, out of us by -- they would take, let's say, a girl, and, and have her have bricks -- she should stand with bricks in the sun, and, and do all kinds of tortures. </sentence><sentence id="1590">And I will just tell you for what two other girls were beaten to death in front of my eyes. </sentence><sentence id="1591">And that was already in Niirnberg. </sentence><sentence id="1592">Yeah, you, you want -- I, I will go back first for some.... </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1692">A: All right. </sentence><sentence id="1693">After that, after a few months -- after this selection, the Blockaltester -- and they killed this, when they beat this, child to death -- she always was hiding me and my sister after the selections un-- in, under the covers. </sentence><sentence id="1694">Under, in that one room where she had, where they storaged blankets. </sentence><sentence id="1695">This was a storage place. </sentence><sentence id="1696">But then came the day when she told me, "Listen. </sentence><sentence id="1697">There are not any more selecting, but they are taking out -- they, they don't select any more; but they are taking whole Blocks out, and we don't...." And I said, "So where are they sending?" </sentence><sentence id="1698">She said, "I don't know. </sentence><sentence id="1699">Some go to the gas chambers, and some go for work." </sentence><sentence id="1700">She said, "Maybe you'll be -- ours will be -- maybe our Block will be lucky to go to work." </sentence><sentence id="1701">But it wasn't. </sentence><sentence id="1702">One day they came. </sentence><sentence id="1703">They took out all of us, and we marched, they marched us straight to the gas chambers. </sentence><sentence id="1704">I was holding my sister's hand, and I was just thinking, "My sister is getting her wish." </sentence><sentence id="1705">But I was very, very mad that I am going to die. </sentence><sentence id="1706">And, and, and I even was so mad that I told myself I'm not even going to make any prayers. </sentence><sentence id="1707">I, I was very rebellious about, dying. </sentence><sentence id="1708">And -- but it was so quiet, and it was so, so orderly. </sentence><sentence id="1709">Nobody was, was even crying. </sentence><sentence id="1710">I guess we, were so -- we, we knew that we haven't got a  chance to survive and, and I guess everybody else thought that it doesn't matter sooner or later. </sentence><sentence id="1711">So if, if it's sooner, it's sooner. </sentence><sentence id="1712">It mattered a lot to me; but, but -- but there was nothing else to do but just be quiet, too. </sentence><sentence id="1713">And then we, we heard that one, what the gas chambers were not empty. </sentence><sentence id="1714">As, as we, were waiting the doors to open, nothing was happening. </sentence><sentence id="1715">And after standing there like a half an hour, one SS told the next one, "You, you know, but let's, let's take this, this group -- we will take them to Niirnberg for work, because we have an order to take the next day." </sentence><sentence id="1716">They had an order to take the next day a group of people to Niimnberg to work in an ammunition factory.

Because nobody was allowed to approach an SS. </sentence><sentence id="1735">In fact, if this would have happened in, in Auschwitz, she would have been automatically killed. </sentence><sentence id="1736">And this is why she -- because she was the whole time, in such a, a depressive mood that she didn't even know what was going on. </sentence><sentence id="1737">Otherwise she would have known, first of all, she would have known not to say that I am sick, because if somebody was sick you were automatically taken out for -- you know, taken to the gas chamber; because sick people were the first ones to be selected. </sentence><sentence id="1738">But we, were just lucky that we, were in the train, and all that she got away with was, was being slapped and the, the whole time I was just like in between life and death on, on that journey. </sentence><sentence id="1739">And, and I can't even know how this happened; but I did arrive -- finally we arrived to, that was near maybe -- we arrived Niirmnberg. </sentence><sentence id="1740">And that was a complete change from -- at least we had, we had a, a room where we had much less people in the room; and we, were only two in, on each bunk was only two. </sentence><sentence id="1741">And we had running water, and we could wash ourselves. </sentence><sentence id="1742">And it, it was a much more human treatment. </sentence><sentence id="1743">And we started to work in this ammunition factory, but naturally we, were starving. </sentence><sentence id="1744">And so we, we, were still deteriorating because of lack of food. </sentence><sentence id="1745">But they were bombing, constantly bombing. </sentence><sentence id="1746">So we, were sometimes as long as three days without food and in a bunker. </sentence><sentence id="1747">And, and they would just feed the SS, but they wouldn't feed us. </sentence><sentence id="1748"> But then one day they took a transport of girls to go into town to bring in bread, and I was the from the lucky ones chosen to, to bring in that bread. </sentence><sentence id="1749">And I decided, and a few other girls --Istole a bread and hid it in, in my coat. </sentence><sentence id="1750">And as I was walking in as, as, so I was walking next to another girl; she said, "If you don't put back the bread, I'll tell on you because..." You know, because she was afraid; because if one did something, everybody was punished. </sentence><sentence id="1751">It wasn't just that girl punished. </sentence><sentence id="1752">I couldn't blame her. </sentence><sentence id="1753">But I told her, "You know what? </sentence><sentence id="1754">I'm the one to take the biggest risk, and I'll share it with you. </sentence><sentence id="1755">So only don't tell on me, and, and I'll, I'll get it in." </sentence><sentence id="1756">And I really got in to, I, I got the bread into the, all the way to the bunker, to the -- but that day was a group of SS who, who took us in, you know, took us in to, town. </sentence><sentence id="1757">They weren't probably so strict; so and when, when we came in, a few other girls stole some bread and all the rest of us saw it. </sentence><sentence id="1758">That was, that was, in fact -- so she told for the -- she was the camp leader, like the camp -- she was also a prisoner but she was a, a Kapo. </sentence><sentence id="1759">But she was a prisoner just, just like us. " </sentence><sentence id="1760">We want you to bring -- we want you should bring back the bread. </sentence><sentence id="1761">You go and see who stole the bread; and we want, we want the bread back." </sentence><sentence id="1762">She did such a good job, not only did she bring back the bread but she brought back the girls who stole the bread. </sentence><sentence id="1763">And I was one, one, one of them. </sentence><sentence id="1764">They, we, were beaten so severely. </sentence><sentence id="1765">I was just, I don't know how I, I survived it. </sentence><sentence id="1766">You know, those long wooden spoons that you that you cook for a whole army. </sentence><sentence id="1767">They -- until she didn't break the spoon. </sentence><sentence id="1768">I, I was, I was beaten with that and then. </sentence><sentence id="1769">and then, and this because that, that I didn't, that, that I survived, that I did not, that I didn't get killed, she said, "okay, go." </sentence><sentence id="1770">And she let me go. </sentence><sentence id="1771">For weeks I could only on my stomach sleep, and I, I walked like a cripple; and I couldn't, and I had to sit and, and still do that, you know, the ammunition work that they took us to that factory. </sentence><sentence id="1772">But then they bombed the, the munitions factory and they bombed and they bombed our whole camp, so we didn't have where to be. </sentence><sentence id="1773">So they took us to Holleischen. </sentence><sentence id="1774">They took everybody to Holleischen; and we arrived in another camp and that was already Sudetengebiet"". </sentence><sentence id="1775">That was, belonged to Czechoslovakia. </sentence><sentence id="1776">And there we started to work in this, also ammunition factory. </sentence><sentence id="1777">but after... </sentence></p></dialogue>

This was, and I was wondering how come we never ate raw potatoes at home. </sentence><sentence id="1893">We missed out on so much good food. </sentence><sentence id="1894">We, we, were...it wasn't, we, weren't normal. </sentence><sentence id="1895">So then -- all right, after that I worked with only rubble. </sentence><sentence id="1896">And then when we, went once another -- it was very close to our liberation -- they, they bombed. </sentence><sentence id="1897">So we, we had to, we all dropped to the to the floor until the bombing was over. </sentence><sentence id="1898">And then when we got up, there was one of our girls dead. </sentence><sentence id="1899">And the shame was because it was only a few days before the liberation; and I didn't see no bleeding, no scratch, nothing. </sentence><sentence id="1900">She looked like she was asleep. </sentence><sentence id="1901">We, we brought her back to, to our camp and to, for to be buried. </sentence><sentence id="1902">And this was the day already that, that the next day they, they locked us in. </sentence><sentence id="1903">They didn't take us out, and we, were most surprised that it's very quiet. </sentence><sentence id="1904">That it didn't, you know, nobody came to, to line us up and to take us out to work. </sentence><sentence id="1905">And we had absolutely no way of knowing what was going on. </sentence><sentence id="1906">We had no idea. </sentence><sentence id="1907">We, we just, we, were very apprehensive; because we felt that something must be going on, because just to let us stay and not getting us, .... just like you say a day's vacation; because they would always take us, even Sundays. </sentence><sentence id="1908">They would say, "You lazy dogs, you get lazy." </sentence><sentence id="1909">So they would take us for any excuse, to...to even if just to take stones from here and, and lo-- and bring them over to the other side. </sentence><sentence id="1910">It was just always a form of, of, punishing us. </sentence><sentence id="1911">So -- and all of a sudden we, we heard, we heard the gate, by the gate, some noise and then they broke open our.... We, were locked, our...our camp was locked from outside with a.... They broke the, the lock, and there were Russian partisans. </sentence><sentence id="1912">And then this was the, the most wonderful day that we, that I could ever remember happening to me. </sentence><sentence id="1913">And, and then we found out from them how this came about, because if they wouldn't liberate us and, and we would have had to wait for the British -- which we did wait for the British because they didn't remain with us; they went to liberate other camps. </sentence><sentence id="1914">And they -- and I will tell it to you so that you would understand it better -- there was one of SS that either wanted to save herself but she was from Czech parents. </sentence><sentence id="1915">She was an SS -- but a Czech, but married to a German. </sentence><sentence id="1916">And for, to how she did it or how this happened that they got, they got they must have -- they got word that we are, this camp -- our Jewish camp in Holleischen, a French  camp and a Polish camp -- all the three camps are going to be burned to the ground that day. </sentence><sentence id="1917">So this is how they came. </sentence><sentence id="1918">They surprised, and the SS were already in the woods. </sentence><sentence id="1919">They weren't even anymore in their headquarters, but they came back for lunch. </sentence><sentence id="1920">They came back for lunch. </sentence><sentence id="1921">They came back for lunch, and they were going to, torch in the evening the, the camp. </sentence><sentence id="1922">And they surprised them while they were having lunch. </sentence><sentence id="1923">They rounded up those SS.You know, some of them rounded up and some came, broke open the, the gates and, and they came. </sentence><sentence id="1924">And then when they brought us out into the open, into the in the front and they showed us that how our camp was surrounded by wooden logs, logs and it was soaked, it was completely soaked in benzene or gasoline. </sentence><sentence id="1925">Just, they all, they were just prepared just to light a match to it and we would have all gone on, gone up in flame. </sentence><sentence id="1926">So what they did is being that they had to go and many other places, you know, to liberate. </sentence><sentence id="1927">So they told us -- because we, were we, were screaming they shouldn't leave us, they, they should stay with us. </sentence><sentence id="1928">They broke open all the food, the stor-- storage food where they had all, you know, from the SS. </sentence><sentence id="1929">Everybody was running to get bread. </sentence><sentence id="1930">I was running -- I it was such a fixation in my mind that I ran to the -- to the potato fields, and I was digging potatoes. </sentence><sentence id="1931">I was digging potatoes to no end. </sentence><sentence id="1932">My sister, at least, was smart enough to run -- and she thought that I that I was also running with, with them -- for the bread; but when she came, when she didn't see me she had at least a bread and, and a salami. </sentence><sentence id="1933">She, she started to look for me. </sentence><sentence id="1934">She didn't see me. </sentence><sentence id="1935">She came back to the field, and there I am staying; I have loads of potatoes. </sentence><sentence id="1936">I said, "Mina, because we will never starve again. </sentence><sentence id="1937">Look at all the potatoes that I am...." She said, "Look, we don't need potatoes for there is -- people are, are having bread and salami." </sentence><sentence id="1938">I said, I said, "I don't move from here if you if you don't help me bring in all those potatoes." </sentence><sentence id="1939">She had to, she had to help me bring in those potatoes; because I, I would not move from those potatoes. </sentence><sentence id="1940">This is what -- because this was -- I have experienced this incident that these girls are beaten to death, and what happened to me when that I have the strength that this is all I could think of at the time. </sentence><sentence id="1941">But anyway, we buried that, that girl that day, you know. </sentence><sentence id="1942">And, and then we, we had to wait for the British to come. </sentence><sentence id="1943">And so they gave rifles to the French men that they should stand guard, because the French was a man's camp. </sentence><sentence id="1944">So they were standing guard, guarding us until the until the British arrived; because they were afraid there could be a pocket of Nazis somewheres and, and come back and still kill us. </sentence><sentence id="1945">And then when the British arrived and they already opened up, you know, we had to be quarantined for weeks. </sentence><sentence id="1946">And we, were in terrible shape anyway and we had to learn even how to lead again a normal life. </sentence><sentence id="1947">I mean, we, we, we could not, we at that time we could not be trusted with anything because our whole mind was, was completely.... You could be the finest and most law-abiding citizen before, but our whole, our, our whole that we experienced, we, were not human. </sentence><sentence id="1948">We, we could not remain human. </sentence><sentence id="1949">It took a long time for us to become human again. </sentence><sentence id="1950">Because, for instance -- | will give you an example -- because this is just really for history to know -- that  the, they set up a kitchen, and, and they asked us all very nicely and, "We will give you food that you can that you should eat that we give you, because your health is -- if not you're not, you're not going to survive. </sentence><sentence id="1951">You must eat only what we give you." </sentence><sentence id="1952">After we, we ate, and they gave a plate or, or a bowl or whatever -- we would take that bowl. </sentence><sentence id="1953">We would try to smuggle out that bowl; because our intention was not to go and, and try and find food. </sentence><sentence id="1954">It wasn't, you know, we couldn't, couldn't imagine that this is now this normal life. </sentence><sentence id="1955">You are going to come back. </sentence><sentence id="1956">And they, they would reason with us: "Look," they said, "you're coming back. </sentence><sentence id="1957">This is not the only meal you're getting. </sentence><sentence id="1958">You're...." They had to talk to us like little bit stupid children, you know? " </sentence><sentence id="1959">You're coming back here." </sentence><sentence id="1960">But we still couldn't trust. </sentence><sentence id="1961">We couldn't trust nobody. </sentence><sentence id="1962">Even for our friends, we couldn't trust; we didn't trust nobody. </sentence><sentence id="1963">So they had to station themselves, because if, if we take away the bowls they don't have them back to serve us the, the next day. </sentence><sentence id="1964">They had to station, they had to station two people and, and take away from each one back, back the bowls, that we wouldn't walk out with all the, the bowls. </sentence><sentence id="1965">And, and, and even af-- and even after that, here I am already liberated and we, were there quite a few weeks until we, were allowed to travel. </sentence><sentence id="1966">So my destination was to go to Budapest and see who remains, that if somebody remains alive. </sentence><sentence id="1967">Against all odds, I still -- you know, until you are not hundred percent sure, somehow you think some miracle happened and, and even maybe some just cousins remained alive. </sentence><sentence id="1968">So we, were traveling in a -- so we didn't need any store. </sentence><sentence id="1969">We didn't have any, any money or any currency; but we, we just had a certain pass, and we, we got some, some money from the British. </sentence><sentence id="1970">And -- but we could travel all over with, without any money. </sentence><sentence id="1971">And so they took us already to the train; and, and we take a -- and Pearls and I took the train, and I'm on my way to Budapest. </sentence><sentence id="1972">But in Prague, there was a, a directorate was giving out sandwiches, was sending out sandwiches. </sentence><sentence id="1973">And so I went down to get a sandwich, and somebody recognized me -- that I am this and this, fiance. </sentence><sentence id="1974">Because I meantime got engaged while I was in Budapest; and so he tells me that, that -- whether I know that Joe is alive. </sentence><sentence id="1975">Joe was my fiance, who, who became right away, very shortly, my husband. </sentence><sentence id="1976">I said, "No." </sentence><sentence id="1977">She said, "All right." </sentence><sentence id="1978">She said, "He's here. </sentence><sentence id="1979">He's also in --" you know, it was like a rehabilitation, "you will be rehabilitating. </sentence><sentence id="1980">But it was a beautiful place. </sentence><sentence id="1981">They gave you the best food, and to gather yourself; and, and he will take me. </sentence><sentence id="1982">So I run in to my sister and I tell her, "You come with me, because Joe is here. </sentence><sentence id="1983">And, and we are going, we are not going to Budapest yet, we are going first, first to, to Prague." </sentence><sentence id="1984">And we come there; and, and there as he was taking my name, it's, it's was a colleague of my brother who was, who was -- oh, he was so happy; and he asked me about my brother, and tell me he's in Palestine. </sentence><sentence id="1985">So he told us that we can stay as long as we want in this in that Charita was the name.... </sentence></p></dialogue>
