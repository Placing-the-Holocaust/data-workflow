August...and October Ist, I believe it was Rosh Hashanah, they had been in to pick up the...all the files from the Jewish... uh...community. </sentence><sentence id="185">They had all the names, all the addresses of everyone in Copenhagen, which was about 6,000 Jews and they had.... They knew where they lived, what they did, their business. </sentence><sentence id="186">They had everything. </sentence><sentence id="187">And we were informed in the synagogue on Rosh Hashanah, the first day of Rosh Hashanah, we were informed that nobody should go home because the Germans are going to round you up the night between the Ist and the 2nd of October. </sentence><sentence id="188">And those who believed it, which most of the people did, we were all scared. </sentence><sentence id="189">They...uh...didn't go home. </sentence><sentence id="190">We all had made arrangements with some non-Jews, some Danish where we could stay or where to sleep. </sentence><sentence id="191">Those who didn't believe it. </sentence><sentence id="192">They were taken, which was a very small percentage anyhow. </sentence><sentence id="193">And they all came back after the war. </sentence><sentence id="194">So we went to our grocer who was a bachelor and he said, "Come to my house and I'll take care of you." </sentence><sentence id="195">So after the synagogue, we went to him and he bought us, or he had in his store bread and butter and cheese and milk and eggs, whatever we needed. </sentence><sentence id="196">He took care of us for a week til we found a connection how to get out of the country. </sentence><sentence id="197">Copenhagen is on the seashore and we went up to Snekkersten, same place and where most of them went from. </sentence><sentence id="198">Everybody went to Sweden from there because it's the narrowest point between Denmark and Sweden. </sentence><sentence id="199">It's like three, four miles wide. </sentence><sentence id="200">That's the whole thing...the waterway. </sentence><sentence id="201">But it is very heavy stream there. </sentence><sentence id="202">It's a very heavy...uh... waterway. </sentence><sentence id="203">So we stayed in his house and.... </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="234">Q: In whose.... Excuse me. </sentence><sentence id="235">How...first of all, how did you get to Snekkersten? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="238">A: How did we get there? </sentence><sentence id="239">Well, he called up every day. </sentence><sentence id="240">He called up somebody that he knew from the resistance movement and he didn't say...we went with...I went with my parents and my two brothers and a sister. </sentence><sentence id="241">We were six people altogether. </sentence><sentence id="242">And he wouldn't say that he has some people to send. </sentence><sentence id="243">He didn't know if this telephone was...uh...what do you call it? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="250">Q: Tapped? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="252">A: Tapped! </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="254">Q: This is your grocer calling? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="256">A: Yes. </sentence><sentence id="257">So he called up. </sentence><sentence id="258">He said, "I have six tons of potatoes. </sentence><sentence id="259">Could you come and pick them up?" " </sentence><sentence id="260">Til he finally got a connection. </sentence><sentence id="261">And uh...it took us about a week, until the day before Yom Kippur. </sentence><sentence id="262">And then we got a taxi; and the taxi took us up to that place up in Snekkersten,  where everybody had been collected, so to speak. </sentence><sentence id="263">All the people were there. </sentence><sentence id="264">There were two or three hundred people there everyday, four hundred people maybe in somebody's home, in a basement. </sentence><sentence id="265">And I remember as a child that...uh...we were covered up in the taxi with...uh...a blanket in case the police would stop and say, "What's wrong? </sentence><sentence id="266">What do you have in there?" </sentence><sentence id="267">He would say, "I have a sick person. </sentence><sentence id="268">Just close the door. </sentence><sentence id="269">I have to go to the hospital." </sentence><sentence id="270">So we were covered up and he went up there. </sentence><sentence id="271">It's not more than 30, 40 minute ride by taxi. </sentence><sentence id="272">We went up there. </sentence><sentence id="273">We came to that house. </sentence><sentence id="274">And...uh...we met somebody from the resistance movement who took us down to the pier at night, and we came down there and we were told that the boat we were supposed to go with had been taken by somebody else who paid more money for it. </sentence><sentence id="275">He paid a big sum of money, so he took this man out by himself...the fishing boat. </sentence><sentence id="276">So we had to wait til the next day and...uh...the next day, luckily for us it had been organized this way that the resistance movement had a big schooner-like; and they took two or three hundred people aboard. </sentence><sentence id="277">We went all down...down below deck, and uh...we went out there by row boats. </sentence><sentence id="278">It wasn't far out to the ship and when they had all the people there, first we paid them money. </sentence><sentence id="279">We paid like 2,000 krone a person. </sentence><sentence id="280">That was the going rate. </sentence><sentence id="281">Which was a lot of money at that time; but we were told if you come to Sweden the money is worthless. </sentence><sentence id="282">You can't do anything with it. </sentence><sentence id="283">You might as well leave it here, number 1, and number 2, whatever money you give now will help those people who are poor or sick and can't afford it. </sentence><sentence id="284">They will also get out. </sentence><sentence id="285">Everybody got out, whether they had money or not. </sentence><sentence id="286">They were all helped to get out. </sentence><sentence id="287">And we got aboard that ship and, uh... we got off. </sentence><sentence id="288">We sailed also...uh...for an hour or so at midnight and in the middle of the ocean we had this big Swedish torpedo boat or gunboat coming towards us. </sentence><sentence id="289">We all thought it was the Germans, but it was the Swedish boat. </sentence><sentence id="290">They had the same kind of uniforms and they helped us all off, on the Swedish ship. </sentence><sentence id="291">We got aboard the Swedish ship and they gave us coffee and candy or whatever, and then we went into Sweden. </sentence><sentence id="292">And we were saved. ( </sentence><sentence id="293">cough) So when we arrived in Sweden, we were all listed by names. </sentence><sentence id="294">They wanted to know who is coming and here that they didn't have any German helpers or whoever. </sentence><sentence id="295">We were all listed by name and address and age and so on. </sentence><sentence id="296">And we came there on the night of Yom Kippur or the day before Yom Kippur, which was very unpleasant for us. </sentence><sentence id="297">We got food. </sentence><sentence id="298">We got clothing. </sentence><sentence id="299">We had nothing along except what we wore. </sentence><sentence id="300">We had no...we had nothing along with us. </sentence><sentence id="301">Just what we had on! </sentence><sentence id="302">And...uh...[ remember that we went to...we were in a camp, a big camp that was guarded by the Swedish soldiers, and we could go freely. </sentence><sentence id="303">We could go in and out the way we wanted. </sentence><sentence id="304">We wanted, of course, my father wanted to go to the synagogue--which was like 10, 12 miles away. </sentence><sentence id="305">And we all walked in there, on Yom Kippur morning, into Halsingborg. </sentence><sentence id="306">We walked in there to synagogue and we.... </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="358">Q: You walked 12 miles just to go to synagogue? </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="359">A: Yes. </sentence><sentence id="360">And we attended the services, a full day of services, without food. </sentence><sentence id="361">And uh...in the middle of the afternoon, a girl came in with a bus, a big bus; and they interrupted the services. </sentence><sentence id="362">And they said that all the people from Denmark, all the refugees who are here in the synagogue, should immediately come out to the bus and go back to camp. </sentence><sentence id="363">They had left the camp and we should go back. </sentence><sentence id="364">So my father said, "Now that we have been saved from the Germans, we are not going to go on a bus on Yom Kippur." </sentence><sentence id="365">We were not used to that. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="373">(Laughing) So we waited until after the services were over at night, and then somebody took us home from the synagogue. </sentence><sentence id="374">Somebody drove us back to the camp. </sentence><sentence id="375">And when we came back to camp, we were told, "You have to leave tonight. </sentence><sentence id="376">Because you didn't come back with the girl that was sent with the bus, so you have to leave tonight." </sentence><sentence id="377">And uh...we had no money or anything. </sentence><sentence id="378">So we went to the railroad station; and somebody bought us the tickets to Malme, where my father had a cousin. </sentence><sentence id="379">So we came there in the middle of the night, 2 or 3 o'clock in the morning. </sentence><sentence id="380">But we were very lucky. </sentence><sentence id="381">We were saved. </sentence><sentence id="382">We were happy. </sentence><sentence id="383">And uh...then we got an apartment there eventually. </sentence><sentence id="384">Little by little, my parents started a restaurant. </sentence><sentence id="385">On the card I gave you, you can see that from that time. </sentence><sentence id="386">My parents started a restaurant, because my mother felt if she makes food for other people--she was a very good cook--then there'll be enough for us to eat, also. </sentence><sentence id="387">And we all got jobs for October, November, December; and in January, the school opened...a Danish school for the...for the refugees-- children, or so to speak. </sentence><sentence id="388">And we went to school there where we had left it off in Denmark and continued in Sweden. </sentence><sentence id="389">We...it was in Lund. </sentence><sentence id="390">We went there by train every day, which was a 20, 25-minute train ride and we got the train...the, uh, tickets from the government, and we got pocket money. </sentence><sentence id="391">Each one got pocket money; and on Sunday, in order to make something extra for us, or to help our parents, we made...I remember that I delivered flowers. </sentence><sentence id="392">I worked in a flower shop, and delivered flowers as a boy. </sentence><sentence id="393">I was 15 years old, so I made extra money that way. </sentence><sentence id="394">And we were very happy there. </sentence><sentence id="395">We had all the goodies that we didn't have in Denmark. </sentence><sentence id="396">They didn't have bananas and oranges and chocolate and chewing gum. </sentence><sentence id="397">We didn't have in Denmark anymore at that time, so we could buy that in Sweden. </sentence><sentence id="398">Not that it was so important, but, uh...there was plenty of everything. </sentence><sentence id="399">Sweden was neutral, and they kept on importing whatever you wanted. </sentence><sentence id="400">They had everything. </sentence><sentence id="401">And that's actually what happened to us in Sweden. </sentence><sentence id="402">We were there for...we were there for close to two years, "til May "45. </sentence><sentence id="403">Everybody went back to Denmark. </sentence><sentence id="404">We were very happy. </sentence><sentence id="405">On May 4th, when we [were] told that the Germans gave up in Denmark and Norway, Holland, Belgium...uh, we went back....
