<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="84">A: Well, it's interesting that you ask that, because it's now that I'm finding out, through some of the work that I have done for the -- for the Holocaust Museum, about my parent's backgrounds, and very slowly I -- I have found out, that especially in my father's family, they were very prominent. </sentence><sentence id="85">Both, I think, in financially, but also as leaders of a community. </sentence><sentence id="86">My great-grandfather, Solomon, was one of the first 13 signatures in 1864 to open Alliance-Frangaise schools in Monastir. </sentence><sentence id="87">My grandfather Isaac, whose name I bear, which was another tradition in Sephardic homes, was a president of the Jewish community of Monastir. </sentence><sentence id="88">And my Uncle Solomon, who was my father's eldest brother, was president of the Joint Distribution Committee. </sentence><sentence id="89">So, apparently they must have been a very prominent family. </sentence><sentence id="90">My grandfather -- and I still remember a letterhead, it was in several languages, but the one that I remember was in French, fournisseur de l'armee This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="91">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="92"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection turque. </sentence><sentence id="93">And we see he used to s -- to sell goods to the Turkish army. </sentence><sentence id="94">Grain, and other material, not -- not weapons, but -- so they had been in that business for a long time. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="108">Q: So wha -- it's -- i -- why did it take you so long to find out, did your father not tell you about the history of the family, or -- </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="110">A: He -- you see, you have to remember, | think in Europe generally, avi was something peculiar to my family, parents don't exchange a lot of confidences when you're young. </sentence><sentence id="111">Things immediately change, magically, when you reach manhood, or adulthood in -- in Europe. </sentence><sentence id="112">And then you become a friend, and things then open up. </sentence><sentence id="113">You see, I left Greece when I was 19, to come to study in United States, so I didn't have the opportunity to engage my father in reminiscences, so my brother -- younger brother, who stayed with my father until my father's death in Greece, he knows much more sometimes, about stories that my father told him, than I had an opportunity to do -- to do. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="118">Q: So tell me what sort of a person your father was as a father to you. </sentence><sentence id="119">Wer -- were -- did you -- would you have considered yourself close, prior to the war? </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="140">Q: Mm-hm. </sentence><sentence id="141">And -- and would you say that as a child you felt close t -- though they weren't sharing information with you -- </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="146">Q: -- were you able to come to them with difficulties, or -- or were -- would you talk to your friends about those kinds of things? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="148">A: No, I would -- up to a certain point, then ev -- eventually I would have to learn to talk to my -- my parents, but I would talk to my mother, because I lived all day long with -- with her, and it was almost a natural thing for me, the first person to think of telling her about something. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="150">Q: And it would be her. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="160">Q: Did you go -- y -- s -- when we wer -- drove here in the car, you talked about taking your kids for a walk. </sentence><sentence id="161">Did your father and mother go for walks with you, and -- and do things with you? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="164">A: My father did not, because -- as I mentioned before, because of his lameness. </sentence><sentence id="165">My mother took me about four or five blocks away from -- from the house where we -- I grew up. </sentence><sentence id="166">There was a little park, and then she would take us, I'm sure when I was very young. </sentence><sentence id="167">Later on, when I reached the age of 10, I then started taking my younger brother on walks. </sentence><sentence id="168">Another thing that I remember we did very frequently was -- as I said, my maternal grandmother visited us twice a week, she lived with a -- an aunt. </sentence><sentence id="169">And it was really for an able person, it was let's say, a 15 minute walk. </sentence><sentence id="170">But for my grandmother, it turn out to be maybe a half an hour, or a little bit more, because she was older, and she would have to rest from time to time. </sentence><sentence id="171">And the little park was on the way, so we're -- I would go to the keropper, and we would eventually reach the park, sit at the bench, let her rest. </sentence><sentence id="172">And my mother would come sometimes together. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="182">Q: When di -- because I didn't know this, when -- when did you start violin lessons? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="184">A: Oh, I started violin lessons when I was eight or nine years old, maybe 10. </sentence><sentence id="185">But I started school when I was four, the reason being that that was when my second brother was born, Samuel. </sentence><sentence id="186">And I don't know, perhaps I was too much, and my mother needed to have free time to care for my brother. </sentence><sentence id="187">She knew the teacher in the Jewish school, which was around the corner from my house. </sentence><sentence id="188">So she asked her if sh -- I could go there for a few hours, just sort of to be kept, and not to interfere with the house affairs. </sentence><sentence id="189">But apparently I must have picked up, because there from then on, I continued, and I went to -- to school. </sentence><sentence id="190">But I think usually at the end of a school year, then my actual age would be apparent to the teachers. </sentence><sentence id="191">So the first six years of primary school -- at the time I went to school it was six years primary, six years high school, or gimnasium. </sentence><sentence id="192">For the first seven years of sc -- of schooling, I changed school every year, because -- for the reason I mentioned before, they would find out from my behavior I was a lot younger than -- than my grade, and they would wo -- washme -- wanted me to -- to remain for another year in the same grade, but of course, my parents did not want to do that, and I continued. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="202">Q: And your violin came in the midst of this? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="204">A: The violin came -- yes, I started with a -- a private teacher, who lived a few blocks from my house, for about a year. </sentence><sentence id="205">And then my parents decided that I ought to go to the conservatory, and I had to give an audition, and I was then admitted, and I started studying. </sentence><sentence id="206">I have -- I have to change, because now I remember, | started in 1939, so I was about 13 then. </sentence><sentence id="207">The reason I'm saying that now, in recollection, was because I was at the conservatory for two years -- two and a half years, and then after the -- the occupation, after the war, it closed. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="212">Q: Uh-huh. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="219">Q: So you were very good to go to conservatory, no? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="221">A: Well, but for only a year, year and a half, I didn't reach any exalted levels. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="223">Q: Did you love it? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="225">A: At that time I did. </sentence><sentence id="226">The violin is a very hard instrument, and to -- to -- to make it make a pleasant sound, it -- the technique in itself is very hard. </sentence><sentence id="227">I had a boyhood -- childhood friend, two years older than I, Saby Shabetai, he lived in the apartment above ours. </sentence><sentence id="228">And when I would eg -- do exercises, then the windows were open, and then from time to time he would shout and tell me to stop that horrible sound. </sentence><sentence id="229">But I -- I persevered, but the war put an end to that. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="235">Q: Right, right. </sentence><sentence id="236">And you have two brothers, Samuel, who was born in 1930, I believe? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="239">A: In 1930, yes. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="241">Q: And -- </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="245">Q: Right. </sentence><sentence id="246">Tell me a little bit about Samuel. </sentence><sentence id="247">Was this hard for you, when the second brother -- you were four -- you were four years old when he -- </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="251">A: It wasn't hard -- </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="253">Q: [indecipherable] </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="255">A: -- but I think it's -- I can see it in my own children and grandchildren, that the four age difference, for the first 10 - 15 years, is almost an -- an unbridgeable gap. </sentence><sentence id="256">You have different friends. </sentence><sentence id="257">I -- I -- I didn't have, I ca -- as I recall, any problems with my younger brother, but I wasn't really that close to him. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="261">Q: Mm-hm. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="263">A: But in contrast, with the youngest brother -- let me call him Meko, because that's how we -- we called him, from the diminutive Nehameko, I was much closer to him. </sentence><sentence id="264">I was sort of his protector. </sentence><sentence id="265">I would take him for walks to the park. </sentence><sentence id="266">I would sometimes supervise the first lessons that he had in going to school. </sentence><sentence id="267">And this is how we were growing up. </sentence><sentence id="268">I'm -- I'm sure that a little bit later on, if -- if things had not happened w-what actually happened, I would have been friendly with all of them. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="275">Q: All of them. </sentence><sentence id="276">How do you account for being so close, or wanting to do things with the littlest one, and not with the one [indecipherable] </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="286">Q: Right. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="288">A: -- to protect him. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="290">Q: Yes. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="292">A: It was just a -- a role I -- | -- I fell into naturally. </sentence><sentence id="293">I don't think I was asked to do it. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="296">Q: Was yours a religious household? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="298">A: We were observant in all the Jewish traditions, I'm talking the Sabbath, and of course, all the holidays. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="300">Q: So you observed the Sabbath? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="302">A: Yes, I think at the age of five and on, my Friday chore, before the actual Sabbath started, was to deliver a bottle of olive oil to the synagogue, because in Sephardic synagogues, there are no candles. </sentence><sentence id="303">Everything is in glass containers with olive oil and wicks that burn. </sentence><sentence id="304">And the thing that you do is to keep the synagogue supplied with oil. </sentence><sentence id="305">And since it was so near my house, then I would be asked to deliver a -- a bottle of oil. </sentence><sentence id="306">Also, my memories, both of the Sabbath, and -- and -- and the major holidays, they are visual, oral, and olfactory, because Friday afternoon, before the onset of Sabbath, when the dining room and the living room were closed, the floors were waxed, and I still remember the -- the wax smell, which wa-was indicative of the preparations for the Sabbath. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="312">Q: And do you remember the smell of food, specific food? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="314">A: A little bit at times. </sentence><sentence id="315">I have more visual memory of the dishes that my mother cooked. </sentence><sentence id="316">Some of them were, at least visually, very attractive. </sentence><sentence id="317">And I also le -- remember at times when she would do a number of desserts that required the rolling of dough to a very thin layer, which today you can buy at the store, it's called phylo -- phylo, which is a Greek word. </sentence><sentence id="318">But in those days, she did it, and if you don't -- you cannot roll it, you roll it up to a certain point, and then I remember she wore a sleeveless dress, and would powder her arms with flour, and then get under the dough and begin to pull it from every corner. </sentence><sentence id="319">And you have to be very careful. </sentence><sentence id="320">Very often it would break, and there's nothing you can do. </sentence><sentence id="321">You would have to start all over again. </sentence><sentence id="322">So I remember these things. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="332">Q: Now, in the Sephardic tradition, are there particular kinds of Jewish dishes within that tradition? </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="345">Q: Oh. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="347">A: Yes, it was -- first of all, you wanted to avoid having butter, in case inadvertently you used it with a -- a meat dish. </sentence><sentence id="348">But it was partly that, partly that both in Greece, and in where she was born, there is not much dairy. </sentence><sentence id="349">At least -- Greece is not a country with lots of dairy land to grow cattle to produce dairy products. </sentence><sentence id="350">Ev-Everybody cooks with olive oil. </sentence><sentence id="351">So there's a tremendous similarity. </sentence><sentence id="352">So, the -- the infusion is p-partly Mediterranean, partly Turkish, partly Greek cuisine, but I think in -- in my mother's case, there are some remnants of dishes that hark back, I think, from the 14" or 15" century in Spain, because they were descendants of the Sephardic Jews who were expelled from Spain. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="359">Q: You were -- were you going to synagogue on a regular basis, or more -- </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="641">A: I think my earliest recollection, which I date my becoming politically aware, is 1936, with the onset of this Spanish Civil War. </sentence><sentence id="642">I think the reason being primarily that it was written up in the newspapers. </sentence><sentence id="643">My mother and father, in particular my mother -- and I really do not know why. </sentence><sentence id="644">I try sometimes to understand why, because obviously I didn't have conversations with her about things like that. </sentence><sentence id="645">But she was very interested in politics, and I know she read, and she discussed things with my father. </sentence><sentence id="646">So I would then read the articles also. </sentence><sentence id="647">So I began to become very sensitive about the situation in Europe. </sentence><sentence id="648">Then, in deg37 or deg38, the interest broadened primarily because in -- in the synagogue, during for instance the break in the entire day of Yom Kippur, after the morning prayers, we wouldn't even go home, although it was around the corner, we would stay in the yard. </sentence><sentence id="649">And we began to see for the first time, people who -- who had never seen before. </sentence><sentence id="650">And these were Ashkenazi -- Jewish people from Czechoslovakia, or Germany, who had found refuge in -- in Greece, in escaping the na -- so one couldn't help being sensitive to this, primarily because my parents talk about it, even when na -- friends came to visit, and we could overhear their conversation. </sentence><sentence id="651">It -- it's went around, things like this. </sentence><sentence id="652">So I -- I - - I can -- I can date my awareness. </sentence><sentence id="653">I don't -- and also I had begun to be very interested in -- in history. </sentence><sentence id="654">I always loved history, I -- I read history books for children from an early age, including myths, and mythology. </sentence><sentence id="655">Excuse me. </sentence><sentence id="656">So I was aw-aware from the middle 30's. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="675">A: I think we would talk a little bit primarily about following the headlines. </sentence><sentence id="676">Re-Remember there were stories which went in is -- Spanish Civil War, then I remember stories of bombardments by German planes, and we would ask, what -- what -- what are Germans doing in -- in Spain? </sentence><sentence id="677">But of course, now one knows that there was a contingent of a -- a -- it became almost a proving ground for many of their -- their -- their weapons. </sentence><sentence id="678">Or the Italians, you know, also the same thing. </sentence><sentence id="679">By contrast, although the French and the British were neutral, and in fact at times m-made terrible obstacles to try to help the -- the loyalists, you have to remember that because of -- of speaking French, I have to say that we were a very Francophile family, so I -- I had read French history. </sentence><sentence id="680">My father, after the war, had bought a book about the second World War that was illustrated with photographs, and I remember spending endless hours leafing through the book, looking at photographs of the French generals, French soldiers, battle scenes, plus also the text. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="857">Q: So in "41 and 42, does your life change very much, or is there a kind of -- once the occupation starts, does it settle down? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="859">A: Well, it changed in many respects, but I -- I continue with school, I f -- I finish high school in -- in ? </sentence><sentence id="860">42. </sentence><sentence id="861">The winter of "41 to "42, which was the first winter under occupation, turn out to be the most terrible winter of the occupation from the standpoint of famine. </sentence><sentence id="862">For the first time, you know, we had begun to see weak people who had fallen in the middle of the street, and gradually even some of them who were left there, and some of them dead. </sentence><sentence id="863">So it was a very, very -- and it -- it -- be -- coincidentally also, Athens, generally, had mild winters. </sentence><sentence id="864">I remember only once in my entire childhood remembering snow. </sentence><sentence id="865">Snow, it was only something that you read in books. </sentence><sentence id="866">And we woke up one day and the roofs were a little white. </sentence><sentence id="867">And some of us went immediately to try to make a snowman, but the moment we reached the street, the snow had melted. </sentence><sentence id="868">There wasn't very much left. </sentence><sentence id="869">But that was a very rough winter, it was very, very cold. </sentence><sentence id="870">There was no heating, lack of food. </sentence><sentence

id="874">But in -- in -- in short, it was a terrible winter, but then things begun to be better. </sentence><sentence id="875">We did not suffer very much in our family, because -- although we didn't get the kinds of foods that we were used to. </sentence><sentence id="876">Then I remember being sent by my mother to stand in -- on queues, in lines, to buy a piece of feta, a piece of cheese. </sentence><sentence id="877">And sometimes we would stand on line for hours only to -- to reach the door practically, and then be told that there's no more |-left. </sentence><sentence id="878">So we spent a great deal of time like that. </sentence><sentence id="879">But I was not directly affected with it in school. </sentence><sentence id="880">We had to be very careful, I -- we were advised and admonished by our teachers not to make any politically overt statements in class, for obvious reasons. </sentence><sentence id="881">But ho -- yor -- y-you knew that you were not entirely free to say what you wanted to, and you had to be very, very careful. </sentence><sentence id="882">There was no curfew in Athens because at least at that time it would have been almost impossible to enforce. </sentence><sentence id="883">A -- as soon as I finish hi -- high school in "42, normally I would have then taken the exams to get into the Polytechnic Institute, but it was closed. </sentence><sentence id="884">The university was closed. </sentence><sentence id="885">So I then, until the beginning of the Jewish persecution in Athens, I worked for slightly over a year for a man who was in -- during the occupation there was a clan-clan-clandestine stock exchange. </sentence><sentence id="886">We're not talking about stocks, or bonds, or -- the only means of transaction, the only thing that was transacted was gold. </sentence><sentence id="887">Gold coins, English sovereigns, French gold francs, Swedish francs, and occasionally bars, small bars of gold. </sentence><sentence id="888">And this market was obviously entirely underground, because it was under penalty of death if you were caught with gold. </sentence><sentence id="889">The way the market was done, it was strictly over the telephone. </sentence><sentence id="890">Somebody would call and -- in the morning and say, "I have 10 -- 10 liras," they used to be called collectively, "to sell, what is the asking price?" </sentence><sentence id="891">And this market would fluctuate entirely on what would happen in the international news. </sentence><sentence id="892">If the Germans were winning, then the Greek drachma would lose even more of it's value. </sentence><sentence id="893">We talk about, by that time, a million drachmas, you know, it was -- millions was just like to buy some candy. </sentence><sentence id="894">If the allies were winning, on the contrary, then the drachma would rise, because you know, naturally people thought that with the allied side winning, then the days of liberation for Greece would come, and therefore the drachma would gain, you know, gain value. </sentence><sentence id="895">So that's what I did. </sentence><sentence id="896">I mean, I would then -- my -- my -- my -- the -- the man I worked for would be the middle man. </sentence><sentence id="897">He would then sell -- get a buyer, get a seller. </sentence><sentence id="898">And then I would then have to from time to time, deliver the goods, which were rolls, maybe of 10 silver coins, and I would deliver them to the -- go pick them up, and -- and deliver them. </sentence><sentence id="899">And it was, you know, it was a dangerous thing, because if I was fa -- fa -- if I were found out, then it would have been terrible. </sentence><sentence id="900">But I was not found out. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1553">A: Ransom had to be paid. </sentence><sentence id="1554">Then the deportation occurred, and actually, this was written up in the papers, because the then archbishop of Greece wrote a -- a -- a letter to the Greek prime minister, the -- the collaboration government, protesting the -- this treatment of the Jews of Salonika. </sentence><sentence id="1555">And very well known, he was threatened to be shot by the German general occupying Greece at that time, and there's a equally famous reply that he made, and he said, "General Stroop, Greek -- Greek clergy are hanged, are not shot. </sentence><sentence id="1556">Please observe this tradition." </sentence><sentence id="1557">So, information was available. </sentence><sentence id="1558">Finally, I -- I -- I have to tell you -- which I have now pieced together subsequently, is my father's niece, the daughter of his sister, and her husband had escaped the last minute from Monastir, went to Salonika because they had family there, but they were told they were crazy to come to Salonika, because it was under German occupation. </sentence><sentence id="1559">Go to Athens. </sentence><sentence id="1560">So they came to Athens, I imagine around May of deg43. </sentence><sentence id="1561">Italian -- I mean, that's still under the Italian occupation. </sentence><sentence id="1562">And I'm sure that from Allegra -- that was my cousin's name, Allegra Russo, and her husband, they were told whatever they know, because they had seen these things first hand, I mean, the treatment of the Macedonian Jews of Bitola, it was unspeakable from the first minute of the occupation. </sentence><sentence id="1563">So they knew. </sentence></p></dialogue>

the -- the third or fourth village, it was just, I think, after Christmas of "43, maybe December 28 or 29. </sentence><sentence id="2764">We got to this village, and -- although the sa -- the story was the same tomorrow, but they didn't put us up in a house in that -- in that village. </sentence><sentence id="2765">Instead they guided us something like close to a half an hour walk from the village. </sentence><sentence id="2766">And in the middle of nowhere there was a little barn, and it was two stories. </sentence><sentence id="2767">And in the lower part was a tethered donkey, and the upper was just a -- a room, but it had a fireplace. </sentence><sentence id="2768">So he says, "This is where you're going to -- to stay for your -- during your stay." </sentence><sentence id="2769">All right. </sentence><sentence id="2770">So that's where we slept the first night. </sentence><sentence id="2771">When we got up the following morning, it had begun to snow incessantly, which continued for a week. </sentence><sentence id="2772">Now, very quickly we were totally snowbound. </sentence><sentence id="2773">Fortunately -- I mean, the way we survived is once a day, around midday or so, a poor, elderly woman from the village would trudge all that distance, with a sack of roughly ground corn flour. </sentence><sentence id="2774">And that's our subsistence, we would take the corn flour and melt some snow, knead it into some kind of a dough, and pat it to a semblance of a bread, and then we would burn it on the fireplace. </sentence><sentence id="2775">That's what we ate. </sentence><sentence id="2776">Now, the -- I think the second week, she brought us an egg. </sentence><sentence id="2777">And we were, of course, you know, we haven't seen anything like this, and we were overjoyed, but very quickly we decided that it would be -- to divide it into three -- I mean, we would not even feel it in our mouths. </sentence><sentence id="2778">So we decided to keep it as a symbol of our eventual deliverance, both from the snow outside of that [indecipherable] the mission as well as the war, because -- and then I continue, very quickly, I mean we used the egg to play games with the mice. </sentence><sentence id="2779">The mice would come out at night, because it was the gallery of all the [indecipherable]. </sentence><sentence id="2780">And we had not thought, we had left the egg someplace, and then in the glow of -- still of the fire -- we used to go out and gather branches, and burn them. </sentence><sentence id="2781">We saw how mice steal the egg. </sentence><sentence id="2782">One mouse takes it in it's paws, and sort of -- and the others drag it by the tail. </sentence><sentence id="2783">So we discovered the game, so we used to take the egg, and have bets made, and races. </sentence><sentence id="2784">We would leave it like this, and then we see the mouse come, and we say -- the bet was how fast he will get to the hole, of course, by the time he reached the hole, we grab the egg again, and -- so that's the way -- and that's how I began to learn Italian because spending all day long, we used to sing Italian songs. </sentence><sentence id="2785">And I clearly remember the first day that -- when the s-snow ended, it was the kind of a thing that you know when the snow clears, and the -- the sky is completely s -- cloud free, and bright, blinding brightness because of the white, and we heard that drone of aircraft, which was an incredible sound. </sentence><sentence id="2786">And we look up, and we see huge formations of bombers, which we di -- concluded couldn't be anything but allied, because the Germans didn't have very much of an air force. </sentence><sentence id="2787">And -- and -- and -- and I think in retrospect, because we -- I know I can tell you, I can -- the direction which they were flying, namely northeast, they probably were coming from Italy to bomb the oil fields in Ploesti in Romania. </sentence><sentence id="2788">So, you know, we could almost -- the kind of a thing that we all three of us looked up, and -- and sort of begged that the day will come for us very quickly. </sentence><sentence id="2789">So, after -- after the second week there, we, you know, concluded that we were not going to get anywhere, especially now since the ground was covered with snow, even if things had changed, the attitude had changed. </sentence><sentence id="2790">So, we -- I had lost also a sense of orientation where we were. </sentence><sentence id="2791">Where is the nearest

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2965">Q: Right, right. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2967">A: -- because by that time, there was also another transformation that had taken place a few months before my arrival in the partisans, namely the partisans became organized as a modern army, with echelons, distinct divisions, regiments, battalions, companies. </sentence><sentence id="2968">At least on paper, all right? </sentence><sentence id="2969">And -- whereas before, these were independent units, marauding, doing whatever they could, but this was put on a much more professional footing, because by that time, the -- the man in command of the entire ELAS was General Sarafias, who was a professional military officer before the war. </sentence><sentence id="2970">So when I then was assigned to the regiment -- now the -- the regimental commander was a -- a man who permanent [indecipherable] was a major in the former Greek army, by the name of Karfis. </sentence><sentence id="2971">And he happened to have as an adjutant, a recent graduate of the military -- Greek military academy. </sentence><sentence id="2972">So he was the usual, you know, not spit and polish, because we didn't have the things for that, but saluting, although there wasn't s-so much saluting with the partisans, you know. </sentence><sentence id="2973">The method of addressing each other was synagonistis, which means fellow fighter. </sentence><sentence id="2974">It was -- it wasn't comrade, it wasn't mister. </sentence><sentence id="2975">It was even t -- with an officer of superior rank, you would address him as fellow fighter, and then his name. </sentence><sentence id="2976">So, because I think of the fact that my background, finishing high school, command of a language, and so forth, I was given a -- a clerical job, primarily enciphelment -- codes. </sentence><sentence id="2977">Because by that time, there were even radios, and nearby, because very near the regimental place, there was the -- the airfield, if I can call it that, it was just a bare piece of ground, but it was situated in the natural plateau, the one that I fired, remember? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2989">Q: Yeah. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2991">A: My first rifle. </sentence><sentence id="2992">And when in the su -- in the summer months, when the | -- land was dry, then it was able to support the weight of an aircraft, and they would fly them over there, from Egypt, and for missions back and forth. </sentence><sentence id="2993">And because of the proximity, then there was a permanent detachment of British officers, liaison officers, that have been parachuted, or brought by aircraft, next to our regimental headquarters. </sentence><sentence id="2994">So at times, I would then be asked to go -- I did not know English, but some of them, some of the English officers knew French, and I was able to converse. </sentence><sentence id="2995">Plus they were the only ones that had long range, short wave radios. </sentence><sentence id="2996">You know, the rest of -- I mean, the partisans, only division had a radio, and in our headquarters we didn't have a radio in the beginning, so everything had to be through again, field telephony. </sentence><sentence id="2997">But by then, it was necessary, because of certain engagements, to encode messages, and so I was pressed in that job. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3009">A: Well, you know, no clerical job is interesting, everything becomes routine a little bit, but it was -- the thing that that -- am-amazed me is that after awhile, I didn't have to look at the decoding book to decode text. </sentence><sentence id="3010">I had begun to learn, and -- and visualize the -- the This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="3011">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="3012"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection 4 decipherment -- th-the [indecipherable] and -- but I didn't -- I didn't want to sh -- people to see that, because, you know, I was told that -- that, you know, if you eventually memorize it, then -- then you -- if you are ever caught, then under torture you may reveal the codes, although I'm sure that the things that they had to communicate were not of momentous strategic im-importance to -- </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3019">Q: But they would also change the codes </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3021">A: Yeah, but -- bu-but, you do that -- we didn't have -- in all that -- I'm talking about practically from February through November, practically the nine months that I -- my remain -- stayed with the partisans service, we changed codes routinely only twice. </sentence><sentence id="3022">So there wasn't that kind of a [indecipherable] because I don't think they were high level codes. </sentence><sentence id="3023">But they were important to us, and -- well, th-that was not the only thing I had to do. </sentence><sentence id="3024">Then the adjutant orders had to be typed. </sentence><sentence id="3025">We had -- we found a ramshackle typewriter, and some paper. </sentence><sentence id="3026">I was the only one who was able to use that and type some orders. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3035">A: Sort of. </sentence><sentence id="3036">More of the two or three fingers, which I still have to use today. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3039">Q: So, I've -- how are things now, is this unit now going out and doing sabotage, or is it quiet, and that's not what you're doing [indecipherable] </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="3041"> A No, no, no, no. </sentence><sentence id="3042">Again, because it was regimental headquarters -- now, it's fighting units, and sabotage are in the region. </sentence><sentence id="3043">I mean, if I drew a circle, it would probably cover, you know, a radius of 50 - 60 kilometers. </sentence><sentence id="3044">40 miles, you know, because the [indecipherable] adjacent things. </sentence><sentence id="3045">By that time, in the beginning of the partisan war, the major things that the partisans had to do -- wa-wanted to do, was A, kill known collaborators, primarily to elevate the morale of the people. </sentence><sentence id="3046">You know, begin to give them a sense that there are people who are protecting them. </sentence><sentence id="3047">That those who collaborate with the enemy are going to get their just desserts. </sentence><sentence id="3048">And because you cannot fight heavy engagements, there were occasional skirmishes, and fi -- and attacks with -- with isolated Italian, or -- or German units. </sentence><sentence id="3049">But in our sector, when we begun to do a systematic thing of attacking convoys because our unit was the nearest to the main road that goes from Trikala to eventually Kardhitsa, and then Lamia, and so forth, to south [indecipherable] Greece. </sentence><sentence id="3050">So that -- that was essentially the -- the -- the mission, if I can call it, of the regiment. </sentence><sentence id="3051">We -- we never got engaged. </sentence><sentence id="3052">We don't do that with the -- the light weapons. </sentence><sentence id="3053">The heaviest weapons I remember we had in the whole regiment was two heavy machine guns. </sentence><sentence id="3054">You can't engage an enemy that has armory units, with two heavy machine guns. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3080">Q: Are you getting news about the front? </sentence><sentence id="3081">I mean clearly the -- the -- there's a turn in the war, and there's been a turn in the war since 43, or late "42. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3084">A: Right, well, most of the spring, we knew -- first of all to us, through the British connection, primarily, as well as independently, the Greek connections, because of course, division talk to the agency in Athens, or the top command of ELAS. </sentence><sentence id="3085">So -- but it would come to us two or three weeks late. </sentence><sentence id="3086">So it primarily still involves the -- the campaign in Italy. </sentence><sentence id="3087">The -- the great event occurs June six, when Normandy occurs in the war. </sentence><sentence id="3088">We -- we get also news of the eastern front. </sentence><sentence id="3089">But that was the -- the -- the first major event. </sentence><sentence id="3090">That really didn't have an immediate effect, other than si -- psychological, that now these two great parts of the allies are converging. </sentence><sentence id="3091">But I think through a -- the stream of -- of messages coming from division, and from ELAS headquarters, definitely show an increase in the pace of operations, for two reasons. </sentence><sentence id="3092">First of all, visibly, from reports, Germans are abandoning smaller towns, and concentrating in major arteries now. </sentence><sentence id="3093">Why would they do that, since no -- no -- nobody thought that the Greece itself was about to be invaded by allied troops. </sentence><sentence id="3094">So -- so that was one -- one reason. </sentence><sentence id="3095">Then, also, the news began to -- to trickle down again. </sentence><sentence id="3096">We had more contact even from tiko partisans, who had much better communications, and already we began to see that the Russians are approaching the silent part of Europe, namely the Balkans, and it doesn't take a strategic, Napoleonic mind, a short look at the map indicates that -- because Greece is al-almost like a peninsula, the bottom of the Balkans, if the Russians were advancing that much, I think which eventually what happened is that the Germans would have an untenable position in this. </sentence><sentence id="3097">So, this explains why the Germans were consolidating their lines, and because in the meantime, attempts had been made by the British mission to try to unite the warring factions of the Greek resistance. </sentence><sentence id="3098">And eventually, in the -- in June or July of "44, there was a -- as -- a signed agreement that was signed by representatives in the Middle East, in Lebanon, I believe, Beirut, which then held until the end of the war. </sentence><sentence id="3099">So -- so we had this pace going on. </sentence><sentence id="3100">But again, the day to day life for -- for us, food was very scarce, as usual, although it was regimental headquarters, th-they didn't grow crops or -- or other food. </sentence><sentence id="3101">Also clothing, and -- and -- and sanitary conditions were not -- I mean, if you went to sleep at night, especially in -- in the winter, well in the middle of the night, you know, people are getting -- or you sleep on the floor, people are getting up and stepping [indecipherable] sometimes on bodies, make their way to -- to go out, maybe to relieve themselves. </sentence><sentence id="3102">But very often it was not for that reason. </sentence><sentence id="3103">You would go up, and open the tunic to let the cold air come in to quiet the lice, because in sleeping ne -- bodies next to each other, the lice begin to get warm, and begin to -- to move, and you -- it's not particularly pleasant, and to quieten them again, you go out, open the tunic, let the cold in, and they quiet for a bit, and you sleep for another hour or two. </sentence><sentence id="3104">Th-This -- this -- this persisted until when it became real warm in the mountains, May, June, and on, because then you could go bathe in the streams, and that would -- we used to do that every day, and at times it effectfully -- eventually happened to me later on, a month or two later, when I went swimming, and I had been perspiring, running to get to the place to swim, and I must have caught a cold, which was then misdiagnosed as malaria, and I had other problems. </sentence><sentence id="3105">But this was -- the pace noticeably started. </sentence><sentence id="3106">There were more action from our This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="3107">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy.

where they had come from headquarters in the Middle East, or from ELAS headquarters, to harass Germans, even notably those who were retreating and going north, but not to attempt any major action, even if we were able to. </sentence><sentence id="3109">The reason being that they didn't want to infuriate the Germans, because fay -- they didn't really have to infuriate them, they were doing that anyhow in many cases, namely, a scorched earth policy, they attempted to blow up the port facilities in Pireas, and it was only a last minute action by the partisans in the city, that averted the blowing up of port facilities in Pireas. </sentence><sentence id="3110">So -- so noticeably we saw the pace accelerate. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3315">A: Well very quickly, one -- one morning, if I -- I remember, it was close to 10 o'clock in the morning, and I was sort of manning the telephone, and it rang, and they asked the other -- at the other end, to speak to the colonel. </sentence><sentence id="3316">So, but I couldn't get the colonel, I got the adjutant. </sentence><sentence id="3317">Well, very quickly what tran-transpired, regimental headquarters was in a part that was really a short distance from the plains of Thessaly, but it was a -- a suitable elevation. </sentence><sentence id="3318">And there was a -- a kind of like an entry, a pass, a mountain pass, and essentially what the telephone call said is four or five or six German trucks have entered this pass, which had been manned by a very small unit of partisans, about five or six. </sentence><sentence id="3319">And we, of course knew that coming to the pass and going south, ended in a cul-de-sac, because there was nothing, after you've gone for another kilometer, just there was a w -- a mountain wall. </sentence><sentence id="3320">So, when they saw that happening, you know, that's why they called to alert us. </sentence><sentence id="3321">They were not able, those who were guarding the pass, to engage how many Germans there would be, and the nearest unit that -- of a sufficient strength, was at least three or four hours away. </sentence><sentence id="3322">So very quickly the commanding officer decided that the [indecipherable] is to fool the Germans into thinking that they are surrounded, that there This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="3323">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="3324"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection 0 are many more than actually we were. </sentence><sentence id="3325">So he dispatched anybody who could walk, including us clerical personnel in the regimental unit, to go, so we grabbed the -- our weapons, and after running for about 45 minutes, and out of breath, you could see down in that cul-de-sac, and all the -- the Germans had se -- literally circled the wagons, and some of them had gone hiding. </sentence><sentence id="3326">And as they were being fired by the unit that was guarding the pass, they would return -- was rifle fire, they didn't have anything heavy. </sentence><sentence id="3327">And so we started firing at them, and they were firing at us. </sentence><sentence id="3328">And they -- since they saw things coming from both directions, they really concluded that they were in -- in dire straights. </sentence><sentence id="3329">And we were afraid that they would communicate via radio to their original unit, and they would come to relieve them, with a much bigger force. </sentence><sentence id="3330">But apparently, they either didn't have radio, or if they had, they didn't know where they were, see, they got lost. </sentence><sentence id="3331">And by that time, in about three hours, or -- the main fighting unit came, and started -- the partisan unit, firing at the Germans, and then, after about a few minutes, you begin to see a white flag, but just before that happened, suddenly there was a little noise, or -- or -- or sound near where I was behind a rock. </sentence><sentence id="3332">And at the same time that I heard the sound, I also felt a -- kind of a -- of a pain, temporary pain in the right knee, and when I bend down I saw it was a tear, and something -- oozing a little bit of blood. </sentence><sentence id="3333">And it must have some part of a -- of a bullet that had hit a rock and splintered, and part of the thing ricocheted, but it didn't go inside, I didn't find anything, it wasn't a major wound, and it didn't hurt, but nev-nevertheless when I was taken to [indecipherable] I was bandaged by a woman who turned out to be a Jewish woman, who had gone to school for midwives, with a -- a -- a young girl, who was next door neighbors to us. </sentence><sentence id="3334">So -- but it was the only action that I saw. </sentence><sentence id="3335">I mean we -- we -- the number of Germans killed was, I think, eight or nine, and two were wounded, they were carried out with a litter and three prisoner. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3501">A: -- it was -- maybe the ending of August, in two ways. </sentence><sentence id="3502">First of all, because our units are more active -- but I have to tell you that I can remember it now in my mind's ear, because I had never heard all these months the sound of artillery. </sentence><sentence id="3503">You know, there's no artillery in partisan, but now you begin to hear, at a great distance, this dull thud, boom, boom, boom. </sentence><sentence id="3504">And at night, you know, it's not a heavy sound, it's not continuously [indecipherable] but it's there. </sentence><sentence id="3505">And at night you hear the same sound, but at the same time you see also the illumination in the horizon. </sentence><sentence id="3506">So you -- you -- you know somebody is firing, all right? </sentence><sentence id="3507">So essentially what's -- what's happened is by then the Germans are in very well organized retreat, they're abandoning Greece. </sentence><sentence id="3508">And of course, that's understood, and known, and so the partisans units physically are themselves beginning to move first to harass the rear of the departing Germans, but also to get low, because the lower parts now are themselves free. </sentence><sentence id="3509">So -- so it became a combination of news, combination of an action, a combination of hearing things, seeing things, and then beginning to assess the [indecipherable] because as soon as these things started, headquarters wasn't going to stay in the rear where we were. </sentence><sentence id="3510">We be -- ousess began to descend to lower elevations. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="4441">A: I'm -- I'm -- you're -- you're -- you're -- you're -- you're kind, because I thought you would continue, you would carry it one more step and say how did I dare then leave him? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="4443">Q: Well, I might have gone there, so it's good that you said that. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="4445">A: Well, there is no question my -- my father, I mean, he wa -- he used to tell me, I remember, even when I was already in high school, if I would ask him for some money to do so something like, I don't know, go to a movie, or something -- or -- or go buy something, he would say to me, "Look, I don't have the money to give you for that purpose. </sentence><sentence id="4446">But if you were to ask me that you want to go buy a book, even if I don't have the money, I will tell you what I will do. </sentence><sentence id="4447">I will not smoke for a week to save from smoking, so -- so -- anything that has to do with education, I, you know, I'Il do, or that," - - so it's not surprising to me, and I -- and I know in some respects, because I learned these things subsequently, my -- my f-father would say things that were not true, fibs, lies, but they were lies in -- for good purposes. </sentence><sentence id="4448">But even before he worked this thing with -- through the B'nai Brith for a scholarship for me to come to the United States, I know he wrote a letter to Churchill saying -- which was a bit of an exaggeration, that he, at the risk of his life had hidden a British soldier who had to go into hiding -- because a British contingent had come to help the Greeks when we were fighting the Italians. </sentence><sentence id="4449">And then, of course, in deg41. </sentence><sentence id="4450">It was partly true. </sentence><sentence id="4451">There was a man who was in the British army that happened to be f -- his parents from Monastir. </sentence><sentence id="4452">And he came to the synagogue, you know, for Pessach. </sentence><sentence id="4453">And so we invited him, and he joined us for [indecipherable]. </sentence><sentence id="4454">That's what happened, that's true. </sentence><sentence id="4455">But he was not really hiding. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="4484">A: No, no, no. </sentence><sentence id="4485">No, that -- that -- that -- that -- on the other hand, getting into the United States -- because for a long time, in ac -- in a certain ways my father was naive. </sentence><sentence id="4486">When I was growing up, I was going to be a textile engineer. </sentence><sentence id="4487">Well why? </sentence><sentence id="4488">I mean, dit -- what does he know about textiles, other than some son of some business assoc -- associate had gone and studied textile engineering in Yaszh, in Belgium, which a-apparently had a well- known textile engineering school. </sentence><sentence id="4489">So I was being prepared fully for engineering, but also for textile engineer. </sentence><sentence id="4490">Of course I -- all of that got changed, you know, when I decided to be an electrical engineer, and [indecipherable] textiles. </sentence><sentence id="4491">But h -- he understood this much, that opportunities in Europe, education opportunities, let alone the United States, which was a mirage, you know, sort of not only far away physically, but so distant emotionally. </sentence><sentence id="4492">So he would do anything. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="4502">Q: So r -- let me then ask you the more difficult question. </sentence><sentence id="4503">How did you dare leave? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="4506">A: Well, how I dare leave, first of all I was i -- after awhile inebriated by the thought that I was going to go to the United States. </sentence><sentence id="4507">Second, Sam had returned, so I knew my father was not alone. </sentence><sentence id="4508">Third, I was joined by a cousin, whose -- whose father was my father's cousin. </sentence><sentence id="4509">I -- I -- with a young man, Jeff Levi -- lev -- Levis was his name, we came together on the same ship. </sentence><sentence id="4510">He went to Iowa, I went to Illinois. </sentence><sentence id="4511">We related from both sides, the maternal and the paternal side. </sentence><sentence id="4512">So, and he was an only child. </sentence><sentence id="4513">And therefore, I -- putting all these things together, there were no limits to that what parents would not do to further -- after all, I was going to study. </sentence><sentence id="4514">It didn't necessarily mean that I was going to go there forever. </sentence><sentence id="4515">I could have easily, in normal times, be sent to study in Manchester, which has another textile engineering sch -- school. </sentence><sentence id="4516">So there were -- th -- there were no thoughts -- now, if -- if Sam had not returned, I can, as they say in Greek, I could put my hand on flames and swear that my father would have done the same thing, and he would have pushed me, and encouraged me, and really shoved me, because he -- he felt the -- the value of -- of education. </sentence><sentence id="4517">And I did it. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="4574">A: And I was encouraged enough to -- to stay in, although I had no means of, you know, independently, I was given a -- an assistanceship -- a research assistanceship, which would pay the tuition, and 103 dollars a month, and that's all I had to live on, because my father from time to time would send me in a letter, a five dollar bill, or a 10 dollar bill. </sentence><sentence id="4575">So it was primarily the encouragement I got from -- from teachers that made me stay, and in fact I stayed another two years in Illinois. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="4603">Q: [indecipherable] </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="4605">A: Because the draft was still on, and of course I would have had the choice of not going to the army, s -- being an alien. </sentence><sentence id="4606">But of course, I could never again stay in this country. </sentence><sentence id="4607">We haven't talked about the fact that -- that it was in "50, at one point I was to be expelled by the Immigration and Naturalization Service, because I had essentially overstayed my student visa. </sentence><sentence id="4608">It's another long story, but my professors intervened, and the long and the short is that Senator Douglas introduced a private bill in congress, and I got to stay in the United States on a law named for me, for the relief of Isaac Nehama, signed by President Eisenhower. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="4712">A: No, I'd like to thank you, almost in the same -- for the same reasons that Sam says the same thing to his own interviewer, because the other reason, other than Sharon's very wise statement persuading me to do that, is that it leaves something for either my descendents, number one, as well as perhaps people in the future, who might be interested about this particular period. </sentence><sentence id="4713">And this I'm saying now, following a year and a half of work as a volunteer for the Holocaust Museum and doing this thing for the Bitola Jews, I have lived with, essentially almost 2000 faces of people who are all dead, and who -- whose names then I had to type it into a database, and who become alive, and then reading books, and talking about that. </sentence><sentence id="4714">So, I want to thank you for then doing that, because it leaves something which might be of some small value or use to some interested historian, or -- or person in the future. </sentence></p></dialogue>
