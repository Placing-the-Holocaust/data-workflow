<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="163">Q: Tell me about how your life changed when the war broke out. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="165">A: Well, at the beginning when the Germans came into our hometown, they let us for a while be in our houses, everything was like never nothing happened yet. </sentence><sentence id="166">Then one summer morning, early morning, they knocked on everybody's doors, and they made everybody get out of the houses, and who wouldn't leave, they shoot right there. </sentence><sentence id="167">So they got us all out on the streets, and they started marching us, and right next to us, the Gentile people were marching with shovels. </sentence><sentence id="168">Now we couldn't understand what was going on. </sentence><sentence id="169">Because nobody said nothing, and then we see the German soldiers walking, and make us march. </sentence><sentence id="170">So, our city was divided by a railroad. </sentence><sentence id="171">It was like a new city and an old city. </sentence><sentence id="172">So we marched over the bridge, and way out of the city, outskirts of the city like in a big field and there were already Germans with the machine guns all around standing and we got in the middle. </sentence><sentence id="173">And they told us to sit down and wait. </sentence><sentence id="174">And we sit there and we couldn't understand anything, nothing, and those people with the shovels, they probably went to dig ditches already to kill us or something. </sentence><sentence id="175">We didn't know what was going on. </sentence><sentence id="176">Because it was the first time. </sentence><sentence id="177">So, late afternoon, they told us women and children separate, men separate. </sentence><sentence id="178">They started separating everybody. </sentence><sentence id="179">And there was one nice soldier, and he walked over and he says the women with the children will live. </sentence><sentence id="180"> That is all he said. </sentence><sentence id="181">And we still didn't know what he meant. </sentence><sentence id="182">So, by that time everybody who had three or four kids started dividing between the people who didn't have kids. </sentence><sentence id="183">So then they marched the men away first. </sentence><sentence id="184">And nobody knew where they had taken them and what they would do with them. </sentence><sentence id="185">Then 20 minutes later, they told all the women, "Line up and start marching towards the city." </sentence><sentence id="186">So we were told to separate again, as soon as we cross, we got in the middle halfway in the road, and they told us to run. </sentence><sentence id="187">And everybody started to run into houses. </sentence><sentence id="188">Whatever house they saw, they just ran. </sentence><sentence id="189">And right after we got into the houses, we could hear shooting and we more exactly, you know, understood that something was happening. </sentence><sentence id="190">And nobody knew where the men were or nothing until late evening they came back. </sentence><sentence id="191">They took them to armory like, a armory for soldiers. </sentence><sentence id="192">They took them there. </sentence><sentence id="193">They made them work for awhile, and then they let them go. </sentence><sentence id="194">And that was the first that they did. </sentence><sentence id="195">And right after that, they made a Judenrat--an office, where you have to register to go work. </sentence><sentence id="196">They came there and they asked for people to work and everybody started working. </sentence><sentence id="197">And they were young, young kids. </sentence><sentence id="198">We had to wear first a Jewish star on our arm, like an arm band. </sentence><sentence id="199">That was not good enough for them because they couldn't tell if you were Jew or not because the right arm band didn't show much. </sentence><sentence id="200">So they told us to wear a yellow circle in the back of our back and in front. </sentence><sentence id="201">And I, myself, was not allowed to work, I had been going to work every day, and worked different places and once I was taken to work on a railroad station with some other girls. </sentence><sentence id="202">We had to carry small bombs. </sentence><sentence id="203">And the SS were standing with the whips, and if you didn't pick it up and take it on the train, you were whipped. </sentence><sentence id="204">And it was very bad. </sentence><sentence id="205">Then, a few months later, they organized a ghetto. </sentence><sentence id="206">They took one part of the section and all the Jews went to this part of the city. </sentence><sentence id="207">And they put in like 2 or 3 families in a house. </sentence><sentence id="208">And they had a gate, and you had to go in through the gate and come out through the gate. </sentence><sentence id="209">And then, one day they came, with a truck, to mobilize all the young people. </sentence><sentence id="210">They never came with the truck to the ghetto. </sentence><sentence id="211">They always went to the office, and then we have to come there and then go to work. </sentence><sentence id="212">So when I saw the truck, I said to myself, "I am not going." </sentence><sentence id="213">For some reason, I had a feeling that something was going to be wrong. </sentence><sentence id="214">So I said "No, I am not going." </sentence><sentence id="215">My mother didn't insist for me to go either. </sentence><sentence id="216">She says "You don't want to go, don't!." </sentence><sentence id="217">So they had on the front of the house, like an empty store, was bombed, you know, and they came in, and I crawled in there and I sit in there, and I watched through the broken wood pieces. </sentence><sentence id="218">I could see the truck, and they were loading up as many as they could. </sentence><sentence id="219">They put one on top of another, and I knew that something was wrong, and those people never came back. </sentence><sentence id="220">We later found out they were taken to the woods and shot. </sentence><sentence id="221">And life was going on for awhile like that, and I was working different places. </sentence><sentence id="222">Once they took a group of girls and three men to a school, to a gymnasium, to make ready the school for the soldiers who had to come into town. </sentence><sentence id="223">We had to put straw on the floors, clean it. </sentence><sentence id="224">The men were chopping wood to make a fire, and one German was watching us. </sentence><sentence id="225">One German was watching us. </sentence><sentence id="226">They never left us alone. </sentence><sentence id="227">So after we finished, we told them we finished, and we free to go? </sentence><sentence id="228">He said, "No, we have to stay and wait for the soldiers." </sentence><sentence id="229">So, I said, "No, something is going to happen when the soldiers come in." </sentence><sentence id="230">So I say to the girls, "We have to run." </sentence><sentence id="231">They say, "How can we run, the soldiers here." </sentence><sentence id="232">I said, "I get rid of them." </sentence><sentence id="233">I went outside and I told the men to come out for a minute and keep him busy. </sentence><sentence id="234">I told him why and we could get away. </sentence><sentence id="235">And while he was there, we run out and we run into the office, to the Judenrat, and we told the man what happened. </sentence><sentence id="236">So he put us in another room, he closed the door, and put a bookcase in front. </sentence><sentence id="237"> Because he was afraid, the German might come back, and sure enough he came. </sentence><sentence id="238">He came looking for us. </sentence><sentence id="239">And he says he never saw us, the building is big, and we might be wandering around in the building. </sentence><sentence id="240">He left, and when it got dark, we came out and went home. </sentence><sentence id="241">And that is how it went on for quite some time. </sentence><sentence id="242">And then they organized us again and they took us to a train station and they had a big barn and we had to stay there for a whole week to work. </sentence><sentence id="243">Men, old men and girls, it doesn't matter what size. </sentence><sentence id="244">And they had a Gentile woman prepare the soup, whatever they gave us, so one day when they served us the food, she said to me, "You know when you finish working here, they are going to blow up the building with you all. </sentence><sentence id="245">I can help you get out if you want. </sentence><sentence id="246">Tell everybody what is happening." </sentence><sentence id="247">So that evening I told them that we had to get out because by tomorrow it might be the end of us. </sentence><sentence id="248">Nobody wanted to listen to me. </sentence><sentence id="249">They all were saying, "Ah, you just think so." </sentence><sentence id="250">Nobody believed that that was going to happen, something. </sentence><sentence id="251">So I told her that I am ready to go. </sentence><sentence id="252">So she brought me a long skirt for summertime, and she bought me a shawl like the people from the farmers wear. </sentence><sentence id="253">And I got dressed, and she got me out of there. </sentence><sentence id="254">And I started walking maybe 30 or 40 kilometers home. </sentence><sentence id="255">Took me a whole day. </sentence><sentence id="256">And when I got to the house and knocked on the door, my mother was shocked to see me; because she didn't expect me home yet. </sentence><sentence id="257">She asked me what happened, and I said that is what news we got. </sentence><sentence id="258">And sure enough, they finished working that Friday; and sure enough, that Friday night, that building went off. </sentence><sentence id="259">There is one person also escaped that day before the blow up, and he came home and told what happened. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="355">Q: The rest of them were all killed? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="357">A: The rest of them were killed. </sentence><sentence id="358">You see, before they even sent them to camps, they got rid of people, as much as they could. </sentence><sentence id="359">And that went on until 1942. </sentence><sentence id="360">And by that time, everybody got a little smarter and understood what was happening. </sentence><sentence id="361">So everybody made like shelters in the basements, wherever they can find a place. </sentence><sentence id="362">Like the house I lived, they made under the steps. </sentence><sentence id="363">They made an opening. </sentence><sentence id="364">You could not really get in too many people there, you know, just enough to get in. </sentence><sentence id="365">And one morning when we woke up, we saw trucks right in front of the gate along the street, a lot of Germans, and we understood that something is going to happen. </sentence><sentence id="366">So we crawled into the shelter. </sentence><sentence id="367">And we could hear stomping around in the house, looking, and it was terrible that day. </sentence><sentence id="368">We sit quiet. </sentence><sentence id="369">We didn't have food in there. </sentence><sentence id="370">We didn't expect, you didn't know when they could do it, so you couldn't prepare yourself. </sentence><sentence id="371">So then, after a couple of days sitting in there, the water pipe broke, and the water started coming up, gushing out there, and was almost to our necks, and we had to get out. </sentence><sentence id="372">We couldn't stay no longer. </sentence><sentence id="373">So we came out during the night, went into the house, we changed the clothes. </sentence><sentence id="374">We didn't think about nothing, just to get out. </sentence><sentence id="375">And right across the street from the ghetto, there was Gentile people which my mother knew and she secured, we had to run, they will keep us. </sentence><sentence id="376">So we ran from our house to the front house which was closer to the road, and we looked around, nobody was there, and we went across the street. </sentence><sentence id="377">And my mother knocked on the back door, and the man opened the door and he said if we not going to leave he is going to call the Germans. </sentence><sentence id="378">He no want to see us and he doesn't know us. </sentence><sentence id="379">So we had no place to go, so next door was another Gentile person who knew us. </sentence><sentence id="380">My mother went over there, and he says he can keep us overnight and during the day we will have to leave because it is right by the main road and he really don't have a place to keep us. </sentence><sentence id="381">So he had a big stack of hay in the  middle of the yard. </sentence><sentence id="382">Anybody could walk over and punch the hay and find us. </sentence><sentence id="383">And we crawled in there. </sentence><sentence id="384">He brought us some food and we sat the next day, all day, and the evening he bought us some clothes so we be looking like Gentile people, and we started walking. </sentence><sentence id="385">Where we were going we didn't know ourselves. </sentence><sentence id="386">My mother had in mind there was a woman living on the outskirts of the city, maybe she will keep us. </sentence><sentence id="387">So we walked over to her place, and when we got to her place we heard German voices in the house. </sentence><sentence id="388">So we couldn't do nothing, so she had like a little shack which she used to keep a pig in there. </sentence><sentence id="389">We crawled in this little shack and we sat there and waited until the Germans left. </sentence><sentence id="390">When the Germans left, my mother knocked on the door, and the woman said she is very sorry, she couldn't keep us. </sentence><sentence id="391">She has no room and her daughter is dating those Germans. </sentence><sentence id="392">She says "You can stay tonight if you want, and tomorrow maybe. </sentence><sentence id="393">You have to go." </sentence><sentence id="394">So we stayed overnight and the next morning, early morning, my mother got up, she got dressed, and she left us there, and she went to look for a place. </sentence><sentence id="395">She was gone all day, and in the evening she came, she says, "I find a place." </sentence><sentence id="396">She didn't know the person, the person didn't know her. </sentence><sentence id="397">She was a very nice Gentile woman. </sentence><sentence id="398">She believed in God. </sentence><sentence id="399">She said God sent us to her and she has to do it. </sentence><sentence id="400">She was a poor woman. </sentence><sentence id="401">And we came there, the next morning we came there. </sentence><sentence id="402">And the next morning she put us in the barn at first. </sentence><sentence id="403">She knew that we couldn't stay there because anybody who comes in the fields to work, because her husband was a forest man, and everybody had a piece of ground and worked in those fields. </sentence><sentence id="404">She was afraid anybody come to the field would see us. </sentence><sentence id="405">So we were there for awhile and in Europe, they really make a big ditch, big hole, and they put potatoes and they keep them over winter there. </sentence><sentence id="406">She had potatoes in there. </sentence><sentence id="407">So she took the potatoes out. </sentence><sentence id="408">She put some straw down and she put some boards over top. </sentence><sentence id="409">She put a pole in the middle to hold it on and on top, she put in pumpkins, a whole bunch of pumpkins. </sentence><sentence id="410">And she just made a small hole so we could climb in there. </sentence><sentence id="411">And we went in there, it was in the fall. </sentence><sentence id="412">We went in there, and we sit there for 16 months in that little hole, in that little place. </sentence><sentence id="413">You couldn't even stretch your feet out. </sentence><sentence id="414">And she brought us food once a day. </sentence><sentence id="415">We had one potato, each of us a day, and a quart of water a day. </sentence><sentence id="416">She, herself, didn't have much food. </sentence><sentence id="417">She was glad to feed us with that, and we were happy to get this so long as we are safe. </sentence><sentence id="418">And some days when it was quiet she used to come take the pumpkin away so we can get some air. </sentence><sentence id="419">One day she took the pumpkin away. </sentence><sentence id="420">And we were sitting and talking between each other; and all of a sudden, a car came by and threw the pumpkin on the hole. </sentence><sentence id="421">So I said to my father, I said, "Ah, I am going to open up. </sentence><sentence id="422">I will push it." </sentence><sentence id="423">He said, "No, leave it along." </sentence><sentence id="424">And right after that, two Germans passed by. </sentence><sentence id="425">It looked like the car knew...we...that we were there, and she has to save us. </sentence><sentence id="426">And we was there for quite awhile. </sentence><sentence id="427">And the woman knew what was going on, because if they caught people at Gentile's houses, they killed the Gentile and the Jews. </sentence><sentence id="428">She didn't care. </sentence><sentence id="429">She just want to save us. </sentence><sentence id="430">She had one little boy, she had three kids, and one little kid was 4 years old. </sentence><sentence id="431">He used to go in the field sometimes and get some carrots out of the ground and bring them down to us. </sentence><sentence id="432">He used to say, "The Germans will not live to long enough to kill you." </sentence><sentence id="433">He was very nice, the little kid. </sentence><sentence id="434">And we were there, and then one day, like she noticed it, she thought somebody saw us. </sentence><sentence id="435">It was wintertime. </sentence><sentence id="436">It was cold. </sentence><sentence id="437">She says we have to get out of there. </sentence><sentence id="438">And we went out of there, and we go into the forest. </sentence><sentence id="439">On ice! </sentence><sentence id="440">We laid on that, and we had hardly any clothes. </sentence><sentence id="441">We laid all night on that ice. </sentence><sentence id="442">Everybody, when I tell them, I tell them the story about this ice, they don't believe me and I didn't get pneumonia or something. </sentence><sentence id="443">It looks like our bodies were so strong, they took anything. </sentence><sentence id="444">And we stayed  overnight and the next morning, we went back in, and we stayed there until 1944. </sentence><sentence id="445">In 1944, she, herself, used to go to the city and bring us newspapers so we could read to her because she couldn't read and write. </sentence><sentence id="446">So in the evenings she used to bring a candle with the paper, and my father used to read the news to her. </sentence><sentence id="447">And we told her if she goes into town, see what happens, if she talks to people, tell us what is happening. </sentence><sentence id="448">So in that year of "44, she came back and said the people were talking the Russians were coming back. </sentence><sentence id="449">So it was good news, already the Germans were leaving. </sentence><sentence id="450">So one day she came and she says, "The Germans are out. </sentence><sentence id="451">There was bombing and all that, and the Germans are out, and the Russians are back in." </sentence><sentence id="452">So my parents go out. </sentence><sentence id="453">And they left us still in that hole because they were not sure what was going on. </sentence><sentence id="454">They left to town. </sentence><sentence id="455">And we were sitting there; and
