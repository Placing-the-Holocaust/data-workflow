<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="7">Q: Tell me a little bit about your family life before the war. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="9">A: Okay. </sentence><sentence id="10">My dad had a furniture workshop and mom was a housekeeper, house, homemaker. </sentence><sentence id="11">We were three small children. </sentence><sentence id="12">And we lived in what was known as a Jewish neighborhood, which encompassed sort of six, seven streets in Antwerp. </sentence><sentence id="13">We went to school, Friday night we had a Sabbath dinner, Saturday we went to synagogue, but Saturday afternoon sometimes we snuck off to the movies. </sentence><sentence id="14">And life was pleasant, you know, with three sisters, sometimes we played together, other times we fought, we did homework, there was a beautiful clock at the end of our street, and after school we'd go and play there, we'd ride our bikes, we'd play ball on the wall next to our apartment house and life kind of was pleasant. </sentence><sentence id="15">It was pleasant. </sentence><sentence id="16">On the week-end, on Sundays, neighbors, friends, everybody'd get on their bikes, we'd go the park, have a picnic. </sentence><sentence id="17">And the park was a beautiful park, it was called the Lanekevitzstrak(ph) Park and had a beautiful pond with swans and we enjoyed it. </sentence><sentence id="18">I re-visited it recently and, seems smaller than it did when I was small. </sentence><sentence id="19">And, everything seemed alright for awhile and what I didn't realize, however, was that the, there was a depression. </sentence><sentence id="20">And that my dad was having financial problems. </sentence><sentence id="21">He eventually lost his business which was, he had a furniture workshop. </sentence><sentence id="22">He made custom furniture. </sentence><sentence id="23">He lost it. </sentence><sentence id="24">And then went off to the coal mines to get work. </sentence><sentence id="25">People tried to get work just about wherever they could. </sentence><sentence id="26">And, he even worked for the Fourth Company for a short while. </sentence><sentence id="27">And then eventually got a position with a steamship company and started sailing the seven seas. </sentence><sentence id="28">And this was about early "36, "37. </sentence><sentence id="29">And at This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="30">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="31"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection that time we had gone back, we had gone, I wouldn't say back exactly, my mom did go back, but we went with my mom to Romania because my family originated from there, and that was the last time I saw my grandfather, my grandmother and many of my aunts and uncles. </sentence><sentence id="32">Most of them did perish in Auschwitz. </sentence><sentence id="33">By 1937, we rarely saw my father. </sentence><sentence id="34">We always saw him like every three months, every four months, when he'd come home for about two or three days and then would take off again. </sentence><sentence id="35">At about the same time, he made the acquaintance of an officer on his steamship, on the steamship he worked on, the man was a German and a Christian. </sentence><sentence id="36">And I'm mentioning that because he'll be coming into our lives later on again. </sentence><sentence id="37">Otherwise, I wouldn't have identified him like that. </sentence><sentence id="38">Carl would not always be able to go back to Germany when the ship docked in Antwerp to see his family because time was short, so he would stay with us and we became very fond of him. </sentence><sentence id="39">In 1938, there was an influx of refugees in Antwerp. </sentence><sentence id="40">They came from Austria, from Germany and the whole Jewish community opened up their homes for them. </sentence><sentence id="41">We, ourselves, in our small apartment, had four people staying with us. </sentence><sentence id="42">I think it was four, I'm not sure if it was three or four, but from what I remember, there were two couples. </sentence><sentence id="43">And around the dinner table a lot of talk was going on about what went on in Germany, about what I know now to be Chrystalnacht(ph), and I remember becoming fearful, I remember going to bed and thinking about it and I say, well, maybe we're going to have to run away. </sentence><sentence id="44">And I would ask my mother about it, and she said, don't worry, old people tell stories, they're exaggerating. </sentence><sentence id="45">She says, nothing's happening, Austria, Germany, they're civilized countries. </sentence><sentence id="46">The people there are like here, she says, maybe some things are happening, after all, you know, I always tell you that there are people who are antisemetic, and who don't like Jews, but nothing like what they're telling you. </sentence><sentence id="47">So, time went on. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="89">Q: Let me just, before you go further, just ask, you said that you lived in a Jewish community. </sentence><sentence id="90">Did you have contact with Christian people? </sentence></p></dialogue>

</sentence><sentence id="95"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="96">A: Oh, sure. </sentence><sentence id="97">Of course. </sentence><sentence id="98">I went to public school. </sentence><sentence id="99">I went to public school and then after school the boys went to what they called Hebrew school and the little girls went to what they called Yiddish school. </sentence><sentence id="100">We learned how to read and write in Yiddish. </sentence><sentence id="101">Of course we had contact because in public school it was mixed. </sentence><sentence id="102">I didn't go to a secular, I mean I went to a secular school, I didn't go to a religious school. </sentence><sentence id="103">So, yes, we did have contact, but the reason I mentioned the Jewish neighborhood, is, there were Jewish people living all over Antwerp, but the neighborhood that I'm speaking of was, I would almost say 90% Jewish. </sentence><sentence id="104">There were Christians living there also, but it was the neighborhood where you had all the kosher butchers, you had synagogues almost on every second street, and kosher restaurants, and if you really walk those streets you really didn't think there was another world. </sentence><sentence id="105">As a matter of fact, until I went to kindergarten, I spoke just Yiddish. </sentence><sentence id="106">I didn't know there were other languages, except the Hungarian and Rumanian that I heard my parents speak, which I never learned. </sentence><sentence id="107">So, for me, until I went into regular public school, I thought that the only people who existed were Jewish people. </sentence><sentence id="108">But then, of course, I came in contact with everyone. </sentence><sentence id="109">And speaking of school, in Belgium, in many of the European countries, school isn't five days a week like here in the United States. </sentence><sentence id="110">You go to school on Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, full days. </sentence><sentence id="111">Thursday is a half day and then a half day on Saturday. </sentence><sentence id="112">So, we were not excused from that, although many times, we were absent on Saturdays. </sentence><sentence id="113">However, when we did go to school, our teacher would excuse us from reading, I mean from writing on the board or writing in our notebooks and then I had one teacher who sat us in the back of the room so she would remember who not to call on to write. </sentence><sentence id="114">And that wasn't overly comfortable, but it was something that we adjusted to. </sentence><sentence id="115">And, okay, going back to "38, "39, there was, I remember hearing talk about Poland being invaded and I heard talk about Belgium being neutral, but it was very vague at that particular time. </sentence><sentence id="116">It wasn't until later that I learned the full history of that. </sentence><sentence id="117">In 1940, the spring of 1940, I was at a summer camp. </sentence><sentence id="118">In This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="119">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="120"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection Belgium, you had socialized medicine, you also had a system whereby poor children were offered what they called Fresh Air Camp experience. </sentence><sentence id="121">And you would be able to go away for about two weeks to a Fresh Air Camp to kind of be physically rehabilitated, get good food, get fresh air so that we'd stay healthy. </sentence><sentence id="122">So, I was sent to one camp for two weeks and one of my sisters was sent to another camp. </sentence><sentence id="123">And I remember the morning, this is very clear in my mind, the morning of May 10, 1940. </sentence><sentence id="124">We were sitting and, to the best of my recollection, having breakfast in the dining room, and the radio was playing some music, the music was stopped and an announcement was made that the German armies are walking into Belgium. </sentence><sentence id="125">Which shocked the counselors, everyone, they practically jumped out of their seats. </sentence><sentence id="126">And rushed us to finish our breakfast. </sentence><sentence id="127">Took us back to the dorms, we had to pack our little bags, they got us onto buses and took us back to Antwerp. </sentence><sentence id="128">I got there, I remember getting to Antwerp and I remember the streets being full of people, rushing back and forth and talking. </sentence><sentence id="129">It was very chaotic. </sentence><sentence id="130">Very chaotic. </sentence><sentence id="131">Almost, you know looking back on it now, is I can understand it, what happened is everybody was caught by surprise. </sentence><sentence id="132">Nobody expected it. </sentence><sentence id="133">And people were packing up wagons, and this holds true for both the Christian and the Jewish population. </sentence><sentence id="134">Everyone was running. </sentence><sentence id="135">Because from what I learned later on, is the Belgians were as afraid of the Germans as anybody else would be, at the time. </sentence><sentence id="136">Because during World War IL, there was a lot of resistance in Belgium and...World War I, I'm sorry, I apologize. </sentence><sentence id="137">World War I. There was a lot of resistance in Belgium against the Germans. </sentence><sentence id="138">And, from what I heard at the time, was that the, a lot of torturing took place. </sentence><sentence id="139">So Belgians were tortured and they were frightened. </sentence><sentence id="140">I don't have, myself, any specific cases that I could document, but it's sort of one of these known facts within the country. </sentence><sentence id="141">So, everybody was running. </sentence><sentence id="142">Now, we had a slight problem. </sentence><sentence id="143">My mother and the two of us. </sentence><sentence id="144">By then, of course, remember I said my father was on a ship. </sentence><sentence id="145">Meanwhile, unbeknownst to us, my father's ship in "38, had docked in Canada and he had a sister who lived in This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="146">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="147"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection New York, who had been sent there after World War I because her father had been killed on the front and there was an aunt in New York who was willing to take in the little girl and raise her. </sentence><sentence id="148">So, my father called her from Canada and she says, have you heard? </sentence><sentence id="149">This was after November of 1938, have you heard what happened in Germany? </sentence><sentence id="150">And my father says, no, what are you talking about?She says, don't go back. </sentence><sentence id="151">He says, what do you mean, don't go back? </sentence><sentence id="152">I've got my wife, I've got the two children, I've got to go back. </sentence><sentence id="153">And she urged him to stay and she sent someone for him and they illegally brought him into the United States. </sentence><sentence id="154">I shouldn't even say this, but he became legalized. </sentence><sentence id="155">He eventually entered the American Army, served honorably and was honorably discharged. </sentence><sentence id="156">As soon as he got to New York and settled down, they started making arrangements to bring us to the United States. </sentence><sentence id="157">That, they encountered great difficulty. </sentence><sentence id="158">First of all, my father wasn't here legally, as yet. </sentence><sentence id="159">Secondly, we, even if my uncle and aunt made the arrangements to bring us, we fell under the Rumanian quota. </sentence><sentence id="160">The Rumanian quota, as for most Eastern European Jews, was very long. </sentence><sentence id="161">It could sometimes take up to 10 years, waiting to come. </sentence><sentence id="162">And I came across something that was very interesting here in the United States, in the immigration department of the years "37 through "40, immigrants were listed by countries, except for one group. </sentence><sentence id="163">One group was listed as Hebrews. </sentence><sentence id="164">I'll show it to you later. </sentence><sentence id="165">But, anyway, getting back to 1940. </sentence><sentence id="166">I had been sent to the summer camp as did, my second sister was sent. </sentence><sentence id="167">So, two of us had been away. </sentence><sentence id="168">I was back now, the little one, the youngest was back. </sentence><sentence id="169">The middle one wasn't back yet. </sentence><sentence id="170">Now, mother tried desperately to reach the camp. </sentence><sentence id="171">We didn't have a phone in our home. </sentence><sentence id="172">She had to go to a shop to get, actually, most of the phones were at the post office, to try to call. </sentence><sentence id="173">Somehow, she couldn't get through. </sentence><sentence id="174">And had absolutely no knowledge where my middle sister was. </sentence><sentence id="175">Someone with a car and a trundle seat in the back, getting ready to escape to France, because that's where everybody was heading, everybody was heading towards Northern France, offered us a seat if we would just go right away. </sentence><sentence id="176">And my This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="177">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="178"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection mother had a terrible dilemma. </sentence><sentence id="179">Does she take two of us and go, does she wait for the third one and get stuck and lose all the children, as well? </sentence><sentence id="180">And I learned later, of course, at that time I didn't know, although she talked about it, I had a vague recollection of what she was telling me. </sentence><sentence id="181">Because I remember her saying, Florika(ph), that's a diminutive in Belgium for Flora, we have to try to find Charlotte so we can leave. </sentence><sentence id="182">But, I remember her also saying, if I can't find her, maybe we should go anyway and see if we can find her later on. </sentence><sentence id="183">And, while she was pondering this question, which I now as a mother and a grandmother, I realize it's one of the most difficult ones you ever have to do, and I hope that no mother ever has to ponder this kind of dilemma. </sentence><sentence id="184">She kept talking, but at the same time she started packing some little bags. </sentence><sentence id="185">My youngest sister at the time had the measles and she had a high fever, which was another problem. </sentence><sentence id="186">The people who had the car kept saying, we're leaving, we're not waiting any more. </sentence><sentence id="187">And she kept begging them, wait a little while longer, maybe they'll bring my Charlotte. </sentence><sentence id="188">Finally, they said, no, we're going. </sentence><sentence id="189">And she made a decision. </sentence><sentence id="190">She told one of the neighbors who had decided not to go, to wait out the war or whatever was coming, she says, if my Charlotte comes, please keep her for us. </sentence><sentence id="191">And we got into the car, into the trundle seat in the back, it was an open seat, and we, we went. </sentence><sentence id="192">So, it was the two of us and my mom. </sentence><sentence id="193">And her idea was that if we can get to France, maybe to Calais(ph), and maybe get a ship to Britain, Great Britain, maybe from there, and she was, pure fantasy. </sentence><sentence id="194">We had no Visas, nothing. </sentence><sentence id="195">But, somehow, this is the plan that she had made. </sentence><sentence id="196">From Britain to get to the United States. </sentence><sentence id="197">So, we went. </sentence></p></dialogue>

the port. </sentence><sentence id="369">And we were, our plan was at that point, mom decided, well, maybe we shouldn't just go to the port to try to get to Great Britain, maybe we should just try to get to Paris, maybe that would be safer. </sentence><sentence id="370">So, we were in the railroad station, and I remember being very tired and we had slept on our suitcases in the station and then we decided to just abandon one suitcase because mom had to carry my little sister who was four, and who, not quite, this was in May and she wasn't four until the following, the next month, June. </sentence><sentence id="371">What's happening to my English? </sentence><sentence id="372">It's funny, when I get emotional, I lose my ability to speak. </sentence><sentence id="373">We left one suitcase in the railroad station. </sentence><sentence id="374">I remember we hid it behind a corner because we were afraid someone would see us and run after us and tell us we left a suitcase. </sentence><sentence id="375">We thought that was illegal. </sentence><sentence id="376">We then went to the port and we, I sat on a suitcase, the one suitcase that we had left, with my little sister and my mother saw a big ship and they were loading soldiers on the ship. </sentence><sentence id="377">And she went over there and she spoke to someone. </sentence><sentence id="378">I didn't know who she spoke to, but she spoke to someone and when she came back she said, we're going to wait here, maybe they'll take us, they're going to go to England. </sentence><sentence id="379">It was a Red Cross ship. </sentence><sentence id="380">So, we sat. </sentence><sentence id="381">And we sat through the night and they kept loading wounded soldiers. </sentence><sentence id="382">By dawn, the man mom had spoken to walked over to us and he said, sorry, there's no room, it's full. </sentence><sentence id="383">And he couldn't take us. </sentence><sentence id="384">So, we tried to find a place to stay. </sentence><sentence id="385">As we were walking away, we saw people screaming, anybody want to go to England, there's a ship here, you can come, every, people just loaded onto a ship. </sentence><sentence id="386">I learned later that this was a ship that was abandoned and someone who knew how to steer just took the, just went in took the ship and invited people to come onto it.

other side facing the water. </sentence><sentence id="396">And, I'm saying this for a reason, what happened, once the ship was full, suddenly the tide went down as it typically does towards evening, and the ship tilted. </sentence><sentence id="397">The people on the other side started sliding down because the ship kept tilting. </sentence><sentence id="398">We ended up sitting on the cabin wall.

were all pulled up. </sentence><sentence id="402">From there we found a church, we gave up on going to England. </sentence><sentence id="403">We found a church and the Red Cross was giving out milk for children and things like that, so we got a little milk and then we went out to try to find a place to stay. </sentence><sentence id="404">As we were walking the street, the sirens came on and we ended up in a shelter, a bomb shelter. </sentence><sentence id="405">We stayed there for awhile, when the clear siren rang, mom said, you know what, you stay here with Betty, I'll go find us a place to stay. </sentence><sentence id="406">So, she left me in the shelter and I sat there by myself with my little sister. </sentence><sentence id="407">And I sat and I waited and I waited and I waited.

nothing to give her. </sentence><sentence id="410">So, the streets were deserted and they were fairly dark, and I walked screaming, mamma, mamma, mamma, all of a sudden I hear someone calling, Flora, Flora, Flora. </sentence><sentence id="411">Mom had forgotten where she had left us, because we didn't know Calais(ph). </sentence><sentence id="412">So, she was walking the streets hoping that I would have left the shelter maybe, and she kept calling and hoping that I would hear and I was calling, so we did find each other. </sentence><sentence id="413">At that point, we went, found another church, well, to make a long story short, because this was lengthy, we ended up in Bulangsumere(ph). </sentence><sentence id="414">In Bulangsumere(ph) we stayed put. </sentence><sentence id="415">By then the German Army had walked into Northern France, and we got stuck in Bulangsumere(ph), so we stayed there, we found a place to stay with a woman who had a bar and mom helped her so that we could

had five English lessons, so I was elected to ask the questions, where is this and where is that. </sentence><sentence id="3180">So, that was the extent of my knowledge of English.

that, I just kept, basically, I worked. </sentence><sentence id="3207">I mean, literally, that was my life. </sentence><sentence id="3208">My home, my family and work. </sentence><sentence id="3209">Then for awhile there, my second child, my husband was promoted and I could be a homemaker for awhile, so I was a homemaker, but I wanted certain things, like music lessons with the best of teachers and everything that was good for my children, so I started using my dressmaking skills because I didn't want to leave the children because I didn't have parents at home and I felt that my children should have a mother at home. </sentence><sentence id="3210">But I wanted money. </sentence><sentence id="3211">So, I became a dressmaker again at home. </sentence><sentence id="3212">And

</sentence><sentence id="3220">And then, but meanwhile, I never had a high school diploma. </sentence><sentence id="3221">When my son was, there were two incidents that drove me to improve myself in other areas. </sentence><sentence id="3222">One of them was, I still had a fairly deep accent and I didn't realize to what degree because my husband never said anything. </sentence><sentence id="3223">Once in awhile people would kind of make fun, but by that time, it didn't bother me that much. </sentence><sentence id="3224">One day my little one came home from first grade crying.

when you come to school, don't talk. </sentence><sentence id="3228">Everybody says you talk funny. </sentence><sentence id="3229">So, my child wasn't going to be an outsider, so I started working with my husband and improving my accent, that's why I have a New York accent. </sentence><sentence id="3230">And fighting my accent, that was one thing. </sentence><sentence id="3231">Then one day, I realized that someday the children are going to ask me if I have, if mamma has a high school diploma. </sentence><sentence id="3232">And I didn't want to have to lie to my children. </sentence><sentence id="3233">So, I went to see my, but, you know, there was one element in all this, is that I, basically, I was very much of a loner. </sentence><sentence id="3234">I did things. </sentence><sentence id="3235">Like, I, as I said, I became part of the community, I worked at the school as a volunteer at the library, I, at the synagogue I volunteered, I became a den mother and all that, but, yet, I was a loner. </sentence><sentence id="3236">I had no time for friendships. </sentence><sentence id="3237">But, I think it wasn't so much that I had no time, I think I had become so comfortable going my own way, going all the way back when the children laughed at me after school and I isolated myself. </sentence><sentence id="3238">I worked and started teaching myself English. </sentence><sentence id="3239">That it became a pattern. </sentence><sentence id="3240">In fact, I'm still accused of being a workaholic. </sentence><sentence id="3241">I'm supposed to be retired, but I work all the time. </sentence><sentence id="3242">And I think you develop a pattern. </sentence><sentence id="3243">But, anyway, I went to see my little girl's kindergarten teacher and I said, look, this is between us, I want to tell you something, maybe you can help me. </sentence><sentence id="3244">See, because I had talked to my husband, my husband kept saying, Flora, you're a smart girl, you don't have to prove anything to anybody, you don't need it. </sentence><sentence id="3245">But, I wanted it. </sentence><sentence id="3246">So, she says, you can get a high school diploma two ways.
