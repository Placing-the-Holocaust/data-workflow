<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="144">A: Maybe a day or two. </sentence><sentence id="145">Because maybe I wouldn't be starved to that point of dying, but I completely gave up, because I thought there was no other way. </sentence><sentence id="146">There's nothing left. </sentence><sentence id="147">Sooner or later, we all will be dead. </sentence><sentence id="148">This is the end of it. </sentence><sentence id="149">So, just giving up on everything. </sentence><sentence id="150">USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0044 6 No food, no water, nothing. </sentence><sentence id="151">Nowhere to turn. </sentence><sentence id="152">There -- There -- Outside the barbed wire, there was kohlrabi -- I probably mentioned that too, the piles kohlrabi that were decomposed, that people there still risking their lives to get one of those squash things, a smelly things to eat. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="162">Q: What are those? </sentence><sentence id="163">Kohlrabi, what -- what is it? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="166">A: It's like -- What can I say? </sentence><sentence id="167">It's a thing that you used to feed animals. </sentence><sentence id="168">And I know it was -- in Europe it's called kohlrabi, I don't know how to translate this into English, up to this day, I don't know. </sentence><sentence id="169">But that's supposed to have been the people's food. </sentence><sentence id="170">It was warm in April, you know. </sentence><sentence id="171">The sun was beating down on that. </sentence><sentence id="172">The kohlrabi was decomposed. </sentence><sentence id="173">People were risking their lives, actually, trying to get one, and they were shot. </sentence><sentence id="174">They were shot to death, almost on the minute of liberation, because they were so desperate to get this. </sentence><sentence id="175">But I was never one of the brave, to go and risk like that. </sentence><sentence id="176">I was a very timid girl, and I -- I would say the honest truth, my sister was the organizer. </sentence><sentence id="177">If it wouldn't be for her, maybe I wouldn't be alive, because she worked in a different place, where she had more access to food. </sentence><sentence id="178">And she always used to smuggle into the camp, some of it for me, which was a great help. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="192">Q: After all that you had been through for all those years -- </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="193">A: Yes. </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="194">Q: -- and all that happened to you, why is it at this particular time -- you say you had given up? </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="201">Q: No, just before. </sentence><sentence id="202">You said you had, you know -- </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="203">A: Because I could see that there was no hel -- no help coming from nowhere. </sentence><sentence id="204">Nothing. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="207">Where do we go? </sentence><sentence id="208">Surrounded by barbed wire and dead corpses. </sentence><sentence id="209">And you walked around, and -- and people were just dying right in front of you. </sentence><sentence id="210">What was waiting for us? </sentence><sentence id="211">The same thing, you know? </sentence><sentence id="212">So it's just -- you might as well, sooner or later, because there's no other way. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="219">Q: But you had -- didn't you have indications that the Germans were losing the war at that point? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="221">A: Oh yes, we know that. </sentence><sentence id="222">We know they were losing the war, especially when I was in Hamburg, then we were still working there on the streets, you know? </sentence><sentence id="223">Th-The fliers, the Allied fliers, they were coming three, four, five times a day, and we worked there. </sentence><sentence id="224">Like it says in my interview, next to a radar station, we could hear that radar turning and beeping, and the sirens going on. </sentence><sentence id="225">They were here. </sentence><sentence id="226">We could -- We could hear the bombs flying, and everything. </sentence><sentence id="227">And the city of Hamburg was one rubble on top of the other. </sentence><sentence id="228">That's the way it looked. </sentence><sentence id="229">So we knew no -- no country in condition -- in condition like that could win a war. </sentence><sentence id="230">It was impossible for them. </sentence><sentence id="231">But the question was, are we -- are we - - will we be able to live -- to be -- survive this? </sentence><sentence id="232">That was the question. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="245">Q: Did you talk much with your sister or your other friends there about how the war was going, and -- and how long you thought it would be before it ended, before it was over? </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="304">A: Yes, it did, but it seems like we were always the ones that had this willpower. </sentence><sentence id="305">When we went to work, we got our portion of bread in the morning, some people ate it right away, they were so hungry. </sentence><sentence id="306">We were also the same way hungry, but my sister and I, my friends, we never ate the whole portion, we always divided it, because I wanted to have the reassurance that I have something to eat for later. </sentence><sentence id="307">We knew nothing else was coming. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="308">St -- On the -- On the bowshtella we -- we never got anything unless we worked -- one time -- you worked for a couple weeks in a village across the Elba. </sentence><sentence id="309">The village was called Kronst, and we were loading bricks on a boat. </sentence><sentence id="310">But that was also -- you had to be lucky to be picked for this. </sentence><sentence id="311">You see, we were fighting -- everybody was fighting to go to the village, because the local people brought food for us, and there was more to eat, so it was a great big fight in the morning to get first in line, to be picked for this place. </sentence><sentence id="312">We were always divided in different working groups. </sentence><sentence id="313">Most of the time, a majority of the time, I was in Hamburg, cleaning the streets. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="314">   USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0044 10 </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="315">Q: Before liberation, at the end, you -- you talked about, in your video interview, how the -- there were, you know, still, of course, you know, German guards there, but they were wearing surrender armbands, and -- </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="316">A: Tho-Those were not German guards any more. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2228">A: Well, I would say, in the beginning maybe not, because the closeness with the families was always there, even in -- and the other people's lives here. </sentence><sentence id="2229">People were much closer in families than they are now. </sentence><sentence id="2230">Children and parents were together, things were done together, and I was always invited to people's homes, and to dinners, and stuff like that. </sentence><sentence id="2231">Everybody sat down at the table, the children were there, our children were there. </sentence><sentence id="2232">And s -  ontectnetonancedjusetneey for tarher biormatoerabouttfisestecion USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0044 63 - S -- conversing afterwards. </sentence><sentence id="2233">So it was like ri -- somehow, the family that we didn't have, it was compensating very much. </sentence><sentence id="2234">The only hard time was when it came to our holidays. </sentence><sentence id="2235">So, it was very hard to take, because you sat at the table, and you thought of the wonderful times you had at home, surrounded by everybody, and by all the tradition. </sentence><sentence id="2236">And all of a sudden, all of this is gone, and that's what it is, hard facts of life. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2248">Q: Mm-hm. </sentence><sentence id="2249">Is there anything else that we haven't talked about, that you'd like to talk about? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2252">A: You know, off-hand, I can't think of it, but probably by the time you're gone, I would say I should have said this, or I should have said that, and that's what probably will happen. </sentence><sentence id="2253">I just -- I don't know. </sentence><sentence id="2254">I know one thing, when we get old, we survivors who think time is running too fast for us, we try to do so much more, to be -- that it should be left behind. </sentence><sentence id="2255">You -- You know, my two daughters never got married, I don't have any grandchildren, it's hard to take this. </sentence><sentence id="2256">They just elected to be career women. </sentence><sentence id="2257">Yeah, I would like to have some grandchildren, somebody left to remember everything, but then I compensate myself at the mind that all of this is recorded, and some people will know about it anyway. </sentence><sentence id="2258">So this -- I think this is a very good thing that is happening to me. </sentence><sentence id="2259">And many schools also tape me, and they have that on their files. </sentence><sentence id="2260">And I go, for the fourth time, I went to Milwaukee, to Marquette University. </sentence><sentence id="2261">And they always tape it, they considered this a lecture. </sentence><sentence id="2262">And every year, when I come, they make a tape of whatever I say, and they file in their files there, so that -- that's something that I think is very good. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="2263"> USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0044 64 </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2264">Q: You know, it -- it has been so many years, and the people who did the live through it, who are still alive, obviously are not going to be around forever. </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2265">A: Of course. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2274">A: I think maybe for awhile it will persist, but I'm afraid with time, it might just be something in the archives that now and then, someone will look it up for some reference. </sentence><sentence id="2275">This is the way it probably will be, sadly. </sentence><sentence id="2276">I say that very sadly. </sentence><sentence id="2277">In the beginning, maybe, the first several years after we are gone, it will be still carried on, but later on, I don't know. </sentence><sentence id="2278">That's what I think will happen. </sentence></p></dialogue>
