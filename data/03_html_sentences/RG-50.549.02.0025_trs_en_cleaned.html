<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="40">A: Sure. </sentence><sentence id="41">P'll be happy to do that. </sentence><sentence id="42">My maiden name was Schild, that's spelled S-c-h-i-l-d.My father's name was Siegfried Schild, good German name and he came from a very small town on the Mian river, by the name of Hessdorf. </sentence><sentence id="43">And he was a butcher and in those days, families had to marry off their sons and daughters for a purpose, so since he was a butcher, a -- my grandparents looked for an opportunity for him to marry into a butcher shop. </sentence><sentence id="44">It was as simple as that. </sentence><sentence id="45">That's the way it was in the olden days. </sentence><sentence id="46">And there was this Paula Yoksburger in Anspach, who was one of five daughters and her parents, my grandparents, Sophie and Gabriel Yoksburger were very hard up to marry off their five daughters without money. </sentence><sentence id="47">You see, in those days you needed to have money to marry off a daughter. </sentence><sentence id="48">And finally, they knew of this young man in Hessdorf who was    USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0025 4 looking for a -- what they called a shiduch, a -- a match between himself and someone who was somewheres in the butcher business. </sentence><sentence id="49">And it worked out fine, even though my mother was two years older and I'm sure there was no great love, but it was a marriage in those days that was called very appropriate and very good and it -- it was fine. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="61">Q: What did your maternal grandparents do? </sentence><sentence id="62">Wa-Was the -- your maternal grandfather a butcher? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="65">A: Yes. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="67">Q: Oh. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="69">A: Yes, he had a butcher shop in Anspach, no sons and he needed to have a son-in-law that would step into his butcher shop. </sentence><sentence id="70">And, as a matter of fact, he died very soon after his daughter's sa -- his -- his daughter Paula was married to this young butcher boy from Hessdorf and it -- it worked out just wonderfully. </sentence><sentence id="71">He died and the son-in-law stepped into the butcher shop in Anspach and there was my mother and father and soon after -- a year after the marriage there was one daughter, my sister Freidel and two and a half years after that, I arrived, Gerda. </sentence><sentence id="72">And the only regret my father had up to his dying day, that he didn't have a son. </sentence><sentence id="73">In Anspach, it would have been necessary to hand the butcher shop over to a son. </sentence><sentence id="74">But as it turned out, that reason fell completely away and I guess he got over not having a son. </sentence><sentence id="75">He -- he -- he was okay with his two daughters. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="83">Q: Do you know anything more about your family in Anspach, how long they had been there and had been butchers? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="85"> USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0025 5 </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="86">A: Yes, I did a little research on my family at one time. </sentence><sentence id="87">The Schild family -- the ones that lived in Hessdorf, my father's side of the family, apparently came out of Spain in the 17th or 18th century with that wave of emigration that -- that -- that was triggered by the e-emancipation in Spain. </sentence><sentence id="88">And apparently that's where my family comes from, because my Jewish na -- my Hebrew name is Sprinza, which is Esperanza for -- for a young girl. </sentence><sentence id="89">And apparently I had a grandmother or a great-grandmother or some female ancestor -- ancestress I would say, a female ancestor, who -- who was a Spaniard. </sentence><sentence id="90">And apparently that's what happened on my father's side. </sentence><sentence id="91">On my mother's side, the story is that we came -- that they came from a very small town called Yoksburg and as you probably know, in - - in the 18th century, the -- the Jews finally got last names. </sentence><sentence id="92">Up to then it was Moshe the butcher or Jakob -- Yakob the shoemaker, they didn't have names. </sentence><sentence id="93">And apparently, when they -- when the time came, when the decree was passed down that the Jews had to have names, many of them took the name of their town -- of the town they lived in. </sentence><sentence id="94">So that's why you have so many Berlinner and Hamburger and -- and of small tow -- Frankfurter or Kissinger. </sentence><sentence id="95">These are all people that came from particular towns and that's how my grandparents were named Yoksburger, because they had lived in a small town called Yoksburg, which is very close to Anspach. </sentence><sentence id="96">You must understand that, in opposition to America, where the Jews are all clustered and -- and congregated in large cities, this was not the case in Europe. </sentence><sentence id="97">In Europe, Poland, Germany and all the many countries of Europe, the Jewish communities -- the strong Jewish communities were in the small towns, because there the people left them in peace. </sentence><sentence id="98">There was always anti-Semitism, but   USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0025 6 in small towns, very frequently they were able to buy themselves the protection of the -- of the lord. </sentence><sentence id="99">They were called Markgraffen or whoever owned these little towns and by being servile to these feudal lords and being useful to them, they were able to get the protection and they settled in those small towns and they remained very Orthodox, many of them. </sentence><sentence id="100">There was nothing else, it was Orthodoxy or nothing. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="117">Q: Would you describe the community in Anspach as -- as -- </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="118">A: Mm-hm. </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="119">Q: -- a strong community by the time that you are aware of it as -- as [indecipherable] </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="120">A: Yes. </sentence><sentence id="121">Yes, I would. </sentence><sentence id="122">We had the -- we had a rabbi who was a -- a leader in -- in -- in the -- in the ge -- in the European German commu -- Jewish community. </sentence><sentence id="123">His name was Eli Munck. </sentence><sentence id="124">He wrote several seminal books on -- on the pr -- the prayers, the world of prayer for instance and the call of the Torah. </sentence><sentence id="125">He was just a very great light in -- in Jewish intelligencia. </sentence><sentence id="126">And I -- I'd like to say this, which many people forget. </sentence><sentence id="127">Th-Th-Th-The German rabbis were able to become so great and to devote themselves to writing because they were not hired by the community. </sentence><sentence id="128">Here, a rabbi is beholden to his board of directors and to his president and to the wives, in order to keep his job and he has very little time to -- to -- to be independent, to think stuff on his own. </sentence><sentence id="129">But in Europe -- in Germany particularly, religion was a state -- spa -- state sponsored affair. </sentence><sentence id="130">Each one of us had to pay a religion tax and the Jewish religion tax went to pay the rabbis and upkeep the synagogues and the other -- the Christian religion tax went their way. </sentence><sentence id="131">So the rabbis were very free and we were very fortunate to have just two fantastic rabbis in a row. </sentence><sentence id="132">When I    </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="146"> USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0025 7 was very young, our rabbi was Pinhusk Horn, which was also a name that stands forever in -- in -- in Jewish history of Germany. </sentence><sentence id="147">And then we had this wonderful Eli Munck, who devoted himself to writing and to bringing up the youngsters, because he knew that the future of Judaism was in the youngsters. </sentence><sentence id="148">I -- I'd like to say one other thing that only occurred to me very recently. </sentence><sentence id="149">Th-The rabbis in Germany did not urge the Jews to leave and I remember my parents holding that somewhat against Rabbi Munck. </sentence><sentence id="150">Why didn't he say, "Go find yourself another place to go to." </sentence><sentence id="151">He never did. </sentence><sentence id="152">And it only occurred to me very recently that this was for the obvious reason that the rabbis were state employed, you see? </sentence><sentence id="153">Do you understand what I'm saying? </sentence><sentence id="154">They couldn't say that or they -- or Hitler would have knocked them off in a minute. </sentence><sentence id="155">The rabbis were completely dominated by the state. </sentence><sentence id="156">And -- and the outgrowth of that thought is thank God for the separation of state and church in this country. </sentence><sentence id="157">So you -- you live a long time before these things really dawn on you. </sentence><sentence id="158">You know, we adored this rabbi and we believed everything he said and we did everything he said. </sentence><sentence id="159">But he didn't tell us to leave, you see? </sentence><sentence id="160">Think about that. </sentence><sentence id="161">Is -- it's really -- it's a revelation when that thought came to me. </sentence><sentence id="162">He himself left with his family, after awhile and saved himself and his many children, but he didn't tell us to leave. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="180">Q: How did that revelation change how you thought about him or -- or shift how you processed the whole experience? </sentence><sentence id="181">Because certainly -- </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="182">A: That's -- </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="183">Q: -- his story, Rabbi Munck's story is something that you mentioned several times in the previous interview -- </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="189">Q: -- and there was something kind of nagging, I would say. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="191">A: Yeah, first of all, I want to spell his name, so people know who I'm talking about. </sentence><sentence id="192">It was Eli Munck, M-u-n-c-k. Dr. Eli Munck and he is very famous rabbi. </sentence><sentence id="193">He left and went to Paris afterwards and founded a -- a fine, deeply religious Jewish community in Paris, Ru cardet. </sentence><sentence id="194">And I'm still very friendly with many of his children. </sentence><sentence id="195">Now, how did it affect me? </sentence><sentence id="196">I adored the man, you see? </sentence><sentence id="197">In -- in -- in Germany, the rabbi was somewhere between your father and God, equi-distance. </sentence><sentence id="198">And I particularly liked the Munck family. </sentence><sentence id="199">I was like a child in their house myself. </sentence><sentence id="200">And it didn't change my feelings toward him. </sentence><sentence id="201">Also, one of the reasons it didn't change my feelings toward him was when I was liberated -- and now I'm jumping ahead several years -- when I was liberated to Switzerland and ended up in Montrou -- Seulemontre at Laisavont, I found out very soon that Eli Munck and his whole family had fled from Paris and had established themselves in Geneva. </sentence><sentence id="202">And once I knew that, I got in touch with him and he with me. </sentence><sentence id="203">And he was the first person I saw again, of my for-former life. </sentence><sentence id="204">You can't argue with feelings, you see? </sentence><sentence id="205">I loved the man and here I saw him again, after all I had gone through and I credited him in a way with my res -- religiosity. </sentence><sentence id="206">He gave me that strong belief in God and he guided me through my younger years. </sentence><sentence id="207">My parents were busy and making a living and were very simple people, no education. </sentence><sentence id="208">And he -- he gave me a lot. </sentence><sentence id="209">I -- I didn't change my feelings toward him, I have to say. </sentence><sentence id="210">It should have, but i-it didn't. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="258">A: No -- well, he was -- I -- I have to tell you a very funny story. </sentence><sentence id="259">When we came to Switzerland -- and I like to talk about that at some more length later on, but just now, in connection with my great friendship with Eli Munck, when I was liberated to USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0025 10 Switzerland, we -- that whole transport, were again put into a lager -- into a concentration lager, it was nothing like what I just came out of, it was the grand hotel in mont -- in -- in Seulemontre, in Laisavont. </sentence><sentence id="260">I might have a picture of it, it was a gorgeous hotel that was emptied out for us, so that we -- these 12 hun -- it wasn't the whole group, it was maybe 300 people, could be put up in great comfort with this gorgeous view of Lake Geneva below us and Montplant on the other sides and -- and all the mountains around us, so don't think it was a -- a concentration camp, but it was a concentrating lager so that we could be controlled. </sentence><sentence id="261">We couldn't roam around. </sentence><sentence id="262">We had to check in and check out, we had guards on the doors. </sentence><sentence id="263">We had to always be in -- tell them where we went. </sentence><sentence id="264">And so, I wanted to visit my beloved Rabbi Munck in Geneva. </sentence><sentence id="265">And somehow -- I don't know how, I got myself a ticket to -- to go there on the -- on the train. </sentence><sentence id="266">It's -- it's very -- it's a very short distance, as you know. </sentence><sentence id="267">It's just a -- a little bit around on the lake of Geneva. </sentence><sentence id="268">And I asked for permission to -- to go and the permission was denied. </sentence><sentence id="269">And you know what I did? </sentence><sentence id="270">I left secretly, on my own, to see my beloved rabbi. </sentence><sentence id="271">And you know what happened?Two Swiss policemen caught me on the train station in Montrou as I was just about to step onto that train and took me back and put me into what was like a -- a little solitary confinement. </sentence><sentence id="272">Again, in great luxury, but it was a locked door and a locked window and I had my food passed in and out. </sentence><sentence id="273">This because I needed so badly to see the rabbi and his family. </sentence><sentence id="274">Can you believe it? </sentence></p></dialogue>

</sentence><sentence id="2179">And in that way I'm very glad that I moved to small town, but that was very se -- very secondary, only after I lived there for many years in -- in Lewiston, Maine,

And he certainly didn't look like a liberator. </sentence><sentence id="2323">The liberators by then, all had a certain look. </sentence><sentence id="2324">They were a little bit on the heavy side, gray hair -- you know, salt of the earth kind of people. </sentence><sentence id="2325">And he didn't look like that, he looked quite elegant and quite aloof and I  ontectnetonancedjusietneey for tarher biormatberabouttfisstecion USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0025 65 thought, ""Who is he?" </sentence><sentence id="2326">So I said, "Well, no -- no time is lost in finding out." </sentence><sentence id="2327">And I marched right up to him, after all, I acted a little bit like the -- like the hostess in that's -- in that context and I said, "I'm Gerda Haas. </sentence><sentence id="2328">Welcome to our reception. </sentence><sentence id="2329">May I ask who you are? </sentence><sentence id="2330">Are you one of our survivors or one of our liberators?" </sentence><sentence id="2331">And he -- he clicked his heels you know and gave me a salute. </sentence><sentence id="2332">He was in civilian clothes, of course, just with a military insignia on his lapel. </sentence><sentence id="2333">And he said, "I am Colonel Retired Manfred Kelman, US Regiment --" and I think he named it, which I have forgotten by then. </sentence><sentence id="2334">And I was taken aback and I said, "So you are one of our liberators?" </sentence><sentence id="2335">He said, "No. </sentence><sentence id="2336">I am a survivor. </sentence><sentence id="2337">I was in Theresienstadt." </sentence><sentence id="2338">And I was completely baffled. </sentence><sentence id="2339">He didn't look old enough and he didn't look Jewish and he didn't look like a survivor. </sentence><sentence id="2340">Neither did he act like one. </sentence><sentence id="2341">So he and I huddled a little bit, because I couldn't spend too much time, but we made a date and we met later for coffee. </sentence><sentence id="2342">And the fellow tells me he was a Mishling. </sentence><sentence id="2343">He was brought up by a Jewish father and an -- and an Aryan SS mother. </sentence><sentence id="2344">And he was 14 years old when the Nazis finally yanked him out of his house. </sentence><sentence id="2345">Up to now his mother could keep him and kept her eye on him and he was a little bit protected. </sentence><sentence id="2346">Also, as he told me later, he had a miserable childhood. </sentence><sentence id="2347">He was neither Jewish nor Aryan. </sentence><sentence id="2348">So anyway, by the age of 14, he was sent to Theresienstadt and there he was again miserable, because he wasn't a Jew and he had to wear the star all of a sudden and he had no friends. </sentence><sentence id="2349">There was nobody 14 years old in Theresienstadt. </sentence><sentence id="2350">And so finally at the -- at the end of the war, his mother sent an -- an -- a still functioning army car to pick him up out of Theresienstadt. </sentence><sentence id="2351">But by gosh, the guy was in Theresienstadt just like me, a prisoner of the Nazis, with his star on his left USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0025 66 hand side. </sentence><sentence id="2352">And of course we became close friends. </sentence><sentence id="2353">I just couldn't get over it. </sentence><sentence id="2354">And as soon as he -- that finished it for him. </sentence><sentence id="2355">As soon as he could, he took -- his father died in concentration camp and he took his mother out and came to America. </sentence><sentence id="2356">And of course he was a youngster, so he got his education, enrolled into the army, rose to the level of Colonel, went back to fight the Nazis and retired to Maine because it was a nice state to retire in. </sentence><sentence id="2357">How do you like that story? </sentence><sentence id="2358">That's -- I should -- I should write that as a novel -- as a short story. </sentence><sentence id="2359">I've told it many times and it's just flabbergasting. </sentence><sentence id="2360">So that's again the envelope of -- of -- of the Holocaust, of my life. </sentence><sentence id="2361">And he was the nicest, nicest fellow. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2637">A: I-It's so little known that one of the tenets of Nazi ideology was of course that we shouldn't live. </sentence><sentence id="2638">We -- we should all be killed. </sentence><sentence id="2639">And that -- that is one of the laws of the -- of the Nazi party, the Jews have to be killed. </sentence><sentence id="2640">But then practicality took over and they figured as long as we can squeeze a little labor out of them, let's work around that basic law and make a second law. </sentence><sentence id="2641">And this law -- and I have it here, in -- in Xerox copy, th-the Wannsee Conference Law of 1942 states that when the people come to concentration camp, anyone under 18 is to be killed on arrival and anyone over 45 is to be killed on arrival. </sentence><sentence id="2642">And so they were. </sentence><sentence id="2643">So that narrow gap, between 18 and 45 was allowed to sort of kill themselves. </sentence><sentence id="2644">Die of natural causes, namely starvation and -- and h-hard labor and beatings and infections and finally then of course also, the gas chamber. </sentence><sentence id="2645">So this should not be forgotten. </sentence><sentence id="2646">So after we, who are now in our 70's, are gone, there are very few true survivors left, because of that ominous law of killing people under 18. </sentence><sentence id="2647">When I tell that to students, that -- they really sit up and -- and take notice. </sentence><sentence id="2648">It was really beastly. </sentence><sentence id="2649">It was really beastly. </sentence></p></dialogue>
