<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="257">Q: And why did you want to go to Germany? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="259">A: I--I'm not certain, but I imagine there was a lot of probably excitement and glamor attached to that adventure because remember at that time, I'd just gotten out of nursing school. </sentence><sentence id="260">Had no idea of what it was all about. </sentence><sentence id="261">22--or probably 23. </sentence><sentence id="262">I had no idea. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="267">Q: What-- </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="268">A: Never regretted a minute of it, but I had no idea. </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="269">Q: You knew there was some danger. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="279">A: Um-hum. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="281">Q: And then what happened? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="283">A: Went to San Antonio, Texas. </sentence><sentence id="284">And--oh, so--what did I do. </sentence><sentence id="285">Signed up--this was all done by mail because then in Arkansas, now, it's all going through--I really don't know where. </sentence><sentence id="286">So I--I did sign up and received a commission through the mail. </sentence><sentence id="287">The funniest thing was I didn't know I had a commission. </sentence><sentence id="288">This is all just very strange to me, and I thought I'd got it when I--I thought I would get it when I reached San Antonio for basic training, but actually I had it the minute that I received the assignment, and it was strange "cause I was on the train --we all had to stand up on a train. </sentence><sentence id="289">There were no seats. </sentence><sentence id="290">The trains were so full and there was a chaplain and a--and an enlisted man and I sharing one seat. </sentence><sentence id="291">The chaplain got it when he got on. </sentence><sentence id="292">He was very kind. </sentence><sentence id="293">And he said we'll all--it was about eight hours from my home to San Antonio. </sentence><sentence id="294">He said, "We'll share this seat" so we -- we actually --have to stand until it's our turn to sit in that one seat and --so as we were talking, they told me --this chaplain and this enlisted man had been in for awhile said, "You're already a second lieutenant." </sentence><sentence id="295">I thought that was very interesting. </sentence><sentence id="296">Anyhow --and they thought I was pretty naive so went on down to San Antonio and took basic training there, and I can't remember how much later but not long after that had orders for Camp Swift, Texas, with the 121st Semi-Mobile Evacuation Hospital was --I can't remember the word for that-- activating. </sentence><sentence id="297">Was activating. </sentence><sentence id="298">So the doctors and nurses and corpsmen from --and administrative people from around the nation and--I think it's probably primarily up here in the --in the East were gathering at San Antonio to activate this tent hospital, and from there we went to New York. </sentence><sentence id="299">After we were activated as a hospital, all of us were there, we went to New York by train. </sentence><sentence id="300">Everything's by train in those days, and stayed there a few days, and then at night --well, no, there had to be as much secrecy as possible then because we were going by ship to England, and they still had the U-boats, the Germans had U-boats in the Atlantic, so went by ship to England, and we had no idea where we were going, but I remember going onto the ship and the blackout, complete blackout, and you --suddenly you were on the ship. </sentence><sentence id="301">It's almost as if you didn't really know you were boarding the ship; but there we were, and I think we left, maybe sailed the next morning and took us five days to get to England, and we were in England and -- and that --I believe we were waiting for the --when was D-Day? </sentence><sentence id="302">Do you remember what day that was? </sentence><sentence id="303">I think we were waiting for --no, I guess it was the Battle of The Bulge or something. </sentence><sentence id="304">We were waiting for some real heavy activity to loosen up a little so that we could cross the Channel and go to France. </sentence><sentence id="305">Stayed there a few days and then we started -- and then we went to Luxembourg, and from Luxembourg I know one time another nurse and I and a doctor and a couple of corpsmen were sent to somewhere in Germany. </sentence><sentence id="306">At that time everything was "somewhere." </sentence><sentence id="307">No towns could be listed or anything so this was somewhere in Germany which from --and that from Luxembourg is a very, very short distance, and we went in one little old --one little Army ambulance at night. </sentence><sentence id="308">Of course it had been a blackout, and that was quite a trip because the --in a complete blackout, and they had --I guess--I don't know how they ran that ambulance but must have been very dim lights, so you could see a little bit but not much "cause anyway they came to a --a huge crater, bomb crater in the road, and the driver had to stop just short of that because he didn't have lights, he couldn't see, but he knew there was something there, and he got out--and he flashed --you had to flash your flashlights down to the ground. </sentence><sentence id="309">Never up or out but down to the ground, and I remember him flashing that around to see how big the crater was so he could go around it; and down in a ravine by the road we heard these flashes of lights and heard some kind of firing, some kind of skirmishing down there, and we finally reached our destination. </sentence><sentence id="310">Then the next morning we were really balled out for having come because it was so dangerous, but our commanding officer hadn't known that. </sentence><sentence id="311">Somehow the communications hadn't been so good so we got to this --where we were detached to this very small outfit, and they needed --they just needed help so badly. </sentence><sentence id="312">That's why we were detached there, and they had a lot of German wounded too. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="344">Q: Now, was this your first nursing activity? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="346">A: Yes. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="348">Q: Okay. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="350">A: No, no, no, no. </sentence><sentence id="351">No, we helped in England, I'm sorry. </sentence><sentence id="352">Should back up to England, but yes, in England we --we worked in a hospital there for a little while, and I can't remember how long, and those-those were --we had American casualties from a big, big battle. </sentence><sentence id="353">That may have been --I can't remember. </sentence><sentence id="354">Anyhow it was very heavy fighting, big battle, very important fighting at that time, and we had many American casualties. </sentence><sentence id="355">That's why we had to stay in England awhile to take care of them and wait for things to calm down a little bit in Germany and France, so that--that was it until we rejoined our own hospital from this little--whatever that was. </sentence><sentence id="356">It was not an evac hospital, smaller than that. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="364">Q: So in this little, little hospital-- </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="365">A: Yeah. </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="366">Q: --there were a lot of German wounded? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="368">A: And a lot of American wounded. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="370">Q: A lot of American. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="372">A: Uh-huh. </sentence><sentence id="373">And-- </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="374">Q: How was this for you as a very young, inexperienced nurse to see all these war casualties? </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="375">A: I think we lived from day-to-day. </sentence><sentence id="376">I -- I -- I know at that time I had no thought of the war ever ending. </sentence><sentence id="377">Perhaps some people did, I don't know, but I think for the most part all of us were living just by the day because we didn't know if we'd be moving out the next day or what would happen because we didn't --we kept our patients --we were not supposed to keep them over 24 hours and then they were sent back to the rear, so I think we lived essentially --everything was so fast, and perhaps we were moving so fast, everything happened so fast that we didn't really think about tomorrow. </sentence><sentence id="378">Now, I'm sure that people who were moving our little hospital for us had to plan all of that. </sentence><sentence id="379">You know, the logistics had to be tremendous, but the rest --the nurses and doctors and corpsmen just lived for that time. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="385">Q: Okay. </sentence><sentence id="386">So then you were moved to-- </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="387">A: We would follow where the fighting was, and that would be --well, we were advancing. </sentence><sentence id="388">There was no retreating. </sentence><sentence id="389">This was toward the end of the war. </sentence><sentence id="390">19--early part of 1944 so you see it was --no. </sentence><sentence id="391">The end of 1944. </sentence><sentence id="392">So it was --the war was winding down- -it was still very heavy fighting, but we were advancing constantly, and we were --so we had to move frequently, very frequently, and it was --I don't know how many times we moved, but it was --we'd always set up our tents in a field unless there might be a building handy that --that we could set up in which would be a --a real help for a hospital because I remember, you know, a dog could wander through the operating room in the tents, and that's just the way it was. </sentence><sentence id="393">Set up in muddy ground. </sentence><sentence id="394">No flooring, of course, for the tents. </sentence><sentence id="395">Just mud or dry --just dirt, whatever it happened to be at the time. </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="396">Q: And were you an operating room nurse or-- </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="397">A: No, no, I was just --no, I had just gotten out of --out of nursing school. </sentence><sentence id="398">No, I was a-- general duty they called it. </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="399">Q: Okay. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="401">A: Just --and as that you're put anywhere where you're needed. </sentence><sentence id="402">No specialty. </sentence><sentence id="403">So from there--at some point we were near--there --well, we were attached--by this time we were attached to the Third Army, to Patton's Third Army, and we were somewhere near where Patton was, and I don't really know where that was, and it couldn't have been very far from the--Buchenwald, the concentration camp Buchenwald. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="407">Q: Now, you were attached to -- </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="408">A: Patton's Third Army. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="410">Q: --Patton's Third Army. </sentence><sentence id="411">And your unit was? </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="420">A: So we were in --in --near Buchenwald, and Patton had been there. </sentence><sentence id="421">And Patton was a very tough old soldier, and he wanted everyone to visit in that area, within that area to visit Buchenwald to see what was there so they'd be --it would--become so furious. </sentence><sentence id="422">The war's still going on. </sentence><sentence id="423">Become so furious that--that it would make certainly better fighting men, determined, and I know our commanding officer thought it would not be the place for the women to --I think there were 30 or 33 of us women, very few of us. </sentence><sentence id="424">He did not want us to go there, but Patton said everyone would go, no exceptions, and so all of us had to go. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="434">A: No, we didn't but that would have meant that other --we --I don't remember all that-- we would have had to have gone in shifts. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="436">Q: Right, okay. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="438">A: And I think I must have been on the first shift because I know we were told that--that the --the camp had been liberated three days before we got there, so not very much --all they had --had been able to do was hand out food to --to the --to those who were surviving, and there were quite a few who were surviving, and they handed out food. </sentence><sentence id="439">Nothing had been done as far as I can think because the bodies were there. </sentence><sentence id="440">The crematory was still there. </sentence><sentence id="441">Gas chamber, everything was as it had been and --and I'm having flashbacks so --we went there on one --kind of a dismal day. </sentence><sentence id="442">Had to have been in the spring. </sentence><sentence id="443">Had no idea really --I mean you --you know, you've heard that this is going on, but --but you haven't known anyone who's seen it. </sentence><sentence id="444">You haven't seen the pictures because it's just been liberated, just now getting people in and getting the pictures, and so when we arrived there, I can't remember that we even spoke to each other. </sentence><sentence id="445">There were very few of us, so we had to have gone in shifts. </sentence><sentence id="446">Very few of us, and I can't remember even speaking to anybody because it was such a shock; but nobody broke down and wept or had hysterics, and I don't know if part of that was the training you've had as a medical group or not, but I just remember silence, and the shock is incredible and you --perhaps walk through in a bit of a daze because who can --who can assimilate to all of this. </sentence><sentence id="447">You can't. </sentence><sentence id="448">And we were shown through the camp. </sentence><sentence id="449">I don't remember by whom. </sentence><sentence id="450">Probably --   probably some of the soldiers who had liberated them, I'm not sure, but we were shown through the camp around the grounds, and the inmates who were there were still dressed in their striped uniforms and so happy, so filled with joy and trying so hard to do anything they could for us, and I think --I could be wrong here but I think it was both American and British who liberated Buchenwald, but I'm not certain, but all I saw were American soldiers there. </sentence><sentence id="451">And we went through the barracks, and you want me to describe the barracks? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="467">Q: Um-hum. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="469">A: They were wooden buildings, not very large at all, and they had --these were just for sleeping, and they had bunk beds, as I remember it, four high with just a few inches between each two bunks so that you --you just knew --there was just no way a --a person could turn over in the bunk. </sentence><sentence id="470">For them to change their position to turn over, I'm sure they had to slide out and start again. </sentence><sentence id="471">Just a --just probably the head cleared. </sentence><sentence id="472">I think that was about all to get four bunks high. </sentence><sentence id="473">And that just seemed terrible to us, you know, with no mattresses or things like that, none of the comforts. </sentence><sentence id="474">And there was one --we went through one of the barracks, and there were two men there still in their striped uniforms, and they were --you've heard the expression "skin and bones." </sentence><sentence id="475">Well, in this case for these inmates, that was literal. </sentence><sentence id="476">Absolutely literal. </sentence><sentence id="477">And they had been given some black bread by the Americans I'm sure, and they wanted to share it with us. </sentence><sentence id="478">Now, had we been older, more mature, we would have accepted as their guests because who had they been able to share with or had anything to share with? </sentence><sentence id="479">Or even talked with freely, but we thought how can we take their bread? </sentence><sentence id="480">That's all they had. </sentence><sentence id="481">And we refused. </sentence><sentence id="482">Later I thought had I been older, more mature, I would have handled it differently, but we did refuse that. </sentence><sentence id="483">Then we were shown the --at some point the crematoria --crematoria --I guess--is it crematory or crematorium? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="499">Q: Either one. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="501">A: With the bodies and, you know, ready to be cremated. </sentence><sentence id="502">We were shown the gas chambers and the stacks of bodies, naked bodies so high and the carts or wagons filled with them in addition to the stacks on the ground all around. </sentence><sentence id="503">Then we were taken to one of the Nazi administrator's offices, probably a commanding office, I'm not sure, and they pointed out this lamp shade made out of human skin, and it was a terrible thing. </sentence><sentence id="504">I'm about to cry. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="687">A: Because my generation is the last generation that had the --the firsthand contact, firsthand knowledge, and I know that there are people who believe it never happened, and I think there will be more who will refuse to believe it ever happened, and I think it's wonderful what the Holocaust Museum--the records they are keeping of this because I think it must be, must be kept for history, for the future generations, and I think it's great you're getting the interviews now because it--my --well, I say my generation is the last. </sentence><sentence id="688">Of course the children of the inmates in the concentration camp will have some memories. </sentence><sentence id="689">That's the next generation, but probably there are not too many of them and so I think it's very important. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="760">Q: But it was tough for you at the time to see that happening. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="870">Q: Did you ever talk with him about it? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="872">A: Very --no, I didn't really. </sentence><sentence id="873">I guess maybe not at all perhaps. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="876">Q: Do you keep in touch with any of the people that you were overseas with? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="878">A: Yes, I did --not now. </sentence><sentence id="879">I did, oh, for years, I did with two. </sentence><sentence id="880">Two special people. </sentence><sentence id="881">Actually three. </sentence><sentence id="882">Three. </sentence><sentence id="883">And then, you know, our --our paths have diverged and, oh, one of them is dead, and I did keep in contact with her until she died. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="890">Q: So even though you didn't talk about it, you were in contact with people-- </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="891">A: Um-hum. </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="892">Q: --who had been through what you had been through? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="894">A: Yes. </sentence><sentence id="895">We never mentioned it. </sentence><sentence id="896">And--and I --now I find that strange. </sentence><sentence id="897">I never felt it strange, but now I do find that really strange. </sentence><sentence id="898">We never mentioned it. </sentence><sentence id="899">So I don't know where any of them are now, and --and I'm sure some --I know this one is dead, perhaps some others. </sentence><sentence id="900">Because I was actually next to the youngest in the group of nurses. </sentence><sentence id="901">Therefore, if I'm 75, they would be older. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="910">Q: So do you think much or some or at all about those experiences overseas now? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="912">A: Quite a bit. </sentence><sentence id="913">I suppose everyone does quite a bit. </sentence><sentence id="914">You know, you don't really get hung up on it, but you'll have these flashbacks and --or something will remind you of what happened then and --yeah. </sentence><sentence id="915">So I guess I do think about it quite a bit. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="920">Q: Do you think that it changed you in any way to have gone through all that? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="922">A: You know, I never thought so. </sentence><sentence id="923">I never thought so, and yet my son one day said to me, he said, "You know, Mom"--he knew someone at work, some woman, and she said her mother had similar experiences, and she thought "I think it's affected my mother. </sentence><sentence id="924">I don't know how, and he said, "And I said to her, you know, it probably did my mother too." </sentence><sentence id="925">I didn't ask him how. </sentence><sentence id="926">Just --I stay off that subject. </sentence><sentence id="927">So I don't think it --I never thought it did. </sentence><sentence id="928">Maybe it did. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="936">Q: Well, it's hard to know what it would have been like if you hadn't have done that "cause-- </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="937">A: Yes. </sentence><sentence id="938">May have been the very same. </sentence><sentence id="939">Who knows but it was an experience that you could well do without. </sentence><sentence id="940">I had a woman one time tell me that she didn't think it ever happened, and I don't know why she said that. </sentence><sentence id="941">We weren't talking about it, but she said that she didn't believe that there were ever any concentration camps. </sentence><sentence id="942">She thought that was a lot of propaganda, and I--I'm thinking you're talking to the wrong person, and she talked quite a bit about it until I finally just stopped her and told her whatever --I don't remember what I told her, but anyhow I told her the truth. </sentence><sentence id="943">I was shocked. </sentence><sentence id="944">That shocked me as much as anything probably to think that somebody --she was older than I, so she had been through --in the States. </sentence><sentence id="945">She had known what was going on. </sentence><sentence id="946">I mean she had heard --she had to have heard. </sentence><sentence id="947">No way she could have avoided newspapers, radios, what was going on, and yet she thought that was all propaganda. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="959">Q: How did she take it when you told her? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="961">A: Well, I felt that she didn't believe a word of it. </sentence><sentence id="962">Then not long ago, I met a woman and she was -- and I don't --I don't know why the subject came up, but she was telling me that her father-in-law --I don't know, someone, someone in her family did not believe it ever happened. </sentence><sentence id="963">Was propaganda. </sentence><sentence id="964">So again someone else didn't believe it, and then I --that makes me believe there might be a lot of people that believe this never happened, therefore, the story has to be told, has to be kept because I can't imagine there'd be anyone who would think it hadn't happened. </sentence><sentence id="965">I know they're teaching it in the schools today, and there --they --I think they're teaching it--quite a bit about it, and yet there are those who don't believe, and I can't --apparently they don't want to believe it. </sentence><sentence id="966">Why don't they want to believe? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="973">Q: Hard to understand. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="975">A: Um-hum. </sentence><sentence id="976">Have you heard that there are people who don't believe it? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="979">Q: Oh, yes. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="981">A: And why do they not believe it, do you know? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="983">Q: I don't know. </sentence><sentence id="984">Hard to --it's hard to understand. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="987">A: So do you think if these people--those people who do not believe would go through the museum, the Holocaust museum, they'd still not believe? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="989">Q: I don't know whether they would or not, but I think your testimony's a very important piece of documenting that it did happen. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="991">A: Thank you. </sentence><sentence id="992">There are lots of us out here I'm sure. </sentence><sentence id="993">Lots of books are being written now too. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="997">Q: Yes, there are. </sentence><sentence id="998">Is there anything else that you would like to say? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1001">A: I don't think so. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1003">Q: Anything that I've forgotten to ask you? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1005">A: I --I don't think so. </sentence><sentence id="1006">No, I don't believe that--would have nothing do with the concentration camps so I don't think there is anything. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1009">Q: Well, that's all right. </sentence><sentence id="1010">Ifthere's something else that you want to say. </sentence><sentence id="1011">Doesn't have to be directly connected. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1015">A: It would just be experiences that--that would have no bearing on it so I think it's probably unimportant as far as this goes. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1017">Q: Experiences in the war? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1019">A: Um-hum. </sentence><sentence id="1020">Would have no bearing on --on --on the --well, it would have had some bearing on the Nazis. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1023">Q: Okay. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1025">A: Do you want something-- </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1026">Q: If you want to. </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1027">A: --or just want to hang around? </sentence><sentence id="1028">Oh, I found it very interesting that we--oh, I shouldn't say interesting. </sentence><sentence id="1029">That's not--not a good description. </sentence><sentence id="1030">Exciting. </sentence><sentence id="1031">And something I was glad to do that we didn't --we --of course you heard about Dunkirk. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1037">Q: Um-hum. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1039">A: We were set up in Germany when some of the men who were captured at Dunkirk, this is five years later, had been prisoners of the Germans all this time. </sentence><sentence id="1040">Not ina concentration camp but a prison camp. </sentence><sentence id="1041">Were liberated. </sentence><sentence id="1042">Came back through our hospital for just a few hours "cause we were still this little tent in the field, and all very --had been wounded seriously and had --had very little care given. </sentence><sentence id="1043">Desperately needed care. </sentence><sentence id="1044">But they weren't interested in that so much as we were the first English-speaking women they had seen in five years, and they wanted to know what was going on in England, and --and we were so happy and --oh, they were probably there a couple of hours before they went back to the --to the rear, and it was just exciting to talk with them. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1051">Q: And to see how excited they were. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1053">A: Oh, yes. </sentence><sentence id="1054">Yes. </sentence><sentence id="1055">Uh-huh. </sentence><sentence id="1056">And they had heard that the --they had just heard--because they got no news in the prison camps, no letters from home. </sentence><sentence id="1057">Nothing. </sentence><sentence id="1058">They had no idea what was going on in England, but they had just heard that the American soldiers were marrying all of the English women and that was a terrible thing for them to have to hear, and we were happy to tell them not so. </sentence><sentence id="1059">So then they went on back to England I'm sure very quickly. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1067">Q: Well, you must have had days and days of very dreary times so to have something like that happen would certainly-- </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1068">A: Be -- </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1069">Q: --give you a different mood. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1071">A: Yes, yes. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1073">Q: Yeah. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1075">A: Yes, it was. </sentence><sentence id="1076">And I think that's probably all that I have to say. </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1077">Q: Okay. </sentence><sentence id="1078">Well, I want to thank you very much for giving your testimony. </sentence><sentence id="1079">It's very important for the museum to have this. </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1080">A: Thank you. </sentence><sentence id="1081">You're very welcome. </sentence></p></dialogue>
