<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="85">Q: And one of the questions that I wanted to ask you is -- is a long time sort of prospective from the post-war to the present time is, from here, from this doctor, have you experienced prejudice because you are a German in certain circumstances, and if so, where? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="87">A: Oh well, once with Major Hermann. </sentence><sentence id="88">We didn't -- It didn't mean enough to him that I had suffered and that I was not, in quote, a Nazi. </sentence><sentence id="89">I was a German and that was enough for him, he being Jewish. </sentence><sentence id="90">After that -- No, I think -- Well, of course, when I traveled in France, at that time it was near impossible to tell somebody, I am German, they would have liquidated you. </sentence><sentence id="91">So I traveled through France as a Frenchman. </sentence><sentence id="92">I have participated in conversations like, these Goddamn Germans, these horrible, these this and this and so on and so forth. </sentence><sentence id="93">So, except -- until when I came to South America, which is about as pro- German as you can get, in any part of South America, and quite anti-Semitic. </sentence><sentence id="94">So as a German, no, except for the -- the -- the time immediately after the war in other European countries, where I didn't dare say that I was German, other than that no, I had -- there were no repercussions because of my heritage, no. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="103">Q: I want to go back to your being in the hospital and three blocks away and how long you were in the hospital and did you see your parents? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="105">A: Yeah, my parents came from time to time and I remember that I gained, oh sometimes as much as a pound and a half a day. </sentence><sentence id="106">And one day the American doctor told me that my    USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0041 6 heart would not support so much gain of weight and that I had to get up and I thought that was a bad joke. </sentence><sentence id="107">But I remember h-he telling me that I had to jump on one leg 13 times and then on the other one, where little by little, I went -- some GIs drove me around in a wheelchair and I would do sketches of the Gls. </sentence><sentence id="108">And then, maybe it was two or three months later, I walked with this cane and I was released and I was then with my parents. </sentence><sentence id="109">And Americans, shortly thereafter, were replaced by the British. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="115">Q: In the hospital? </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="123">Q: You had quite a -- a rich life since, which is why I wanted to start here, and I also had a question, although I understand that you were a person who loved adventure, I wondered how long you stayed at home, and why did you go? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="125">A: Situation in Germany was rather unbearable, Black Market, one German would denounce another German for being a member of the Nazi party, for having done this or that. </sentence><sentence id="126">The entire country was destroyed, Diisseldorf 75 percent. </sentence><sentence id="127">There didn't seem to be a future. </sentence><sentence id="128">Money did not exist, it was bartering. </sentence><sentence id="129">Coffee, cigarettes, butter were the main items for bartering. </sentence><sentence id="130">My parents had lost my brother, who had fallen to his death in the Alps. </sentence><sentence id="131">My mother continuously cried. </sentence><sentence id="132">So it was a period of depression and even though at    USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0041 7 that time it was an impossibility to leave, you couldn't leave -- you couldn't go in the street after 10 o'clock. </sentence><sentence id="133">But somehow I flirted with the idea of going to America. </sentence><sentence id="134">And anybody with whom I would have shared the idea would have declared me insane. </sentence><sentence id="135">I went to see a teacher of mine, an old teacher who -- I understand that he had an estate, or his family had an estate in America. </sentence><sentence id="136">And I didn't know that much about the difference of South America and North America, to me America was America. </sentence><sentence id="137">I went to see him, and I remember he asked me, "Where do you want to go, eventually?" " </sentence><sentence id="138">Well," I said, "America." " </sentence><sentence id="139">What part of America?" </sentence><sentence id="140">And I said North America just to give him an answer. </sentence><sentence id="141">He said, "Well, I'm very sorry, but my family has an estate in -- close to Buenos Aires, in Argentina." </sentence><sentence id="142">Then I went to see my father, and I told him that -- that I was going to try to leave. </sentence><sentence id="143">Said, "You know that's impossible." </sentence><sentence id="144">Well, I said, "I'm going to try." </sentence><sentence id="145">And he said that, "If I didn't know you, I would say you are crazy, but -- but there's no need for me to say anything. </sentence><sentence id="146">All I say that whatever person you meet, just expect them to be no good and if they are good, you're going to have a very pleasant surprise." </sentence><sentence id="147">That was his advice. </sentence><sentence id="148">I had previously tried -- well, let me explain that many Germans in large cities, knowing that the cities were to be or were being bombed, took certain items of value and shipped them to relatives in rural areas, which happened to be the Russian zone. </sentence><sentence id="149">My parents had shipped a suitcase to some friends. </sentence><sentence id="150">And going to the Russian zone was quite an adventure and I went to the Russian zone several times. </sentence><sentence id="151">And that itself is quite a story. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="180">Q: Was this the Russian zone in Germany? </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="186">Q: And that meant that the Russians were in charge of everything [indecipherable] </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="188">A: They were the occupying force, and they were terrible. </sentence><sentence id="189">So, we're -- going to the Russian zone was in itself something like going to a foreign country. </sentence><sentence id="190">I had gone there twice, so I figured that somehow I sh -- I should be able to go. </sentence><sentence id="191">I had an address of a relative of a friend in Belgium. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="199">Q: What was your motive for going? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="201">A: Oh, I was sick and tired of Germany, of the situation in Germany, thought there must be better places in the world then, than corruption, Black Market, degeneration, etcetera, etcetera, etcetera. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="205">Q: So you said goodbye to your parents? </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="224">A: Oh, yeah, I -- I -- no, I told that to her because she would not have allowed me to </sentence></p><p><sentence id="225"> leave, and I didn't want her to cry. </sentence><sentence id="226">So I stow away to Achen, which is right on the border, </sentence></p><p><sentence id="227"> and there I -- I had some cigarettes with me that I gave to a railroad employee, and I </sentence></p><p><sentence id="228"> asked him -- I spoke to him with a French accent and I told him that I had been in </sentence></p><p><sentence id="229"> Germany as a French prisoner of war and that I'd fallen in love with a German girl and </sentence></p><p><sentence id="230"> I'd come to see her and I needed to go back. </sentence><sentence id="231">And I wondered whether he could help me,    </sentence></p><p><sentence id="232"> USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0041 9 whether there was a train going across. </sentence><sentence id="233">He told me about a cargo train and well, I hid in that cargo train and went to Belgium. </sentence><sentence id="234">I went to see an old farmer. </sentence><sentence id="235">Matter of fact, I visited the farmer's son last year. </sentence><sentence id="236">And he told me, "Don't come up, they're looking for Germans all over the place, so -- </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="237">Q: How did he know you? </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="238">A: He didn't know me. </sentence><sentence id="239">I told him who I was. </sentence><sentence id="240">He was the cousin or nephew of a lady in our neighborhood. </sentence><sentence id="241">You have to underst -- </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="242">Q: Oh, sorry. </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="243">A: -- You have to understand the situation. </sentence><sentence id="244">The border towns in Germany and Belgium, they were German during the Kaiser. </sentence><sentence id="245">After the Kaiser, they -- they became Belgium. </sentence><sentence id="246">Hitler took it back, and after Hitler lost, they returned to Belgium. </sentence><sentence id="247">So those areas, like Alsace-Lorraine, they all speak German and they're probably more German than Belgian, or Germ -- [indecipherable] so anyway, he gave me some sandwich, an apple, and told me that I should wait for the milk truck. </sentence><sentence id="248">It took me to Liege. </sentence><sentence id="249">Well, at -- at noon time, I was in -- in Brussels and I stayed a few days in Brussels, visiting with a friend of my father. </sentence><sentence id="250">Then I went to France and eventually I became a sailor. </sentence><sentence id="251">That went on until December of "48, when I stow awayed on a -- on a Dutch freighter and went to South America. </sentence></p></dialogue>
