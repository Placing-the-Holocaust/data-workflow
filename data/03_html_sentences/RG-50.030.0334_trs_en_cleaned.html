<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="101">A: Yes, very religious -- very Orthodox. </sentence><sentence id="102">There was nothing else in small towns. </sentence><sentence id="103">In fact, in all of Germany you were either very religious or you weren't aware of your Jewishness at all -- you were very, very Reformed. </sentence><sentence id="104">Conservative Judaism had not been invented, yet. </sentence><sentence id="105">So, yes, we were very religious and interestingly enough, the religion was state supported. </sentence><sentence id="106">In other words we always had to mark on taxes or on any forms -- on birth certificates, wedding forms or anything -- our affiliation. </sentence><sentence id="107">It was always Jewish because the state paid for the upkeep of the synagogue. </sentence><sentence id="108">The state paid for the salary of the Rabbi or the Hazan, or the Shohet. </sentence><sentence id="109">So there was never a question that we were very Jewish, and everybody knew that and everybody, up to a certain point, respected it too. </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="110">Q: Did you have non-Jewish friends growing up? </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="111">A: Yes, we did have non-Jewish friends but not real good chums. </sentence><sentence id="112">They were just the kids on the block that we played with. </sentence><sentence id="113">My parents didn't restrict us in going out with only Jewish people. </sentence><sentence id="114">It didn't seem a problem. </sentence><sentence id="115">We knew so much where we belonged and who we were that there was no danger for us to intermingle or anything. </sentence><sentence id="116">So, yes, we did have non-Jewish friends up to a certain point. </sentence><sentence id="117">But the real close friends were the Jewish people. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="125">Q: And when you went to school, it was a mixed school? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="127">A: Yes. </sentence><sentence id="128">In grade school. </sentence><sentence id="129">I don't remember too much about grade school, but then I went to the Lyzeum -- that was like it would here be maybe a high school, and then junior college. </sentence><sentence id="130">That was already considered higher education. </sentence><sentence id="131">The girls went to the Lyzeum and the boys went to the Gymnasium," which here is an athletic term, but over there it was an academic term. </sentence><sentence id="132">So, yes I do remember that very well. </sentence><sentence id="133">I was admitted in 1933 at the age of 10 only because I could prove that my father was a World War I veteran. </sentence><sentence id="134">Already, Hitler had just come to power in January. </sentence><sentence id="135">I was admitted to school that fall. </sentence><sentence id="136">And I remember I had to bring some proof that my father had received the Iron Cross First Class in World War One and otherwise I could not have gone. </sentence><sentence id="137">I would have already been repelled as a Jewish student. </sentence><sentence id="138">So I did go, but I didn't stay very long. </sentence><sentence id="139">In 1936 there was a law that -- it was phrased in that way -- German students do no longer have to be subjected to sitting in the same room with Jewish students. </sentence><sentence id="140">So of course it was the Jewish students who had to leave. </sentence><sentence id="141">I always thought it was a very interesting way of framing it. </sentence><sentence id="142">In those early years Hitler was still a little bit more cautious and modest in his demands on us than he was later on. </sentence><sentence id="143">But up to then we were accepted. </sentence><sentence id="144">We did not -- slowly we did not chum around with the German children anymore. </sentence><sentence id="145">I remember there were two Jewish students in my class, myself and Matilda Adler(ph). </sentence><sentence id="146">How some names will stay with you all your life! </sentence><sentence id="147">And she and I were, little by little, we were ostracized. </sentence><sentence id="148">I remember us standing in the comer in the school yard. </sentence><sentence id="149">We couldn't mingle with the other kids anymore. </sentence><sentence id="150">And they weren't mean to us, but they were not allowed to be friendly to us. </sentence><sentence id="151">If they would, they were being punished. </sentence><sentence id="152">And I also remember that I was not allowed to answer questions in school, even if I knew the answer. </sentence><sentence id="153">After a while I didn't even raise my hand anymore because I knew the teacher could not possibly call on me. </sentence><sentence id="154">As a Jewish student I was supposed to be stupid. </sentence><sentence id="155">I was supposed to be ignorant. </sentence><sentence id="156">I was not -- Jews -- Hitler declared Jews as stupid, so how could I know any answers? </sentence><sentence id="157">And that hurt a while but then I got use to it. </sentence><sentence id="158">But finally in "36 we had to leave. </sentence><sentence id="159">And I got as far as fourth grade in there instead of the ordinary sixth grade. </sentence><sentence id="160">I didn't graduate. </sentence><sentence id="161">And that hurt because | didn't know what else to do. </sentence><sentence id="162">I couldn't stay at home -- and I couldn't go to any other school, so that the childhood years were happy, but the school years already were not. </sentence><sentence id="163">And my sister who was a year ahead of me -- same story. </sentence><sentence id="164">She was the only Jewish girl in her class and she was even more ostracized and picked upon -- and she was more timid than I was. </sentence><sentence id="165">I was always more the "tomboy" type and she was very much more gentle and introverted than I was. </sentence><sentence id="166">So  she suffered actually more than I did. </sentence><sentence id="167">And when we came home we talked a little about it, but then we tried to forget it and just integrate into our family. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="209">Q: Did your parents give you any advice about what to do when you came home and talked about this kind of abuse? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="211">A: Did my parents give me any advice? </sentence><sentence id="212">I would say "no." </sentence><sentence id="213">My parents already were wrapped up in their own problems. </sentence><sentence id="214">Already, very early in Hitler's reign, the Schechtverbot" came -- and I think what you mean by that. </sentence><sentence id="215">The Jews were no longer allowed to kill their animals in the ritualistic way by shekhting. </sentence><sentence id="216">And I always thought that was such an irony. </sentence><sentence id="217">The reason Hitler gave for that Schechtverbot was, it was inhumane to the animals. </sentence><sentence id="218">Think about that for a minute. </sentence><sentence id="219">For the animals he had pity, but for us -- he put us into the gas. </sentence><sentence id="220">There was no more inhumanity involved there. </sentence><sentence id="221">So in "38, being very considerate for those poor animals, there was the Schechtverbot. </sentence><sentence id="222">And then Father had his own problems. </sentence><sentence id="223">I remember how Father and Mother and grandmother and Aunt Adelheid used to sit in the room and just try to figure out what the future will bring. </sentence><sentence id="224">Now all he had to sell were the chickens, you see. </sentence><sentence id="225">For a while there was frozen meat from Argentina, but who's going to buy frozen meat in 1936. </sentence><sentence id="226">It was unheard of. </sentence><sentence id="227">Nobody would touch it -- and so he gave that up very quickly. </sentence><sentence id="228">And then there was no more income, except for that little bit that we made on the chickens. </sentence><sentence id="229">And they were having problems. </sentence><sentence id="230">For a long time I remember Father saying, "Mir gehen mit dem letzten Zug." </sentence><sentence id="231">That was Bayerisch -- that was Bavarian dialect for "We're going to go with the last train. </sentence><sentence id="232">We're going to stick it out. </sentence><sentence id="233">We're not gonna leave here." </sentence><sentence id="234">But after a while he had to realize that there was no "letzten Zug." </sentence><sentence id="235">There was not gonna be a last train. </sentence><sentence id="236">So they had their own problems, and no, we didn't bother them with our problems. </sentence><sentence id="237">They couldn't have helped us anyway. </sentence><sentence id="238">If we ever confided into anyone it was Aunt Adelheid and grandmother. </sentence><sentence id="239">They seemed to -- they were very close to us. </sentence><sentence id="240">Does that give you a little picture of my home life? </sentence><sentence id="241">It was a nice, close, lovely family. </sentence><sentence id="242">And then came 1938 -- Kristallnacht(r). </sentence><sentence id="243">For a while the non- Jews were moderate in their intercourse with us. </sentence><sentence id="244">They held back, but they weren't hostile. </sentence><sentence id="245">And I remember some of the closer non-Jewish friends used to come to the back door at night when no one would see them and used to bring us maybe a little bread or some fruit because already we couldn't buy everything we wanted to. </sentence><sentence id="246">All of a sudden that was -- the Jews couldn't really buy what they wanted. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="283">Q: Can you explain that some because I -- what kinds of restrictions there were, on movement and purchase-- </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="284">A: Well, little by little the merchants would become hostile to us. </sentence><sentence id="285">And when they saw us coming the better things would disappear under the counter, like the better fruits. </sentence><sentence id="286">1 remember there were always Blut Orangen" from America -- that was those red oranges from America which was -- that was just a delicacy for us. </sentence><sentence id="287">I remember that so much. </sentence><sentence id="288">Mother used to bring that home once in a while. </sentence><sentence id="289">But then as time went on, there were no more Blut Orangen. </sentence><sentence id="290">They disappeared the minute they saw us coming. </sentence><sentence id="291">And so, little by little, there was hostility. </sentence><sentence id="292">And dearth by us, after a little while, and we became poor. </sentence><sentence id="293">I remember how we used to sit around that Blaupunkt radio that we had. </sentence><sentence id="294">I can still remember that so well. </sentence><sentence id="295">You used to turn the knob and the whole dial would zoom back and forth. </sentence><sentence id="296">You didn't have to turn the knob little by little. </sentence><sentence id="297">You just touched it a little and the dial would fly away from you and you had to catch it to where you wanted it. </sentence><sentence id="298">But no matter which station you took, there was always Hitler's voice on the radio -- always this frightening voice -- this loud, hypnotizing speech that he gave -- always against the Jews and how he would make the life of the Germans better and better if they would just follow him and do away with the Jews -- and the Jews had taken all their good things -- and the whole Versailles Treaty was the fault of the Jews. </sentence><sentence id="299">The huge banners that came up over Ansbach that used to say, "Die Juden sind unser Ungliick*" --"The Jews are our misfortune. </sentence><sentence id="300">Everything bad that happened to the Germans is the fault of the Jews." </sentence><sentence id="301">And my sister and I used to slink by those huge banners that were all over the city and we used to try just not to see them, thinking if we didn't see them, they weren't there. </sentence><sentence id="302">But they were there. </sentence><sentence id="303">Little by little that really took over. </sentence><sentence id="304">And I remember the torch parades that came. </sentence><sentence id="305">Hitler visited Ansbach many times actually. </sentence><sentence id="306">It was a stronghold for the SA, the earlier group as you know. </sentence><sentence id="307">First came the SA and then came the SS The SA was the Sturmabteilung" and then the SS was the Schutzstaffeln"", They actually -- it started out as a personal body guard of Hitler, but then the SA was pushed aside and the SS became the dominant military and civil force in Germany. </sentence><sentence id="308">But I remember still the SA going down our cobblestone streets with their large torches and singing and marching. </sentence><sentence id="309">And these were all young kids that we still knew at one time before they became SA It was always frightening. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="336">And when Hitler came into town the Jews, of course, were ordered to stay away -- stay off the streets. </sentence><sentence id="337">And also an interesting thing was, in the Nuremberg Laws what we thought was the least ominous law was, that the Jews could not fly the German flag. </sentence><sentence id="338">That, you know, we thought that we could live with. </sentence><sentence id="339">Well, who wants it to fly the German flag? </sentence><sentence id="340">But it turned out that was also a seminal law. </sentence><sentence id="341">Right away they could tell which house was Jewish because everybody else had to fly the flag. </sentence><sentence id="342">So that was also an interesting law. </sentence><sentence id="343">That was up to Kristallnacht. </sentence><sentence id="344">After that it was no problem anyway. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="354">Q: Prior to Kristallnacht, do you remember seeing anyone beaten up? </sentence><sentence id="355">Were you ever ina  difficult situation? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="358">A: No, except the kids used to -- after a while they threw stones at us, or they made snowballs with a stone inside you know and hit it at us, and we didn't know. </sentence><sentence id="359">And that was, of course, like a missile. </sentence><sentence id="360">And we couldn't retaliate. </sentence><sentence id="361">We couldn't throw a snowball back. </sentence><sentence id="362">Number one, we were much too timid, and number two, they would have just killed us if we had. </sentence><sentence id="363">They were already -- now the Hitlerjungend."! </sentence><sentence id="364">Both the boys and the girls had to be in the Hitlerjungend, the youth organization of the SS, and they were all powerful. </sentence><sentence id="365">When they had their little Hitlerjungend's uniforms on, they felt like they were God themselves. </sentence><sentence id="366">Otherwise, back to your question, no, I have not seen anyone being beaten up. </sentence><sentence id="367">But I will tell you, we didn't provoke them. </sentence><sentence id="368">We stayed in our houses and we slunk around the streets and if we saw anyone-- </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="380">Q: Mrs. Haas, can you go back to this time and talk a little bit about the intimidation that you were feeling. </sentence><sentence id="381">You said that you would walk sort of in a frightened way and would stay in your house. </sentence><sentence id="382">What was this doing to you and your sister? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="386">A: Well, when you are 10 years old and from that time on, and my sister was only a year and a half older, when you're constantly told that you are stupid, and -- they called it " Untermensch,"*" "subhuman" -- and you personally are responsible for everything that's going wrong in all of Germany, and practically in all the world, and you can't shine in any way. </sentence><sentence id="387">You can't let your imagination, or your intellect, or your normal physical appearances come up and speak for yourself -- for itself, after a while that does something to you. </sentence><sentence id="388">After a while -- after 10 years of this, you believe you are stupid. </sentence><sentence id="389">You believe you look Jewish and you look ugly and you are not worthy of anything. </sentence><sentence id="390">And it really took a while to get over this. </sentence><sentence id="391">And you know I see some older people nowadays that have gone through this whole thing and it looks to me as if they haven't gotten over it yet. </sentence><sentence id="392">They still feel that they are the less human -- the lesser human race -- and I still -- they look depressed to me. </sentence><sentence id="393">I think I got over it, but during the time I believed I was no good. </sentence><sentence id="394">I believed I was a second rate human being. </sentence><sentence id="395">It was a terrible thing to do. </sentence><sentence id="396">And you must understand, on the other hand, these very same kids that went to school with me who up to then were nothing, they came from a downtrodden, broken home, they had no clothes to wear, they -- in many cases they had to come to the Jewish families to beg for food and substances, they were suddenly dressed up in their Nazi uniforms and their -- first in their Hitlerjungend uniforms, which were splendid. </sentence><sentence id="397">They were beautiful, and later on they were dressed up in their SA and SS uniforms, underneath they were still very mediocre, very pedestrian German people. </sentence><sentence id="398">But all of a sudden they were shining, they were beautiful. </sentence><sentence id="399">And don't forget, a uniform really does something to you psychologically. </sentence><sentence id="400">These people not only had their uniform on, but they felt they were the uniform. </sentence><sentence id="401">They felt they could do beautiful things just because they looked so great. </sentence><sentence id="402">And they did. </sentence><sentence id="403">They got away with it. </sentence><sentence id="404"> As you very well know, one of the very first laws that Hitler put onto the books in Germany was the Gestapo Law of 1936 which stated that anyone in an SS, in a Nazi uniform, would stand above the law -- could do anything they wanted to, could up to kill the Jews openly on the street. </sentence><sentence id="405">As long as they were in their Nazi uniform the law could not touch them. </sentence><sentence id="406">Now if you think of it, we on the other hand were since the 1935 Nuremberg Laws, staatenlos,"* stateless. </sentence><sentence id="407">That means we had no recourse to the law. </sentence><sentence id="408">Any injustice that was done to us, forget it. </sentence><sentence id="409">There was no law to go to, to complain. </sentence><sentence id="410">But they -- and the psychological effect of that is not to be underestimated. </sentence><sentence id="411">They were indeed the supermen the all powerful, unapproachable. </sentence><sentence id="412">No law could touch them. </sentence><sentence id="413">And as we, when we were ten years old were told how low we were, they were told how great they were -- and by the time they were 20 and 25 and we met them again in the killing centers, their psychology had changed just as much as ours had. </sentence><sentence id="414">I don't know how to impress upon you what a uniform will do a person. </sentence><sentence id="415">It suddenly makes him into a semi-god. </sentence><sentence id="416">And Hitler was no dummy about that. </sentence><sentence id="417">His uniforms were beautiful, shiny; those boots, those helmets, all those buttons and rows of things. </sentence><sentence id="418">And then the names, they all of a sudden were -- they weren't just Johann Schmidt anymore -- they were Oberscharfithrer"* and they were Blockleiter. </sentence><sentence id="419">"deg And the kids already they were -- I can't remember all the German names, but suddenly they got a title. </sentence><sentence id="420">They were somebody. </sentence><sentence id="421">And they had quite forgotten that underneath the uniform there was really nothing much, but that's -- but you don't know that when you're stuck in it. </sentence><sentence id="422">You only know that 50 years later when you acquire a little overview and a little insight. </sentence><sentence id="423">But that was part of the success of the Nazis -- those uniforms, and the singing, and the torch parades. </sentence><sentence id="424">That was uplifting to them and to the spectators -- to the people who watched. </sentence><sentence id="425">They suddenly belonged. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="466">Q: Did you ever get angry at this when you were -- during this period? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="468">A: I don't think so. </sentence><sentence id="469">I don't think we were angry. </sentence><sentence id="470">I don't think we were allowed anger. </sentence><sentence id="471">We were just allowed fear, fear and trembling. </sentence><sentence id="472">I still remember so well when they sat around the table at night and worried, and worried, "What are we going to do? </sentence><sentence id="473">What are we going to do with the kids?" </sentence><sentence id="474">We couldn't go to school anymore. " </sentence><sentence id="475">How are we gonna live?" </sentence><sentence id="476">Anger was far away. </sentence><sentence id="477">Worry and fear was the dominant emotions. </sentence><sentence id="478">And then the belief in God, that never left us. " </sentence><sentence id="479">God will help. </sentence><sentence id="480">God will bring resolution. </sentence><sentence id="481">Hitler won't last long. </sentence><sentence id="482">Hitler's gonna be gone from the scene by Christmas. </sentence><sentence id="483">Hitler's gonna be gone from the scene by spring. </sentence><sentence id="484">No, he wasn't." </sentence><sentence id="485">We believed our own wishes. </sentence><sentence id="486">We didn't believe Mein Kampf (r) and all the raging speeches that he gave -- that he prophesied that he would make Germany "Judenrein." </sentence><sentence id="487">That  was the big deal. </sentence><sentence id="488">It went in one ear and out the other for us. </sentence><sentence id="489">What does he mean "Judenrein"""?This is not a word we grew up with. </sentence><sentence id="490">So we ignored it. </sentence><sentence id="491">But he knew what he meant and he did it too. </sentence><sentence id="492">Now I get angry when I think about it, but in those days, no, there was no anger. </sentence><sentence id="493">There was only great, great fear. </sentence><sentence id="494">And then we gathered around our Rabbi and he told us...Everybody was so short-sighted. </sentence><sentence id="495">Everybody was so blind. </sentence><sentence id="496">Even the Rabbi, whom we thought had real insight and foresight and a direct line to God you know, he said, "Don't worry. </sentence><sentence id="497">Everything will be alright. </sentence><sentence id="498">Don't leave Ansbach. </sentence><sentence id="499">Stay, stay, stay." </sentence><sentence id="500">But unfortunately, then he was the first to leave. </sentence><sentence id="501">He went and got a job in Paris as a Rabbi and he left. </sentence><sentence id="502">And that opened our eyes after that. </sentence><sentence id="503">We too began to leave. </sentence><sentence id="504">That hurt me more than anything else -- that our Rabbi left us our beloved Rabbi. </sentence><sentence id="505">It's like your father leaving you. </sentence><sentence id="506">That was interesting in retrospect. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="574">A: I was too young to know what cynical was. </sentence><sentence id="575">Those emotions you are mentioning are luxuries. </sentence><sentence id="576">We were just plain, down to earth. </sentence><sentence id="577">We just dealt with the basics here -- hope, anger and always the belief in God. </sentence><sentence id="578">That never left us. </sentence><sentence id="579">And in a way it was a big help. </sentence><sentence id="580">It was a big help. </sentence><sentence id="581">We would have despaired if we didn't have that, that hope for the future. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="592">A: Yes. </sentence><sentence id="593">I did. </sentence><sentence id="594">I did, but in a modified way. </sentence><sentence id="595">We grew up very religious, as I said. </sentence><sentence id="596">There was nothing else. </sentence><sentence id="597">And we adored our Rabbi. </sentence><sentence id="598">We would do anything he would tell us to. </sentence><sentence id="599">And I'm not only speaking of my sister and myself. </sentence><sentence id="600">But that whole youth group whose picture you have seen. </sentence><sentence id="601">We gathered around him every Shabbos and we were devoted to him. </sentence><sentence id="602">That great  faith, I think, helped me a great deal, because later on when things really got... What I'm telling you now, that's not bad. </sentence><sentence id="603">That's just the beginning. </sentence><sentence id="604">But later on when things really got bad, then there was nothing else to cling to. </sentence><sentence id="605">And I wonder if people understand that, that you can still be religious and believe in God even though you see what -- let's say, what God is doing all around you. </sentence><sentence id="606">I don't want to have to explain what I just said. </sentence><sentence id="607">But on the one hand you see all the evil that -- in our religious mind was still sent from God. </sentence><sentence id="608">And on the other hand, you come inward and you still believed he would help -- and that was a big help. </sentence><sentence id="609">It really was. </sentence><sentence id="610">It sounds like an irony, but it was a big help. </sentence><sentence id="611">And then later on when I was rescued, and I found my father again. </sentence><sentence id="612">Then again also my mother and my whole family had died. </sentence><sentence id="613">Again there was at least that much reason to be grateful to God who had saved me, and had saved my father. </sentence><sentence id="614">And then I married a religious man. </sentence><sentence id="615">I tried to bring up my children religious. </sentence><sentence id="616">And it's a problem. </sentence><sentence id="617">You can't live without it and you can't live with it, but most of all you can't live without it. </sentence><sentence id="618">So it's a way of life now. </sentence><sentence id="619">It's a way of life. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="648">Q: When you got kicked out of Lyzeum, when you couldn't go anymore -- when the Jewish children couldn't go -- what was the decision of your parents? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="650">A: Yes. </sentence><sentence id="651">I remember that very well also. </sentence><sentence id="652">My sister was already old enough. </sentence><sentence id="653">First of all she had graduated. </sentence><sentence id="654">She was two years ahead of me. </sentence><sentence id="655">She had graduated from the Lyzeum and now she -- there was nothing else to do. </sentence><sentence id="656">There was no post-graduate or college or anything -- forget it. </sentence><sentence id="657">She could either go to Hakhshara"" to prepare herself for Israel -- for Palestine, but remember we were going with the last train so there was no need to go to Palestine. </sentence><sentence id="658">We weren't leaving Ansbach. </sentence><sentence id="659">So she went to a girls Landwirtschaftschule"* -- a girls preparation for... just to be a wife and a mother. </sentence><sentence id="660">It wasn't Landwirtschaftschule, it was Wolfratshausen. </sentence><sentence id="661">How can I explain it to you? </sentence><sentence id="662">It was a preparatory school for young women -- for young ladies. </sentence><sentence id="663">I remember she came back and she showed me how she learned how to fold linens so that they would look like military in the shelves. </sentence><sentence id="664">You know, that's the kind of thing they learned. </sentence><sentence id="665">Much good that did us. </sentence><sentence id="666">And I was too young to go there, so I went to the one Jewish school that was still in existence. </sentence><sentence id="667">That was the Adass Jisroel Schule in Berlin. </sentence><sentence id="668">Now Berlin was far from Ansbach. </sentence><sentence id="669">It was like 300 kilometers and that was far. </sentence><sentence id="670">Remember, we're in 1930s in Europe. </sentence><sentence id="671">We're not in the 1990s in America. </sentence><sentence id="672">Berlin was far and I didn't know anybody. </sentence><sentence id="673">I had to live in the dormitory and I didn't know any kids. </sentence><sentence id="674">And now the bigger problem was that I didn't have the correct preparation for a Jewish school. </sentence><sentence id="675">I had only gone to my Rabbi during the section that was called "religion," -- "religion," when the Catholics went to their priests and the Protestants went to their father, to their religious leader, we went to Elie Munk, to Rabbi Munk. </sentence><sentence id="676">And that's all the religious education we had that one hour a week where we had religion. </sentence><sentence id="677">So I was not prepared for that and of course I did very poorly. </sentence><sentence id="678">So that reinforced my thinking that I really was stupid and minor, even in the Jewish school I  0 couldn't excel, you see. </sentence><sentence id="679">So it was tough. </sentence><sentence id="680">And then I was called home after Kristallnacht. </sentence><sentence id="681">I remember driving through Berlin and seeing the synagogues in flames and all the glass on the streets and the people huddled and depressed. </sentence><sentence id="682">And it was very obvious that what had impacted upon me psychologically had impacted on all the Jews. </sentence><sentence id="683">They walked around like the victims -- like the hunted. </sentence><sentence id="684">And I was in the train, and I was going toward Ansbach, and there my family had been taken to a collection center. </sentence><sentence id="685">Father had been sent to prison along with all the men. </sentence><sentence id="686">And Mother and all the women had already been sent back home and were packing. </sentence><sentence id="687">And we couldn't take more than we had that we could carry, and we had to leave everything. </sentence><sentence id="688">And I remember the name of the man that was just -- just a very simple little fellow who was ordered by the Nazis to take over our house. </sentence><sentence id="689">And he already had moved in with his eight kids. </sentence><sentence id="690">And we were still packing and leaving and going to the railroad station, and then we realized really what was going on. </sentence><sentence id="691">Then Father didn't talk about the last train anymore. </sentence><sentence id="692">And, then we went -- we could only go to certain cities. </sentence><sentence id="693">We couldn't just pick up and leave and buy a new house, or go to a new apartment -- far from it. </sentence><sentence id="694">We were told which cities to go to and we were told to go to Munich, and we were also told to just find someone to live with. </sentence><sentence id="695">And we found a distant relative -- well it doesn't matter -- there was some relationship there, who took us into one spare room that they had. </sentence><sentence id="696">And then Father and all the uncles and cousins all came back, all their hair shorn. </sentence><sentence id="697">The Munich Jews had been sent to Dachau, whereas the Ansbach Jews had been sent to, to prison in Nuremberg. </sentence><sentence id="698">And I remember how they all came back from the Dachau with their heads completely shorn, and then we began to wake up. </sentence><sentence id="699">Then we still only thought that the men were in danger. </sentence><sentence id="700">Who could think that they would kill women and children, or old people, or Rabbis, or respected business people or anything? </sentence><sentence id="701">So then Father was lucky and he got onto a convoy that the British Jews had organized and he got into that convoy as a butcher, and they went to Sandwich, England, to the Kitchener camps, with the hope -- this was in July of 1939. </sentence><sentence id="702">There was no talk of war, yet. </sentence><sentence id="703">Hitler kept that very secret. </sentence><sentence id="704">It was -- that was like a bombshell when the war started. </sentence><sentence id="705">So in July, a little more than one month before the beginning of the war in Poland, there was no fear of war. </sentence><sentence id="706">So we thought that my father could find domestic positions for us and bring us over after him. </sentence><sentence id="707">But the war ended that. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="766">Q: Do you think there was any talk of all of you going at once or could only the men go? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="768">A: That was only a transport for men from 18 to 45 years old and Father was just 45. </sentence><sentence id="769">It was a miracle he even got in. </sentence></p></dialogue>

</sentence><sentence id="1220">But how did we know that? </sentence><sentence id="1221">We knew the law and we tried to live with it. </sentence><sentence id="1222">Then we already were, were very much the victims. </sentence><sentence id="1223">We looked very bad. </sentence><sentence id="1224">We had no more -- we couldn't get clothing coupons. </sentence><sentence id="1225">I remember we couldn't get coupons to have our shoes repaired. </sentence><sentence id="1226">So we walked around in shoes that were ready to be thrown out. </sentence><sentence id="1227">We couldn't get new ones. </sentence><sentence id="1228">That's without even saying. </sentence><sentence id="1229">But we couldn't get our old ones repaired either. </sentence><sentence id="1230">So we had no clothes. </sentence><sentence id="1231">We had bad shoes. </sentence><sentence id="1232">We were not well nourished. </sentence><sentence id="1233">We had the star. </sentence><sentence id="1234">We didn't need the star. </sentence><sentence id="1235">We marked as victims from the inside out, and from the outside as well. </sentence><sentence id="1236">Where as they got better and better -- well fed and more victorious, and more triumphant every day. </sentence><sentence id="1237">In the hospital, first I was in Niedershonhausen and then that was dissolved, and then I went in Berlin. </sentence><sentence id="1238">I'm telling you how bad everything was, and yet there was that little nucleus of happiness still, you know. </sentence><sentence id="1239">We were among Jews. </sentence><sentence id="1240">We could talk with them. </sentence><sentence id="1241">We had our own little kingdom. </sentence><sentence id="1242">We had our own little hierarchy. </sentence><sentence id="1243">I was just a student nurse. </sentence><sentence id="1244">I was nobody, but the hierarchy went to the Head Nurse, and it was heaven when the Head Nurse was friendly with you, which was not the case in my case. </sentence><sentence id="1245">I never got enough self-confidence up to talk to a head nurse, and she wasn't that much older than I was. </sentence><sentence id="1246">And then, of course, there was the whole hierarchy -- all the physicians that seemed like demigods. </sentence><sentence id="1247">And then there was the whole god; that was Lustig -- Dr. Lustig -- Dr. Walter Lustig. </sentence><sentence id="1248">He had two Doctors. </sentence><sentence id="1249">He called himself Doctor Doctor Walter Lustig. </sentence><sentence id="1250">He was a very prominent Jew before the Nazis came. </sentence><sentence id="1251">He was married to an Aryan woman -- to an Aryan physician woman and that was why he was saved for quite a while. </sentence><sentence id="1252">I'll get back to Lustig in a minute, but as you know the Mischlin  6 -- the Mischehe"" and the Mischlinge(tm)" were a big problem to Hitler, and in fact the hospital remained in existence because of that problem of the Mischlinge and the Mischehe. </sentence><sentence id="1253">They couldn't divorce. </sentence><sentence id="1254">The Pope didn't allow that, and Hitler couldn't treat the Aryan person as a Jew, and he couldn't really accept the Jew as an Aryan, so he tolerated them. </sentence><sentence id="1255">And it was always a.... I'm sure you're familiar with the history of the Mischlinge. </sentence><sentence id="1256">That was obviously a thorn in his side. </sentence><sentence id="1257">And the children of those Mischlinge were also a big problem. </sentence><sentence id="1258">And Theresienstadt was partly organized for those Mischlinge. </sentence><sentence id="1259">They couldn't very well go into their death. </sentence><sentence id="1260">After all, in many cases they had a pure Aryan father or... who was fighting for Hitler on the front. </sentence><sentence id="1261">So anyway, Lustig was married to an Aryan woman and he got the job as leader of the Jewish hospital. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1347">A: As much as I can remember. </sentence><sentence id="1348">Let's see. </sentence><sentence id="1349">I was of course involved in my own work at the time? </sentence><sentence id="1350">When she first came to Berlin I was still in Niedershenhausen and I remember the Head Nurse of Niedershonhausen who was a lovely old lady, whom I was very attached to, used to invite my sister on her day off to come to me because my sister lived in -- they all lived together in a big room. </sentence><sentence id="1351">Very Spartan, nothing there at all, just beds and a chair or what have you. </sentence><sentence id="1352">So it wasn't much fun to spend the day off there. </sentence><sentence id="1353">So the Oberschwester,"* the Head Nurse of Niedershenhausen -- as much as I loved her I forgot her name now, I don't recall her name -- invited my sister. </sentence><sentence id="1354">So my sister walked. </sentence><sentence id="1355">And I remember the Head Nurse then instructed the kitchen to serve my sister and me a fried egg. </sentence><sentence id="1356">Now that -- need I say more? </sentence><sentence id="1357">In 1940, the end of 1940, we were each eating a fried egg in Berlin. </sentence><sentence id="1358">I remember how much that meant to us, and also nutritionally, my sister was very much down. </sentence><sentence id="1359">They didn't have good food and they worked very hard. </sentence><sentence id="1360">They did factory work. </sentence><sentence id="1361">I don't exactly know what they did. </sentence><sentence id="1362">She never talked about it. </sentence><sentence id="1363">But in one of the letters to my mother -- and then she sent it to my father -- she writes that she has been chosen to be the camp nurse -- that she's taking care of the little injuries, etc., </sentence><sentence id="1364">etc., </sentence><sentence id="1365">and that apparently was quite an advantage for her, and she was very proud of it also. </sentence><sentence id="1366">And then all of a sudden they were detailed into a transport and I don't recall too much about that. </sentence><sentence id="1367">I remember going to her dormitory at the Siemens factory and they had left. </sentence><sentence id="1368">There was this empty big room with nothing there. </sentence><sentence id="1369">There was one hat that I remember she wore and that was sitting on her bed, and I took that hat and walked back home. </sentence><sentence id="1370">I don't recall my emotions or anything. </sentence><sentence id="1371">I probably blocked them out and, again, the hope was that we would all see each other when we all got deported. </sentence><sentence id="1372">That was always the one "glimmer" of the deportation. </sentence><sentence id="1373">We always thought we would see each other again. </sentence><sentence id="1374">We would also get there -- like death, and you see your people again up in heaven, but that was not the way it worked -- was the concentration camps. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1405">A: I think she was a lot more realistic than I was. </sentence><sentence id="1406">I, after all, lived in a little Jewish nucleus in the middle of Nazism. </sentence><sentence id="1407">We were served our meals. </sentence><sentence id="1408">We didn't have to go scrounging around or  8 go to the grocery stores, which by that time already were restricted. </sentence><sentence id="1409">The Jews could only go to certain grocery stores in the city during certain hours, and buy only certain things with their rations. </sentence><sentence id="1410">That was all spared to me. </sentence><sentence id="1411">We got our meals served and we didn't much ask where they came from. </sentence><sentence id="1412">So I was much better off. </sentence><sentence id="1413">Her rations -- she worked hard and I think her rations were minimal because I remember so clearly how she enjoyed that egg. </sentence><sentence id="1414">So she must have had very poor food. </sentence><sentence id="1415">And I don't remember too much. </sentence><sentence id="1416">I remember that we wrote to my father a lot when we got together and I don't, I don't remember what we wrote, but I know what we wrote from reading the letters 30 years later and she writes -- I remember especially in one letter she writes, "Kann denn niemand etwas fiir uns tun?" " </sentence><sentence id="1417">Can't anybody do anything for us?" </sentence><sentence id="1418">We had, after all by then, the major part of our family here and one part of the family in particular that moved to Argentina with all their money didn't help us at all. </sentence><sentence id="1419">And I've never quite forgiven them that. </sentence><sentence id="1420">They could have helped us. </sentence><sentence id="1421">They had the money and we could have gone into Argentina. </sentence><sentence id="1422">The quota wasn't that strict. </sentence><sentence id="1423">And I remember especially from her letter, "Kann dem Tante Lina garnichts fiir uns tun?" -- " </sentence><sentence id="1424">Can't Aunt Lina" -- who was the one there -- "do anything for us." </sentence><sentence id="1425">So she was much more realistic than I was. </sentence><sentence id="1426">I didn't write such things. </sentence><sentence id="1427">I only wrote about my nursing and my friends that I made and how much I liked it, and things like that. </sentence><sentence id="1428">She was much more with the times than I was. </sentence><sentence id="1429">And Aunt Lina unfortunately did nothing either. </sentence><sentence id="1430">That was very, very sad that my own family didn't gather around and pulled out as much as, as many as they could. </sentence></p></dialogue>

If they were calling him, they didn't want just "Dr.Lustig." </sentence><sentence id="1481">They wanted "Der Jude Lustig, hier."" </sentence><sentence id="1482">So he was a puppet. </sentence><sentence id="1483">There's no question about it. </sentence><sentence id="1484">Within the Jews he was all powerful naturally. </sentence><sentence id="1485">He was the one that made up the lists. </sentence><sentence id="1486">He was the one that put cross checks on who should go into transports of nurses, doctors, personnel, patients. </sentence><sentence id="1487">He was the all powerful one. </sentence><sentence id="1488">But within the context of the Nazis, he was a puppet. </sentence><sentence id="1489">He was nothing. </sentence><sentence id="1490">He did their doing. </sentence><sentence id="1491">And if he didn't, he was the one that was punished. </sentence><sentence id="1492">So, it's hard to know how to judge him. </sentence><sentence id="1493">I'm tempted to judge him benevolently. </sentence><sentence id="1494">Many people hated him. </sentence><sentence id="1495">Many people feared him. </sentence><sentence id="1496">He -- of course, you know he was such a powerful man, stories build up. </sentence><sentence id="1497">And I remember so well, when we first came to the hospital, we were in Niedershenhausen, student -- we were 17, 18 years old. </sentence><sentence id="1498">And again I have to caution you to realize what that meant back in the 30s and in Berlin we were so, so simple, so naive. </sentence><sentence id="1499">And then when we were transferred to the big hospital, the rumor went that, "Dr. Lustig will inspect all the student nurses completely naked. </sentence><sentence id="1500">And only the ones that he likes naked he would take in." </sentence><sentence id="1501">Of course it was a stupid rumor, and it did not occur at all, but that was his, his aura. </sentence><sentence id="1502">That was his reputation. </sentence><sentence id="1503">He was all powerful. </sentence><sentence id="1504">He could demand anything he wanted and we had to do it. </sentence><sentence id="1505">But it wasn't so. </sentence><sentence id="1506">He was just a very nice man. </sentence><sentence id="1507">He was very powerful, yes, but also quite nice. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1756">Q: So could you explain what a day might be like? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1758">A: As much as I remember. </sentence><sentence id="1759">We got up in the morning and went to the Speisesaal.*deg We hada dormitory kind of a living where we lived and we called it der Reitsall*" -- the horses station, it was so big you know. </sentence><sentence id="1760">And Golly and I roomed close together, and we had to put our uniforms on, sew on the yellow star very quickly and neatly -- it didn't leave any holes in it. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1764">Q: You mean daily you had to sew on the star? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1766">A: Whenever we changed the uniform. </sentence><sentence id="1767">We got two stars that we had to buy from the Jewish Community for zehn Pfennigs,** for 10 pennies, and we better take care of them. </sentence><sentence id="1768">If we didn't have them, forget it, we were shot. </sentence><sentence id="1769">And then we went to have breakfast, and then we started to work -- whatever our duties use to be. </sentence><sentence id="1770">The children were in long rows of beds and we were assigned to maybe six children that were ours that we had to take care of the whole day long. </sentence><sentence id="1771">And then the doctors would come in and we had to report on the kids. </sentence><sentence id="1772">It wasn't so sophisticated. </sentence><sentence id="1773">Don't think we knew all that much. </sentence><sentence id="1774">And then at noontime we had, I don't recall --I guess we went back to the Speisesaal for lunch, and then the inner circle always went into Schwester Elly's little room and smoked cigarettes with the doors closed. </sentence><sentence id="1775">And then in the evening we went and had supper again. </sentence><sentence id="1776">And we couldn't go out. </sentence><sentence id="1777">There was a curfew. </sentence><sentence id="1778">We had to be there at eight -- back at eight. </sentence><sentence id="1779">So everything that we did, we did within the hospital. </sentence><sentence id="1780">And the hospital was a complex -- a whole compound. </sentence><sentence id="1781">So we did get out for fresh air just by walking across the halls, across the -- to the different buildings. </sentence><sentence id="1782">And of course there were little romances with the young physicians. </sentence><sentence id="1783">Everything was so -- it was so enclosed. </sentence><sentence id="1784">It was so unnatural you see. </sentence><sentence id="1785">It was -- everything was so confined. </sentence><sentence id="1786">So naturally romances sprung up and died down again, and many people left on transports, and once they were here one day and the next day they were gone. </sentence><sentence id="1787">We somehow got use to that. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1884">A: Those were children from the Jewish Community that were sick. </sentence><sentence id="1885">And, little by little, that changed, and little by little it was Mischlinge that came in -- children of mixed marriages. </sentence><sentence id="1886">And then by "43 I left. </sentence><sentence id="1887">And little by little the whole complex of the nurses, and the whole complexion of the staff changed too. </sentence><sentence id="1888">We were replaced by Mischlinge -- by people who were from mixed marriages with whom they didn't know what to do with. </sentence><sentence id="1889">They couldn't put them on the lists yet. </sentence><sentence id="1890">They did later. </sentence><sentence id="1891">In fact, this nice Dr. Elkan(ph) that I was friendly with dumped me for a Mischlinge. </sentence><sentence id="1892">I never forgot and forgave him. </sentence><sentence id="1893">It was just as well. </sentence><sentence id="1894">It was just as well. </sentence><sentence id="1895">There was no time to form emotional bondages. </sentence><sentence id="1896">And in fact I-- she came to this country, too. </sentence><sentence id="1897">I corresponded with her for a while. </sentence><sentence id="1898">You formed such weird friendships -- such weird relationships -- and they lasted. </sentence><sentence id="1899">They really lasted. </sentence><sentence id="1900">I was very friendly with, with -- not the Head Nurse, but the one that came under her. </sentence><sentence id="1901">I don't know what you would call her -- maybe the Assistant Head Nurse -- Schwester Lea(ph). </sentence><sentence id="1902">And we picked each other up again  4 here in this country. </sentence><sentence id="1903">We had really nothing in common otherwise, but that huge balloon of memories. </sentence><sentence id="1904">We could talk with each other and it was like in the comic strips, you know, over our heads was the same picture. </sentence><sentence id="1905">You see? </sentence><sentence id="1906">Was so weird. </sentence><sentence id="1907">And then Golly would come in and over her head was the same picture, and we would talk about that. </sentence><sentence id="1908">Does that give you some idea what it was like? </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1998">A: Oh, that was difficult. </sentence><sentence id="1999">And then Lustig was also very much involved. </sentence><sentence id="2000">All these Befehle," all these SS orders to do things came through Lustig. </sentence><sentence id="2001">The SS never spoke to anyone else, you see. </sentence><sentence id="2002">He was their man. </sentence><sentence id="2003">So Lustig let it be known throughout the hospital -- that was in October of "42, that -- up to then it was sort of, you know, it was sort of dispersed. </sentence><sentence id="2004">But now, all of sudden, it got general. </sentence><sentence id="2005">It got bunched up together -- that we were all going to be  5 appearing the next morning at seven o'clock in full uniforms at the Jewish Community Center on Oranien Strasse . </sentence><sentence id="2006">And that was a big room. </sentence><sentence id="2007">We got there of course. </sentence><sentence id="2008">There was no way we would not go there. </sentence><sentence id="2009">It didn't occur to us not to go. </sentence><sentence id="2010">That's another thing. </sentence><sentence id="2011">We were so conditioned to obey. </sentence><sentence id="2012">If I look at those kids nowadays, they refuse to obey their mothers, or their teachers, or their governors, or their President... It was the furthest thing from our minds not to obey an order, you see. </sentence><sentence id="2013">And when I speak to students, I always encourage them to continue doing that. </sentence><sentence id="2014">So we obeyed. </sentence><sentence id="2015">We went in our uniform with our star, seven o'clock in the morning, the whole bunch of us, and it was a big room, and we just stood there. </sentence><sentence id="2016">We didn't know why. </sentence><sentence id="2017">We had no idea why we were called. </sentence><sentence id="2018">Lustig didn't tell us and nobody else knew. </sentence><sentence id="2019">And we stood and we stood, and it was, we couldn't go to the toilet, we couldn't get any coffee, and I'm quickly reaching for my nice cup of tea so it won't be taken away from me. </sentence><sentence id="2020">We were desperate. </sentence><sentence id="2021">At 12 o'clock, three SS men showed up. </sentence><sentence id="2022">We knew Eichmann. </sentence><sentence id="2023">He was very familiar to us. </sentence><sentence id="2024">We also knew Giinther.*" </sentence><sentence id="2025">He was also familiar. </sentence><sentence id="2026">There were two SS Giinthers -- one from Berlin and one from Prague. </sentence><sentence id="2027">This was Giinther from Berlin. </sentence><sentence id="2028">And then there were three Jews from Vienna. </sentence><sentence id="2029">And then there was an SS man whom we didn't know. </sentence><sentence id="2030">And of course we couldn't whisper among each other, "Who was that? </sentence><sentence id="2031">What's going on?" </sentence><sentence id="2032">That was completely out. </sentence><sentence id="2033">And at first they didn't talk to us at all. </sentence><sentence id="2034">They just stood there in front of us and smoked and laughed and joked. </sentence><sentence id="2035">Very young, our age. </sentence><sentence id="2036">I was 20 at that point. </sentence><sentence id="2037">And then they called before them the heads of each of the Jewish departments -- of each department, including Lustig who was head of the hospital. </sentence><sentence id="2038">And then, then first of all, that guy introduced himself. </sentence><sentence id="2039">He was Brunner -- Anton Brunner" from Vienna. </sentence><sentence id="2040">And he had come from Vienna with those three Jews. </sentence><sentence id="2041">Then he told us why he was there, and in his own Viennese dialect, which is still ringing in my ears he said, and of course I'll say it in English, that he came to show the SS in Berlin how to deal with the Jews -- how they had dealt with the Jews in Vienna. </sentence><sentence id="2042">And that's why he came and brought the three Jews with him. </sentence><sentence id="2043">How to deal with the Jews? </sentence><sentence id="2044">We thought they had been doing fine up to now. </sentence><sentence id="2045">But his innovation was -- his fork in the road -- was that from now on the Jews had to do the dirty work. </sentence><sentence id="2046">And he demonstrated it right away. </sentence><sentence id="2047">He told the leaders of each department to pick their own, to pick their own -- 30 percent of each department to go into transport. </sentence><sentence id="2048">He wasn't gonna bother picking anymore. </sentence><sentence id="2049">He had each of the Jews pick their own Jews. </sentence><sentence id="2050">And that didn't sink in right away, but after it sank in it was really ein Wendepunkt(tm) --a tuming point -- a pivotal point in the history of the Holocaust. </sentence><sentence id="2051">From then on it was Jews stuffing Jews into the, into the cattle cars. </sentence><sentence id="2052">It was Jews taking the Jews out of the cattle cars, too, and doing all the, all the agents of their own destruction they were from then on. </sentence><sentence id="2053">And under that falls the Kapos&gt; and the Jewish elders, and even we, we got white armbands. </sentence><sentence id="2054">We had to go  6 around helping them and we had to do our own. </sentence><sentence id="2055">That was very diabolic. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2116">A: Well we were sent home. </sentence><sentence id="2117">Somehow I wasn't picked to go into transport so I was sent back to the hospital, and a few weeks later we were sent again. </sentence><sentence id="2118">We were sent three times. </sentence><sentence id="2119">Yes, and then the second time -- the first time he took hostages. </sentence><sentence id="2120">Brunner took hostages. </sentence><sentence id="2121">The first time he still let the people go home. </sentence><sentence id="2122">The people had to pick their own people to go into transport and he allowed them to go home -- to pack and to say "goodbye." </sentence><sentence id="2123">But he kept 20 of the high officials of the Jewish Community hostages. </sentence><sentence id="2124">And he said that if not everybody would show up, those 20 people would be killed. </sentence><sentence id="2125">At the time I still remembered their names and I think I wrote it into my, into my notes. </sentence><sentence id="2126">I could look it up. </sentence><sentence id="2127">But it's not important at the moment. </sentence><sentence id="2128">And some actually did either kill themselves -- some of the people who were supposed to go to transport either killed themselves or went underground, or just ran away. </sentence><sentence id="2129">And he actually did kill those 20 people. </sentence><sentence id="2130">He sent the ashes to their families. </sentence><sentence id="2131">So we knew he meant business. </sentence><sentence id="2132">And that was the same thing later in Theresienstadt. </sentence><sentence id="2133">If something went wrong -- 20, 200, 2,000 -- were killed for one person. </sentence><sentence id="2134">So that's the reason why I didn't -- why we didn't think of, of objecting, of doing anything against them. </sentence><sentence id="2135">We couldn't be responsible for the death of our own people. </sentence><sentence id="2136">But anyway, so then we were sent back, and the second time we were sent back, he called the head of the Jewish Community before him -- that was Dr. Kraindl -- and Kraindl was struck by a heart attack in front of these SS people and fell dead. </sentence><sentence id="2137">And he said, "Move him. </sentence><sentence id="2138">Go away. </sentence><sentence id="2139">Take away that dead person. </sentence><sentence id="2140">Just another dead Jew." </sentence><sentence id="2141">And then the third time we were told to go the Kasernen(tm) -- to the barracks to help with the transportation of the Jews. </sentence><sentence id="2142">Now that was in February of "43 during the big Fabrikaktion. </sentence><sentence id="2143">&gt; The Fabrikaktion was that they went into the -- into those factories and took out the people who were working there who thought they were protected -- who had been promised protection because they worked for the -- for the military units. </sentence><sentence id="2144">And they came by the thousands. </sentence><sentence id="2145">They came in huge furniture vans stuffed with Jews, just they way they were from the factories -- in their aprons -- with their clothes -- and always with the star of course. </sentence><sentence id="2146">And we had to take care of them. </sentence><sentence id="2147">We had...One of my friends, her name was Klara, I remember it. </sentence><sentence id="2148">We were assigned to the Rathenower Kaserne in Berlin. </sentence><sentence id="2149">I had never been there. </sentence><sentence id="2150">We had to go there by special permit to use the public transportation. </sentence><sentence id="2151">And there was this huge barrack, and the Jews were not allowed to use the toilets. </sentence><sentence id="2152">That was the first thing. </sentence><sentence id="2153">No food of course -- no toilets -- nothing. </sentence><sentence id="2154">So then some Jewish people came who dug a ditch in the backyard. </sentence><sentence id="2155">That was the toilet. </sentence><sentence id="2156">And then finally some coffee came. </sentence><sentence id="2157">But in between that we already had some thousands of Jews who were  7 beside themselves -- direct from the factory -- without their mothers or fathers or children or husbands, or anybody. </sentence><sentence id="2158">That was really pandemonium in that -- in those barracks. </sentence><sentence id="2159">Then I remember we had to go out and take in all these people that came by the hundreds. </sentence><sentence id="2160">And I remember one van opened up and blood stained people fell out. </sentence><sentence id="2161">They had resisted and the SS shot them. </sentence><sentence id="2162">Big deal, you know. </sentence><sentence id="2163">And we weren't allowed to do anything to them -- we just...We had no material anyway. </sentence><sentence id="2164">So they were then shipped off too, the way they were -- bleeding. </sentence><sentence id="2165">And then we were...

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3027">Q: Did the old people live separate from...? </sentence><sentence id="3028">How were the barracks divided, or how were the living situations divided? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3031">A: At first everybody had to go into the barracks and lie on the floor on straw. </sentence><sentence id="3032">And then the old people went into the old aged home which was miserable, miserable. </sentence><sentence id="3033">The barracks were better than that. </sentence><sentence id="3034">Dark and dirty and just hopeless, smelly. </sentence><sentence id="3035">And that was a terrible situation. </sentence><sentence id="3036">And the young people were taken to appropriate works. </sentence><sentence id="3037">You see the ghetto was completely organized and taken care of by Jews. </sentence><sentence id="3038">There was ghetto Jewish police and Jewish firemen, and we took care of the kids, and, of course, Jewish nurses and doctors, and Jewish street- sweepers and the whole works. </sentence><sentence id="3039">And the Judeniiltester"? -- </sentence><sentence id="3040">Eppstein"! </sentence><sentence id="3041">and Edelstein" and  8 Murmelstein" -- three stones. </sentence><sentence id="3042">Does that explain it to you? </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3407">A: It's hard to say. </sentence><sentence id="3408">I'm sure there were male-female friendships as well. </sentence><sentence id="3409">First of all, as I mentioned before, marriages were permitted, and my friend Golly very soon married the man that she had followed, and then lived with him in a small little room somewheres -- even just in a corner of a small room. </sentence><sentence id="3410">It was not a luxurious way of living. </sentence><sentence id="3411">So there was male- female relationships throughout the ghetto, and I would think, yes, there were friendships either way. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3417">Q: No. </sentence><sentence id="3418">I would have asked you that question, but I was also asking a question about male friendships with other men. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3421">A: Oh. </sentence><sentence id="3422">I wasn't aware of that. </sentence><sentence id="3423">No. </sentence><sentence id="3424">I was not aware of that. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3429">Q: So you were separated from -- the men were living separately from the women, except for those people who were--? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3431">A: Yes. </sentence><sentence id="3432">Yes, that's correct. </sentence><sentence id="3433">Oh, definitely. </sentence><sentence id="3434">No, I was not afraid of -- I was not aware of same sex friendships. </sentence><sentence id="3435">You know that was very, very taboo. </sentence><sentence id="3436">Number one in the Jewish Religion, and number one in Germany. </sentence><sentence id="3437">Hitler killed homosexuals. </sentence><sentence id="3438">The list of hate was Jews, homosexuals, blacks and then everybody else. </sentence><sentence id="3439">But that was not allowed. </sentence><sentence id="3440">Ah, forget it. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3451">Q: No, [actually wasn't referring to sexual relations now. </sentence><sentence id="3452">I really meant the friendships that were like the friendship you had with Eva, because you're talking about a relationship that helped you to survive, right? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3455">A: Yes. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3457">Q: And I was wondering whether you saw, among men, a similar kind of pairing of, you know. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="3459">And were the pairings among men and women that weren't marriage, for instance, that were love affairs, were they always love affairs, or was that because the men had access to things that the women needed? </sentence><sentence id="3460">In other words, were they not always just straight forward not that love is straight forward? </sentence><sentence id="3461">Do you know what I mean? </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3462">A: I don't quite see what you're asking me. </sentence><sentence id="3463">Are you asking me if the kind of friendship I had with Eva, I could also observe between two men? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3466">Q: That's one question. </sentence><sentence id="3467"> 3 </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3470">A: Yeah. </sentence><sentence id="3471">I'm wondering if I'm at all able to answer that because I had no insight into where the men lived, but I would think "yes." </sentence><sentence id="3472">I would think they formed very close camaraderie as well. </sentence><sentence id="3473">How else could they survive? </sentence><sentence id="3474">So I would think the question of that must be "yes," but I wouldn't know from any personal experience. </sentence><sentence id="3475">Now what was the other part of the question? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3482">Q: Well, I'll ask it in a balder -- in a balder way. </sentence><sentence id="3483">Was there prostitution in Theresienstadt? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3486">A: That's a good question, and I have often been asked that. </sentence><sentence id="3487">I did not observe it while I was there, but since then I have read a lot about it. </sentence><sentence id="3488">But I don't think that there was because the Nazis were strictly forbidden to fraternize with the Jews -- strictly. </sentence><sentence id="3489">And if anything like that occurred, it wasn't only the Jew that was punished, the Nazi was punished as well. </sentence><sentence id="3490">But I have since then heard so much of that, that I'm wondering if I was just not aware of it. </sentence><sentence id="3491">But I don't think so. </sentence><sentence id="3492">It certainly wasn't so that I could observe it. </sentence><sentence id="3493">The Nazis and Jews were strictly separated. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3502">Q: How about among Jews? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3504">A: How about what? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3506">Q: Among Jews? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3508">A: Sex among Jews? </sentence><sentence id="3509">I would think "yes." </sentence><sentence id="3510">I would think that went on. </sentence><sentence id="3511">We were not in a situation like Auschwitz, and also we were healthier. </sentence><sentence id="3512">And fairly -- there were babies born in the ghetto. </sentence><sentence id="3513">So that -- so my answer is "yes." </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3520">Q: Did they survive? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3522">A: Yes. </sentence><sentence id="3523">They came to us to the home. </sentence><sentence id="3524">We took care of them, with their mothers. </sentence><sentence id="3525">The mothers nursed and the fathers came to visit, so I would say "yes." </sentence><sentence id="3526">There was a normal life there. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3532">Q: Do you think these were pregnancies that occurred prior to arrival in Theresienstadt, or were people well enough you think... </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3534">A: Both. </sentence><sentence id="3535">Both. </sentence><sentence id="3536">Many came pregnant from their homes -- from their original homes -- very many, and I would think.... Also, officially, pregnancies had to be terminated, and were in the whole Elbe Hospital. </sentence><sentence id="3537">But yes, I think we had some babies there that were.... </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3542">Q: So there were abortions that were forced? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3544">A: Absolutely. </sentence><sentence id="3545">That was... They were ordered. </sentence><sentence id="3546"> 4 </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3554">A: No. </sentence><sentence id="3555">There was no question -- no problem. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3558">Q: Did you ever have to participate in any of these? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3560">A: No. </sentence><sentence id="3561">I was not in that part of the health system. </sentence><sentence id="3562">I was with the product -- with the nurses with the babies. </sentence><sentence id="3563">We got quite attached to some of those babies. </sentence><sentence id="3564">And that's how I met Jirca. </sentence><sentence id="3565">He was the brother of one of the nursing mothers there, you see. </sentence><sentence id="3566">Otherwise, I don't think I would have known him. </sentence><sentence id="3567">And, you know, we were both young, and we went on walks together. </sentence><sentence id="3568">One thing I remember so much from Theresienstadt is we got such a love and appreciation of the stars, of the firmament. </sentence><sentence id="3569">You know that was one of the few things we were allowed to do. </sentence><sentence id="3570">We could look up and look, and he knew the stars very well, so he gave me a lasting appreciation of constellations, and of planets, and first magnitude stars, and I was very happy about that. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3582">Q: Wasn't there a situation where he took you to -- he was ringing church bells? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3584">A: Yes. </sentence><sentence id="3585">And then, during the International Commission, and already before, they decided that the town would look more normal if that, up to then dead, clock up on the church tower would spring to life. </sentence><sentence id="3586">And somehow, I don't know why, he got the job of winding up that clock, and he took me with him a couple of times. </sentence><sentence id="3587">And that was a permanent event in my life. </sentence><sentence id="3588">I can still see every steep step that I climbed, I climbed up there. </sentence><sentence id="3589">And as I got higher and higher, how the fragrant air came through that opening, "cause there was nothing -- it was open, you see, on the top, and how that wonderful air from the surrounding countrysides....The ghetto of course had always bad air, also many people, and there was nothing to give air to. </sentence><sentence id="3590">And here I came up this was this -- and then the view -- and he could see Prague in the distance. </sentence><sentence id="3591">I couldn't, but I think he kind of hoped he could see Prague. </sentence><sentence id="3592">That was his home town. </sentence><sentence id="3593">But I could see the Elbe and the Eger. </sentence><sentence id="3594">That was wonderful blue rivers, unpolluted, and I can still remember how I wished I could swim, and how I almost felt the cool water on my shoulders. </sentence><sentence id="3595">We hadn't been swimming since I was a child, you see. </sentence><sentence id="3596">And I can still remember how I dreamt that I could dive into that water and feel the water go over my shoulders. </sentence><sentence id="3597">And then we heard bird sings. </sentence><sentence id="3598">But also as we looked at the beautiful things, we also saw die Kleine Festung." </sentence><sentence id="3599">One of the features of the ghetto was what was called "die Kleine Festung." </sentence><sentence id="3600">That was -- you see, Theresienstadt was a garrison town built in the 1600s or the 1700s for soldiers, and naturally they had to have like a correction place for soldiers that needed to be punished, and that was die -- a medieval fortress -- a medieval, almost like a torture fortress, where they put the soldiers that needed to be isolated. </sentence><sentence id="3601">And they recovered this again from medieval times and put the Jews in there. </sentence><sentence id="3602">Took terrible consequences. </sentence><sentence id="3603">The Jews there were -- were never returned. </sentence><sentence id="3604">It was also, by the way, a historical place. </sentence><sentence id="3605">The young man by the name of Gavrilo Princip who shot the Crown Prince in 1914, and started World War I in Sarajevo -- I say "Sarajevo" -- You say it differently, don't you? </sentence><sentence id="3606">How do you say it?Sarajevo. </sentence><sentence id="3607">Sarajevo, which is so much in the news now. </sentence><sentence id="3608">That how World War I started as you  5 probably know. </sentence><sentence id="3609">It was called, "the shot that went around the world." </sentence><sentence id="3610">That young man -- that young Princip was imprisoned in the Kleine Festung, and then he died just before the end of the war, and he's buried outside the Kleine Festung. </sentence><sentence id="3611">So it has a very historical side to it. </sentence><sentence id="3612">So this is what we saw from up on the tower and I only, reluctantly, always, went back down into the ghetto after he took me up there. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3644">Q: It was more than once. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3646">A: I think it was a couple of times. </sentence><sentence id="3647">It kind of kaleidoscoped into one because each time it was such a wonderful experience. </sentence><sentence id="3648">It think it was maybe two, three times. </sentence><sentence id="3649">And he was, naturally, not allowed to take me up there, so by the time we came down into the, into the ground floor again, he always had to look out first that no SS was around and then he could sneak me out. </sentence><sentence id="3650">We took pleasure where we could. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3656">Q: So there's always this combination of the background being so sad and deprived, and yet- </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3658">A: Yes. </sentence><sentence id="3659">I always feel a little guilty because I did not go through that terrible hell that so many of other Jews went through. </sentence><sentence id="3660">I never was in a gas chamber. </sentence><sentence id="3661">I was never in real danger of my life. </sentence><sentence id="3662">I was, of course, constantly, "cause all the time those transports would go out -- and I survived. </sentence><sentence id="3663">And I that's -- I think part of why I'm still religious -- I did survive. </sentence><sentence id="3664">Miracles did happen. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3672">Q: Let me ask you a couple of other things. </sentence><sentence id="3673">Did you menstruate in the ghetto, or did it stop? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3676">A: It stopped. </sentence><sentence id="3677">It stopped. </sentence><sentence id="3678">We were so worried when they took our, our napkins as contraband in the Schleusse. </sentence><sentence id="3679">And of course, by the way, those were not these elegant little contraptions that young women use today. </sentence><sentence id="3680">It was something that we used, had to wash out afterwards, and used again. </sentence><sentence id="3681">And we were so worried when it was... when those were taken from us, and then we didn't need them for which reason I don't know. </sentence><sentence id="3682">And it impacted us differently. </sentence><sentence id="3683">Some of us became very heavy and very fat, and others became very thin after we lost our menstruation -- and | kind of got a little thin and Eva got a little heavier -- I don't know why. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3692">Q: Tell me about Freddi Hirsch. </sentence><sentence id="3693">What was your relationship with him? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3696">A: Nice. </sentence><sentence id="3697">I met Freddi when I was still in the Hundertschaft because I was detailed to sweep in front of his home -- his children's home. </sentence><sentence id="3698">He was the leader of the children's home. </sentence><sentence id="3699">He was already a prominent Zionist before, and he attracted the young people around himself. </sentence><sentence id="3700">And then when he got out of the Hundertschaft, he was detailed to the children's home to work with the children. </sentence><sentence id="3701">It was of course forbidden to have classes or real instructions, so he always was able to lead and guide and instruct the children kind of on the sly. </sentence><sentence id="3702">While they were  6 supposedly working, he would give instructions, and he was very much beloved. </sentence><sentence id="3703">He was a very lovely young man ~--a real Zionist --a real ethical figure. </sentence><sentence id="3704">And the Germans respected him for a long time, and then the reason he got into the next transport was -- yes, I remember that. </sentence><sentence id="3705">A transport of children from Czechoslovakia showed up -- from Slovakia showed up -- alone -- barefoot, in terrible condition -- and we heard about it. </sentence><sentence id="3706">And they didn't speak anything but Polish, and he of course spoke Polish. </sentence><sentence id="3707">And we... Eva went as a nurse to that transport also. </sentence><sentence id="3708">I didn't. </sentence><sentence id="3709">I don't know why. </sentence><sentence id="3710">That was the one time we didn't do things together. </sentence><sentence id="3711">That transport was a group of children whose parents had been shot, and these children had witnessed that, and they were very frightened -- very intimidated. </sentence><sentence id="3712">And the order came from the SS that we were not allowed to speak to them. </sentence><sentence id="3713">We were not allowed to know that their parents were shot and killed, and the kids, not speaking any other language but Polish, were not permitted to speak to us who spoke German. </sentence><sentence id="3714">So Freddi Hirsch disobeyed that order and spoke to the children in a soothing way, and he was caught at that, and he was, of course, put onto the next transport. </sentence><sentence id="3715">And he wrote a card back that I remember. </sentence><sentence id="3716">After some time he wrote back that... First for a long time we didn't hear from him, and then he wrote back, "We should do all we can to stay in the ghetto and not to volunteer and not to provoke our entrance into an east transport." </sentence><sentence id="3717">And we were puzzled about this because we thought we had it very bad. </sentence><sentence id="3718">We had no news from Auschwitz. </sentence><sentence id="3719">We did not know how bad they had it, and so we, we got our first inkling how bad Auschwitz must be if he advised us to stay where we are. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3744">Q: So you heard no -- did you continually hear rumors about gas chambers, or did they stop? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3746">A: That stopped. </sentence><sentence id="3747">I heard that once in Berlin, "Die werden alle vergast." </sentence><sentence id="3748">And I thought that guy was out of his mind to make such a statement, and then we didn't hear it anymore. </sentence><sentence id="3749">We didn't hear it anymore. </sentence><sentence id="3750">We heard only that they were working, and they couldn't write for a while they could write, but only for a while. </sentence><sentence id="3751">And I never heard from Eva and Werner Simmon. </sentence><sentence id="3752">I surely would have heard from them if they had lived. </sentence><sentence id="3753">And when Golly was deported to Auschwitz, or rather when she followed her husband to Auschwitz, I didn't hear from her. </sentence><sentence id="3754">So, there was something fishy going on and we knew it. </sentence><sentence id="3755">But also we -- I think we purposely closed our minds to it. </sentence><sentence id="3756">We purposely -- because we were so apt to go into the next transport, and why should we think we were going to be killed right away So, self preservation, we took that out of our minds. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3768">Q: And who was choosing the people to go on transports? </sentence><sentence id="3769">Also the Judenrat?(r)" </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3772">A: Yes. </sentence><sentence id="3773">I have to assume so. </sentence><sentence id="3774">Yes. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3778">Q: You're not sure? </sentence><sentence id="3779"> 7 </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3782">A: I'm not sure, but.... Yes, of course it was the Judenrat. </sentence><sentence id="3783">I am sure, because when the October transports -- the one that Jirca went on, just before the Commission. </sentence><sentence id="3784">Then all of a sudden Edelstein was taken prisoner, and his wife was told to bring food three times a day, and to bring fresh clothing once a week. </sentence><sentence id="3785">And she never got any -- any dishes back, and she never got any dirty laundry back. </sentence><sentence id="3786">He was, as we know now, he was already in the Kleine Festung and probably already dead. </sentence><sentence id="3787">And the reason was that he did not want to cooperate in those transports. </sentence><sentence id="3788">He refused to put that many people up for transports. </sentence><sentence id="3789">So the answer to your original question is "yes." </sentence><sentence id="3790">It was the Jews who made the transport. </sentence><sentence id="3791">Of course it had to be. </sentence><sentence id="3792">The Germans didn't do it anymore. </sentence><sentence id="3793">Why should they? </sentence><sentence id="3794">And it was the Jews who worked in the Schleusse. </sentence><sentence id="3795">The Schleusse of course went both ways -- in and out. </sentence><sentence id="3796">And who took the people to the cattle cars and everything else? </sentence><sentence id="3797">Thank God I never had to do that. </sentence><sentence id="3798">I only went to all the incoming transports to see if I would find anybody I knew. </sentence><sentence id="3799">And, in fact, by then the trains came right into the ghetto. </sentence><sentence id="3800">And there was a certain barrack where we could go to and just look out the window and see the people come. </sentence><sentence id="3801">Eva and I did that. </sentence><sentence id="3802">We watched to see if we knew anybody. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3824">Q: When the people worked in the Schleusse, do you think they stole things? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3826">A: Yes, I would think so. </sentence><sentence id="3827">I would think so. </sentence><sentence id="3828">I would think so. </sentence><sentence id="3829">I don't think they considered it stealing "cause-- </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3834">Q: No, no-- </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3836">A: "Cause it was that -- it was already stolen in the first place. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3838">Q: I didn't mean that in the derogatory sense. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3840">A: But I think so, yes. </sentence><sentence id="3841">And then they could do a little good with it. </sentence><sentence id="3842">And then often they would exchange these things for cigarettes. </sentence><sentence id="3843">Cigarettes were very coveted. </sentence><sentence id="3844">Everybody wanted to smoke. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3850">Q: Why? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3852">A: Don't ask me, I never smoked, and I never touched a cigarette -- or maybe I touched one once or twice -- but they loved cigarettes. </sentence><sentence id="3853">I think it got them away from the ghetto. </sentence><sentence id="3854">I think it made them feel normal again. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3858">Q: And why didn't you smoke? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3860">A: I never did. </sentence><sentence id="3861"> 8 </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3864">Q: Did Eva? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3866">A: No. </sentence><sentence id="3867">Never. </sentence><sentence id="3868">No. </sentence><sentence id="3869">It wasn't done. </sentence><sentence id="3870">At home nobody smoked. </sentence><sentence id="3871">It never occurred to me to smoke. </sentence><sentence id="3872">Maybe I did once or twice, and I think I was very sick afterwards, so I never did it again. </sentence><sentence id="3873">I still don't smoke. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3882">Q: What was your food like? </sentence><sentence id="3883">What was your daily--? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3886">A: The food. </sentence><sentence id="3887">When we came in, as our belongings were taken away from us, we got in return one little thing -- one little pot kind of a thing out of metal, that we had to hook onto ourselves -- and not to lose it, because we didn't get a second one. </sentence><sentence id="3888">If we lost it, we just didn't get any food. </sentence><sentence id="3889">So we hung onto it for dear life. </sentence><sentence id="3890">And three times a day, while we were still in the Hundertschaft -- in the beginning -- three times a day we went to the Essensausgabe*! - </sentence><sentence id="3891">the distribution center for the food. </sentence><sentence id="3892">And in the morning we got coffee, and they called it eine buchta(r) -- was kind of a square shaped piece of bread. </sentence><sentence id="3893">And at noontime we got soup and bread, and a little margarine, I think. </sentence><sentence id="3894">And in the evening we got soup, and a little sugar, and coffee. </sentence><sentence id="3895">And that had to do us. </sentence><sentence id="3896">And maybe a little bit bread again. </sentence><sentence id="3897">But then when we worked in the children's home, then the food came to us already. </sentence><sentence id="3898">It came into the home and it was much better then. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3912">Q: Was it prepared in the home, or was it already prepared? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3914">A: No, no. </sentence><sentence id="3915">There was one central station that did all the food. </sentence></p></dialogue>

</sentence><sentence id="4615">And so at first we just ignored it. </sentence><sentence id="4616">And then the next morning, we heard it again. </sentence><sentence id="4617">And then we heard it from people whom we trusted that were in with the administration, and we heard -- especially we, we young women who were still looking pretty well, we heard, "Go ahead. </sentence><sentence id="4618">Go and register for that transport. </sentence><sentence id="4619">Hurry up." </sentence><sentence id="4620">And so after a while, Eva in her light -- I would never have registered , I'm sure I thank my whole life to her -- she said, "Come on, let's go. </sentence><sentence id="4621">Let's go. </sentence><sentence id="4622">Let's register. </sentence><sentence id="4623">Why wait for anything else?" </sentence><sentence id="4624">And of course all we could think of was all those transports that they said would go to Palestine, and they never got to Palestine. </sentence><sentence id="4625">So I said, "But what if we end up in Auschwitz?" </sentence><sentence id="4626">So she said, "Then our problems are solved if we should join the other one. </sentence><sentence id="4627">Then we're together already anyway. </sentence><sentence id="4628">So, nothing to lose. </sentence><sentence id="4629">We go." </sentence><sentence id="4630"> 8 So we went, and we had to register, which was very different from the other transports. </sentence><sentence id="4631">We were looked over. </sentence><sentence id="4632">We had to answer questions, especially the question I remember was, "Did any one of your family ever die in Theresienstadt, or was sent away to the East?" </sentence><sentence id="4633">And we had nobody, you see. </sentence><sentence id="4634">So we could say ""no." </sentence><sentence id="4635">And then we saw him write down that we could get into the transport. </sentence><sentence id="4636">And then the next day -- this was all packed into two days, you see. </sentence><sentence id="4637">There was no way of come back in two weeks or anything like that, no red tape of any kind. </sentence><sentence id="4638">So then the next day we got that brown slip that I showed you before where it says that we should appear on February the fourth, at seven o'clock in the evening, with one suitcase -- no bedrolls, no rucksacks, nothing of the kind -- and nicely dressed and punctual. </sentence><sentence id="4639">The Germans were very much for punctuality, whether that was for your liberation or for your death, you be punctual. </sentence><sentence id="4640">So we went, and we left the rest of the people in the basement room, and we really didn't believe we were really going to Switzerland. </sentence><sentence id="4641">We did believe something was different. </sentence><sentence id="4642">And in the train, it was not a cattle car this time, in the train we got packages of marmalade, and stuff that I didn't even know what to do with. </sentence><sentence id="4643">And then we left, Eva and I very much together, and we really got to Switzerland. </sentence><sentence id="4644">And when we got to Switzerland, we crossed the border into Switzerland I remember three things that stayed in my mind very much. </sentence><sentence id="4645">We looked out the window. </sentence><sentence id="4646">Number one, nobody yelled us, "Get back in or you'll be shot," you know. </sentence><sentence id="4647">And number two, the people smiled. </sentence><sentence id="4648">I hadn't seen a person smile in 12 years. </sentence><sentence id="4649">What was there to smile at? </sentence><sentence id="4650">All through my youth and my growing up. </sentence><sentence id="4651">The people smiled at us. </sentence><sentence id="4652">And the person that -- then some Swiss people in uniform came in and they were nice to us, and that was unheard of, anyone in uniform being nice to Jews. </sentence><sentence id="4653">What's this?Gan Eden?(tm) Already we're dead and we're in paradise. </sentence><sentence id="4654">Was unheard of. </sentence><sentence id="4655">And then the third thing I remember, night fell and the lights stayed on. </sentence><sentence id="4656">There was no war in Switzerland, you see. </sentence><sentence id="4657">The lights purposely stayed on so the airplanes overhead could tell that it was Switzerland and wouldn't bomb it. </sentence><sentence id="4658">But to us it was an epiphany. </sentence><sentence id="4659">It was unheard of. </sentence><sentence id="4660">So then we were allowed to pick one of the several places where we could go, and Eva and I stayed together and picked Les Avants, and then she fell in love with a French refugee who had also come, and she followed him to France because she was completely alone. </sentence><sentence id="4661">And I contacted my father, and then he let me come over to America, and I married. </sentence><sentence id="4662">And by gosh when our kids became teenagers they visited back and forth, and J ean(r)" fell in love with Polly" --right under my eyes, and I didn't see it happen. </sentence><sentence id="4663">And I didn't know for many years just how that all came about. </sentence><sentence id="4664">May I tell you just very quickly. </sentence><sentence id="4665">Maybe you know it already, but to me it was a very, very fascinating story because I discovered it myself. </sentence><sentence id="4666">It wasn't told to me. </sentence><sentence id="4667">I went to the National Archives. </sentence><sentence id="4668">I had an advisor, Tim Mulligan, to guide me through the whole process, and I discovered the documents and read them, and I found out that at the end of 1944, a Jewish-Swiss woman by the name of Recha Sternbuch, very religious woman.... I'll condense the story a little bit -- approached  9 Jean-Marie Musy, who was a Swiss -- a former Swiss President. </sentence><sentence id="4669">First she thought she wanted her mother and father to be taken out of Germany. </sentence><sentence id="4670">Musy was a friend of Himmler's and he had rescued a few Jews before, and she approached him to get her parents out. </sentence><sentence id="4671">And then, she thought, "Why not try to get all the Jews out?" </sentence><sentence id="4672">It was late in the war, and she asked him to contact Himmler, and she said she, in turn, would contact the Americans and see if for a certain ransom he would let the Jews out of Germany. </sentence><sentence id="4673">And by gosh he agreed. </sentence><sentence id="4674">This is now, of course, I'm condensing this very much. </sentence><sentence id="4675">He agreed. </sentence><sentence id="4676">Musy went to Germany to meet him first in his railroad car, then at another secret location, and he agreed. </sentence><sentence id="4677">And I saw the correspondence between him and -- Himmler and Musy -- and then later with Sternbuch. </sentence><sentence id="4678">He wanted first -- first he wanted lorries, trucks to continue the war, but the Americans of course didn't do that. </sentence><sentence id="4679">In the meantime Sternbuch had contacted the Va'ad Ha-Hatsala, which is the Union of Orthodox Rabbis of America and Canada. </sentence><sentence id="4680">And they had formed this Va'ad, just for the purpose of helping the Jews -- the war was ending -- whom they knew would come and needed help, even in Europe. </sentence><sentence id="4681">And when Sternbuch contacted them, they immediately agreed to collect money to buy out the Jews. </sentence><sentence id="4682">In the end, the first transport, it was exchanged for 5,000,000 American dollars, and was to be of twelve hundred people out of Theresienstadt, because we still looked good, and as I have said before, especially we young people were urged to, to come. </sentence><sentence id="4683">And then Hitler -- and the condition that Himmler made was that he should get good publicity in Swiss and American press. </sentence><sentence id="4684">Why? </sentence><sentence id="4685">Because he saw the war ending, and he saw his own fate clearly before him. </sentence><sentence id="4686">After all, he was the originator of all that killing, and he now wanted to whitewash himself. </sentence><sentence id="4687">He wanted good publicity and good treatment when the war ended. </sentence><sentence id="4688">And this was done without Hitler's knowledge. </sentence><sentence id="4689">And Hitler heard about it. </sentence><sentence id="4690">When the first 1,200 Jews came out, he heard about it. </sentence><sentence id="4691">And he immediately disinherited Himmler. </sentence><sentence id="4692">Himmler had to flee, and he forbade every other contact -- every other release -- Jews or non-Jews -- nobody leaves Germany anymore. </sentence><sentence id="4693">So we were the only transport. </sentence><sentence id="4694">And Musy, who it is believed enriched himself from those 5,000,000 dollars went back into obscurity. </sentence><sentence id="4695">Nobody heard from him. </sentence><sentence id="4696">Then he died. </sentence><sentence id="4697">He was already 76 years old at the time of his intercourse with Himmler. </sentence><sentence id="4698">But he died later. </sentence><sentence id="4699">Mrs. Sternbuch was much honored and also died much later --in "71. </sentence><sentence id="4700">And Himmler had to flee first from Hitler, who was going to kill him -- and he wandered around Liineburger Heide which is a place --a lonely place in Germany, and then he had to flee from the Allies. </sentence><sentence id="4701">It was the English -- the British that captured that part of Germany. </sentence><sentence id="4702">And when the Allies did capture him, not knowing whom they had, he took cyanide and killed himself. </sentence><sentence id="4703">And then they knew it was Himmler. </sentence><sentence id="4704">It was too late. </sentence><sentence id="4705">And I was saved. </sentence><sentence id="4706">He tried to save himself and he saved me instead. </sentence><sentence id="4707">Isn't that a miracle? </sentence><sentence id="4708">I was number 1,400-- number 1,174 out of those 1,200. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="5085">Q: What did you do? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="5087">A: Well, two things -- one egotistical and the other altruistic. </sentence><sentence id="5088">The egotistical first. </sentence><sentence id="5089">I got myself an education. </sentence><sentence id="5090">I went to college. </sentence><sentence id="5091">My husband, my husband was always very understanding of me. </sentence><sentence id="5092">He could see, he could see my whole situation much better than I could. </sentence><sentence id="5093">And by then -- this took a while. </sentence><sentence id="5094">My first depression occurred after my first baby was born. </sentence><sentence id="5095">And then I still was very timid, very much afraid of authority, very much reluctant to approach anyone that was in authority "cause that was dangerous up "til then. </sentence><sentence id="5096">So then after a while I missed very much that I didn't have an education. </sentence><sentence id="5097">And after a while then I went to Bates College in Lewiston, and they accepted me as one of the very first non-College age students. </sentence><sentence id="5098">See now, this is different. </sentence><sentence id="5099">This was in the "50s -- in the "60s. </sentence><sentence id="5100">I graduated in "71. </sentence><sentence id="5101">I was only the second person of non-- of not eighteen years old. </sentence><sentence id="5102">I was like 46 or 47, and I did alright. </sentence><sentence id="5103">I graduated with a lot of honors and I loved every moment of it. </sentence><sentence id="5104">And then I was done. </sentence><sentence id="5105">And then I didn't know what to do again, so my husband urged me and he said, "Go to graduate school. </sentence><sentence id="5106">Become a librarian," "cause I liked books. </sentence><sentence id="5107">And I did that and again I graduated, so now what? </sentence><sentence id="5108">So he said, "Take a job. </sentence><sentence id="5109">Be a librarian." </sentence><sentence id="5110">And Bates College took me as a librarian, and I was very happy there during the years. </sentence><sentence id="5111">And then the second part comes in -- the altruistic part if I may say so. </sentence><sentence id="5112">Then I began to realize Bates College, up to not too long ago, was a very Baptist college. </sentence><sentence id="5113">When my husband became college physician in -- soon after our marriage, in the early "50s, he was only the second Jewish employee of that whole college, and the college was in existence for some 150 years or so -- and very limited Jewish students and no Jewish activities. </sentence><sentence id="5114">And they didn't know Jews or Jewish contexts or nothing about the Holocaust. </sentence><sentence id="5115">So an opportunity presented itself, ready made, and I stepped in. </sentence><sentence id="5116">I got myself funding from the National Humanities Counsel, and from Jewish organizations, and I began to educate the College. </sentence><sentence id="5117">I did programs of Jewish contexts, and I made month-long informational college affairs where the people could hear speeches and ask questions, have dialogues, and simply inform themselves, "What is Judaism? </sentence><sentence id="5118">What are Jews? </sentence><sentence id="5119">What are the finer points of it?" </sentence><sentence id="5120">And really, I was quite successful. </sentence><sentence id="5121">I got a Jewish library into the college, when the Rabbi of the city where I lived died. </sentence><sentence id="5122">This was all back in Maine. </sentence><sentence id="5123">We settled in Maine. </sentence><sentence id="5124">When he died I was instrumental in getting his whole library into the College, and it's known now as the Rabbi Barrend(ph) Jewish Library, and it's a fine, fine library. </sentence><sentence id="5125">I catalogued it, and integrated it as a special library. </sentence><sentence id="5126">And that drew Jewish interest. </sentence><sentence id="5127">And from that library -- I used that again as my platform -- I gave Jewish talks, and got Jewish persons in. </sentence><sentence id="5128">I had Hilberg." </sentence><sentence id="5129">I had Lansky" of the Yiddish Center. </sentence><sentence id="5130">I had Velvel Pasternak of Jewish music. </sentence><sentence id="5131">I -- who me? </sentence><sentence id="5132">I brought all these  4 people in and I educated them. </sentence><sentence id="5133">Then finally I saw a need -- the people wanted to teach the Holocaust and they didn't know what to do. </sentence><sentence id="5134">They didn't know how to teach it. </sentence><sentence id="5135">So out of that activity, out of all those Jewish affairs that I had organized, was some money left over in the end, and I organized the Holocaust Human Rights Center of Maine for the purpose of helping the teachers teach the Holocaust. </sentence><sentence id="5136">And that was a very fine success. </sentence><sentence id="5137">I moved out of Maine, but the Center stayed, and we have an oral history project, of course. </sentence><sentence id="5138">We have a teachers" guidebook. </sentence><sentence id="5139">We have all kinds of things, were successful. </sentence><sentence id="5140">And then I felt better. </sentence><sentence id="5141">I don't have a --I still feel terrible about my losses, but I don't feel guilty anymore. </sentence><sentence id="5142">And I speak all around the country. </sentence><sentence id="5143">And I hear students -- I see there is a necessity to speak, because the students know only democracy. </sentence><sentence id="5144">The constant question is, "Well, why didn't you just not go," you know. </sentence><sentence id="5145">Or, "Why didn't you say you weren't Jewish?" </sentence><sentence id="5146">Or, "How come you had to give your house up?" </sentence><sentence id="5147">They don't understand this. </sentence><sentence id="5148">They're living in a democracy. </sentence><sentence id="5149">They don't understand what it is to live in an autocracy. </sentence><sentence id="5150">So I still -- I still feel a need to talk and to write, and to answer questions. </sentence><sentence id="5151">And I wrote a second book, and I'm writing one now for even younger children, because they need to know. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="5483">A: Q and L. Originally the whole Theresienstadt was divided into Q streets which went one way, and L... Q meant queer -- Queer and Long -- and the others were longitude -- Longitude and Queer, and Q and L, that was all there was. </sentence><sentence id="5484">But then when the Commission came, suddenly there appeared beautifully decorated little wooden signs on each street with fancy names -- Bergstrasse and Wiesenstrasse(ph), and what have you, and Q was 7 -- was then Bergstrasse 7. </sentence><sentence id="5485">And this is my permission to go into the Swiss transport with my number 1,174 on the right hand corner, and it tells me not to bring any ugly bedrolls -- just to bring a neat suitcase and be gone. </sentence><sentence id="5486">Oh, that's finally a picture of my family. </sentence><sentence id="5487">I defied Hitler and started a family and brought new Jews into the world. </sentence><sentence id="5488">My husband and I, and those are my four children. </sentence><sentence id="5489">Polly was probably -- 12 then. </sentence><sentence id="5490">She's the one that later married Jean. </sentence><sentence id="5491">And that's Len" who's now in Utah, and Hedy,"(r) who is in Minneapolis -- She's the reason we moved there, and that's David" who just had a baby here in Washington. </sentence><sentence id="5492">What a lovely group of kids. </sentence><sentence id="5493"> 8 </sentence></p></dialogue>
