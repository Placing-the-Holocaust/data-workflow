<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="102">A: Yes, very religious -- very Orthodox. </sentence><sentence id="103">There was nothing else in small towns. </sentence><sentence id="104">In fact, in all of Germany you were either very religious or you weren't aware of your Jewishness at all -- you were very, very Reformed. </sentence><sentence id="105">Conservative Judaism had not been invented, yet. </sentence><sentence id="106">So, yes, we were very religious and interestingly enough, the religion was state supported. </sentence><sentence id="107">In other words we always had to mark on taxes or on any forms -- on birth certificates, wedding forms or anything -- our affiliation. </sentence><sentence id="108">It was always Jewish because the state paid for the upkeep of the synagogue. </sentence><sentence id="109">The state paid for the salary of the Rabbi or the Hazan, or the Shohet. </sentence><sentence id="110">So there was never a question that we were very Jewish, and everybody knew that and everybody, up to a certain point, respected it too. </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="111">Q: Did you have non-Jewish friends growing up? </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="112">A: Yes, we did have non-Jewish friends but not real good chums. </sentence><sentence id="113">They were just the kids on the block that we played with. </sentence><sentence id="114">My parents didn't restrict us in going out with only Jewish people. </sentence><sentence id="115">It didn't seem a problem. </sentence><sentence id="116">We knew so much where we belonged and who we were that there was no danger for us to intermingle or anything. </sentence><sentence id="117">So, yes, we did have non-Jewish friends up to a certain point. </sentence><sentence id="118">But the real close friends were the Jewish people. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="128">A: Yes. </sentence><sentence id="129">In grade school. </sentence><sentence id="130">I don't remember too much about grade school, but then I went to the Lyzeum -- that was like it would here be maybe a high school, and then junior college. </sentence><sentence id="131">That was already considered higher education. </sentence><sentence id="132">The girls went to the Lyzeum and the boys went to the Gymnasium," which here is an athletic term, but over there it was an academic term. </sentence><sentence id="133">So, yes I do remember that very well. </sentence><sentence id="134">I was admitted in 1933 at the age of 10 only because I could prove that my father was a World War I veteran. </sentence><sentence id="135">Already, Hitler had just come to power in January. </sentence><sentence id="136">I was admitted to school that fall. </sentence><sentence id="137">And I remember I had to bring some proof that my father had received the Iron Cross First Class in World War One and otherwise I could not have gone. </sentence><sentence id="138">I would have already been repelled as a Jewish student. </sentence><sentence id="139">So I did go, but I didn't stay very long. </sentence><sentence id="140">In 1936 there was a law that -- it was phrased in that way -- German students do no longer have to be subjected to sitting in the same room with Jewish students. </sentence><sentence id="141">So of course it was the Jewish students who had to leave. </sentence><sentence id="142">I always thought it was a very interesting way of framing it. </sentence><sentence id="143">In those early years Hitler was still a little bit more cautious and modest in his demands on us than he was later on. </sentence><sentence id="144">But up to then we were accepted. </sentence><sentence id="145">We did not -- slowly we did not chum around with the German children anymore. </sentence><sentence id="146">I remember there were two Jewish students in my class, myself and Matilda Adler(ph). </sentence><sentence id="147">How some names will stay with you all your life! </sentence><sentence id="148">And she and I were, little by little, we were ostracized. </sentence><sentence id="149">I remember us standing in the comer in the school yard. </sentence><sentence id="150">We couldn't mingle with the other kids anymore. </sentence><sentence id="151">And they weren't mean to us, but they were not allowed to be friendly to us. </sentence><sentence id="152">If they would, they were being punished. </sentence><sentence id="153">And I also remember that I was not allowed to answer questions in school, even if I knew the answer. </sentence><sentence id="154">After a while I didn't even raise my hand anymore because I knew the teacher could not possibly call on me. </sentence><sentence id="155">As a Jewish student I was supposed to be stupid. </sentence><sentence id="156">I was supposed to be ignorant. </sentence><sentence id="157">I was not -- Jews -- Hitler declared Jews as stupid, so how could I know any answers? </sentence><sentence id="158">And that hurt a while but then I got use to it. </sentence><sentence id="159">But finally in "36 we had to leave. </sentence><sentence id="160">And I got as far as fourth grade in there instead of the ordinary sixth grade. </sentence><sentence id="161">I didn't graduate. </sentence><sentence id="162">And that hurt because | didn't know what else to do. </sentence><sentence id="163">I couldn't stay at home -- and I couldn't go to any other school, so that the childhood years were happy, but the school years already were not. </sentence><sentence id="164">And my sister who was a year ahead of me -- same story. </sentence><sentence id="165">She was the only Jewish girl in her class and she was even more ostracized and picked upon -- and she was more timid than I was. </sentence><sentence id="166">I was always more the "tomboy" type and she was very much more gentle and introverted than I was. </sentence><sentence id="167">So High school (German)  she suffered actually more than I did. </sentence><sentence id="168">And when we came home we talked a little about it, but then we tried to forget it and just integrate into our family. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="211">Q: Did your parents give you any advice about what to do when you came home and talked about this kind of abuse? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="213">A: Did my parents give me any advice? </sentence><sentence id="214">I would say "no." </sentence><sentence id="215">My parents already were wrapped up in their own problems. </sentence><sentence id="216">Already, very early in Hitler's reign, the Schechtverbot" came -- and I think what you mean by that. </sentence><sentence id="217">The Jews were no longer allowed to kill their animals in the ritualistic way by shekhting. </sentence><sentence id="218">And I always thought that was such an irony. </sentence><sentence id="219">The reason Hitler gave for that Schechtverbot was, it was inhumane to the animals. </sentence><sentence id="220">Think about that for a minute. </sentence><sentence id="221">For the animals he had pity, but for us -- he put us into the gas. </sentence><sentence id="222">There was no more inhumanity involved there. </sentence><sentence id="223">So in "38, being very considerate for those poor animals, there was the Schechtverbot. </sentence><sentence id="224">And then Father had his own problems. </sentence><sentence id="225">I remember how Father and Mother and grandmother and Aunt Adelheid used to sit in the room and just try to figure out what the future will bring. </sentence><sentence id="226">Now all he had to sell were the chickens, you see. </sentence><sentence id="227">For a while there was frozen meat from Argentina, but who's going to buy frozen meat in 1936. </sentence><sentence id="228">It was unheard of. </sentence><sentence id="229">Nobody would touch it -- and so he gave that up very quickly. </sentence><sentence id="230">And then there was no more income, except for that little bit that we made on the chickens. </sentence><sentence id="231">And they were having problems. </sentence><sentence id="232">For a long time I remember Father saying, "Mir gehen mit dem letzten Zug." </sentence><sentence id="233">That was Bayerisch -- that was Bavarian dialect for "We're going to go with the last train. </sentence><sentence id="234">We're going to stick it out. </sentence><sentence id="235">We're not gonna leave here." </sentence><sentence id="236">But after a while he had to realize that there was no "letzten Zug." </sentence><sentence id="237">There was not gonna be a last train. </sentence><sentence id="238">So they had their own problems, and no, we didn't bother them with our problems. </sentence><sentence id="239">They couldn't have helped us anyway. </sentence><sentence id="240">If we ever confided into anyone it was Aunt Adelheid and grandmother. </sentence><sentence id="241">They seemed to -- they were very close to us. </sentence><sentence id="242">Does that give you a little picture of my home life? </sentence><sentence id="243">It was a nice, close, lovely family. </sentence><sentence id="244">And then came 1938 -- Kristallnacht(r). </sentence><sentence id="245">For a while the non- Jews were moderate in their intercourse with us. </sentence><sentence id="246">They held back, but they weren't hostile. </sentence><sentence id="247">And I remember some of the closer non-Jewish friends used to come to the back door at night when no one would see them and used to bring us maybe a little bread or some fruit because already we couldn't buy everything we wanted to. </sentence><sentence id="248">All of a sudden that was -- the Jews couldn't really buy what they wanted. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="285">Q: Can you explain that some because I -- what kinds of restrictions there were, on movement and purchase-- </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="397">A: Well, when you are 10 years old and from that time on, and my sister was only a year and a half older, when you're constantly told that you are stupid, and -- they called it " Untermensch,"*" "subhuman" -- and you personally are responsible for everything that's going wrong in all of Germany, and practically in all the world, and you can't shine in any way. </sentence><sentence id="398">You can't let your imagination, or your intellect, or your normal physical appearances come up and speak for yourself -- for itself, after a while that does something to you. </sentence><sentence id="399">After a while -- after 10 years of this, you believe you are stupid. </sentence><sentence id="400">You believe you look Jewish and you look ugly and you are not worthy of anything. </sentence><sentence id="401">And it really took a while to get over this. </sentence><sentence id="402">And you know I see some older people nowadays that have gone through this whole thing and it looks to me as if they haven't gotten over it yet. </sentence><sentence id="403">They still feel that they are the less human -- the lesser human race -- and I still -- they look depressed to me. </sentence><sentence id="404">I think I got over it, but during the time I believed I was no good. </sentence><sentence id="405">I believed I was a second rate human being. </sentence><sentence id="406">It was a terrible thing to do. </sentence><sentence id="407">And you must understand, on the other hand, these very same kids that went to school with me who up to then were nothing, they came from a downtrodden, broken home, they had no clothes to wear, they -- in many cases they had to come to the Jewish families to beg for food and substances, they were suddenly dressed up in their Nazi uniforms and their -- first in their Hitlerjungend uniforms, which were splendid. </sentence><sentence id="408">They were beautiful, and later on they were dressed up in their SA and SS uniforms, underneath they were still very mediocre, very pedestrian German people. </sentence><sentence id="409">But all of a sudden they were shining, they were beautiful. </sentence><sentence id="410">And don't forget, a uniform really does something to you psychologically. </sentence><sentence id="411">These people not only had their uniform on, but they felt they were the uniform. </sentence><sentence id="412">They felt they could do beautiful things just because they looked so great. </sentence><sentence id="413">And they did. </sentence><sentence id="414">They got away with it. "" </sentence><sentence id="415">Hitler youth (German) ? </sentence><sentence id="416">Sub-human (German); term used to refer to people deemed inferior according to Nazi racial theory. </sentence><sentence id="417"> As you very well know, one of the very first laws that Hitler put onto the books in Germany was the Gestapo Law of 1936 which stated that anyone in an SS, in a Nazi uniform, would stand above the law -- could do anything they wanted to, could up to kill the Jews openly on the street. </sentence><sentence id="418">As long as they were in their Nazi uniform the law could not touch them. </sentence><sentence id="419">Now if you think of it, we on the other hand were since the 1935 Nuremberg Laws, staatenlos,"* stateless. </sentence><sentence id="420">That means we had no recourse to the law. </sentence><sentence id="421">Any injustice that was done to us, forget it. </sentence><sentence id="422">There was no law to go to, to complain. </sentence><sentence id="423">But they -- and the psychological effect of that is not to be underestimated. </sentence><sentence id="424">They were indeed the supermen the all powerful, unapproachable. </sentence><sentence id="425">No law could touch them. </sentence><sentence id="426">And as we, when we were ten years old were told how low we were, they were told how great they were -- and by the time they were 20 and 25 and we met them again in the killing centers, their psychology had changed just as much as ours had. </sentence><sentence id="427">I don't know how to impress upon you what a uniform will do a person. </sentence><sentence id="428">It suddenly makes him into a semi-god. </sentence><sentence id="429">And Hitler was no dummy about that. </sentence><sentence id="430">His uniforms were beautiful, shiny; those boots, those helmets, all those buttons and rows of things. </sentence><sentence id="431">And then the names, they all of a sudden were -- they weren't just Johann Schmidt anymore -- they were Oberscharfithrer"* and they were Blockleiter. </sentence><sentence id="432">"deg And the kids already they were -- I can't remember all the German names, but suddenly they got a title. </sentence><sentence id="433">They were somebody. </sentence><sentence id="434">And they had quite forgotten that underneath the uniform there was really nothing much, but that's -- but you don't know that when you're stuck in it. </sentence><sentence id="435">You only know that 50 years later when you acquire a little overview and a little insight. </sentence><sentence id="436">But that was part of the success of the Nazis -- those uniforms, and the singing, and the torch parades. </sentence><sentence id="437">That was uplifting to them and to the spectators -- to the people who watched. </sentence><sentence id="438">They suddenly belonged. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="483">Q: Did you ever get angry at this when you were -- during this period? </sentence></p></dialogue>

What I'm telling you now, that's not bad. </sentence><sentence id="624">That's just the beginning. </sentence><sentence id="625">But later on when things really got bad, then there was nothing else to cling to. </sentence><sentence id="626">And I wonder if people understand that, that you can still be religious and believe in God even though you see what -- let's say, what God is doing all around you. </sentence><sentence id="627">I don't want to have to explain what I just said. </sentence><sentence id="628">But on the one hand you see all the evil that -- in our religious mind was still sent from God. </sentence><sentence id="629">And on the other hand, you come inward and you still believed he would help -- and that was a big help. </sentence><sentence id="630">It really was. </sentence><sentence id="631">It sounds like an irony, but it was a big help. </sentence><sentence id="632">And then later on when I was rescued, and I found my father again. </sentence><sentence id="633">Then again also my mother and my whole family had died. </sentence><sentence id="634">Again there was at least that much reason to be grateful to God who had saved me, and had saved my father. </sentence><sentence id="635">And then I married a religious man. </sentence><sentence id="636">I tried to bring up my children religious. </sentence><sentence id="637">And it's a problem. </sentence><sentence id="638">You can't live without it and you can't live with it, but most of all you can't live without it. </sentence><sentence id="639">So it's a way of life now. </sentence><sentence id="640">It's a way of life. </sentence></p></dialogue>

</sentence><sentence id="683">It was a preparatory school for young women -- for young ladies. </sentence><sentence id="684">I remember she came back and she showed me how she learned how to fold linens so that they would look like military in the shelves. </sentence><sentence id="685">You know, that's the kind of thing they learned. </sentence><sentence id="686">Much good that did us. </sentence><sentence id="687">And I was too young to go there, so I went to the one Jewish school that was still in existence. </sentence><sentence id="688">That was the Adass Jisroel Schule in Berlin. </sentence><sentence id="689">Now Berlin was far from Ansbach. </sentence><sentence id="690">It was like 300 kilometers and that was far. </sentence><sentence id="691">Remember, we're in 1930s in Europe. </sentence><sentence id="692">We're not in the 1990s in America. </sentence><sentence id="693">Berlin was far and I didn't know anybody. </sentence><sentence id="694">I had to live in the dormitory and I didn't know any kids. </sentence><sentence id="695">And now the bigger problem was that I didn't have the correct preparation for a Jewish school. </sentence><sentence id="696">I had only gone to my Rabbi during the section that was called "religion," -- "religion," when the Catholics went to their priests and the Protestants went to their father, to their religious leader, we went to Elie Munk, to Rabbi Munk. </sentence><sentence id="697">And that's all the religious education we had that one hour a week where we had religion. </sentence><sentence id="698">So I was not prepared for that and of course I did very poorly. </sentence><sentence id="699">So that reinforced my thinking that I really was stupid and minor, even in the Jewish school I "7 Hakhshara He-Halutz [Pioneer Training] (Hebrew) 8 Agricultural school (German) 9 Religion (German)  couldn't excel, you see. </sentence><sentence id="700">So it was tough. </sentence><sentence id="701">And then I was called home after Kristallnacht. </sentence><sentence id="702">I remember driving through Berlin and seeing the synagogues in flames and all the glass on the streets and the people huddled and depressed. </sentence><sentence id="703">And it was very obvious that what had impacted upon me psychologically had impacted on all the Jews. </sentence><sentence id="704">They walked around like the victims -- like the hunted. </sentence><sentence id="705">And I was in the train, and I was going toward Ansbach, and there my family had been taken to a collection center. </sentence><sentence id="706">Father had been sent to prison along with all the men. </sentence><sentence id="707">And Mother and all the women had already been sent back home and were packing. </sentence><sentence id="708">And we couldn't take more than we had that we could carry, and we had to leave everything. </sentence><sentence id="709">And I remember the name of the man that was just -- just a very simple little fellow who was ordered by the Nazis to take over our house. </sentence><sentence id="710">And he already had moved in with his eight kids. </sentence><sentence id="711">And we were still packing and leaving and going to the railroad station, and then we realized really what was going on. </sentence><sentence id="712">Then Father didn't talk about the last train anymore. </sentence><sentence id="713">And, then we went -- we could only go to certain cities. </sentence><sentence id="714">We couldn't just pick up and leave and buy a new house, or go to a new apartment -- far from it. </sentence><sentence id="715">We were told which cities to go to and we were told to go to Munich, and we were also told to just find someone to live with. </sentence><sentence id="716">And we found a distant relative -- well it doesn't matter -- there was some relationship there, who took us into one spare room that they had. </sentence><sentence id="717">And then Father and all the uncles and cousins all came back, all their hair shorn. </sentence><sentence id="718">The Munich Jews had been sent to Dachau, whereas the Ansbach Jews had been sent to, to prison in Nuremberg. </sentence><sentence id="719">And I remember how they all came back from the Dachau with their heads completely shorn, and then we began to wake up. </sentence><sentence id="720">Then we still only thought that the men were in danger. </sentence><sentence id="721">Who could think that they would kill women and children, or old people, or Rabbis, or respected business people or anything? </sentence><sentence id="722">So then Father was lucky and he got onto a convoy that the British Jews had organized and he got into that convoy as a butcher, and they went to Sandwich, England, to the Kitchener camps, with the hope -- this was in July of 1939. </sentence><sentence id="723">There was no talk of war, yet. </sentence><sentence id="724">Hitler kept that very secret. </sentence><sentence id="725">It was -- that was like a bombshell when the war started. </sentence><sentence id="726">So in July, a little more than one month before the beginning of the war in Poland, there was no fear of war. </sentence><sentence id="727">So we thought that my father could find domestic positions for us and bring us over after him. </sentence><sentence id="728">But the war ended that. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1388">A: As much as I can remember. </sentence><sentence id="1389">Let's see. </sentence><sentence id="1390">I was of course involved in my own work at the time? </sentence><sentence id="1391">When she first came to Berlin I was still in Niedershenhausen and I remember the Head Nurse of Niedershonhausen who was a lovely old lady, whom I was very attached to, used to invite my sister on her day off to come to me because my sister lived in -- they all lived together in a big room. </sentence><sentence id="1392">Very Spartan, nothing there at all, just beds and a chair or what have you. </sentence><sentence id="1393">So it wasn't much fun to spend the day off there. </sentence><sentence id="1394">So the Oberschwester,"* the Head Nurse of Niedershenhausen -- as much as I loved her I forgot her name now, I don't recall her name -- invited my sister. </sentence><sentence id="1395">So my sister walked. </sentence><sentence id="1396">And I remember the Head Nurse then instructed the kitchen to serve my sister and me a fried egg. </sentence><sentence id="1397">Now that -- need I say more? </sentence><sentence id="1398">In 1940, the end of 1940, we were each eating a fried egg in Berlin. </sentence><sentence id="1399">I remember how much that meant to us, and also nutritionally, my sister was very much down. </sentence><sentence id="1400">They didn't have good food and they worked very hard. </sentence><sentence id="1401">They did factory work. </sentence><sentence id="1402">I don't exactly know what they did. </sentence><sentence id="1403">She never talked about it. </sentence><sentence id="1404">But in one of the letters to my mother -- and then she sent it to my father -- she writes that she has been chosen to be the camp nurse -- that she's taking care of the little injuries, etc., </sentence><sentence id="1405">etc., </sentence><sentence id="1406">and that apparently was quite an advantage for her, and she was very proud of it also. </sentence><sentence id="1407">And then all of a sudden they were detailed into a transport and I don't recall too much about that. </sentence><sentence id="1408">I remember going to her dormitory at the Siemens factory and they had left. </sentence><sentence id="1409">There was this empty big room with nothing there. </sentence><sentence id="1410">There was one hat that I remember she wore and that was sitting on her bed, and I took that hat and walked back home. </sentence><sentence id="1411">I don't recall my emotions or anything. </sentence><sentence id="1412">I probably blocked them out and, again, the hope was that we would all see each other when we all got deported. </sentence><sentence id="1413">That was always the one "glimmer" of the deportation. </sentence><sentence id="1414">We always thought we would see each other again. </sentence><sentence id="1415">We would also get there -- like death, and you see your people again up in heaven, but that was not the way it worked -- was the concentration camps. </sentence></p></dialogue>

We worked there for two days straight -- for three days straight, and then finally we were released from duty and some other nurses came with their white armbands and we got back. </sentence><sentence id="2240">And then we went again the next three days. </sentence><sentence id="2241">It was three day shifts. </sentence><sentence id="2242">And then finally that Fabrikaktion was over "cause there were no more Jews to take. </sentence><sentence id="2243">That was in February, "43, and then a few weeks later I was finally taken too. </sentence><sentence id="2244">I had enough by then. </sentence><sentence id="2245">Now you can understand why I say it was a relief. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3299">A: I'm not sure I was in the film, but the film was done. </sentence><sentence id="3300">I remember that. </sentence><sentence id="3301">I was part of the deception while the Commission was there. </sentence><sentence id="3302">I don't remember what Eva did. </sentence><sentence id="3303">She may have been with me. </sentence><sentence id="3304">I don't recall that, but I recall that I was detailed behind a hay wagon, and I was told to put a little kerchief around my hair, and I got the rake over my shoulder. </sentence><sentence id="3305">And behind that filled up hay wagon, which we'd never seen before, we were walking -- a group of us girls were walking and we had to sing. </sentence><sentence id="3306">I'm sure Eva was with me, too, because she had such a nice voice. </sentence><sentence id="3307">And we walked by the Commission, out of the ghetto, and in by the next gate, and then we were dissolved again "cause the Commission had passed. </sentence><sentence id="3308">It was all -- all just a show. </sentence><sentence id="3309">But we didn't know, and we didn't care. </sentence><sentence id="3310">If we had any character, we would have refused to do that. </sentence><sentence id="3311">It didn't occur to us. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3325">Q: Now in your book you say that some people did refuse and they put them in a room for a few hours. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3327">A: Yes. </sentence><sentence id="3328">Yes, some people did refuse, especially the Danes the Danish Jews. </sentence><sentence id="3329">They had a lot more spirit than we did. </sentence><sentence id="3330">They were very different from us. </sentence><sentence id="3331">And also, you see, we already had ten years of Hitler and most of them didn't. </sentence><sentence id="3332">They were still fresh from their King, and from the authority of their King who was standing behind the Jews. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3339">Q: Can you repeat what you were saying about the Danes? </sentence><sentence id="3340">You said the Danes were different than you. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3343">A: Ya. </sentence><sentence id="3344">The Danes were different. </sentence><sentence id="3345">First of all they, they were treated differently. </sentence><sentence id="3346">They lived in houses and they didn't have -- I don't think they had to work. </sentence><sentence id="3347">I'm not sure on that now. </sentence><sentence id="3348">And I had one Danish girlfriend -- one girl, Danish friend. </sentence><sentence id="3349">I don't know how I got her, but somehow I was friendly with one of them. </sentence><sentence id="3350">And she was very outspoken. </sentence><sentence id="3351">And she said that she would tell the Commission that this was all just a farce, a comedy, a Potemkin Village. </sentence><sentence id="3352">And she was taken into custody during the time of the International Commission. </sentence><sentence id="3353">And when she came out again, she told us she was together with a lot of other people who were outspoken, and with a lot of people who looked very Jewish. </sentence><sentence id="3354">And the explanation was later that they were taken into this custody not by the SS, but by the Jewish ghetto governments because they  were afraid of any repercussions. </sentence><sentence id="3355">And if anything had gone on the whole ghetto would have been severely punished. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3369">Q: What did you think of her actions at that time when she said that she was going to tell them the truth? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3371">A: I admired her. </sentence><sentence id="3372">I didn't have the guts to do that. </sentence><sentence id="3373">It didn't even occur to me to do that. </sentence><sentence id="3374">You were told to do something and you did it. </sentence><sentence id="3375">It was such a, it was such a different mentality. </sentence><sentence id="3376">I don't even understand it myself anymore today. </sentence><sentence id="3377">But it really didn't occur to any of us to do that. </sentence><sentence id="3378">I wished I could, I wished I could have a simple, clean explanation for it, but I don't. </sentence><sentence id="3379">It was the whole business of -- It all dragged after me -- that whole 10 years of Hitler, and even before. </sentence><sentence id="3380">My whole 2,000 year history, that was all in me. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3391">Q: Could you explain your characterization of the barracks when you were in there with all these women, and you said there was -- there was hostility -- in the barracks? </sentence><sentence id="3392">Could you explain more of? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3395">A: Yes, I'll try. </sentence><sentence id="3396">I wasn't in the barracks for too long. </sentence><sentence id="3397">I would think there was a very bad feeling, already on my part. </sentence><sentence id="3398">I had come to Theresienstadt actually with great expectations. </sentence><sentence id="3399">Right away I was disappointed. </sentence><sentence id="3400">Where's my mother? </sentence><sentence id="3401">Not here. </sentence><sentence id="3402">My sister? </sentence><sentence id="3403">Never heard of her. </sentence><sentence id="3404">All my friends? </sentence><sentence id="3405">Zero. </sentence><sentence id="3406">So already my mood was very down. </sentence><sentence id="3407">Then I get stuck into --I get separated from Eva Simmon -- from my friend, from all the kids, from all the people I knew, from Golly also. </sentence><sentence id="3408">Golly was with me for a while, but we weren't together in -- on the straw at all. </sentence><sentence id="3409">She was somewhere else. </sentence><sentence id="3410">And then these women, these were all older women whom I've never seen before. </sentence><sentence id="3411">And they were wrapped in their grief -- in their separation from their families. </sentence><sentence id="3412">It just was no camaraderie there whatsoever. </sentence><sentence id="3413">And I felt lonely, and maybe the hostility came from me, but I could not form a friendship on that straw there at all. </sentence><sentence id="3414">And, I repeat, it's very important, in a situation that we were in, to have a friend -- to have someone to share things with. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3435">Q: Was your friendship with Eva typical or deeper than what you saw around you? </sentence><sentence id="3436">Or was it common that people had very close ties with one person or two persons? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3439">A: That's a question I never asked myself. </sentence><sentence id="3440">But as I think back, I would say it was not unusual to form a very close friendship. </sentence><sentence id="3441">What else did we have? </sentence><sentence id="3442">That was all that was allowed to us -- a personal friendship. </sentence><sentence id="3443">And I would say it was not too uncommon. </sentence><sentence id="3444">I could observe it looking back now. </sentence><sentence id="3445">In that room where we then lived, in that basement, and where we worked upstairs with the children, most of the other inhabitants were Czech nurses, Czech girls. </sentence><sentence id="3446">Because we were, after all in Czechoslovakia. </sentence><sentence id="3447">And, looking back, they were very tightly close together. </sentence><sentence id="3448">And there was a bit of a gulf between them and us. </sentence><sentence id="3449">They considered  themselves in their own country, and we were the newcomers. </sentence><sentence id="3450">So we didn't form friendships with them at all. </sentence><sentence id="3451">But they formed friendships with themselves. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3465">Q: When you think back, do you think that women had different sorts of friendships than men, or there's not a gender difference here? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3467">A: It's hard to say. </sentence><sentence id="3468">I'm sure there were male-female friendships as well. </sentence><sentence id="3469">First of all, as I mentioned before, marriages were permitted, and my friend Golly very soon married the man that she had followed, and then lived with him in a small little room somewheres -- even just in a corner of a small room. </sentence><sentence id="3470">It was not a luxurious way of living. </sentence><sentence id="3471">So there was male- female relationships throughout the ghetto, and I would think, yes, there were friendships either way. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3477">Q: No. </sentence><sentence id="3478">I would have asked you that question, but I was also asking a question about male friendships with other men. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3481">A: Oh. </sentence><sentence id="3482">I wasn't aware of that. </sentence><sentence id="3483">No. </sentence><sentence id="3484">I was not aware of that. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3489">Q: So you were separated from -- the men were living separately from the women, except for those people who were--? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3491">A: Yes. </sentence><sentence id="3492">Yes, that's correct. </sentence><sentence id="3493">Oh, definitely. </sentence><sentence id="3494">No, I was not afraid of -- I was not aware of same sex friendships. </sentence><sentence id="3495">You know that was very, very taboo. </sentence><sentence id="3496">Number one in the Jewish Religion, and number one in Germany. </sentence><sentence id="3497">Hitler killed homosexuals. </sentence><sentence id="3498">The list of hate was Jews, homosexuals, blacks and then everybody else. </sentence><sentence id="3499">But that was not allowed. </sentence><sentence id="3500">Ah, forget it. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3511">Q: No, [actually wasn't referring to sexual relations now. </sentence><sentence id="3512">I really meant the friendships that were like the friendship you had with Eva, because you're talking about a relationship that helped you to survive, right? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3515">A: Yes. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3517">Q: And I was wondering whether you saw, among men, a similar kind of pairing of, you know. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="3519">And were the pairings among men and women that weren't marriage, for instance, that were love affairs, were they always love affairs, or was that because the men had access to things that the women needed? </sentence><sentence id="3520">In other words, were they not always just straight forward not that love is straight forward? </sentence><sentence id="3521">Do you know what I mean? </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3522">A: I don't quite see what you're asking me. </sentence><sentence id="3523">Are you asking me if the kind of friendship I had with Eva, I could also observe between two men? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3526">Q: That's one question. </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3527">A: Yeah. </sentence><sentence id="3528">I'm wondering if I'm at all able to answer that because I had no insight into where the men lived, but I would think "yes." </sentence><sentence id="3529">I would think they formed very close camaraderie as well. </sentence><sentence id="3530">How else could they survive? </sentence><sentence id="3531">So I would think the question of that must be "yes," but I wouldn't know from any personal experience. </sentence><sentence id="3532">Now what was the other part of the question? </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3533">Q: Well, I'll ask it in a balder -- in a balder way. </sentence><sentence id="3534">Was there prostitution in Theresienstadt? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3537">A: That's a good question, and I have often been asked that. </sentence><sentence id="3538">I did not observe it while I was there, but since then I have read a lot about it. </sentence><sentence id="3539">But I don't think that there was because the Nazis were strictly forbidden to fraternize with the Jews -- strictly. </sentence><sentence id="3540">And if anything like that occurred, it wasn't only the Jew that was punished, the Nazi was punished as well. </sentence><sentence id="3541">But I have since then heard so much of that, that I'm wondering if I was just not aware of it. </sentence><sentence id="3542">But I don't think so. </sentence><sentence id="3543">It certainly wasn't so that I could observe it. </sentence><sentence id="3544">The Nazis and Jews were strictly separated. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3553">Q: How about among Jews? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3555">A: How about what? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3557">Q: Among Jews? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3559">A: Sex among Jews? </sentence><sentence id="3560">I would think "yes." </sentence><sentence id="3561">I would think that went on. </sentence><sentence id="3562">We were not in a situation like Auschwitz, and also we were healthier. </sentence><sentence id="3563">And fairly -- there were babies born in the ghetto. </sentence><sentence id="3564">So that -- so my answer is "yes." </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3571">Q: Did they survive? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3573">A: Yes. </sentence><sentence id="3574">They came to us to the home. </sentence><sentence id="3575">We took care of them, with their mothers. </sentence><sentence id="3576">The mothers nursed and the fathers came to visit, so I would say "yes." </sentence><sentence id="3577">There was a normal life there. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3583">Q: Do you think these were pregnancies that occurred prior to arrival in Theresienstadt, or were people well enough you think... </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3718">Q: Let me ask you a couple of other things. </sentence><sentence id="3719">Did you menstruate in the ghetto, or did it stop? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3722">A: It stopped. </sentence><sentence id="3723">It stopped. </sentence><sentence id="3724">We were so worried when they took our, our napkins as contraband in the Schleusse. </sentence><sentence id="3725">And of course, by the way, those were not these elegant little contraptions that young women use today. </sentence><sentence id="3726">It was something that we used, had to wash out afterwards, and used again. </sentence><sentence id="3727">And we were so worried when it was... when those were taken from us, and then we didn't need them for which reason I don't know. </sentence><sentence id="3728">And it impacted us differently. </sentence><sentence id="3729">Some of us became very heavy and very fat, and others became very thin after we lost our menstruation -- and | kind of got a little thin and Eva got a little heavier -- I don't know why. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3742">A: Nice. </sentence><sentence id="3743">I met Freddi when I was still in the Hundertschaft because I was detailed to sweep in front of his home -- his children's home. </sentence><sentence id="3744">He was the leader of the children's home. </sentence><sentence id="3745">He was already a prominent Zionist before, and he attracted the young people around himself. </sentence><sentence id="3746">And then when he got out of the Hundertschaft, he was detailed to the children's home to work with the children. </sentence><sentence id="3747">It was of course forbidden to have classes or real instructions, so he always was able to lead and guide and instruct the children kind of on the sly. </sentence><sentence id="3748">While they were  supposedly working, he would give instructions, and he was very much beloved. </sentence><sentence id="3749">He was a very lovely young man ~--a real Zionist --a real ethical figure. </sentence><sentence id="3750">And the Germans respected him for a long time, and then the reason he got into the next transport was -- yes, I remember that. </sentence><sentence id="3751">A transport of children from Czechoslovakia showed up -- from Slovakia showed up -- alone -- barefoot, in terrible condition -- and we heard about it. </sentence><sentence id="3752">And they didn't speak anything but Polish, and he of course spoke Polish. </sentence><sentence id="3753">And we... Eva went as a nurse to that transport also. </sentence><sentence id="3754">I didn't. </sentence><sentence id="3755">I don't know why. </sentence><sentence id="3756">That was the one time we didn't do things together. </sentence><sentence id="3757">That transport was a group of children whose parents had been shot, and these children had witnessed that, and they were very frightened -- very intimidated. </sentence><sentence id="3758">And the order came from the SS that we were not allowed to speak to them. </sentence><sentence id="3759">We were not allowed to know that their parents were shot and killed, and the kids, not speaking any other language but Polish, were not permitted to speak to us who spoke German. </sentence><sentence id="3760">So Freddi Hirsch disobeyed that order and spoke to the children in a soothing way, and he was caught at that, and he was, of course, put onto the next transport. </sentence><sentence id="3761">And he wrote a card back that I remember. </sentence><sentence id="3762">After some time he wrote back that... First for a long time we didn't hear from him, and then he wrote back, "We should do all we can to stay in the ghetto and not to volunteer and not to provoke our entrance into an east transport." </sentence><sentence id="3763">And we were puzzled about this because we thought we had it very bad. </sentence><sentence id="3764">We had no news from Auschwitz. </sentence><sentence id="3765">We did not know how bad they had it, and so we, we got our first inkling how bad Auschwitz must be if he advised us to stay where we are. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3790">Q: So you heard no -- did you continually hear rumors about gas chambers, or did they stop? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3792">A: That stopped. </sentence><sentence id="3793">I heard that once in Berlin, "Die werden alle vergast." </sentence><sentence id="3794">And I thought that guy was out of his mind to make such a statement, and then we didn't hear it anymore. </sentence><sentence id="3795">We didn't hear it anymore. </sentence><sentence id="3796">We heard only that they were working, and they couldn't write for a while they could write, but only for a while. </sentence><sentence id="3797">And I never heard from Eva and Werner Simmon. </sentence><sentence id="3798">I surely would have heard from them if they had lived. </sentence><sentence id="3799">And when Golly was deported to Auschwitz, or rather when she followed her husband to Auschwitz, I didn't hear from her. </sentence><sentence id="3800">So, there was something fishy going on and we knew it. </sentence><sentence id="3801">But also we -- I think we purposely closed our minds to it. </sentence><sentence id="3802">We purposely -- because we were so apt to go into the next transport, and why should we think we were going to be killed right away So, self preservation, we took that out of our minds. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3814">Q: And who was choosing the people to go on transports? </sentence><sentence id="3815">Also the Judenrat?(r)" </sentence></p></dialogue>

Yes, of course it was the Judenrat. </sentence><sentence id="3829">I am sure, because when the October transports -- the one that Jirca went on, just before the Commission. </sentence><sentence id="3830">Then all of a sudden Edelstein was taken prisoner, and his wife was told to bring food three times a day, and to bring fresh clothing once a week. </sentence><sentence id="3831">And she never got any -- any dishes back, and she never got any dirty laundry back. </sentence><sentence id="3832">He was, as we know now, he was already in the Kleine Festung and probably already dead. </sentence><sentence id="3833">And the reason was that he did not want to cooperate in those transports. </sentence><sentence id="3834">He refused to put that many people up for transports. </sentence><sentence id="3835">So the answer to your original question is "yes." </sentence><sentence id="3836">It was the Jews who made the transport. </sentence><sentence id="3837">Of course it had to be. </sentence><sentence id="3838">The Germans didn't do it anymore. </sentence><sentence id="3839">Why should they? </sentence><sentence id="3840">And it was the Jews who worked in the Schleusse. </sentence><sentence id="3841">The Schleusse of course went both ways -- in and out. </sentence><sentence id="3842">And who took the people to the cattle cars and everything else? </sentence><sentence id="3843">Thank God I never had to do that. </sentence><sentence id="3844">I only went to all the incoming transports to see if I would find anybody I knew. </sentence><sentence id="3845">And, in fact, by then the trains came right into the ghetto. </sentence><sentence id="3846">And there was a certain barrack where we could go to and just look out the window and see the people come. </sentence><sentence id="3847">Eva and I did that. </sentence><sentence id="3848">We watched to see if we knew anybody. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3960">Q: And so there was a difference between the kind of food certain groups got and other groups. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3962">A: Only in the way that it was a little more that we got. </sentence><sentence id="3963">A little more volume, quantity. </sentence><sentence id="3964">And these places where they distributed the food, mostly the old people had to go because they had no place of work. </sentence><sentence id="3965">The people who worked -- I have to assume -- that it was the same as in the children's home -- that the food was brought to them, rather they stopping their wor.... Of course, it had to be that way "cause the Germans wouldn't allow the people to wander off at noontime and go to lunch, huh? </sentence><sentence id="3966">That wasn't done. </sentence><sentence id="3967">So I have to assume, then the food came ina little better quantity. </sentence><sentence id="3968">And later on, during and after the Commission, there was also better quality. </sentence><sentence id="3969">There was sent much better food. </sentence><sentence id="3970">I remember my agony when I saw for the first time some meat swimming in that soup. </sentence><sentence id="3971">Up to then there was no meat. </sentence><sentence id="3972">It was just -- Eva and I always compared it to, to the dishwater that we threw out after washing our dishes. </sentence><sentence id="3973">You know, a little, little eyes of fat swimming on it, like it was from our dishes at home when we were still living normally. </sentence><sentence id="3974">And then suddenly I found a piece of meat in there and I didn't know what to do because I hadn't eaten meat up to then. </sentence><sentence id="3975">In the hospital, in Berlin, up to -- after I left was kosher, and up to then there was no problem, and suddenly I was *! </sentence><sentence id="3976">Food distribution (German) 2 A (German) 3 Baked yeasted dumpling (German)  confronted with a piece of meat, and I remember my agony.

</sentence><sentence id="4657">And so at first we just ignored it. </sentence><sentence id="4658">And then the next morning, we heard it again. </sentence><sentence id="4659">And then we heard it from people whom we trusted that were in with the administration, and we heard -- especially we, we young women who were still looking pretty well, we heard, "Go ahead. </sentence><sentence id="4660">Go and register for that transport. </sentence><sentence id="4661">Hurry up." </sentence><sentence id="4662">And so after a while, Eva in her light -- I would never have registered , I'm sure I thank my whole life to her -- she said, "Come on, let's go. </sentence><sentence id="4663">Let's go. </sentence><sentence id="4664">Let's register. </sentence><sentence id="4665">Why wait for anything else?" </sentence><sentence id="4666">And of course all we could think of was all those transports that they said would go to Palestine, and they never got to Palestine. </sentence><sentence id="4667">So I said, "But what if we end up in Auschwitz?" </sentence><sentence id="4668">So she said, "Then our problems are solved if we should join the other one. </sentence><sentence id="4669">Then we're together already anyway. </sentence><sentence id="4670">So, nothing to lose. </sentence><sentence id="4671">We go." </sentence><sentence id="4672"> So we went, and we had to register, which was very different from the other transports. </sentence><sentence id="4673">We were looked over. </sentence><sentence id="4674">We had to answer questions, especially the question I remember was, "Did any one of your family ever die in Theresienstadt, or was sent away to the East?" </sentence><sentence id="4675">And we had nobody, you see. </sentence><sentence id="4676">So we could say ""no." </sentence><sentence id="4677">And then we saw him write down that we could get into the transport. </sentence><sentence id="4678">And then the next day -- this was all packed into two days, you see. </sentence><sentence id="4679">There was no way of come back in two weeks or anything like that, no red tape of any kind. </sentence><sentence id="4680">So then the next day we got that brown slip that I showed you before where it says that we should appear on February the fourth, at seven o'clock in the evening, with one suitcase -- no bedrolls, no rucksacks, nothing of the kind -- and nicely dressed and punctual. </sentence><sentence id="4681">The Germans were very much for punctuality, whether that was for your liberation or for your death, you be punctual. </sentence><sentence id="4682">So we went, and we left the rest of the people in the basement room, and we really didn't believe we were really going to Switzerland. </sentence><sentence id="4683">We did believe something was different. </sentence><sentence id="4684">And in the train, it was not a cattle car this time, in the train we got packages of marmalade, and stuff that I didn't even know what to do with. </sentence><sentence id="4685">And then we left, Eva and I very much together, and we really got to Switzerland. </sentence><sentence id="4686">And when we got to Switzerland, we crossed the border into Switzerland I remember three things that stayed in my mind very much. </sentence><sentence id="4687">We looked out the window. </sentence><sentence id="4688">Number one, nobody yelled us, "Get back in or you'll be shot," you know. </sentence><sentence id="4689">And number two, the people smiled. </sentence><sentence id="4690">I hadn't seen a person smile in 12 years. </sentence><sentence id="4691">What was there to smile at? </sentence><sentence id="4692">All through my youth and my growing up. </sentence><sentence id="4693">The people smiled at us. </sentence><sentence id="4694">And the person that -- then some Swiss people in uniform came in and they were nice to us, and that was unheard of, anyone in uniform being nice to Jews. </sentence><sentence id="4695">What's this?Gan Eden?(tm) Already we're dead and we're in paradise. </sentence><sentence id="4696">Was unheard of. </sentence><sentence id="4697">And then the third thing I remember, night fell and the lights stayed on. </sentence><sentence id="4698">There was no war in Switzerland, you see. </sentence><sentence id="4699">The lights purposely stayed on so the airplanes overhead could tell that it was Switzerland and wouldn't bomb it. </sentence><sentence id="4700">But to us it was an epiphany. </sentence><sentence id="4701">It was unheard of. </sentence><sentence id="4702">So then we were allowed to pick one of the several places where we could go, and Eva and I stayed together and picked Les Avants, and then she fell in love with a French refugee who had also come, and she followed him to France because she was completely alone. </sentence><sentence id="4703">And I contacted my father, and then he let me come over to America, and I married. </sentence><sentence id="4704">And by gosh when our kids became teenagers they visited back and forth, and J ean(r)" fell in love with Polly" --right under my eyes, and I didn't see it happen. </sentence><sentence id="4705">And I didn't know for many years just how that all came about. </sentence><sentence id="4706">May I tell you just very quickly. </sentence><sentence id="4707">Maybe you know it already, but to me it was a very, very fascinating story because I discovered it myself. </sentence><sentence id="4708">It wasn't told to me. </sentence><sentence id="4709">I went to the National Archives. </sentence><sentence id="4710">I had an advisor, Tim Mulligan, to guide me through the whole process, and I discovered the documents and read them, and I found out that at the end of 1944, a Jewish-Swiss woman by the name of Recha Sternbuch, very religious woman.... I'll condense the story a little bit -- approached %8 Garden of Eden (Hebrew) *(r) Jean Hammel as Polly Haas-Hammel  Jean-Marie Musy, who was a Swiss -- a former Swiss President. </sentence><sentence id="4711">First she thought she wanted her mother and father to be taken out of Germany. </sentence><sentence id="4712">Musy was a friend of Himmler's and he had rescued a few Jews before, and she approached him to get her parents out. </sentence><sentence id="4713">And then, she thought, "Why not try to get all the Jews out?" </sentence><sentence id="4714">It was late in the war, and she asked him to contact Himmler, and she said she, in turn, would contact the Americans and see if for a certain ransom he would let the Jews out of Germany. </sentence><sentence id="4715">And by gosh he agreed. </sentence><sentence id="4716">This is now, of course, I'm condensing this very much. </sentence><sentence id="4717">He agreed. </sentence><sentence id="4718">Musy went to Germany to meet him first in his railroad car, then at another secret location, and he agreed. </sentence><sentence id="4719">And I saw the correspondence between him and -- Himmler and Musy -- and then later with Sternbuch. </sentence><sentence id="4720">He wanted first -- first he wanted lorries, trucks to continue the war, but the Americans of course didn't do that. </sentence><sentence id="4721">In the meantime Sternbuch had contacted the Va'ad Ha-Hatsala, which is the Union of Orthodox Rabbis of America and Canada. </sentence><sentence id="4722">And they had formed this Va'ad, just for the purpose of helping the Jews -- the war was ending -- whom they knew would come and needed help, even in Europe. </sentence><sentence id="4723">And when Sternbuch contacted them, they immediately agreed to collect money to buy out the Jews. </sentence><sentence id="4724">In the end, the first transport, it was exchanged for 5,000,000 American dollars, and was to be of twelve hundred people out of Theresienstadt, because we still looked good, and as I have said before, especially we young people were urged to, to come. </sentence><sentence id="4725">And then Hitler -- and the condition that Himmler made was that he should get good publicity in Swiss and American press. </sentence><sentence id="4726">Why? </sentence><sentence id="4727">Because he saw the war ending, and he saw his own fate clearly before him. </sentence><sentence id="4728">After all, he was the originator of all that killing, and he now wanted to whitewash himself. </sentence><sentence id="4729">He wanted good publicity and good treatment when the war ended. </sentence><sentence id="4730">And this was done without Hitler's knowledge. </sentence><sentence id="4731">And Hitler heard about it. </sentence><sentence id="4732">When the first 1,200 Jews came out, he heard about it. </sentence><sentence id="4733">And he immediately disinherited Himmler. </sentence><sentence id="4734">Himmler had to flee, and he forbade every other contact -- every other release -- Jews or non-Jews -- nobody leaves Germany anymore. </sentence><sentence id="4735">So we were the only transport. </sentence><sentence id="4736">And Musy, who it is believed enriched himself from those 5,000,000 dollars went back into obscurity. </sentence><sentence id="4737">Nobody heard from him. </sentence><sentence id="4738">Then he died. </sentence><sentence id="4739">He was already 76 years old at the time of his intercourse with Himmler. </sentence><sentence id="4740">But he died later. </sentence><sentence id="4741">Mrs. Sternbuch was much honored and also died much later --in "71. </sentence><sentence id="4742">And Himmler had to flee first from Hitler, who was going to kill him -- and he wandered around Liineburger Heide which is a place --a lonely place in Germany, and then he had to flee from the Allies. </sentence><sentence id="4743">It was the English -- the British that captured that part of Germany. </sentence><sentence id="4744">And when the Allies did capture him, not knowing whom they had, he took cyanide and killed himself. </sentence><sentence id="4745">And then they knew it was Himmler. </sentence><sentence id="4746">It was too late. </sentence><sentence id="4747">And I was saved. </sentence><sentence id="4748">He tried to save himself and he saved me instead. </sentence><sentence id="4749">Isn't that a miracle? </sentence><sentence id="4750">I was number 1,400-- number 1,174 out of those 1,200. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="4860">Q: And Eva was 1,100 and-- </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="4862">A: Seventy-five. </sentence><sentence id="4863">She was right next -- right behind me. </sentence><sentence id="4864">It's really something. </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="4865">Q: Was it difficult for you to part from Eva when she got married -- when she followed this--? </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="4866">A: It was. </sentence><sentence id="4867">I remember that quite well. </sentence><sentence id="4868">She, she -- we said "goodbye" to each other at the, at the train station in Zurich, and well, of course, she was the happiest woman in the world. </sentence><sentence id="4869">She was very much in love with Eric, who -- her future husband. </sentence><sentence id="4870">The interesting thing is they were married in Paris, and who would be the officiating Rabbi? </sentence><sentence id="4871">My own Eli Munk from Ansbach. </sentence><sentence id="4872">Isn't that something. </sentence><sentence id="4873">And then when Jean and Polly got engaged and were about to marry, Eli Munk was then a very old gentleman already and he was living in New York, and the marriage was in Boston, and I wanted very much for him to marry our children. </sentence><sentence id="4874">But then he was already. </sentence><sentence id="4875">He tried, but he was already too old. </sentence><sentence id="4876">But, no, it wasn't all that hard for us to, to part. </sentence><sentence id="4877">We knew we would stay friends, and we knew we would visit each other, and we did. </sentence><sentence id="4878">She and I had some great visits with each other. </sentence><sentence id="4879">She lost her husband much too soon, and her son and my daughter had four children, and we are very devoted grandmothers. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="4894">Q: Did you ever talk with Munk once you re-found him about his leaving and not telling people? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="4896">A: Oh, yes. </sentence><sentence id="4897">I didn't say that to him. </sentence><sentence id="4898">You can't say that to a beloved and respected Rabbi. </sentence><sentence id="4899">That was something that I, that I have to keep in my own mind because I'm still very friendly with his sons and daughters -- especially with his daughter who married the Chief Rabbi of Great Britain, Jakobovitz,"" and I'm very friendly with Lady Emily(ph). </sentence><sentence id="4900">And I still adore her father and her mother, although they're now gone. </sentence><sentence id="4901">But you see when I got to Switzerland there's another very interesting connection. </sentence><sentence id="4902">They had to fleet Paris --- Munks with all their children -- in "44 or "45. </sentence><sentence id="4903">They had to flee Paris, and they fled to Geneva, and when he heard that I was in Les Avants, which is very close to Geneva, he came immediately to visit me. </sentence><sentence id="4904">And you know it was like a father coming. </sentence><sentence id="4905">He was so associated with my youth, and so, so beloved by me that, that was a bond that never dissolved. </sentence><sentence id="4906">And then they invited me their house, and the children were all very small, and it was a homecoming for me, you see. </sentence><sentence id="4907">And now I have long forgiven him that. </sentence><sentence id="4908">I didn't even think about it anymore. </sentence><sentence id="4909">It just came back to me now as I was thinking about Ansbach. </sentence><sentence id="4910">But you know, the normal measurements of ethics do not apply to the years of the Holocaust. </sentence><sentence id="4911">They just don't apply. </sentence><sentence id="4912">Was everybody justified in trying to save his or her own life? </sentence><sentence id="4913">Were people justified in trying to save their own baby, knowing that if that baby wasn't taken, another mother's baby would have to be substituted? </sentence><sentence id="4914">Was I justified to let my mother and sister? </sentence><sentence id="4915">Was my father justified to leave us? </sentence><sentence id="4916">You cannot apply those normal moral standards to the Holocaust years. </sentence><sentence id="4917">You just can't. </sentence><sentence id="4918">You just can't. </sentence><sentence id="4919">So I have long forgiven him that he saved his life, and his whole family's life. </sentence><sentence id="4920">Why should that whole family also have disappeared? </sentence><sentence id="4921">And he has since done so much good. </sentence><sentence id="4922">He's been such an outstanding Rabbi. </sentence><sentence id="4923">And then we were not bound to obey him even though he said, "Stay. </sentence><sentence id="4924">Everything will *! </sentence><sentence id="4925">Rabbi Immanuel Jakobovitz  be okay." </sentence><sentence id="4926">Many people left. </sentence><sentence id="4927">We could have left too, and we did after a while. </sentence><sentence id="4928">So that's a whole other philosophical problem that you just can't allow yourself to get into it. </sentence><sentence id="4929">You get lost in the swamp. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="4965">Q: What was it like to see your father after -- what, six years? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="4967">A: Oh, that was, that was after.... Let's see, he left in "39, and I saw him again in "46 -- in April of "46, and it was very strange. </sentence><sentence id="4968">I came by boat, and I arrived -- I think it was during the Passover -- during the Pesach holidays. </sentence><sentence id="4969">And my father remained very religious. </sentence><sentence id="4970">And he came to Boston to pick me up. </sentence><sentence id="4971">| arrived at the Boston Harbor, and he couldn't travel to the boat to pick me up. </sentence><sentence id="4972">He sent somebody else, and that somebody took me then to an apartment where he stayed and I saw him again. </sentence><sentence id="4973">And I thought that I would see an old man because I had gone through so much. </sentence><sentence id="4974">I had lived six lifetimes, you see, that to me it was like a 100 years. </sentence><sentence id="4975">And I thought there would be this old, broken man full of grief, and full of sorrow and remorse. </sentence><sentence id="4976">But it wasn't. </sentence><sentence id="4977">There was a young, beautiful, dark haired, straight, upright man in his prime -- 50 years old -- who greeted me. </sentence><sentence id="4978">And that was -- I had to adjust my inner vision and my outer, and what I saw in reality. </sentence><sentence id="4979">That took a little bit. </sentence><sentence id="4980">And it took a while for us to become comfortable with each other. </sentence><sentence id="4981">I will have to admit that. </sentence><sentence id="4982">I will have to admit that. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="4999">Q: For you had gone from a child in a way, right? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="5001">A: Yes. </sentence><sentence id="5002">Yes, yes. </sentence><sentence id="5003">And you see he didn't really know what we went through. </sentence><sentence id="5004">He had his own struggles. </sentence><sentence id="5005">It's not that he had a bed of roses. </sentence><sentence id="5006">He came up from nothing, and he had great sorrow to try to get us over. </sentence><sentence id="5007">I have seen his notes after his death, that he never showed me actually. </sentence><sentence id="5008">But I saw how he went from "Pontius to Pilate," from one person to the other, begging for help -- and nobody helped him. </sentence><sentence id="5009">And that wasn't easy either. </sentence><sentence id="5010">That couldn't have been an easy task either -- and knowing that his family.... </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="5021">Q: And what did he end up doing in the United States? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="5023">A: He remained a butcher. </sentence><sentence id="5024">Remember he had no real education. </sentence><sentence id="5025">He first worked for some other Jewish kosher butchers in Washington Heights in New York, and then he and his brother opened their own little butcher shop -- Schild Brothers -- and they became quite successful, but always within the German Jewish community. </sentence><sentence id="5026">And you see his fear of anyone non- Jewish also never left him. </sentence><sentence id="5027">He also carried the scar even though he didn't go through the worst. </sentence><sentence id="5028">But he told me once when somebody came into the store that spoke English, they immediately were afraid. </sentence><sentence id="5029">They immediately thought it was someone to inspect the store, or to make trouble, or to want something from them. </sentence><sentence id="5030">You see, we all, we all have our scars. </sentence><sentence id="5031">You can't go through this without scars -- you just can't. </sentence><sentence id="5032">So he was always afraid of anyone not Jewish as well. </sentence><sentence id="5033">Those were the enemies. </sentence><sentence id="5034">But he lived to a ripe old age. </sentence><sentence id="5035">He married again  --a woman who was in Theresienstadt and lost her husband and two children there. </sentence><sentence id="5036">I never knew her there -- I couldn't, it was much too big to know people. </sentence><sentence id="5037">We were so restricted and then she was much older. </sentence><sentence id="5038">I didn't readily associate or become friendly with people of my parents" age. </sentence><sentence id="5039">I stayed very much with my own age, and possibly with the very old people that I went to visit. </sentence><sentence id="5040">But I never knew her, and she was very good to him "til the day he died. </sentence><sentence id="5041">And he only died about nine years ago at the age of 92. </sentence><sentence id="5042">He remained very religious. </sentence><sentence id="5043">We became very close too at the end. </sentence><sentence id="5044">He never spoke -- I always thought he would say something, at least on his deathbed still, that he shouldn't have left us, or something like that, but he never did. </sentence><sentence id="5045">This is another thing I, I don't understand. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="5123">A: Well, two things -- one egotistical and the other altruistic. </sentence><sentence id="5124">The egotistical first. </sentence><sentence id="5125">I got myself an education. </sentence><sentence id="5126">I went to college. </sentence><sentence id="5127">My husband, my husband was always very understanding of me. </sentence><sentence id="5128">He could see, he could see my whole situation much better than I could. </sentence><sentence id="5129">And by then -- this took a while. </sentence><sentence id="5130">My first depression occurred after my first baby was born. </sentence><sentence id="5131">And then I still was very timid, very much afraid of authority, very much reluctant to approach anyone that was in authority "cause that was dangerous up "til then. </sentence><sentence id="5132">So then after a while I missed very much that I didn't have an education. </sentence><sentence id="5133">And after a while then I went to Bates College in Lewiston, and they accepted me as one of the very first non-College age students. </sentence><sentence id="5134">See now, this is different. </sentence><sentence id="5135">This was in the "50s -- in the "60s. </sentence><sentence id="5136">I graduated in "71. </sentence><sentence id="5137">I was only the second person of non-- of not eighteen years old. </sentence><sentence id="5138">I was like 46 or 47, and I did alright. </sentence><sentence id="5139">I graduated with a lot of honors and I loved every moment of it. </sentence><sentence id="5140">And then I was done. </sentence><sentence id="5141">And then I didn't know what to do again, so my husband urged me and he said, "Go to graduate school. </sentence><sentence id="5142">Become a librarian," "cause I liked books. </sentence><sentence id="5143">And I did that and again I graduated, so now what? </sentence><sentence id="5144">So he said, "Take a job. </sentence><sentence id="5145">Be a librarian." </sentence><sentence id="5146">And Bates College took me as a librarian, and I was very happy there during the years. </sentence><sentence id="5147">And then the second part comes in -- the altruistic part if I may say so. </sentence><sentence id="5148">Then I began to realize Bates College, up to not too long ago, was a very Baptist college. </sentence><sentence id="5149">When my husband became college physician in -- soon after our marriage, in the early "50s, he was only the second Jewish employee of that whole college, and the college was in existence for some 150 years or so -- and very limited Jewish students and no Jewish activities. </sentence><sentence id="5150">And they didn't know Jews or Jewish contexts or nothing about the Holocaust. </sentence><sentence id="5151">So an opportunity presented itself, ready made, and I stepped in. </sentence><sentence id="5152">I got myself funding from the National Humanities Counsel, and from Jewish organizations, and I began to educate the College. </sentence><sentence id="5153">I did programs of Jewish contexts, and I made month-long informational college affairs where the people could hear speeches and ask questions, have dialogues, and simply inform themselves, "What is Judaism? </sentence><sentence id="5154">What are Jews? </sentence><sentence id="5155">What are the finer points of it?" </sentence><sentence id="5156">And really, I was quite successful. </sentence><sentence id="5157">I got a Jewish library into the college, when the Rabbi of the city where I lived died. </sentence><sentence id="5158">This was all back in Maine. </sentence><sentence id="5159">We settled in Maine. </sentence><sentence id="5160">When he died I was instrumental in getting his whole library into the College, and it's known now as the Rabbi Barrend(ph) Jewish Library, and it's a fine, fine library. </sentence><sentence id="5161">I catalogued it, and integrated it as a special library. </sentence><sentence id="5162">And that drew Jewish interest. </sentence><sentence id="5163">And from that library -- I used that again as my platform -- I gave Jewish talks, and got Jewish persons in. </sentence><sentence id="5164">I had Hilberg." </sentence><sentence id="5165">I had Lansky" of the Yiddish Center. </sentence><sentence id="5166">I had Velvel Pasternak of Jewish music. </sentence><sentence id="5167">I -- who me? </sentence><sentence id="5168">I brought all these Raul Hilberg 3 Aaron Lansky  people in and I educated them. </sentence><sentence id="5169">Then finally I saw a need -- the people wanted to teach the Holocaust and they didn't know what to do. </sentence><sentence id="5170">They didn't know how to teach it. </sentence><sentence id="5171">So out of that activity, out of all those Jewish affairs that I had organized, was some money left over in the end, and I organized the Holocaust Human Rights Center of Maine for the purpose of helping the teachers teach the Holocaust. </sentence><sentence id="5172">And that was a very fine success. </sentence><sentence id="5173">I moved out of Maine, but the Center stayed, and we have an oral history project, of course. </sentence><sentence id="5174">We have a teachers" guidebook. </sentence><sentence id="5175">We have all kinds of things, were successful. </sentence><sentence id="5176">And then I felt better. </sentence><sentence id="5177">I don't have a --I still feel terrible about my losses, but I don't feel guilty anymore. </sentence><sentence id="5178">And I speak all around the country. </sentence><sentence id="5179">And I hear students -- I see there is a necessity to speak, because the students know only democracy. </sentence><sentence id="5180">The constant question is, "Well, why didn't you just not go," you know. </sentence><sentence id="5181">Or, "Why didn't you say you weren't Jewish?" </sentence><sentence id="5182">Or, "How come you had to give your house up?" </sentence><sentence id="5183">They don't understand this. </sentence><sentence id="5184">They're living in a democracy. </sentence><sentence id="5185">They don't understand what it is to live in an autocracy. </sentence><sentence id="5186">So I still -- I still feel a need to talk and to write, and to answer questions. </sentence><sentence id="5187">And I wrote a second book, and I'm writing one now for even younger children, because they need to know. </sentence></p></dialogue>
