id="2600">We were laughing already there when I was going sometimes in the night. </sentence><sentence id="2601">I laughed and said what group is going again that meetings to get a connection then. </sentence><sentence id="2602">| felt that is the way to be because when you are a group, you live by yourself, and you don't know -- no telephones, nothing. </sentence><sentence id="2603">You don't know what's going to come next, and they were spying. </sentence><sentence id="2604">You have to have this. </sentence><sentence id="2605">You have to know what your neighbor's doing.

id="2700">The bone wasn't touched. </sentence><sentence id="2701">And this was luck. </sentence><sentence id="2702">It was just the meat here that was shot here. </sentence><sentence id="2703">And I could walk. </sentence><sentence id="2704">It was bleeding a little bit, but I still walked. </sentence><sentence id="2705">And we run over to a house there and we told the farmer, "Fast put on a horse and wagon," Szengut said, "and we will put on -- I will put you down on this on the wagon and we will start running away with this." </sentence><sentence id="2706">Then all of a sudden I see the Germans right by the border there when I was, I was there. </sentence><sentence id="2707">They came out. </sentence><sentence id="2708">And one starts talking Polish to me. </sentence><sentence id="2709">And he says in Polish, "You're a Jew, bastard?" </sentence><sentence id="2710">or something, this. </sentence><sentence id="2711">And he aimed with a rifle this, and he didn't, I don't know, he didn't hit me. </sentence><sentence id="2712">I got up and Szengut grabbed me and left the horse with the wagon, and I start screaming with my people. </sentence><sentence id="2713">I start screaming with my people, they rest, "Stop and start shooting back. </sentence><sentence id="2714">Start shooting back because otherwise nobody will live." </sentence><sentence id="2715">And I remember like today this one of them guys, it was Andrejew. </sentence><sentence id="2716">He was the first one. </sentence><sentence id="2717">He turned around, took out the rifle, he was aiming at the Germans. </sentence><sentence id="2718">The Germans stopped. </sentence><sentence id="2719">They stopped. </sentence><sentence id="2720">Right away they fell through the floor. </sentence><sentence id="2721">And when he took out a few of our people. </sentence><sentence id="2722">There was a Finkel there was a few four or five. </sentence><sentence id="2723">They took out the rifles and they start shooting back. </sentence><sentence id="2724">When they stopped the Germans, I had time to with Szengut to run away to come over and we went over to a woods somewhere there around not far, and the Germans stopped a little bit behind and they had three of our people and I think they, they killed there because I know -- don't know what happened to them again. </sentence><sentence id="2725">And between them was this Majdanek, this guy what run away from Majdanek. </sentence><sentence id="2726">He was killed there right away in this skirmish. </sentence><sentence id="2727">And I run away to the woods. </sentence><sentence id="2728">In the meantime, Szengut and another one, Finkel, they both went back to look. </sentence><sentence id="2729">Maybe they can help somebody to -- they came to a farmhouse and they opened the door there, and when they opened the door Germans was sitting there. </sentence><sentence id="2730">A whole bunch of them was sitting there, and they were singing or eating something. </sentence><sentence id="2731">You know they, they had that trophy. </sentence><sentence id="2732">They took away -- I think they took away some money from these three guys too. </sentence><sentence id="2733">They had maybe a few -- I don't know what kind money. </sentence><sentence id="2734">And Finkel closed the door and Szengut had hand grenade and they threw in there the hand grenade into this, and they don't know what happened there. </sentence><sentence id="2735">Then they run away, and they found me. </sentence><sentence id="2736">I was still waiting. </sentence><sentence id="2737">And we took a farmer, stopped with a horse and wagon on this -- put me on this and they sat down and I was with Szengut and another one and they had another -- they stopped other farmers when they -- on the way and we start moving. </sentence><sentence id="2738">And on the way I asked the farmer, "Maybe you will take me home because I am shot and I cannot -- my finger start bothering me very much, more than the foot." </sentence><sentence id="2739">I said, "I cannot walk and I cannot, I cannot function." </sentence><sentence id="2740">He said, "You have to be helped." </sentence><sentence id="2741">I said, "Oh no, my wife is sick and there's a -- I'm afraid, but I will bring you over. </sentence><sentence id="2742">I have a farm and I have a man what works for me, and he will keep you. </sentence><sentence id="2743">He will keep you there." </sentence><sentence id="2744">I said, "Alright, whatever he wanted to do." </sentence><sentence id="2745">And he brought me over to another farmer and the farmer was very nice to me. </sentence><sentence id="2746">They, they took a Band-Aid and they, they took some water. </sentence><sentence id="2747">I don't know what kind of water. </sentence><sentence id="2748">They washed it and they cleaned it very, very nice. </sentence><sentence id="2749">They, they helped me out. </sentence><sentence id="2750">It took almost a half a day, something, I was there sitting. </sentence><sentence id="2751">All of a sudden, shooting again. </sentence><sentence id="2752">I was with Szengut, and another Piasecki was another guy. </sentence><sentence id="2753">We were there in the partition there. </sentence><sentence id="2754">The rest of the group was in another house. </sentence><sentence id="2755">Start shooting in the house. </sentence><sentence id="2756">Like a thunder. </sentence><sentence id="2757">Shoot directly in the house. </sentence><sentence id="2758">And the farmer showed me the way out in the back and me and Piasecki. </sentence><sentence id="2759">I got up and I said, "Where is Henryk?" </sentence><sentence id="2760">I said, "Where is Finkel?" </sentence><sentence id="2761">And I start looking back and I don't see him. </sentence><sentence id="2762">And the farmer said, "You cannot wait a second. </sentence><sentence id="2763">Run. </sentence><sentence id="2764">Run." </sentence><sentence id="2765">And from the back of the farm it was already start to be a little darkish and I run away with Piasecki, this guy. </sentence><sentence id="2766">We run away both of us. </sentence><sentence id="2767">And with my wounded foot then I had to walk a whole night. </sentence><sentence id="2768">I was walking in the woods. </sentence><sentence id="2769">Walking, walking, walking. </sentence><sentence id="2770">It was day almost. </sentence><sentence id="2771">I went over. </sentence><sentence id="2772">I had no, no choice already. </sentence><sentence id="2773">I didn't know what to do myself. </sentence><sentence id="2774">I walked over to a farmer.
