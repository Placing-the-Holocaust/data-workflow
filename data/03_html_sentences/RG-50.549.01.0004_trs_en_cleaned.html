<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="259">A: I think throughout the whole time that I was in Auschwitz, I always felt in my heart that Rene was okay. </sentence><sentence id="260">I had a vague idea where he was. </sentence><sentence id="261">It was from my bunk it was a little over to the right near some chimneys or something, and in fact he really was there. </sentence><sentence id="262">That's how I remember it. </sentence><sentence id="263">There was once some kind of a fire and I was terribly scared that Rene's bunk may be caught up in that, but luckily he wasn't. </sentence><sentence id="264">USHMM Archives RG-50.549.01*0004 5 </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="271">Q: Did you see him sometimes? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="273">A: Well, I don't recall that I saw him, although Rene says that he did once catch a glimpse of me, so, it's possible that I saw him too, but it didn't quite register for me. </sentence><sentence id="274">But somehow I always knew at some point no matter what this was, and I didn't understand what any of this was, that we'd somehow be together again. </sentence><sentence id="275">You asked earlier about memories of Auschwitz and I guess most of them are really quite bad and I don't like speaking of them very much and I haven't spoken about some at all and I might never because I can't. </sentence><sentence id="276">But Auschwitz, the things that I remember very clearly is having to stand for hours for roll call, and I remember that I was one of the youngest and I was little and I always tried to hide behind somebody else, somebody taller so that I would not be seen. </sentence><sentence id="277">I think this was my mode of operation, is to be invisible and you can't get into trouble. </sentence><sentence id="278">I used to get a piece of bread, usually int he morning, with some black stuff to drink and I remember that I would always, since I was always -- maybe it was in the afternoon -- because I was always hungriest in the morning so I thought it would be really clever for me to try to save this piece of bread so I would have it the next day and of course it usually was gone and I didn't understand it but now in retrospect I think the rats and mice at Auschwitz must have loved me. </sentence><sentence id="279">They knew who to come to. </sentence><sentence id="280">I remember standing in line, humiliated standing outside in the cold naked waiting to get into the showers and also terribly scared because somehow I knew that you didn't always come out of the shower. </sentence><sentence id="281">I didn't know quite what happened, but I knew you didn't always come back. </sentence><sentence id="282">I'm amazed at my, I guess call it chutzpa, because I had a locket on my neck, a gold locket from my mom and I was determined to hang on to this and of course if they had seen it, I don't know what would happened to me, but I took it off my neck and held on to in my hand and somehow got passed the guard. </sentence><sentence id="283">I think what happened is in the showers it finally dropped out of my hand. </sentence><sentence id="284">But there was a little bit of me that said I got away -- I saved my locket. </sentence><sentence id="285">I remember once that I actually hid among dead bodies and I don't know exactly what was going on but I thought if I really lay still and make believe I was dead I would somehow escape whatever was happening. </sentence><sentence id="286">There was always this cloud of smoke in Auschwitz and there was always this smell that after a while I heard comments you know they're burning people. </sentence><sentence id="287">It's flesh burning. </sentence><sentence id="288">I don't think I still understood exactly. </sentence><sentence id="289">I said, you know, it couldn't be. </sentence><sentence id="290">I think my most horrendous memories are those of Doctor Mengala and the hospital and I seemed to be a favorite candidate. </sentence><sentence id="291">I don't know why but I remember getting injections and I remember having some little surgeries here and there, and things with electrical wires. </sentence><sentence id="292">I spent a lot of time in the hospital. </sentence><sentence id="293">I was pretty sick very often, but somehow I held on because I knew that Rene needed me. </sentence><sentence id="294">I had to get by. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="317">Q: How did you know it was Doctor Mengele? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="319">A: Oh, I don't really think I really knew. </sentence><sentence id="320">I think I know that today. </sentence><sentence id="321">It was just a doctor. </sentence><sentence id="322">It just seemed like he was in charge. </sentence><sentence id="323">I mean to me he was like in charge of everything, next to God. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="329">Q: You were alone there from your family, but did you relate to other women? </sentence><sentence id="330">Do you </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="333"> USHMM Archives RG-50.549.01*0004 6 remember women of different ages? </sentence><sentence id="334">What was the relationship between you and the others you were with? </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="335">A: Unfortunately I think I really for whatever reason, I had no relationship with anybody. </sentence><sentence id="336">I was a very quiet child, very introverted. </sentence><sentence id="337">I was scared. </sentence><sentence id="338">I didn't mingle. </sentence><sentence id="339">It didn't seem like there were any children my age. </sentence><sentence id="340">They were a little bit older, and I somehow didn't belong and so I found myself just being kind of an observer. </sentence><sentence id="341">I watched a lot and I always again tried to make myself invisible. </sentence><sentence id="342">Always get behind somebody tall, behind a bunk, behind whatever. </sentence><sentence id="343">One very, very sad experience for me was one night when I had to actually go to the latrines and somehow I got so totally disoriented that I just could not remember where my bunk was and I remember trying to just -- I remember it was almost dawn and I knew that if they found me I'd be in real trouble so I tried to just get into anybody's bunk and maybe it was the people or the times but I was just being pushed away and being told this is not your place. </sentence><sentence id="344">This is not your place, but finally there was one woman and I don't know who she is, she finally said -- just grabbed me and let me come in with her. </sentence><sentence id="345">It was very sad. </sentence><sentence id="346">I missed my mom a lot. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="359">Q: So, you did not have an experience that other women have had of women taking care of each other a little bit in the camp? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="361">A: Not really. </sentence><sentence id="362">I also know that twin girls also had camaraderie because they had their siblings. </sentence><sentence id="363">But I think my overwhelming sense was just loneliness. </sentence><sentence id="364">I felt that I was just alone, always all alone and didn't belong anywhere. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="369">Q: How did you get through those days? </sentence><sentence id="370">Did you talk to yourself? </sentence><sentence id="371">You had to do something? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="375">A: Well, I think I day-dreamed a little about -- I don't know exactly about what. </sentence><sentence id="376">I think I used to remember that I had a doll and I had trains and the toys I used to have, little building blocks. </sentence><sentence id="377">I remembered my mom and I used to remember the walks in the park with my parents. </sentence><sentence id="378">I think that's how I got through. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="383">Q: Were you ever beaten? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="385">A: Not that I -- no. </sentence><sentence id="386">No, but I did witness other people being beaten, and I witnessed people being shot and people running into the electric wire, fences, but no, I tried to keep out of trouble. </sentence><sentence id="387">I had a sense that I had to be really good and listen and obey and I did. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="391">Q: What happened when finally liberation came and the Red Army came? </sentence><sentence id="392">Do you remember that particular day? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="395">A: Well, what I remember is that there was a difference. </sentence><sentence id="396">Suddenly there was a difference in the camp. </sentence><sentence id="397">I don't think that I understood that it was liberation day because I don't think I understood that we were at war. </sentence><sentence id="398">To me, I guess I always hated that the saddest thing is USHMM Archives RG-50.549.01*0004 7 that I really thought that what I had in Auschwitz was the way everybody lived. </sentence><sentence id="399">This was life, but there was a change, a definite change. </sentence><sentence id="400">There was a lot of scurrying about. </sentence><sentence id="401">Things weren't as strict. </sentence><sentence id="402">There seemed to be -- there was no order suddenly. </sentence><sentence id="403">There was just no order, and at that time I was extremely sick and I was lying on the ground. </sentence><sentence id="404">I could not move. </sentence><sentence id="405">I think if another week had passed I probably would have been dead, and I just remembered that a Polish woman picked me up and she piggy-back carried me all the way to her home in Auschwitz. </sentence><sentence id="406">That's what happened to me. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="420">Q: So you were very weak then, very sick, then when they came in? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="422">A: Right, and I saw people running here and there and there was some kind of shouting. </sentence><sentence id="423">It seemed there was a little almost joy like something good happened, but I couldn't move. </sentence><sentence id="424">So, I was just wondering what was going to happen to me. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="428">Q: So, this woman carried you to her home and that's where you stayed for a while? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="430">A: Yes, she lived right in the town proper of Auschwitz and I was very sick. </sentence><sentence id="431">I remember being in bed. </sentence><sentence id="432">I remember -- it must have been a doctor who came to see me and I remember these hot glasses on my back. </sentence><sentence id="433">A lot of that, and eventually I guess I got better because I got enrolled in school. </sentence><sentence id="434">I started going to school and I went to church. </sentence><sentence id="435">I knew that she was not Jewish. </sentence><sentence id="436">I also somehow knew that I was Jewish, but Jewish was not good, and so I wanted very much to be catholic. </sentence><sentence id="437">That was fine with me. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="446">Q: How did you communicate with her? </sentence><sentence id="447">She was Polish? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="450">A: I think I very quickly learned how to speak Polish because I had no trouble in school. </sentence><sentence id="451">I had no trouble in church. </sentence><sentence id="452">I understood everything. </sentence><sentence id="453">So, maybe as a child it was easy for me to pick up the language. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="458">Q: How did you communicate in the camps? </sentence><sentence id="459">Did you understand people there? </sentence><sentence id="460">What languages do you remember? </sentence></p></dialogue>
