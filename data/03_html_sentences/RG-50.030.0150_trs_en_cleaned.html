</sentence><sentence id="56">I...there were days that I had...I finished a book a day. </sentence><sentence id="57">Of course, in the beginning was just children's books, but a new world opened in

</sentence><sentence id="59">We didn't have an opera, but we had an operata. </sentence><sentence id="60">And she really used to pump culture into us because she used to say...I remember it well,

appreciate it. </sentence><sentence id="61">Coming back to...one second to my mother, I have to tell you that she was my best friend and I was very proud of her because not only was she a big beauty and a real lady, I never saw her without a hat or a pair of gloves, but also she was a very compassionate person. </sentence><sentence id="62">She had a very big clientele, and I remember rich

dentist. </sentence><sentence id="63">And they used to bring all kinds of presents, but on the other hand the poor people around us knew if they have a toothache or they have a any problem, they just come, ring the bell and come to the office and my mother would never ask them how much they can pay. </sentence><sentence id="64">They pay how much they could, and if they couldn't pay it was alright also. </sentence><sentence id="65">So she always imbedded in our mind the concept of charity. </sentence><sentence id="66">This idyllic life lasted through 1935, and this was the time when I started to feel the wind of anti-Semitism. </sentence><sentence id="67">My father...my father was working as a registered pharmacist in a very big pharmacy that was a government pharmacy from the social services. </sentence><sentence id="68">Every worker was involved in it. </sentence><sentence id="69">Only 3 Jewish pharmacists were working there. </sentence><sentence id="70">They were the students

</sentence><sentence id="75">My father used to close himself in...in his bedroom and work and study. </sentence><sentence id="76">He used to go on field trips because the old fashioned pharmacist didn't go and just and pick up the medicine from the shelves. </sentence><sentence id="77">They have to prepare it. </sentence><sentence id="78">And finally when the tests came...uh...there was an oral test and there was a written test. </sentence><sentence id="79">The man...the professor that gave him the test was a known anti-Semite and my father was very afraid that he won't pass the test. </sentence><sentence id="80">But he passed the test with flying colors. </sentence><sentence id="81">The written test and the oral. </sentence><sentence id="82">And as he was getting up from the chair...he was practically by the door, after he...telling him about so many complicated chemicals formula and everything, all of sudden, the professor asked him, "David ___, and what is the chemical...uh...formula for carbonated water with the C2 03, and my father was so nervous and so upset that he got a mental block and he couldn't answer him. </sentence><sentence id="83">And he just didn't pass him. </sentence><sentence id="84">So, of course, he had to study enough and he went to Warsaw and after a short time we got the telegram he did pass it. </sentence><sentence id="85">But after a very short time, a decree came and Jews were not allowed to work as pharmacist in a government institution, and my father lost his job. </sentence><sentence id="86">I didn't tell you that my...my father had a brother and two sisters. </sentence><sentence id="87">And my...my grandparents on my father's side were very religious, very religious people, and my grandmother had 16 children

and the rabbi told her that he...that if you wanted your children to live, you have to dress them only in white. </sentence><sentence id="88">Even...only in white, even if they grew...grow up and be able to go to school. </sentence><sentence id="89">And when the child will ask you, "Mama, how come everybody dresses in all kinds of different colors and I'm wearing in white...I'm dressed in white," then you can take off and dress the child in any colors. </sentence><sentence id="90">And this what happened. </sentence><sentence id="91">And she...the 13 and the 14 and 15 and the 16th child survived because she kept them in white. </sentence><sentence id="92">And my...my father had a brother and two sisters. </sentence><sentence id="93">The...the...the...the younger brother immigrated to Argentina with one of the sisters went to the United States, and one of the sisters lived with her parents in Poland and this...this...I just wanted to mention it because this was something happening and we were talking about this in the family. </sentence><sentence id="94">And so coming back to 1935 when my father lost his job, we...my mother had a very close knit family. </sentence><sentence id="95">And, as I mentioned before, they were upper middle class, and they were six children, two brothers and four sisters. </sentence><sentence id="96">One sister, as a young girl, got married and

the younger brother...his name was Soloman, was a dentist who didn't practice dentistry but opened a...a business...uh...dental supplies for dentists and mechanics....and dental mechanics. </sentence><sentence id="101">When it happened, the whole family got together. </sentence><sentence id="102">It was like a family council and they decided that my father has to get to himself together and buy himself a pharmacy. </sentence><sentence id="103">He couldn't buy a pharmacy in Vilno, but they found for him a pharmacy in a small town called Soley, but then a very tragic thing occurred. </sentence><sentence id="104">They didn't want to sell a pharmacy to a Jewish pharmacist. </sentence><sentence id="105">So imagine a pharmacist, a Christian of Polish persuasion  had to be found, a sum of money collected by the family had to given to him and his name the pharmacy was bought. </sentence><sentence id="106">This happened in 1938. </sentence><sentence id="107">And my...my...actually my family split because my mother and my sister had to go to Soley and find an apartment near the pharmacy for my father and we stayed in Poland because my...we were going to school, and my mother was practicing in Vilno. </sentence><sentence id="108">And this was the time that the very tragic event occurred. </sentence><sentence id="109">My mother got sick. </sentence><sentence id="110">My mother

because after 6 months she went into remission and she even started to practice because her patients were so dedicated to her that they...we had to take off the bell from the door because everybody

let them die. </sentence><sentence id="1270">I have to tell you now about something that happened in Dinnerworker which is really remarkable. </sentence><sentence id="1271">We had guards all over. </sentence><sentence id="1272">One of the guards was a younger German, and each and every room had...had a Jewish woman that was in charge. </sentence><sentence id="1273">And in one of the

was taken in a truck and this man...this guard knew that she was taken to be shot. </sentence><sentence id="1289">When he saw her being taken away, he shot himself. </sentence><sentence id="1290">So this was one the remarkable story. </sentence><sentence id="1291">We stayed in Dinnerworker til one day...one day I think it was already in 1944, they told...they all loaded us into a big boat, and they took us across the Baltic Sea. </sentence><sentence id="1292">It was near Danzig, in East Russia, and when we came to a place, this was some kind of a port. </sentence><sentence id="1293">After a

was full with black water, many times cold with turnips half cooked. </sentence><sentence id="1302">And they...this was our...this was what they will give us to eat, and after they finished the...the women guards would finish to distribute this meager rations. </sentence><sentence id="1303">Since we were so hungry, we used to crawl with the head to...to scrap some food on the bottom, and the German used to stand and laugh. </sentence><sentence id="1304">We were surrounded with...uh...electric wire and with so many men and women just fall on the electric wires. </sentence><sentence id="1305">I saw it. </sentence><sentence id="1306">They committed suicide. </sentence><sentence id="1307">Men they separated from you. </sentence><sentence id="1308">We saw there Hungarian women. </sentence><sentence id="1309">We saw there that were brought because it was already 44, we saw the...we saw the...we saw all kinds of nationalities...Jewish nationalities. </sentence><sentence id="1310">And those German guards were so bad, so sadistic, so cruel that I just don't have the words to describe. </sentence><sentence id="1311">One day they called us out...they put us...it was cold...in appell. </sentence><sentence id="1312">We had to stand up, and they said that young women will be taken to a labor camp. </sentence><sentence id="1313">My sister then was...was in big

that I cannot...because my mind already said goodbye to her. </sentence><sentence id="1317">And also the first time in Stutthof, I saw those stripes because those striped uniform and we very anxious to get them because we were very cold. </sentence><sentence id="1318">We didn't...we had very thin dresses. </sentence><sentence id="1319">We didn't have shoes. </sentence><sentence id="1320">My legs were frostbitten, and those uniforms were kind...but they...they didn't give us at this time. </sentence><sentence id="1321">And really at the strangest sound they would help us to fight the cold.
