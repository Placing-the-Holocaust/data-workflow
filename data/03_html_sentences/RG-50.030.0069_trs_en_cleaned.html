cousin...my mother's...my mother's sister...the  one who was killed had three children been left, and my mother was trying to take care on them also. </sentence><sentence id="129">Uh...Then...uh...[ remember my...that Polish policeman came one evening and he said that they're going to close the ghetto. </sentence><sentence id="130">They're going to send all the Jews away and to the concentration

</sentence><sentence id="132">And...uh...my mother would not come by herself because ...uh...she said she wanted to take me and also the other...uh...my cousin...my cousins who were in there. </sentence><sentence id="133">And he would not agree. </sentence><sentence id="134">The only he agree finally is to take me. </sentence><sentence id="135">So she didn't have a choice.

them in. </sentence><sentence id="143">And we been sitting in back and crying but he wouldn't let them in because it was too dangerous for him also to keep any Jews. </sentence><sentence id="144">If they would've caught him, they would've killed him and all his family. </sentence><sentence id="145">The reason why he decided, I understand, to keep us is because...uh...he was sick and he had cancer and he knew he is going to die soon and he wanted to do something good before he died. </sentence><sentence id="146">He said he did so many bad things already and he...he was religious Catholic, Polish. </sentence><sentence id="147">And he knew my family and he must have liked my mother and he...uh...decided to save us though his family, his wife and his children didn't...was...was against
