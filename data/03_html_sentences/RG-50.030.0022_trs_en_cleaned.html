God, you know, because we learned you know. </sentence><sentence id="255">That's the way we brought us up. </sentence><sentence id="256">And questioning God present creator, the -- real believer if he questions something you know, the existence of God -- he shouldn't. </sentence><sentence id="257"> I was, I remember when I was in this camp, and one afternoon, the Kommandant came and said to us -- we were about 20, 2,500 people in this camp -- he said to us, he said, "Any, any of you wants to turn into Christian faith you can do so. </sentence><sentence id="258">You have to go to the church and, and kneel down, and, and, and become Christian. </sentence><sentence id="259">Then you can save your save your life." </sentence><sentence id="260">So you know a drowning man can, he can try to lift with, try to lift up himself with a razor blade, you know, from the water -- you know, to save himself. </sentence><sentence id="261">And 99 percent of the Jews in this camp, they went to church and I myself I've never been a religious man even though my grandfather was very religious, was a Talmud khakhem." </sentence><sentence id="262">And my mother used to have a sheitl -- and all her sisters. </sentence><sentence id="263">I've never been religious, but I just couldn't go to kneel down in, in the church. </sentence><sentence id="264">I don't know. </sentence><sentence id="265">I just -- I said I'd rather die, you know. </sentence><sentence id="266">I remember when these boys came back you, know, from church, they felt Christians. </sentence><sentence id="267">And they were goose-stepping like Christian boys, you know. </sentence><sentence id="268">They had their, their, their face was shined, you know, up. </sentence><sentence id="269">And I --- then I feeled -- felt sorry for God. </sentence><sentence id="270">I was sorry for them. </sentence><sentence id="271">They thought they were delivered from the winds of war to survive. </sentence><sentence id="272">They all died. </sentence><sentence id="273">They all died. </sentence><sentence id="274">Didn't help them, but they thought that it will help them because they turned to the Christian faith. </sentence><sentence id="275">Nothing could have helped them. </sentence><sentence id="276">Even they were their great grandfather was Jewish, they were, they were good as good as the rest. </sentence><sentence id="277">So and later on matter of fact, that was after -- I was just going back to these episodes -- that when I went to, I went to Israel in 1976, and I went to the Yad Vashem and I passed a monument in the middle of the Yad Vashem and was written that anybody didn't left his faith under duress, you know, is holy something, you know. </sentence><sentence id="278">So I said, "What is it talking about?" </sentence><sentence id="279">So I went back. </sentence><sentence id="280">I read it again, you know, went back. </sentence><sentence id="281">I, I read it so it was, then I felt good about myself you know that, not because what's a different Christian and the Jews, you know, how they come from the same, they're all Semites you know, the same thing as Jesus Christ was a rabbi himself and I'm sure he'd teach his followers to obeyed his teachings, and every time they didn't listen to him, so such a beautiful words -- "Thy, our Father, which are in heaven, hallowed be thy name, thy kingdom comes, thy will be done on earth as it is in heaven." </sentence><sentence id="282">These beautiful words, they should listen and they should teach their children to honor their savior, the Jesus Christ. </sentence><sentence id="283">They should listen, they should listen and the Christian clergy, they were teaching hatred against us. </sentence><sentence id="284">Why?Many times we asking why they hate us so much. </sentence><sentence id="285">And they -- how many times we try to shake their hands, even in the darkest nights, to be our friends and neighbors. </sentence><sentence id="286">They'd always, they'd always denied their friendship to us and as always blamed their Christian clergy because they are the ones, they are the one, they are, they teach their the, the children of the Christian faith to be antisemitic . </sentence><sentence id="287">They always did, and it's -- and evidently it's didn't stop yet. </sentence><sentence id="288"> So when I was in this camp when we went to Budapest. </sentence><sentence id="289">And we worked for the war effort, as a furrier and tailors worked for the different things for, for the government. </sentence><sentence id="290">And how many times we used to get the, the air raids and the, the bombs used to explode, you know, in height in heights and it was saturated bombing. </sentence><sentence id="291">How many times 30, 40 feet from me bombs used to explode and here I am to tell you my story. </sentence><sentence id="292">And then I without a scratch, didn't hit me. </sentence><sentence id="293">In this camp, one time, it was September 1944, when the underground organization in Budapest approached us, few of us, and asked us if we wanted to join the underground fighters. </sentence><sentence id="294">I said, "Yes, of course," I said. </sentence><sentence id="295">So they told us, "Look, you -- sooner or later they're going to kill you. </sentence><sentence id="296">It's just a matter of time." </sentence><sentence id="297">They said, "Why don't you just die with your gun in your hand rather than wait for it, wait till they shoot you." </sentence><sentence id="298">So two, 300 of us joined the -- said, "yes." </sentence><sentence id="299">At a certain time because it was always dark in the night, you know. </sentence><sentence id="300">It was no light was allowed during wartime. </sentence><sentence id="301">Otherwise the airplanes coming for surveillance or bombing, they could pinpoint the area easier. </sentence><sentence id="302">So, it had to be always dark, darkness. </sentence><sentence id="303">So on a certain date we dug under the fence in our compound and during the night we slipped out under the other side of the fence, and they were waiting for us with pistols. </sentence><sentence id="304">And they used to -- they gave us a pistol and a couple of rounds, couple of magazines of bullets, rounds. </sentence><sentence id="305">And they told us that anybody wants to ask for identification, shoot them right away. </sentence><sentence id="306">Had to shoot them, otherwise they'd shoot you. </sentence><sentence id="307">Because as a Jew -- they what they did is, when they asked for identification from you, and they wasn't satisfied with it, they used to take you under the door, and you had to show your penis. </sentence><sentence id="308">It was only Jews, they were they were circumcised in Europe. </sentence><sentence id="309">So if they showed, they show you your penis they'll shoot you right on the spot, so we had to shoot them. </sentence><sentence id="310">That was an order, to shoot them. </sentence><sentence id="311">And again we got into the this safe houses, you know, when the this underground fighters they gave us directions you know which way to go and how to get there. </sentence><sentence id="312">We were a little familiar with the area. </sentence><sentence id="313">We got there so the our command--- the commandant, you know, the commandant, he was he was he was 22 years old you know, but he spoke fluent German so he was questioning us, you know, if he want to be sure you know, we're Jew, we're Jewish. </sentence><sentence id="314">And we had to show him our penis, you know, we are Jewish. </sentence><sentence id="315">In a couple of days he was crash training -- how to use small arms, fire arms and machine guns and grenades, how to throw effectively and in after two days we went to our first job. </sentence><sentence id="316">So there were about 15 of us. </sentence><sentence id="317">So I asked him, where we asked the lieutenant -- we used to call him lieutenant, he was 22 years. </sentence><sentence id="318">His name was Laci, Leslie you know in English. </sentence><sentence id="319">So he said, "You'll find out where we're going. </sentence><sentence id="320">So, first we had to steal a truck." </sentence><sentence id="321">A couple of boys knew how to drive, so they saw a truck and we used to follow each other about 50 feet, you know, not to be suspicious you know during the -- it was dark, very dark. </sentence><sentence id="322">So they find the truck. </sentence><sentence id="323">They put the, cross the wires, and off we went outskirts to Budapest, because Budapest is two -- the River Danube divides it. </sentence><sentence id="324">One side is Pest. </sentence><sentence id="325">One side is Buda. </sentence><sentence id="326">So, that's why they call it "Budapest." </sentence><sentence id="327">So, we went to Buda, the other side of the river. </sentence><sentence id="328">So, finally we had a discussion that says we're going into this ammunition dump,  but it was circled and was pro-protected with the Hungarian patrol. </sentence><sentence id="329">So, he went there by himself alone. </sentence><sentence id="330">He was dressed as a Hungarian officer uniform. </sentence><sentence id="331">He spoke fluent German and Hungarian, of course. </sentence><sentence id="332">He was asking for the -- he was asking direction. </sentence><sentence id="333">So, we park that truck, you know, for a short distance from this ammunition dump. </sentence><sentence id="334">Two guys, both side, two, always two of us one side and two on the other side. </sentence><sentence id="335">Two patrols. </sentence><sentence id="336">We grabbed the patrol. </sentence><sentence id="337">We was told what to do you know before. </sentence><sentence id="338">Close his mouth with the bayonet, you know. </sentence><sentence id="339">We had to stab him that many times and this has to be repeated about two, three times before we got into the ammunition factory, dump, dump site. </sentence><sentence id="340">So there we gathered all we could -- the most important thing was mine -- to get mines to -- because our purpose was to delay their supplies and sabotage their trains, you know, the supply. </sentence><sentence id="341">So we got as many, much heavy machine guns can and grenades and mines, as much as we could carry, you know, 15 people. </sentence><sentence id="342">And we loaded the truck -- we loaded -- got the truck loaded and about two sappers stayed behind to, you know what a sapper is. </sentence><sentence id="343">They put four, five different places but mines in into the ammunition dump in a few minutes. </sentence><sentence id="344">Didn't go more than 500 yards. </sentence><sentence id="345">We saw the like a fires -- what do you call it -- blaze, you know. </sentence><sentence id="346">It was like we destroyed the ammunition dump you know, when it were up. </sentence><sentence id="347">They were searching for us all over you know. </sentence><sentence id="348">And they were going to spy, disperse the personnel, you know. </sentence><sentence id="349">They had to hide. </sentence><sentence id="350">The mine was the most important thing we have to go in during the evening at night to mine the railroads and bridges. </sentence><sentence id="351">So, but they start to repairing it you know, the faster and faster, the because they had no more men than we were, you know, the army, you know, the Hungarian army and German collaborators. </sentence><sentence id="352">So it was, it was -- I remember the date -- was it September, September 1944, and Horthy,(r) I told you that Horthy Miklos -- he was chancellor already in Hungary, and this visit came out from Hungary on a false pretense and this Jew-hater Szalasi, he took over the reign, and he was a well-known Jew-hater. </sentence><sentence id="353">He was worse than Horthy Mikles, but when he spirited Horthy Mikles out they called him he was he was a Jewish collaborator already, Horthy Mikles. </sentence><sentence id="354">Besides they call him anything else. </sentence><sentence id="355">So in March, in September seven -- 17, we heard on the radio that they going to make a big parade, when they took over the reign from Horthy, on Vilmos csaszar street in Hungary. </sentence><sentence id="356">So we had the order from the American and British intelligence, because we worked for them because that's the underground fighter -- they told us that we actually worked for the British-American intelligence. </sentence><sentence id="357">And we got our reward -- they will reward us you know after the -- after we do a good jo-- good job. </sentence><sentence id="358">Who cares what they going to reward us? </sentence><sentence id="359">What they going to do?But nevertheless, about 200 of us waited for the columns of the parade on Vilmos csaszar  0 street. </sentence><sentence id="360">We, the night before we placed heavy machine gun and all kind of fire equipment, you know, with submachine gun and grenades and you name it. </sentence><sentence id="361">We had it. </sentence><sentence id="362">Pistols, were 200 of us. </sentence><sentence id="363">Two hundred people, you know, could do a lot of lot of damage. </sentence><sentence id="364">I remember the waiting in the windows and from the cellars, wherever we were stationed. </sentence><sentence id="365">And we heard the column. </sentence><sentence id="366">The column was coming and saw the cheering of the Christians well wishers, you know, with the fascist flags. </sentence><sentence id="367">They were waving fascist flags and, and sitting on -- they have trucks and spick-and-span uniforms, you know, the people who go on the parade. " </sentence><sentence id="368">Give them, give them three cheers," you know. " </sentence><sentence id="369">Salute." </sentence><sentence id="370">And then we gave them the three cheers from our guns. </sentence><sentence id="371">And 300, 200 angry Jews, they can do a lot of dam --do a lot of damage for them. </sentence><sentence id="372">We figured that if we do lot of damage you know for the Szalasi regime, then some of the Budapest population might join us you know, to and fight for to end the war, you know. </sentence><sentence id="373">But no. </sentence><sentence id="374">It didn't happen didn't happen that way at all, and our and our job was to sabotage the railroads again, again, again, but they were, like I said, they were fixing them up and faster and faster. </sentence><sentence id="375">And we became the spies personnel you know. </sentence><sentence id="376">They were looking for us all, all the time. </sentence><sentence id="377">And -- but luckily the areas you know, during the day, everybody was running for shelters, you know. </sentence><sentence id="378">They didn't have a chance. </sentence><sentence id="379">They didn't look for us so much, but nevertheless we -- our unit as a underground fighter became obsolete in Budapest. </sentence><sentence id="380">We was, just couldn't do much. </sentence><sentence id="381">We, I didn't say, I tell you about, we saw so many times that this Fascist used to come in, used to bring, gather the Jews, used to catch them on the street or in the ghettos in Budapest. </sentence><sentence id="382">Used to bring them, just hundreds of hundreds. </sentence><sentence id="383">Used to line them up aside of the River Danube. </sentence><sentence id="384">Used to just machine gun them down, with babies and children, and anybody didn't fall, they just used to kick them right into the river. </sentence><sentence id="385">And only a few Christian on-lookers, and helpers. </sentence><sentence id="386">And it happened so many times, so many times. </sentence><sentence id="387">And nobody helped. </sentence><sentence id="388">No thundering and no lightening from above. </sentence></p></dialogue>
