<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="482">Q: Can you tell me about the narrow escapes? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="484">A: Well, the narrowest escape I had was, uh, we had a contact in the head of the, the underground in Friesland. </sentence><sentence id="485">He was the big boss in Friesland, and I...he was...he was a very good friend of mine. </sentence><sentence id="486">My, my son is still called, is named after him, and he, uh...suddenly there was a very, uh, uh, someone was caught and he was, he was talking, and he knew too much. </sentence><sentence id="487">So the whole group in Friesland had to, to hide and had to change addresses and go out of Friesland because at first in fact, he knew everything, the man, and he, he betrayed the whole thing, so, so he went to, to Amersfoort, which is near Utrecht, and he let me know that he was there and he asked me to come. </sentence><sentence id="488">And I had an appointment with him in Amersfoort,  on the street not in a house. </sentence><sentence id="489">And he said, "Well, would you, I, I need a new persoonbewijs, identity card." </sentence><sentence id="490">And he gave me his photo and he said, "Uh, please take care of it, and give me a very good one." </sentence><sentence id="491">And of course we had our contacts in Amsterdam, people who were printing...who had original identity cards, but only for the top people in the Resistance. </sentence><sentence id="492">So I went there and I, I made his, uh...I got his new identity card, and I had, uh, a rendezvous with him at six o'clock on a certain day in, uh, in Amersfoort. </sentence><sentence id="493">Only, only on a address, but I was very, uh, upset about it because it was so...he was...he was the most man the Germans looked for in the whole country. </sentence><sentence id="494">So I had to be very careful. </sentence><sentence id="495">And I asked the girls whom I lived with at the time, "Go with me and and take the identity card, because if I'm caught with that"...I could have been caught just as, as a twenty-year old boy. </sentence><sentence id="496">That had nothing to do with my...and then I would have...then there would have been the possibility that the identity card would be lost and I would be sent to a concentration camp or something, but that was not the question. </sentence><sentence id="497">The question was I wanted him to have that identity card and I, I had the feeling that it was very dangerous, so I said to her, "Take...you go with me and let's go together, and you, you carry the, the identity card." </sentence><sentence id="498">And just before the station, she broke the shoe...the, the, the lace of her shoe, and I was mad. </sentence><sentence id="499">And we missed the train because of that. </sentence><sentence id="500">Now what happened actually in Amersfoort was that at one o'clock the whole house was, uh, complete...completely circled...uh, how do you call it?... </sentence><sentence id="501">circled...by, by very, uh, well-armed German troops because he was so...that important, and, uh, they, they, they, uh, they rang the bell and they said he got...and the man who, who, who did it said, "I have a message from Esme," which is one of the... which was a good way to, to, to go into the house. </sentence><sentence id="502">Because he didn't suspect anything at that moment. </sentence><sentence id="503">At that moment he, he came in and, uh, two minutes later he knew he was trapped. </sentence><sentence id="504">So he took...he tried to take his revolver and, uh.... </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="526">Q: What happened when he approached the house? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="528">A: When he approached the house he was let in and after two minutes, uh, Krijn, which was his name--Krijn van den Helm, realized that he was trapped and he tried to, to, to...he had this revolver in back the of his trousers and he, and he reached for it and he got it on the wrong...the wrong side and the man who was sitting in front of him shot him [NB: Krijn] dead immediately. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="530">Q: In other words, who shot who? </sentence><sentence id="531">Just to clarify the situation with the two people involved? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="534">Who was shot and who had the revolver? </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="535">A: Yeah. </sentence><sentence id="536">But the the the strange thing is that normally when, when things like that happened, the Germans stayed at the house for twenty-four hours at least, to see what, what people came and they were caught there. </sentence><sentence id="537">That, that happened all the time. </sentence><sentence id="538">That was the biggest risk you had, that you walked to an address where the Germans had arrested someone, where they were still staying to look who was, who was coming. </sentence><sentence id="539">Now the funny...you know, the funny...the strange thing is, that they left at six o'clock and I arrived at, let's say, seven because of the fact that I had missed my train, and then when I, when I, uh, rang the doorbell, she said, "Get out!" </sentence><sentence id="540">so I knew the whole thing was wrong. </sentence><sentence id="541">Well, that, that was just a lucky  escape and, and you know, you never know how, why...if it hadn't been the lace of the shoe, I wouldn't have survived. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="549">Q: You mentioned there was another narrow escape. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="551">A: The other narrow escape was with my partner who was, uh, caught at the station with all kinds of identity cards and, uh, and, uh, material which was absolutely very dangerous, but he was just caught as I tell you as a, as man, a boy of thirty years, twenty years, to be sent to to Germany for work. </sentence><sentence id="552">But we didn't know if they had discovered all, all the material, so then the same man from from Friesland, Krijn van den Helm, where I was just talking about...that was before he was killed... called him and said, What are we going to do? </sentence><sentence id="553">He's in...my partner Wouter's in jail and I'm afraid. </sentence><sentence id="554">I don't know what he had, what he had with him." </sentence><sentence id="555">And he [NB: Krijn] came immediately to Amsterdam, and he went to the university. </sentence><sentence id="556">And by time in "43 the Germans had a very strange law. </sentence><sentence id="557">All the students had to, uh, sign a loyal, uh, statement that they would be loyal to the German occu...occupation and German people or something like that, which was completely idiotic, because it was, it was a forced statement. </sentence><sentence id="558">But they they were very tough on that because they said, "If you don't sign it, either you can't study on, and your parents, especially your father, is responsible," and a lot of students signed because they didn't want their father to be responsible for, uh, what, what, what they did. </sentence><sentence id="559">It didn't occur to us because we were not studying anymore in "43, so there were, uh, there were student cards of of people who had signed and I went with the...with Krijn van Helm to the university, and he went to the office where they they gave away this...where they had the, uh, this, this...what do you call it?...college identification card, and he threatened him that he would kill him if he didn't give him a book of these, uh, identity cards, and he gave them. </sentence><sentence id="560">He immediately gave them. </sentence><sentence id="561">So what we did, we, uh, put a photo of my partner on it. </sentence><sentence id="562">It was signed in his name, and his sister went to the jail and he was immediately freed. </sentence><sentence id="563">So that was a narrow escape, not for me personally but anyway for the whole group. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="577">Q: But in "43, the situation for Jews...there were no Jews at the university then, were there? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="579">A: No, no, no, no. </sentence><sentence id="580">No Jews at the university. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="583">Q: Why did you decide to get involved with the movement to begin with? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="585">A: You don't decide that. </sentence><sentence id="586">It happens. </sentence><sentence id="587">It happens. </sentence><sentence id="588">I think for me, uh, sheer honesty,...it was when, when my friend was, uh, called home and disappeared forever, and then you say, "What are you doing here? </sentence><sentence id="589">You are studying law. </sentence><sentence id="590">This is ridiculous. </sentence><sentence id="591">There are so many other things which are much more important." </sentence><sentence id="592">I think that was the turning point for me. </sentence><sentence id="593">And then, then it goes on. </sentence><sentence id="594">Don't forget, we saw razzias in, in Amsterdam. </sentence><sentence id="595">It's a terrible sight. </sentence><sentence id="596">I mean it's unbelievable. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="609">Q: Can you describe one? </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="610">A: Yes. </sentence><sentence id="611">It, it's...a whole block of houses is, is, is cut off by, by, by police and and army and they are going from every house, looking for everyone. </sentence><sentence id="612">Everyone has to, to...had, had a persoonbewijs, and all Jews had a persoonbewijs with a J on it, so if you had not a persoonbewijs without a J, or if you had no persoonbewijs, you are taken, uh, with them, but they, they went from one house to the other. </sentence><sentence id="613">They didn't have the, the, the addresses of the Jewish people themselves. </sentence><sentence id="614">No, they...that was the typical way they operated. </sentence><sentence id="615">They took a whole block and looked for the Jews...in it. </sentence><sentence id="616">And, and then they brought them out, with children and everything. </sentence><sentence id="617">It was a terrible thing to see. </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="618">Q: Do you know why there was no list? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="620">A: There was a list. </sentence><sentence id="621">They, they they operated different. </sentence><sentence id="622">Sometimes..but a real razzia, in my opinion, is a, uh, search of all the houses, and not on a certain address. </sentence><sentence id="623">Of course, they they, they, they, uh, took, uh, Jews from addresses, but that was individually. </sentence><sentence id="624">They went to a house with three or four people, and they... and they rang the door, and they saw they were at home and then they took them. </sentence><sentence id="625">But that's not the same as a razzia. </sentence><sentence id="626">A razzia is...they wanted to, to, to...because there were a lot of people already hiding in, in, in, in the houses, so they, they found that too, of course. </sentence><sentence id="627">If you had no identification, no persoonbewijs, they took you. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="636">Q: When you would watch a razzia occurring, what would happen to the people that they would bring out of the homes? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="638">A: They, they, they, they were brought together and, and they went with them in, in army cars to the station. </sentence><sentence id="639">And mostly they were taken immediately from the station to Westerbork. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="642">Q: Did you see... were there torturings during the razzias? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="644">A: No. </sentence><sentence id="645">I, I don't think they were tortured at that moment. </sentence><sentence id="646">And unfortunately it's not only the Germans. </sentence><sentence id="647">The Dutch people, the Dutch police helped too. </sentence><sentence id="648">It's unbelievable--but they did. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="654">Q: The Dutch police helped who...?? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="656">A: The Germans. </sentence><sentence id="657">They, they did it together with the Germans, part of the police--not all. </sentence><sentence id="658">There are, of course, people who refused to do that. </sentence><sentence id="659">But part of them--they did it. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="692">Q: Is there one or two, or even several incidents that stick out in your mind the most, about one of the children, or of your experiences helping the children? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="694">A: There was one experience which I'll never forget in my life. </sentence><sentence id="695">That I, I went to, to Joure which is a small town in Friesland. </sentence><sentence id="696">It was in the beginning. </sentence><sentence id="697">It was...and there was a man with a laundry, and I heard that the man had a lot of addresses for adults, but for children too. </sentence><sentence id="698">And he went...every Saturday he went to, to Amsterdam with a, with a truck and he came back in Joure with, let's say, twenty or thirty adults. </sentence><sentence id="699">And he hided them in different places, so I knew, and I wanted to talk to him, that he would give us addresses for children too. </sentence><sentence id="700">So I went with with one of the girls to, to Joure and we had two children with us which we wanted to hide, and he had agreed to, to, to, to help us, and okay...we arrived and we gave the children to him and he looked after them, but as it was already late, we couldn't go back to, to Amsterdam. </sentence><sentence id="701">It was...after twelve you're not allowed to, to be on the streets, so we couldn't make it with the train. </sentence><sentence id="702">So we had to stay there, so we got...we stayed there and we got a very decent meal. </sentence><sentence id="703">For us it was very important to get "heel" [NB: Dutch word for "very"] good food, and he was very nice. </sentence><sentence id="704">After...after... dinner, I sat with him and we talked and then he suddenly said, "Yes." </sentence><sentence id="705">He told me that he hated the Jews on religious ground. </sentence><sentence id="706">They had killed Christians and by his faith, the Jews were his enemies. </sentence><sentence id="707">But, it is stated in the Bible, "You have to love your enemies." </sentence><sentence id="708">So that's why he did everything to save them. </sentence><sentence id="709">Now if I am telling it just now...it looks like a wierd story but at that moment it was a terrible story because I didn't know. </sentence><sentence id="710">I wondered what he was doing...if he was betraying...a traitor and sending all the the adults to the Germans and the children too. </sentence><sentence id="711">I was absolutely frightened. </sentence><sentence id="712">I didn't sleep the whole night and neither did the girl. </sentence><sentence id="713">And we got out as soon as possible, and we went to, to, to the head of the resistance in Friesland, to Leeuwarden. </sentence><sentence id="714">And we said, My God, what do you know? </sentence><sentence id="715">Do you know that man? </sentence><sentence id="716">Is he all right?" </sentence><sentence id="717">We informed him. </sentence><sentence id="718">And it turned out finally he was all right, and after the war I, I spoke to him. </sentence><sentence id="719">I said, "Do you 8 Famine or "hongersnood." </sentence><sentence id="720"> remember what you said to me? </sentence><sentence id="721">You have scared the hell out of me because of, of what?" </sentence><sentence id="722">And he meant it. </sentence><sentence id="723">He meant it, absolutely! </sentence><sentence id="724">He said, "Yes, but I, I...." Afterwards, he said, "I changed completely. </sentence><sentence id="725">I watched these Jews, the whole, uh, during the whole war and they are just like us, and I completely...it was a completely wrong belief." </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="759">Q: Did the women travel with you on the same train? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="761">A: Yeah. </sentence><sentence id="762">If we were...sometimes I was going alone or if I...1f we were with children, then the girl...the girl and I always together. </sentence><sentence id="763">There was no problem about that. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="767">Q: Did you also help secure false documentation for the children? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="769">A: Yes. </sentence><sentence id="770">Well...no. </sentence><sentence id="771">No, nay. </sentence><sentence id="772">That's not right, I think. </sentence><sentence id="773">The children didn't get any identification because the children were hidden. </sentence><sentence id="774">They don't...didn't need, uh, identification. </sentence><sentence id="775">Some of them, however, got them. </sentence><sentence id="776">I remember a case of a baby which was just born and one of my girls went to, to, to the registration office and told the officer that she had had a child and, uh, so the child was actually saved. </sentence><sentence id="777">He had an official non-Jewish mother and the name of the mother, so we didn't have to hide the child. </sentence><sentence id="778">We, we sent it to, to a family where she was brought up and she survived. </sentence><sentence id="779">So that happened. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="791">Q: Then what happened to the child? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="793">A: That's a very strange story because the girl who had adopted her or, or recognized it as, it as her as her son was one...was visiting the, the parents every...every month to give all kinds of things: coupons, uh, bread coupons, meat coupons... </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="795">Q: This was the child's natural mother visited the foster parents? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="797">A: Yes. </sentence><sentence id="798">Yeah. </sentence><sentence id="799">The, the foster parents. </sentence><sentence id="800">And one day when she was there, the, the Gestapo, they came in, and there was another Jewish, uh, boy living there with the parents and, uh, well, uh, the, the Jewish boy was taken and the parents were taken and she said, "It's my child." </sentence><sentence id="801">She would prove it was her child, so they didn't take the child. </sentence><sentence id="802">And the, the, the, the Gestapo said, "How can...how can you put your child with such a terrible, bad family who hides Jews and things like this?" </sentence><sentence id="803">She says, "I didn't know." </sentence><sentence id="804">So she took the, the boy with her, and the boy survived. </sentence><sentence id="805">Funny thing is that after the war, it took her two years to get rid of the child. </sentence><sentence id="806">The, the, the legal, uh, the courts didn't believe it. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="817">Q: Would you visit the children at all once they were placed? </sentence></p></dialogue>
