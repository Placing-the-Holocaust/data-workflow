<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="33">Q: What was your childhood, your early, very early childhood like before the Nazis? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="35">A: I have a very very few recollections of my early childhood. </sentence><sentence id="36">Actually I uh just remember flashbacks of my father who was...uh started to go away in 1939 and kept being drafted in forced labor camps and uh he begin...he began to disappear for three to six months and then it became longer and longer. </sentence><sentence id="37">When they would draft him, it would take eight, nine months before he would return and then one time he was away for ten months, and finally in 1942, that was the last time he was drafted and he never came back. </sentence><sentence id="38">And uh remembering my mother who was a very bright woman and was able to take over and be the head of the family...I don't mean just the nuclear family but head of the extended family. </sentence><sentence id="39">In fact she was instrumental saving my grandmother and myself and a lot of my cousins during uh the war and the Nazi occupation. </sentence><sentence id="40">I remember that the whole family used to gather at my house and we used to have Friday night and Saturday night dinners at my house and uh maybe because my grandmother was living with us, that so...we were the gathering place for the whole family, and that's what happened. </sentence><sentence id="41">That's what I remember. </sentence><sentence id="42">I have pretty good memories of trips. </sentence><sentence id="43">We used to have a lake, Lake . </sentence><sentence id="44"> uncomplicated, very nice life before my father left in 1942. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="55">Q: What do you remember about uh school, playmates, friends during that period? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="57">A: Actually I don't remember an awful lot. </sentence><sentence id="58">1 remember that about 1940 we used to have quite an elegant apartment in the middle of the city and I remember that the Nazi party decided to have their headquarters there, and uh we were evicted from the apartment and we had a hard time finding another apartment being Jews and finally we found a less elegant but an OK apartment uh in a in another part of the city and I remember asking my mother to take the walls with us because I really was very happy in that particular apartment, but we were evicted and we moved into a much smaller apartment and uh we were there until uh the Nazis occupied Hungary. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="61">Q: OK. </sentence><sentence id="62">Tell us, if you would, you started talked about 1940. </sentence><sentence id="63">So let's go on. </sentence><sentence id="64">Let's...tell me, as the war broke out indeed, uh in addition to the move, what happened to you, to your family? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="69">A: Well, in uh...as I remember and the dates may escape me...as I remember 1944 when all our troubles... </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="71">Q: Let's let's back up a bit. </sentence><sentence id="72">Let's stick with, if we could...I don't want to jump to 1944 just yet. </sentence><sentence id="73">Let's let's talk a little about 1940, "41, and "42...the the early years. </sentence><sentence id="74">What, what was your life like? </sentence><sentence id="75">What did you as a child do to 2  and my cousins being only children, the families really could not, did not feel comfortable having more children because they could see the handwriting on the wall, and my mother herself decided to have an abortion. </sentence><sentence id="76">She told me that later, because she just couldn't bring another Jewish child to this world, our crazy mixed-up world as it was. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="83">But the early years as far as I was concerned were pleasant and they were alright. </sentence><sentence id="84">The difficulties started when we had to start wearing the yellow star. </sentence><sentence id="85">That really, my self- esteem just plummeted and that was a very difficult period when a big yellow star was on a young child with uh the inscription of Jude, which meant I guess in German, Jewish. </sentence><sentence id="86">And then that was already beginning of being marked as being different and less...oh what's the word I want to use...maybe not quite as competent as the other children were. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="91">Q: Go on and tell us about that. </sentence><sentence id="92">Tell us more about those years as things now began to be very difficult. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="95">A: Yeah. </sentence><sentence id="96">Things are begi...began to unfold at this point. </sentence><sentence id="97">We started to wear the Jewish star and we also had to be at the apartment at a certain time. </sentence><sentence id="98">There was a curfew, but we still were able to go out and go shopping and buy food with uh the Jewish star on. </sentence><sentence id="99">We had to wear the Jewish star all the time whenever we left the apartment. </sentence><sentence id="100">It was sewn on our clothing, and we were marked as being different from the mainstream and psychologically I'm sure I really suffered from this distinction. </sentence><sentence id="101">And then afterwards uh we were told we had to leave our second apartment because we had to move to a house which was designated for Jews, and of course we left all our furniture at the apartment and just took a few belongings and moved over to a house which was designated to be a Jewish house where Jews could live at that point. </sentence><sentence id="102">And uh we moved in with a sister of my father's, my paternal aunt. </sentence><sentence id="103">There was my grandfather, my aunt and her two children in one room, and my grandmother and my mother and I in another room. </sentence><sentence id="104">It was a two room apartment, and we had to...we were there for a few months. </sentence><sentence id="105">I really can't remember how many months it was, but we were there for a few months and that's when things were starting to really get bad for us. </sentence><sentence id="106">First of all, we had very little food. </sentence><sentence id="107">When uh there were a lot of air raids we had to rush down to the cellar. </sentence><sentence id="108">At times we just didn't even bother to go. </sentence><sentence id="109">My mother says if we have to go , we'll just go, and that's when things really  around, making sure that all the young women were downstairs and ready to go to camps, and my mother was covered up in the bed and I was with my mother and I lied to the soldier. </sentence><sentence id="110">I told the soldier that my mother was sick and she could not go anywhere and she couldn't move, and I told the soldier...as a child I learned survival skills very early on...I told the soldier I have a doctor's certificate. </sentence><sentence id="111">If you just wait a minute I will get the doctor's certificate for you. </sentence><sentence id="112">Six years old and uh...seven maybe. </sentence><sentence id="113">And uh what happened was that uh...there was no doctor's certificate of course...I kept looking and looking and opening drawers and started to really search for the doctor's certificate and the German soldier who could have been sixteen years as I was told, just left. </sentence><sentence id="114">He could have shot us. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="115">He could have forced my mother to go, but by the stroke of luck he just left so I was told that I saved my mother's life at that point, which was probably true. </sentence><sentence id="116">But I also lived with that the rest of my life...that I am able to save people. </sentence><sentence id="117">And uh after that there were more roundups of Jews and the janitor one time who was a Christian woman my mother befriended...befriended and of course she also kept happy with various pieces of jewelry, came up to the apartment to tell us that now you just have to go. </sentence><sentence id="118">This is it. </sentence><sentence id="119">Everybody's going to be taken to the camps, and you just have to disappear. </sentence><sentence id="120">Well, we didn't know what to do at this point and somehow or other...this is where Wallenberg comes into the picture. </sentence><sentence id="121">Somehow or other we gota __ they called. </sentence><sentence id="122">Somehow that afternoon my mother paid somebody off or somebody was willing to help. </sentence><sentence id="123">We got a to be able  ) arrived, but they did let us in and uh we made a little nitch in the corner somewhere and we went to sleep at that point. </sentence><sentence id="124">It was a very...it...l remem...I can't remember whether we were sleeping on mattresses or just on the floor but we were so tired and emotionally exhausted that it didn't matter. </sentence><sentence id="125">We had a safe, quote safe unquote place to put our heads down. </sentence><sentence id="126">Somehow my mother...we stayed there for could be a month to six weeks in this apartment, and it was pretty exciting because people were coming and going. </sentence><sentence id="127">We would listen to...play wegie (ph) boards of what's coming. </sentence><sentence id="128">We would listen to the the American broadcasts and uh somehow the rest of my family one by one found out that we were in the Swedish house, my mother and I, and my cousins kept coming and since my mother told them since she had the it belonged to the whole family, so she managed to  I was uh...my mother and my grandmother, myself were getting ready to go on this march which again as a child it seemed to me was endless. </sentence><sentence id="129">I was in charge of the photo albums, to carry them to the ghetto and my mother carried of course whatever she could and my grandmother could never carry anything. </sentence><sentence id="130">She had heart problems and she hardly could walk. </sentence><sentence id="131">During this march they were shouting and shooting at Jews and we would just step over corpses like it was nothing. </sentence><sentence id="132">We just were psychologically numb and we were just walking around, walking along and did what we were supposed to do and I I dropped a photo albums and that's why I have very few photographs left before the war era and uh my mother yelled at me not to stop and bend over and pick them up. </sentence><sentence id="133">I can, in my mind's eye I can still see those pictures all over the street, and uh I just had to leave them and march on. </sentence><sentence id="134">We were marching on for a little while, and then my grandmother said during the march...and this was really my most frightening experience in the war...my grandmother said she couldn't walk anymore, so the whole transport, the whole group had to stop. </sentence><sentence id="135">It was about two hundred people in this march, so everybody had to stop and the German soldiers came and told us that they're going to shoot my grandmother. </sentence><sentence id="136">She's too old. </sentence><sentence id="137">She can't can't march. </sentence><sentence id="138">They're just going to shoot her to death, and we should all go on, and my mother said she's not going to go. </sentence><sentence id="139">If they're going to shoot my grandmother, let her let them shoot us all and we're just not going to leave an old lady. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="140">But I remember the guns pointing at my grandmother and subsequently the guns pointing at me and my mother and they were ready to shoot us, but then my mother saw a child in a stroller and we were so so...we we hardly have had any food at this point so we were all so thin that uh she picked up my grandmother and put her in the stroller and took the child out of the stroller, put my grandmother in the stroller and we marched on. </sentence><sentence id="141">And we got away with it. </sentence><sentence id="142">So what happened, when we had to go to the ghetto my grandmother was wheeled in a stroller into the ghetto, and we all made it. </sentence><sentence id="143">But I I'll never forget that scene and I'm still very frightened of any kind of violence and any kinds of guns because of this experience. </sentence><sentence id="144">It's just... when a young child has a gun pointed at her...just something happens and one never gets over this experience. </sentence><sentence id="145">But anyway, we were able to march into the ghetto and everybody was able to...everybody survived at that point and uh we did march into the ghetto. </sentence><sentence id="146">Of course the circumstances were terrible. </sentence><sentence id="147">I had lice all over me, not just in my hair. </sentence><sentence id="148">Body lice. </sentence><sentence id="149">We couldn't bathe. </sentence><sentence id="150">We couldn't eat and we were in the ghetto for about two weeks before the Russians came in, and what I had heard about uh...the ghetto days are very hazy as far as I'm concerned because I kept fainting from the lack of food and my mother told me that I didn't have food for three, four days before the Russians came to liberate, so my recollection of the ghetto days are very hazy. </sentence><sentence id="151">I remember being in downstairs in a cellar sitting and not having any food and I remember other Jews eating chocolate while I was just starving and I had no food at all and nobody ever offered us some food, so it wasn't...it was survival of the fittest. </sentence><sentence id="152">It wasn't really let's all survive, at that point and again I think because of Wallenberg...the ghetto was undermined and we were going to be blown up at any minute, but I think because of Wallenberg we were saved and the Russians did...of course there were a lot of air raids and a lot of fighting, but we were so happy to hear the guns because we knew that liberation couldn't be too far off. </sentence><sentence id="153">And that's how I survived those years. </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="154">Q: Tell us, tell us what happened at liberation...what was it like and what did you and your family do? </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="155">A: What I remember of liberation...the Russian soldiers came into the bunker and uh somehow a few hours later there was some muddied soup which they gave to all the survivors. </sentence><sentence id="156">We got some food at last and little by little we were able to...I mean after being really singled out as Jews, able to be free and take our yellow stars off was just a very exhilarating, exciting and frightening moment at the same time. </sentence><sentence id="157">But little by little life got back. </sentence><sentence id="158">Of course we still didn't have food, but it was easier to obtain some foods later on and we were able to get back to our apartments and uh try to resume life, and life was very difficult after...between 1948..."45 and 1956. </sentence><sentence id="159">I lived under the Russian oppression for about ten years and again food was very scarce. </sentence><sentence id="160">It wasn't very fashionable to be Jews again and in fact I had to change...in order to obtain a job...college was out of the question for me because I came from a capitalistic society and uh it was really out of the question for me. </sentence><sentence id="161">I had to change my name. </sentence><sentence id="162">I did attend a Jewish high school, Jewish school and Jewish high school and uh I was singled out again as a Jew. </sentence><sentence id="163">I had to change my name from Grossman to , which was a Hungarian name so I wouldn't be  revolutionary years. </sentence><sentence id="164">My husband then was a college student in Hungary so he partook in some of the demonstrations and uh we decided after, when the Russians came back, we were best to escape Hungary. </sentence><sentence id="165">Of course by then we both were survivors. </sentence><sentence id="166">We knew how to survive, so we took a train to as close to the border as possible when we decided to leave and uh we stayed with some peasants near the border until we found a guide who could led us over the border. </sentence><sentence id="167">The borders were watched by Hungarian and Russian soldiers and uh it was very difficult to escape. </sentence><sentence id="168">Again we had to...oh we found this...I'm getting a little fuzzy here. </sentence><sentence id="169">The memories are just rushing back into my head. </sentence><sentence id="170">We escaped with my cousin and her husband and two small children ages three and five. </sentence><sentence id="171">And uh what happened was that the kids were scared and crying, so before when we paid off the guards in order to get across the border, we had to get some rum and had to give it to the kids so the kids were drunk and fell asleep and my husband carried uh one kid and uh the kid's father carried another kid. </sentence><sentence id="172">We had to walk in the snow. </sentence><sentence id="173">The winter's are very difficult and heavy in Hungary and we dark winter clothing on and we had to walk in this dark clothing in the snow at night to be inconspicuous. </sentence><sentence id="174">When the Russian or the Hungarian soldiers were shooting at us, we had to lie down in the snow with our dark winter clothing in order not to be seen. </sentence><sentence id="175">We walked across...we had to walk a good twenty miles until we got to the border and the walk again was very very frightening. </sentence><sentence id="176">It was like deja vue. </sentence><sentence id="177">What happened as we were marching uh to escape...to go to the ghetto, because they were shooting us at us from watch towers and we had to know where to walk, where the border wasn't undermined. </sentence><sentence id="178">Finally we got to a creek which led us to Austria and this is where I just knew I'll never make it. </sentence><sentence id="179">I was just ready to give up and die. </sentence><sentence id="180">I was so tired after...and scared...after walking for several hours at night in the snow that I was just ready to give up. </sentence><sentence id="181">There was a log between uh Austria and Hungary and people walked across the log but I wasn't coordinated enough and I wasn't...I was so tired I knew I'll never make it. </sentence><sentence id="182">So finally people told me to sit on that log and I was able to just crawl over to Austria on that log, and I was very fortunate because we made it over. </sentence><sentence id="183">A lot of people were taken back to Budapest. </sentence><sentence id="184">They could not escape, but we were again very fortunate to be able to manage to get out. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="215">Q: Indeed. </sentence><sentence id="216">What did you do when you got to Austria? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="219">A: Well, in Austria we stayed in uh...subsequently we went to Salzburg and a Jewish organization was very good. </sentence><sentence id="220">They put us in a hotel, the Pathenon really, and we stayed in the Pathenon for two, three weeks, trying to come to America. </sentence><sentence id="221">We were planning to go to Australia, but there was a real iron curtain in Hungary. </sentence><sentence id="222">We had no news from the west at all, and we thought Australia would be wonderful because we would be as far from Europe as we could be, so we decided to go to Australia. </sentence><sentence id="223">But my husband had a relative who sent us a telegram from France...don't go to Australia. </sentence><sentence id="224">Go to America. </sentence><sentence id="225">Life is good there. </sentence><sentence id="226">So OK. </sentence><sentence id="227">We decided to go to America. </sentence><sentence id="228">This is how the decision was made. </sentence><sentence id="229">And uh however we were applying to come to America but the American Jews, the HIAS organization didn't want us because they didn't want to be responsible for us and they turned us down. </sentence><sentence id="230">Finally we were able to find an organization which brought over three thousand refugees regardless of religion, and this was the Tolstoy (ph), the granddaughter  of Leo Tolstoy had an organization bringing refugees over and uh by the Tolstoy organizations we were able to come to America. </sentence><sentence id="231">And again of course we felt very alienated and not belonging and it usually takes an immigrant five years to really get into the mainstream, to learn the language, to learn the culture, to learn the customs, so again we had to forget and relearn new ways of relating to people and new...uh how to live ina new land. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="245">Q: What was your adjustment to America like? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="247">A: [had a very difficult time. </sentence><sentence id="248">I didn't expect all this difficulty, but I...thinking back I think I was pretty depressed. </sentence><sentence id="249">I felt alienated. </sentence><sentence id="250">I didn't speak the language. </sentence><sentence id="251">I didn't have any skills then. </sentence><sentence id="252">I didn't have any education then. </sentence><sentence id="253">I used to...uh the early years were very difficult. </sentence><sentence id="254">I...after arriving...upon arriving to America we were sent to Camp Kilmer (ph), and at Camp Kilmer they were sending uh people all over the country and we were told that we should go to Norfolk, Virginia because they, the Jewish community wanted some refugees there and we spoke some English. </sentence><sentence id="255">It will be a good place for us. </sentence><sentence id="256">So we moved to No...so we said fine. </sentence><sentence id="257">We'll go anywhere. </sentence><sentence id="258">We didn't care. </sentence><sentence id="259">We didn't know anything about anything, so we went to Norfolk which is a southern town, not really wonderful for an immigrant, but uh the reason we went there because they told my husband that he could finish his schooling. </sentence><sentence id="260">He was an architectural student. </sentence><sentence id="261">We moved to Norfolk. </sentence><sentence id="262">There were no school of architecture. </sentence><sentence id="263">So we had to move on. </sentence><sentence id="264">We moved to Raleigh, North Carolina, where he did finally finish his schooling and I was working at Woolworth's in Raleigh, North Carolina, really not speaking English very well and not being able to...I really wasn't employable. </sentence><sentence id="265">And so the early years were very difficult for me, and uh learning a language, learning a culture...it takes a good five years for a person to really feel at home in a new country. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="285">Q: Thank you. </sentence><sentence id="286">Is there anything you want to add? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="289">A: I don't know. </sentence><sentence id="290">I think when I go home I'll remember a thousand other things to add, but right now I think this is my story. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="293">Q: What do you think the effect of the Holocaust has been? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="295">A: This is a difficult question to answer. </sentence><sentence id="296">I've been struggling with it for fifty years.(Laughter) My self-esteem was non-existent. </sentence><sentence id="297">I had to really work on developing some sense of worth. </sentence><sentence id="298">I think that sense of worth...I think that's what's the...I felt less than equal for years because of the Holocaust, because of escaping of Hungary. </sentence><sentence id="299">I had a very very...I think the biggest problem is that you just don't feel quite as good as the other guy. </sentence><sentence id="300">I think that was one of the major problems. </sentence><sentence id="301">Until you really feel good about yourself and who you are and you can accept who you are, it's just very difficult. </sentence><sentence id="302">Self-esteem is the name of the game I think. </sentence><sentence id="303">And that was really just can't and it just negated who I was, what I was all about. </sentence><sentence id="304">I was very ashamed of who I was. </sentence><sentence id="305">I didn't feel good about myself...for a long time. </sentence><sentence id="306"> 0 </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="320">Q: Tell us what you're doing now. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="322">A: Well, I became...in order to help myself to feel worthwhile I became a psycho-therapist and working with other people, helping them to realize who they are, what they are all about and help them to develop a healthier self-esteem. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="324">Q: OK. </sentence><sentence id="325">Thank you very much. </sentence></p></dialogue>
