<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="516">Q: So they had inherited money, but did they have a house of their own? </sentence><sentence id="517">Did they have a building? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="520">A: All that was lost. </sentence><sentence id="521">We had some friends in Switzerland who helped in the beginning until the school got started, but we had almost no money at all. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="524">Q: Okay. </sentence><sentence id="525">And while you were in Switzerland was there discussion of what was going on in Germany? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="528">A: Oh, yes, of course, particularly since most of the students were from Germany and had relatives in Germany and relatives in concentration camps, and it was always discussion of what was going on in Germany. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="552">A: There was several reasons. </sentence><sentence id="553">One is that the Swiss were very dubious about having Germans, and they were sending people back to Germany at the time. </sentence><sentence id="554">Secondly, our visa had run out, and we were actually very lucky. </sentence><sentence id="555">In those days if you were Jewish you had a"J" in your German passport, and American immigration laws in those days meant that if you were Jewish it took three or four more years before you could get, while they were perfectly happy to take non-Jewish Germans, and we had a friend at the German Consulate in Geneva who made sure that we had passports without a""J" in it, which gave us an early immigration visa to America. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="561">Q: I see. </sentence><sentence id="562">I see. </sentence><sentence id="563">So for all those reasons -- so that when you left, do you remember leaving Switzerland? </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="634">Q: Well, Imean, the value of having another language in the house is the kids never understand what you're saying. </sentence><sentence id="635">And sometimes that's important. </sentence><sentence id="636">Where did you come to the United States? </sentence><sentence id="637">Where did you arrive, and where did you settle and why? </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="774">Q: Well, it's unusual in many ways because most people who came inthe United States didn't have such a circle, and it suggests that -- I don't mean the term in any negative way -- but anelite kind of social circle that had come from Europe. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="776">A: It certainly was easier for us than for many other German refugees. </sentence><sentence id="777">I don't -- you were probably not alive in those days, but there was avery strong antisemetic strain in America at that time. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="780">Q: Uh-huh. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="782">A: And coming from Germany, that was particularly -- </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="783">Q: You felt it? </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="784">A: Oh, yeah. </sentence><sentence id="785">It was -- it wasn't clear at Swarthmore, which is a Quaker school, and therefore obviously not -- but there was antisemitism in the area where we lived and you could sort of sense it. </sentence><sentence id="786">Maybe we were overly sensitive about it. </sentence><sentence id="787">I don't know. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="792">Q: Well, the question I would have would be, did you remember instances where you could see it? </sentence><sentence id="793">You know, things like that are very hard -- </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="794">A: Just remarks, but nothing physical or people would talk about kikes or something like that. </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="795">Q: They would say such things? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="797">A: Huh? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="799">Q: They would say such things, using those words? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="801">A: That's how I learned that word. </sentence><sentence id="802">It was somebody -- and I can remember asking somebody what does it mean, and they explained it to me. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="813">A: No, it was gradual. </sentence><sentence id="814">And, to be honest with you, I never felt particularly Jewish. </sentence><sentence id="815">The only reason that I would tell people that I was Jewish is that I felt to explain what the Germans did and that I wasn't ashamed of being Jewish. </sentence><sentence id="816">But most of my life nobody asked, and I was always blond and not particularly looking of any kind of -- so that it never -- in many years it was never mentioned. </sentence><sentence id="817">I mean, and the fact that we were not religious, of course, made a big difference. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="823">Q: Well, you anticipated one of my questions, which was did what you experience, you know, being Jewish whether, whatever relationship you would have to it, the outside world in Germany certainly, you know, shaped your destiny. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="831">Q: Not really? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="833">A: My parents were, I guess what was called then free thinkers and had absolutely no religious -- I mean, I don't think I ever heard them talk about God or any kind of religion. </sentence><sentence id="834">And it wasn't until the Nazis that the Jews became arace, you know. </sentence><sentence id="835">And so that when I grew up it was areligion. </sentence><sentence id="836">And since we weren't religious, then it didn't play any part in my life really. </sentence></p></dialogue>
