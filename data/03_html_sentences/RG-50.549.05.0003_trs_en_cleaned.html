" </sentence><sentence id="1310">You start doing it before the SS comes in, before they change." </sentence><sentence id="1311">So, I don't know what time it was, four or five o'clock, I don't know. </sentence><sentence id="1312">So I climbed down again from the bed and I was able to stand for a minute. </sentence><sentence id="1313">So this was really a big accomplishment. </sentence><sentence id="1314">And I took a chair and I pushed it. </sentence><sentence id="1315">And I was walking, like jumping, I couldn't put down yet the foot all the way on the bottom, on the floor like. </sentence><sentence id="1316">But every day I tried, until I got stronger. </sentence><sentence id="1317">End of Tape 1, Side B 16   USHMM Archives RG-50.549.05*0003 17 Tape 2, Side A </sentence></p></dialogue>
