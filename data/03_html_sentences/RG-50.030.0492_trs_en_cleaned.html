<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="927">A: Three things. </sentence><sentence id="928">First of all, you have to connect right -- no, because for me, for me is -- is not at all -- is no longer -- is not something -- I'm not centering on the horror of the thing. </sentence><sentence id="929">I see that as a -- a-a-as a hope, I mean the -- and recently I got to understand much better the universality of the Jewish faith, if | may use that word. </sentence><sentence id="930">I don't whether I -- I hope I do not offend you, be-because the thing is that the root of western culture, although it's called Judeo-Christian, wi -- ba -- th-the first root is the -- the col -- the vocation of Israel, for instance, that Shema and so on, for me it's an -- wi -- although I'm a -- a ca -- believer Catholic [indecipherable] believer, there is -- for me it's absolutely fundamental. </sentence><sentence id="931">And I see it -- I would not say that in a Jewish way, but for me I-I see the origin of my own Catholic faith here, right in that extraordinary history of Israel and so on. </sentence><sentence id="932">No, wh-what I mean to say is that first of all there's still a tremendous amount of ignorance. </sentence><sentence id="933">Why -- I don't see why, in every Catholic school, or in every public school there should not be a -- some -- a booklet or something, a very short, well written, educative information on the Jewish customs and so on and on the basic Jewish beliefs and so on. </sentence><sentence id="934">It could be done at a very little expense. </sentence><sentence id="935">Why -- di -- that's one thing, and the second thing is that you know the west? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="945">Q: Mm-hm. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="947">A: Now, we underwent a cultural revolution, wi -- and now the values, the traditional values, which we call Judean-Christian values are now deconstructed and so on. </sentence><sentence id="948">And there there is a tremendous work to do. </sentence><sentence id="949">I'm not negative, and I think that in that -- what I call that cultural revolution, wi -- there is something which could be transformed into a positive [indecipherable] the values of the western culture a-are changed. </sentence><sentence id="950">The change has been very negative and so on, but it -- it's also, you see, very -- 1-it could be transformed into a positive -- and there I see if the Jewish -- if there could be a common formulation. </sentence><sentence id="951">Not that the Jews really should -- to express that basic fundamental reality, the universality of the Jewish message and so on. </sentence><sentence id="952">But that should not be done, you know, by grade, or I don't know, or books and so on. </sentence><sentence id="953">It should be done -- it should come bottom up, you see? </sentence><sentence id="954">And that could be done. </sentence><sentence id="955">That -- that -- that could be done, because I'm sure that, first of all that there would be a communion of -- of the jewi -- because I am -- been a teacher all my life, you see and I'm oriented towards the -- the younger generation, I feel more at ease with -- but if that effort could come bottom up, wi -- through friendship, you know, networking. </sentence><sentence id="956">Of course, there is an intellectual work which has to be done. </sentence><sentence id="957">And that means educational work. </sentence><sentence id="958">But the reality should be friendship, should be personal counters, and start, you know, very low profile, not, you know, those big reunions. </sentence><sentence id="959">For instance, my daughter met David Rosen, Rabbi David Rosen, do you know him? </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="988">Q: That's right, mm-hm. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="990">A: Yes. </sentence><sentence id="991">And the basic -- my faith, the Catholic faith is based on the Bible, and -- which is Jewish experience. </sentence><sentence id="992">So, in other word, number one is understanding of the -- of the structure -- intellectual structure of a deconstruction wh-which si -- is contrary to the fundamental Jewish tradition which, insofar is it is common to the Christian origin. </sentence><sentence id="993">Right? </sentence><sentence id="994">Number two i-is, if possible, try to be more interactive, or more intelligent in spreading basic knowledge, even for kids and so on. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1000">Q: I see, mm-hm. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1002">A: In schools, and so on, and of course at the upper level even more, of Judaism, right? </sentence><sentence id="1003">And third is that fred -- friendship business. </sentence></p></dialogue>
