<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="252">Q: Let's...let's stay with you. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="254">A: Not... and knowing...the people knew exactly what he represented. </sentence><sentence id="255">In any case, we stopped the work and after 2 years in...in Germany, and we started ourselves a community in Switzerland. </sentence><sentence id="256">And because we said how is it possible that people...the whole humanity can become socially just and in peace. </sentence><sentence id="257">We have to do it ourself before we can expect from the others. </sentence><sentence id="258">We have to experience it ourselves whether it's possible. </sentence><sentence id="259">And...and secondly if we represent that people can only believe us if we do it ourselves. </sentence><sentence id="260">So the question is always that we don't expect from the others to do things, but we do it ourselves first of things. </sentence><sentence id="261">And so therefore this reason we started to live in community, idealistic community like the kibbutz from idealism and peace and justice that we represented that we lived that. ( </sentence><sentence id="262">clearing throat) But then we made experience that there were as many ideas as there were idealists, and we couldn't come to common unity as community expresses, and we were looking around. </sentence><sentence id="263">Where is that unity that we found? </sentence><sentence id="264">And we found it only in the will of God. </sentence><sentence id="265">Only if we all do the will of God, then we become united. </sentence><sentence id="266">And so we after 3 years, we joined the Bruderhof in Germany who represented that. </sentence><sentence id="267">Christ...Christ for us...Christ is not the founder of the Christian churches. </sentence><sentence id="268">The Christian churches do exactly the opposite of what Christ said.(Clearing throat) For instance... </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="295">A: It was so. </sentence><sentence id="296">1930 we started in Switzerland to live in community, (clearing throat) and there right in the beginning a pastor came to us with a family of four children. </sentence><sentence id="297">And he said, "Look here. </sentence><sentence id="298">Can I join you? </sentence><sentence id="299">Because I preach but I don't do. </sentence><sentence id="300">I don't live really a brotherly life. </sentence><sentence id="301">I have a nice house as a pastor and I have nice (coughing) income. </sentence><sentence id="302">Can I join you?" </sentence><sentence id="303">And one of our...we were three families, three couples who started...who came from the same youth movement. </sentence><sentence id="304">And...uh...one family was more Christian than we. </sentence><sentence id="305">And they said, "Look, go to the Bruderhof and learn there how to live in community. </sentence><sentence id="306">And then come back and teach us." </sentence><sentence id="307">And they went and stayed...1930. </sentence><sentence id="308">And then the Bruderhof was always concerned because they felt very much that we were seeking that unity, fighting for it....uh...struggling for it, but didn't find. </sentence><sentence id="309">And therefore when the second family wished to go away...the second...another family who was one of the founders of our community...they wished to go off the same. </sentence><sentence id="310">We don't find unity. </sentence><sentence id="311">It's finished. </sentence><sentence id="312">And they were given the advice also to go to the Bruderhof first. </sentence></p></dialogue>
