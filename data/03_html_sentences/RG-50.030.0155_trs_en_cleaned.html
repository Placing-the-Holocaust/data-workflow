<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="455">Q: Let's...let's stay with you. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="457">A: Not... and knowing...the people knew exactly what he represented. </sentence><sentence id="458">In any case, we stopped the work and after 2 years in...in Germany, and we started ourselves a community in Switzerland. </sentence><sentence id="459">And because we said how is it possible that people...the whole humanity can become socially just and in peace. </sentence><sentence id="460">We have to do it ourself before we can expect from the others. </sentence><sentence id="461">We have to experience it ourselves whether it's possible. </sentence><sentence id="462">And...and secondly if we represent that people can only believe us if we do it ourselves. </sentence><sentence id="463">So the question is always that we don't expect from the others to do things, but we do it ourselves first of things. </sentence><sentence id="464">And so therefore this reason we started to live in community, idealistic community like the kibbutz from idealism and peace and justice that we represented that we lived that. ( </sentence><sentence id="465">clearing throat) But then we made experience that there were as many ideas as there were idealists, and we couldn't come to common unity as community expresses, and we were looking around. </sentence><sentence id="466">Where is that unity that we found? </sentence><sentence id="467">And we found it only in the will of God. </sentence><sentence id="468">Only if we all do the will of God, then we become united. </sentence><sentence id="469">And so we after 3 years, we joined the Bruderhof in Germany who represented that. </sentence><sentence id="470">Christ...Christ for us...Christ is not the founder of the Christian churches. </sentence><sentence id="471">The Christian churches do exactly the opposite of what Christ said.(Clearing throat) For instance... </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="543">And then they sent a letter to us...1933 in January, challenging us. </sentence><sentence id="544">And on this my wife said, "That's the thing which we need." </sentence><sentence id="545">I said, "I'm...I'm not quite sure about that." </sentence><sentence id="546">And I for the first time in my life was asking God... start to say, "What do you think? </sentence><sentence id="547">What should I do?" </sentence><sentence id="548">And I got somehow a confirmation that I should go at least to find out what is on the Bruderhof. </sentence><sentence id="549">And so I come with my wife and a son. </sentence><sentence id="550">We had Klaus, who was at that time 10 minutes old. </sentence><sentence id="551">And then...in the Bruderhof'I sat, so to say, in the corner and looked through like an _____ you know what...what's the matter here? </sentence><sentence id="552">And then I found out that the true Christ is different from the Christ of the churches. </sentence><sentence id="553">That the true Christ fulfilled really what the Tennah said. </sentence><sentence id="554">It's not so that he was against the Tennah , but he ____ but the CHristians prosecuted the Jews. </sentence><sentence id="555">That's a contradiction. </sentence><sentence id="556">So on the Bruderhof, I found the true Christ, not the Christ of the churches and a community, and therefore I joined. </sentence><sentence id="557">Now at this moment, Hitler came to power. </sentence><sentence id="558">And Everett Amold who had been...had been judgment of the war had also been led to live in the community, he told us the following. </sentence><sentence id="559">Look here. </sentence><sentence id="560">Hitler came out of power, and here he comes in at the Holocaust because the Hitler prepared the Holocaust so to say. </sentence><sentence id="561">And he said, "Look here. </sentence><sentence id="562">This Hitler is preparing murder, deaths. </sentence><sentence id="563">We have to give a witness. </sentence><sentence id="564">We have to give a witness of life. </sentence><sentence id="565">Everybody that may cross our lives if we give that...everybody who does not wish to give his life should disappear. </sentence><sentence id="566">And those who wish to give their lives for the truth should stay on the Bruderhof. </sentence><sentence id="567">And we stayed. </sentence><sentence id="568">A few left, and a few stayed. </sentence><sentence id="569">About 120 stayed on the Bruderhof when Hitler came to power. </sentence><sentence id="570">And then we had ...soon had the raids of six police by the Nazis but they couldn't...they...they...couldn't still distinguish between Christian Socialism and Christian communism and political communism, because we are accused of being communists, you know like today.

No, I asked one of the Gestapo, "Look here, why do you come here?" </sentence><sentence id="639">He said, "Look here. </sentence><sentence id="640">You represent community and we represent community, but you represent community in another spirit than we. </sentence><sentence id="641">Therefore, it's impossible for you and we forbid that you take any guests in." </sentence><sentence id="642">We were forbidden by the Gestapo to take any guests. </sentence><sentence id="643">And...uh...so then...uh...but we didn't...we didn't obey.
