<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3">Q: I'd like you to begin by telling me your name, date of birth and where you were born. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="5">A: And then continue? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="7">Q: If you would. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="9">A: My name is Steve Galezewski. </sentence><sentence id="10">I was born May 11th, 1923 in the Town of Inowroclaw in northwest Poland. </sentence><sentence id="11">The reason why I am talking today is I am a Pole who was born in a generation, the only generation really, in free Poland. </sentence><sentence id="12">Poland became a free country in 1918, and then was, of course, was attacked in 1939 by Nazi Germany. </sentence><sentence id="13">Being brought up in the climate of freedom, I probably am a little bit more patriotic than the Poles who were raised in the periods after the Second World War. </sentence><sentence id="14">In my childhood, I was very involved, as well as my father, in the Boy Scout movement. </sentence><sentence id="15">This is the reason why my father was arrested and eventually killed by gestapo, because he was a leader of the youth in the Town of Inowroclaw where we lived. </sentence><sentence id="16">My childhood was a very happy childhood until the year 1939. </sentence><sentence id="17">At that time, I was 16 years old, and almost, I could say, that at time I had to put the uniform and start my war days. </sentence><sentence id="18">So you can see that I missed all the high school proms and the fun most of the high school kids have in their last days of high school. </sentence><sentence id="19">On September 1 ... </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="31">Q: Could I just ask you to talk a little bit more about what life was like in this town and whether or not you had Jewish friends ... </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="33">A: Okay. </sentence><sentence id="34">Well, let's erase the last sentence I had. </sentence><sentence id="35">In the Town of Inowroclaw, the Jewish population was not very numerous like in other parts of Poland. </sentence><sentence id="36">However, there was a beautiful synagogue with the roof which we thought was gold, gold-leafed roof. </sentence><sentence id="37">One of the better buildings in town. </sentence><sentence id="38">In my high school, I did have a class of some 25, 30 people. </sentence><sentence id="39">I had two Jewish boys. </sentence><sentence id="40">I remember their names. </sentence><sentence id="41">One was Smalish (ph) and the other one was Zowagazski (ph). </sentence><sentence id="42">Two different people. </sentence><sentence id="43">Smalish was not very athletic. </sentence><sentence id="44">He was more or less a sedentary type. </sentence><sentence id="45">The other one, Zowagazski, was involved with us in all the school activities like soccer, basketball, and he quite often visited my home, so I was fairly close to him. </sentence><sentence id="46">I wish today I knew whether they still alive or what happened to either one of them. </sentence><sentence id="47">When the Germans actually came to Inowroclaw, I don't recall any activity against the Jewish people. </sentence><sentence id="48">I don't remember, because most probably they had moved away from the German Army as the German Army came in. </sentence><sentence id="49">The war started for us, the Second World War started for us September 1, 1939. </sentence><sentence id="50">Two, three days before the -- and I should probably also say that I was brought up in a soldier's family. </sentence><sentence id="51">My father was a professional soldier. </sentence><sentence id="52">And two, three days before his regiment, which was the 59th Infantry Regiment, moved to the defense line on the German border, he called me and gave me a pistol, which was a  Walther 7.65 millimeters and had a talk with me man-to-man. </sentence><sentence id="53">And said, "Look, I am leaving. </sentence><sentence id="54">I don't know when I will be back. </sentence><sentence id="55">You are the oldest boy out of three of you. </sentence><sentence id="56">You will assume the role of the head of the family. </sentence><sentence id="57">I want you to take good care of your mother and two brothers. </sentence><sentence id="58">And then, of course, he went to war. </sentence><sentence id="59">Already after the war ended, I learned a lot of things which happens to him during that war. </sentence><sentence id="60">For instance, he was in the Battle of Kura, which was one of the fiercest battles fought during that campaign. </sentence><sentence id="61">And when the entire army was surrounded by German panzer divisions near that River Kura, they were already after three days of fighting without ammunition, without support of any kind. </sentence><sentence id="62">And casualties were extremely heavy. </sentence><sentence id="63">Commanding officer of the regiment, according to the write-ups in the newspapers, called my father and asked him to preserve the regimental flag. </sentence><sentence id="64">Regimental flag for a Polish soldier is something very sacred. </sentence><sentence id="65">Still today, when I see an American flag, for instance, not necessarily Polish, something grabs my heart, and I am ready to take the hat off my head. </sentence><sentence id="66">That's part of the upbringing I grew in. </sentence><sentence id="67">He, according to the versions in the newspapers and accounts of those who survived the prisoner-of-war camp, he apparently broke through the encirclement of Germans and buried the flag in a forest. </sentence><sentence id="68">Of course, he subsequently in 1940 was arrested by gestapo, that's the last time we saw him, and nobody knew where the flag was. </sentence><sentence id="69">In 1985, someone with a metal detector was going through the woods and detected that there was something buried. </sentence><sentence id="70">They dug it out and it was a backpack and in that backpack was the regimental flag, half destroyed. </sentence><sentence id="71">It was restored and is today flying proudly in the Army Museum in Warsaw. </sentence><sentence id="72">When father -- when the father was arrested -- this is something which really sticks in my mind. </sentence><sentence id="73">Because the gestapo came in early in the morning, he was not home. </sentence><sentence id="74">He was not home, and they said, "You sit down. </sentence><sentence id="75">We wait for him here." </sentence><sentence id="76">And we waited until he got back from work at 5 o'clock in the evening. </sentence><sentence id="77">To me, it was a horrible because I wanted to warn him and yet, here were the gestapo bandits with a woman and three young boys. </sentence><sentence id="78">And I couldn't do anything about it. </sentence><sentence id="79">Father was accused of trying to break away that region of Poland from the Third Reich. </sentence><sentence id="80">Germans already considered Pomerania, that part of Poland, as their territory, and really, that's why the war started. </sentence><sentence id="81">Because they wanted a corridor from Germany to the Gdansk and to east Prussia. </sentence><sentence id="82">Poland, of course, refused to buckle under this trap, and that's how the war started. </sentence><sentence id="83">After arrest of father, we were given 15 minutes to pack belongings and were taken out of our apartment and put in a concentration camp in Inowroclaw, where we were for about two weeks. </sentence><sentence id="84">After that, we were put into the cattle train and shipped out of the Verdun, out of what Germany considered - - what Germans considered German territory and were taken to the Warsaw region and the Minsk-Suwatki (ph), the doors of the cattle wagons were opened and we were let out to start a new life.

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="137">Q: ... a few questions. </sentence><sentence id="138">You've mentioned that you had  demolished, and that something was going on. </sentence><sentence id="139">But not in the region of Poland where I come from, that's only from the newspaper I learned. </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="140">Q: But was it something that other boys talked about ... </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="142">A: No, that was never really discussed, because to us, a human being was a human being. </sentence><sentence id="143">Whether you are Jewish or -- well, frankly, they were Polish citizens anyway, all of them. </sentence><sentence id="144">So to ask, there was no difference. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="148">Q: I'm also curious. </sentence><sentence id="149">Before September "39, what you knew about the activities of the Nazi Party ... </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="152">A: Well, that's -- again, we knew that inevitably something is going to happen. </sentence><sentence id="153">That's why in Poland our army was mobilized and we were somewhat prepared. </sentence><sentence id="154">To the extent that, for instance, my high school made donations from all the students, and we purchased a heavy machine gun for the 59th Regiment. </sentence><sentence id="155">It wasn't like you have here in the United States where you have millions of dollars for armament. </sentence><sentence id="156">Out there we had to scratch everything we could to arm ourselves. </sentence><sentence id="157">From my generation, there were some very heroic moves. </sentence><sentence id="158">We didn't have very many submarines, for instance, but we had what we called live torpedoes. </sentence><sentence id="159">And I was so proud of our house help, because she volunteered, 18-year-old girl who was helping my mother in household, she volunteered as a live torpedo. </sentence><sentence id="160">Germany, of course, we knew that was fully armed, was belligerent and that the trouble will come from there. </sentence><sentence id="161">Also, their treatment of Jews was giving us indication what will happen if they ever show up in Poland. </sentence><sentence id="162">As a matter of fact, somewhere from 1936, if I'm not wrong, we opened up pretty much for the Jewish people escaping from Germany or trying to get out of Germany. </sentence><sentence id="163">We opened up the Polish borders and let quite a few of them into Poland. </sentence><sentence id="164">I'm pretty sure that they -- except for the incidents of anti-Semitism here and there, I'm pretty sure that felt at home, because in Poland for 30 million population, we had some 3 million Jews. </sentence><sentence id="165">So this was a very big percentage. </sentence><sentence id="166">I don't know how many millions of Jews are in Israel, but I'm pretty sure not much more than 3 million or maybe even less. </sentence><sentence id="167">We being prepared for a war somewhat, in Boy Scouts on all the camps to which we went in 1939, we were trying to make them on the Polish/German border. </sentence><sentence id="168">And during our campfires, we, of course, sung the Boy Scouts" songs, patriotic songs, always trying to warn Hitler not to try us -- not to try because we would not behave like the other countries behaved when Hitler invaded them. </sentence><sentence id="169">We wanted him to know that we will fight. </sentence><sentence id="170">That fight came in finally on September 1, 1939, when 5 o'clock in the morning 21 Heinkels, 88 Stukas bombed the open town. </sentence><sentence id="171">This is the first time I saw dead bodies, not only of horses and animals, but of human beings. </sentence><sentence id="172">Up to that moment, I didn't ever even go to a funeral, so this was for me a very traumatic day. </sentence><sentence id="173">I also when I think about that day, I almost have to laugh at myself. </sentence><sentence id="174">Because the 7.65 millimeter pistol my father me, I was trying to shoot down the diving bombers, and, of course, it's a laughable thing. </sentence><sentence id="175">It  would be just like a fly going with an elephant. </sentence><sentence id="176">The families of military personnel were being evacuated on the fifth day of war, and I decided, although father designated me as the head of family, I decided to designate my younger brother and join the fight. </sentence><sentence id="177">So I gave the pistol to my brother, who was 13 years old. </sentence><sentence id="178">Gave him the same talk father gave me, and very promptly lied my age. </sentence><sentence id="179">I was 16, I had to say I was 18. </sentence><sentence id="180">And I joined the 59th Regiment, that is the unit which was being organized in the back of the fighting unit. </sentence><sentence id="181">Went through most of the fights on the road from Tnowroclaw, Warsaw, Lublin, Kovel". </sentence><sentence id="182">The humiliation of the villagers and population was unbelievable. </sentence><sentence id="183">They were simply machine-gunning women and children, bombing villages which had nothing to do with the military. </sentence><sentence id="184">In the eastern Poland where we got near Kovel", Ukrainians started their own fight and started burning Polish village, and started burning and killing Jews and Poles. </sentence><sentence id="185">No wonder that later on, Germans were able to organize SS Militia Division out of the Ukrainians and use them as guards in the concentration camps. </sentence><sentence id="186">The war was over basically in October 2nd, 1939, and I returned home in about November. </sentence><sentence id="187">Didn't get into the POW camp. </sentence><sentence id="188">Most of the Polish Army, of course, either crossed through Romania or Hungary, and eventually reorganized in France; or shed their uniforms with civilian clothing and returned home. </sentence><sentence id="189">When I came home, mother and my brothers were already there. </sentence><sentence id="190">Thank God they survived. </sentence><sentence id="191">Father came in later. </sentence><sentence id="192">He also, after saving the flag, returned home in civilian clothing. </sentence><sentence id="193">Of course, he did not talk about the flag at all, so 1 was unaware what was going on in that particular thing. </sentence><sentence id="194">When I was asked by the historians, I couldn't contribute much on that. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="238">Q: Was he angry that you hadn't followed his directions? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="240">A: No, no. </sentence><sentence id="241">Actually, we were all happy that everything finished and we were still together. </sentence><sentence id="242">Then, of course, after he was arrested and we were transported to the Minsk-Suwatki, we started a new chapter in our lives. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="246">Q: I just wanted to ask you. </sentence><sentence id="247">You mentioned that you and your family was put in this concentration camp for a few months or ... </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="250">A: A couple of weeks. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="252">Q: ... a couple of weeks. </sentence><sentence id="253">Who all was in there with your family? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="256">A: All the people like us who did not want to become . </sentence><sentence id="257">In that area, </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="258">A: I don't recall that. </sentence><sentence id="259">I don't recall specifically seeing Jews in that camp. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="262">Q: What happened at this camp? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="264">A: This was a camp from which you either landed eventually Mauthausen or some other big camp, or like in our case, being transported to the other part of Poland, move them away from the German part of Poland. </sentence><sentence id="265">We were called displaced persons, DPs as they called them, they called us after the war. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="268">Q: Do you remember exactly what your family thought about what was going on, why you were being moved? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="270">A: Well, father, of course, was gone. </sentence><sentence id="271">With mother, talking about things of that was -- well, it was not normal to talk to mother about things men talked about, let's put it this way. </sentence><sentence id="272">It doesn't mean that women were not treated equally in Poland, by any chance. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="276">Q: Were you frightened? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="278">A: No, at that age and from what I already went through, I wasn't frightened. </sentence><sentence id="279">Frankly, I wanted to fight. </sentence><sentence id="280">I wanted to revenge what they have done up to now from what I have seen. </sentence><sentence id="281">And remember one thing, that I was born in free Poland. </sentence><sentence id="282">I was brought as a free Pole, and I couldn't stand, for instance, things we were required in that town. </sentence><sentence id="283">Like at the entrance to the movie theater or to a restaurant or to a park where children play, a sign, "For Poles, Jews and dogs, entrance forbidden." </sentence><sentence id="284">Or when I see a German walking on the sidewalk, I'm supposed to step into the gutter, take my hat off, bow, and stay in that position until he moves away three paces from me. </sentence><sentence id="285">Those were not things compatible with freedom I enjoyed in Poland. </sentence><sentence id="286">Therefore, I was looking for a source where I could arm myself and fight. </sentence><sentence id="287">I thought about crossing the border and getting to France where Polish troops were being organized. </sentence><sentence id="288">Somehow that didn't happen, because when they let us out of in Minsk-Suwatki, we had absolutely no money. </sentence><sentence id="289">We had absolutely no time to take anything from our household, jewelry or anything. </sentence><sentence id="290">We were simply taken out. </sentence><sentence id="291">And incidentally, into our house or into our apartment, they put Germans whom they transferred from like where they are to other regions. </sentence><sentence id="292">So in one minute, you lost your entire life's assets. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="308">Q: What was the 2 </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="309">Q: Who else would have been ? </sentence><sentence id="310">Did they prevent you from going into Polish schools or ... </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="313">A: There were absolutely no Polish schools beyond the sixth grade. </sentence><sentence id="314">Germans considered us a race which was supposed to be eliminated after they eliminated the Jewish race. </sentence><sentence id="315">We were the number two in line. </sentence><sentence id="316">And, therefore, they said they don't have to be educated beyond the simple reading and arithmetics. </sentence><sentence id="317">Therefore, no high schools in Poland. </sentence><sentence id="318">Of course, immediately the underground high schools sprang up, and the former teachers, you know, they were meeting in groups of four, five, ten private homes and continuing the studies. </sentence><sentence id="319">Universities, of course, were nonexistent for Poles. </sentence><sentence id="320">In the area of Minsk-Suwatki, I was a stranger. </sentence><sentence id="321">I didn't know anybody. </sentence><sentence id="322">It took some time before I started to know who is who. </sentence><sentence id="323">I have joined, of course, first thing, the high school -- underground high school where I continued my studies. </sentence><sentence id="324">Out there among the boys, I found my first contact on the fighting underground. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="337">Q: Let me change the tape. </sentence><sentence id="338"> dangerous for Poles because anytime you helped a Jew by giving him bread or milk or whatever, food or sheltering, you endangered your entire family and your village. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="341">It happened many, many times where a neighbor who didn't like his neighbor said, "Hey, my neighbor yesterday gave something to the Jews who came out of the woods, out of the forest." </sentence><sentence id="342">Well, that entire family was wiped out, and their house was burned to the ground. </sentence><sentence id="343">And the news all around was arriving, this happened in this village; this happened in that village. </sentence><sentence id="344">So population, Polish population basically was very frightened and very careful on it. </sentence><sentence id="345">This probably could be the reason why it was universally practiced. </sentence><sentence id="346">On the other hand, AK, which is the underground organization to which I belonged, and that means -- AK means Army Krajowa, which is home army. </sentence><sentence id="347">Had very specific orders to assist and help as much as possible by absorbing young Jews who were in the forest and wanted to join the guerrillas, they were welcomed with open arms. </sentence><sentence id="348">As a matter of fact, here in Los Angeles, we had an example of that. </sentence><sentence id="349">In my combat organization, Mr. Harter, who belongs to veteran's organization, veteran guerilla organization, was saved by Poles and survived the war by being in the guerilla unit. </sentence><sentence id="350">I heard of many, many instances of the same thing happening, but this is my personal involvement with Mr. Harter. </sentence><sentence id="351">My beginning in the underground was simply what they call small sabotage. </sentence><sentence id="352">We were putting placards on streets, anti-German, trying to change their morale, which at the time at the beginning, 1940, "41, was still pretty high. </sentence><sentence id="353">But we were trying to pass some messages to them by graffiti type, by placards, by all possible means that the war, the fighting is a hopeless war. </sentence><sentence id="354">They're not going to win. </sentence><sentence id="355">After a few months, I graduated from this small sabotage into the real fighting unit where we were, for instance, protecting the parachute drops from England. </sentence><sentence id="356">We also were protecting on other occasions the radio station which was communicating with the West. </sentence><sentence id="357">In 1941 there were still very few actual attacks on German compounds, but in 1942 the speed of the military involvement increased. </sentence><sentence id="358">And in that I took part, and oh, in 1942 in blowing up two trains. </sentence><sentence id="359">In 1943, ammunition train, we blew up and also took materials to support ourselves from various industrial complexes like a chocolate factory where we took tons and tons of sugar. </sentence><sentence id="360">We loaded them on the horse and buggies the peasants supplied. </sentence><sentence id="361">And then sold that for money to support the guerilla activities. </sentence><sentence id="362">Blew up a vodka distillery, other smaller activities wherein the villages -- in every village, Germans said you have to deliver so many horses, so many cows, so many tons of grain or potatoes for the Germany effort. </sentence><sentence id="363">And usually, there were designated people who were responsible for that. </sentence><sentence id="364">And those people knowing that they're working and they can be banished for it, they were very eager. </sentence><sentence id="365">We tried to dampen their enthusiasm and warn them not to do it in a too eager way. </sentence><sentence id="366">If someone like that didn't listen to us, next time we took him and publicly in that village, let's say, 50 lashes. </sentence><sentence id="367">We also watched women, that they wouldn't go with German soldiers or German civilians. </sentence><sentence id="368">If that happened and she didn't get the warning and continued, a unit would go shave her head to zero and put a finger on her that she was a prostitute. </sentence><sentence id="369">Smaller other things, and usually the boys 12, 13, girls even were involved in it. </sentence><sentence id="370">In the movie theater, there would be a German with a Polish prostitute in the mink coat. </sentence><sentence id="371">Well, they  would have the spray bottle with the strong acid, and very quietly would spray that acid on the fur coat of the girl. </sentence><sentence id="372">By the time the girl was leaving the movie theater, the fur coat was almost falling off her back. </sentence><sentence id="373">Those were the expressions of resistance from the youngest all the way up. </sentence><sentence id="374">We tried to liberate our prisoners. </sentence><sentence id="375">We attacked several prisons and liberated quite a few. </sentence><sentence id="376">What Germans in Warsaw, however, for every German killed, they tried to wipe out 25, 50 Poles. </sentence><sentence id="377">And what they would usually do, they would put a sign on all the visible places in Warsaw that today or yesterday a German soldier was attacked and killed. </sentence><sentence id="378">For that 50 Poles tomorrow will be executed, although they were listed as possible people to go free. </sentence><sentence id="379">So the terror was unbelievable, but by the year 1942, "43, we realized that if we were doing nothing as we were in 1940, let's say, the underground, we were dying. </sentence><sentence id="380">We were being hanged on the streets for no reason at all. </sentence><sentence id="381">The concentration camps were full of Poles, not only Jews, but Poles. </sentence><sentence id="382">Of course, those Jews from Poland were Poles anyway, so there's no distinction there. </sentence><sentence id="383">But in the Polish located camps, Germans, of course, brought Jews from other countries. </sentence><sentence id="384">From that you can see what the situation was developing in Poland. </sentence><sentence id="385">So we finally decided, hey, if we have to die, we might as well die taking some of them with us, and that's where this pace of resistance accelerated. </sentence><sentence id="386">And that's where more trains went up, more bridges were blown up. </sentence><sentence id="387">More attacks on the airfields and other military objectives happened. </sentence><sentence id="388">By 1942, I think it's July 1942, in July 1942 out of the ghetto I think they have taken some 220 people and in one day shot them at the cemetery, at the Jewish cemetery. </sentence><sentence id="389">Now, I have not witnessed that, but it was universally known. </sentence><sentence id="390">On August 1942, the Minsk ghetto was liquidated. </sentence><sentence id="391">What happened is the Germans, Latvians, Ukrainians with the assistance of the Jewish police, rounded all inhabitants of the ghetto into the marketplace. </sentence><sentence id="392">A few thousand people were in that marketplace, and they didn't know what is going to happen to them. </sentence><sentence id="393">They stayed there overnight. </sentence><sentence id="394">Some were trying to escape, and they were, of course, shot during the escape. </sentence><sentence id="395">Next day in a column -- they formed the columns and all the inhabitants of the ghetto were marched into the railroad station where numerous cattle wagons were waiting for them. </sentence><sentence id="396">They were loaded with the help again of Jewish police. </sentence><sentence id="397">The Jewish police, although not armed, they had baseball bats, all of them, and special hats and special arm bands. </sentence><sentence id="398">During that transport and during the gathering of the ghetto in the marketplace, the word was that about 1,000 of the Jews were shot. </sentence><sentence id="399">Where the trains went, I'm not sure whether they went to Majdanek or Auschwitz or some other camps. </sentence><sentence id="400">I have witnessed the march from a window on the street to which they were going, I have witnessed the march of the Jews to the trains. </sentence><sentence id="401">I have not seen personally anyone killed, because the region where I was was rather short visible from the window where I was. </sentence><sentence id="402">But I could hear the shots, and then the word came in the next day and the following day among Poles that about 1,000 were shot during that incident. </sentence><sentence id="403">So this was the finish and annihilation of the Jewish ghetto in Minsk. </sentence><sentence id="404">There were, of course, 500 craftsmen -- tailors, shoemakers, people who were taken out of ghetto before, and they were housed in the Copernicus (ph) School, and they were working for the German Army, working on the German uniforms. </sentence><sentence id="405">Working on producing shoes, doing things which  were useful for the German Army. </sentence><sentence id="406">From that group, sometimes in 1943, "42, "43, some 200 were taken and shot again in the Jewish cemetery. </sentence><sentence id="407">The remaining 300 plus stayed and continued to work for the army. </sentence><sentence id="408">On January 6th, which happens to be a Polish Catholic holiday, that's why I remember the date, was the annihilation of the rest of the Jews from the Copernicus School. </sentence><sentence id="409">How did that happen? </sentence><sentence id="410">And that I personally witnessed. </sentence><sentence id="411">At that time I had the documents on my own name; however, they were documents very strong which I received from the underground channels, underground help. </sentence><sentence id="412">I was a fireman in a factory. </sentence><sentence id="413">There was a factory in Minsk where several of us from the underground were employed for the simple reason that those documents allowed us to be on the street after the curfew. </sentence><sentence id="414">Curfew in town was like 7 o'clock, and after 7 o'clock, no Jew, no Pole could be on the street. </sentence><sentence id="415">Only Germans were allowed to be after curfew on the streets. </sentence><sentence id="416">So with those documents, of course, we could go on our underground activities, gather for the job to be done somewhere. </sentence><sentence id="417">That very morning on the 6th of January, we noticed shooting. </sentence><sentence id="418">And looking outside we see a lot of smoke coming out. </sentence><sentence id="419">Being, of course, a fire brigade in a factory, our concern was supposed to be a factory, but we decided to go and see if we can help and put the fire out in town. </sentence><sentence id="420">So we all put the helmets on, jumped into the wagon, and went toward the smoke. </sentence><sentence id="421">Well, the smoke was coming in from the Copernicus School where the remnants of the Jewish population of Minsk were housed. </sentence><sentence id="422">On arrival, the entire building was in flames. </sentence><sentence id="423">The roof was on the verge of collapse. </sentence><sentence id="424">Outside one could see uniformed Latvians, Germans, Sicherheitspolizei, and Polish police shooting at the window and generally trying to finish whoever was trying to get out of the fire. </sentence><sentence id="425">I could see two piles of bodies some six, seven feet high, piled up next to the school. </sentence><sentence id="426">I could see on the ledges of windows half-burned bodies. </sentence><sentence id="427">I could a mother with a little child trying to throw the child out of the window when someone shot her and killed her. </sentence><sentence id="428">The thing which stayed with me for many, many, many years after the war, however, was an incident which happened a few steps from me. </sentence><sentence id="429">A gendarme, a German six-foot plus tall, because I am six foot so I can judge the height, some 250 pounds heavy takes a little Jewish girl by the hand. </sentence><sentence id="430">Leads her to the wall, sits her by that wall, corrects her posture even. </sentence><sentence id="431">Moves back a few steps and shoots her right in the head. </sentence><sentence id="432">Now, at a moment like that, one is ready, of course, to jump and do something, but what could one do? </sentence><sentence id="433">I could only pay back for happenings like that through my underground activities. </sentence><sentence id="434">Because anything on the spot out there would have meant death to all of us. </sentence><sentence id="435">I did not want this to be forgotten in case they do not have in the museum any records of what happened in Minsk- Suwatki. </sentence><sentence id="436">Two often one hears the Holocaust never happened. </sentence><sentence id="437">Well, here is one eyewitness who saw what was going on and what was happening. </sentence><sentence id="438">Where the Jews from Minsk were taken, I'm not sure. </sentence><sentence id="439">Whether this was Majdanek, whether this was Sachsenhausen or Auschwitz, but usually those three were the main sources of gathering the Jews from Polish ghettos in Poland. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="543">A: No. </sentence><sentence id="544">Frankly, we didn't hear much about it. </sentence><sentence id="545">Although I tell you one thing from reading after the war, we had a courier from Poland who is still alive, still lectures. </sentence><sentence id="546">Who went from Poland to London and reported to allies and to Roosevelt and Churchill what was going on in Poland. </sentence><sentence id="547">Because Germans were trying to say nothing is happening. </sentence><sentence id="548">Well, so the Jewish population in the United States through that should have known what is happening to their brothers and sisters in Poland. </sentence><sentence id="549">And yet, to my disappointment, they didn't do enough to do something about it. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="557">Q: I was curious how and where you were at that time . </sentence><sentence id="558"> 1 Tape #2 </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="559">Q: You know, I'm not sure whether something is -- we're starting a new tape. </sentence><sentence id="560">It might -- I wanted to learn a little bit more some of the specific risks you undertook in some of your underground activities. </sentence><sentence id="561">And I also want to ask you questions about general underground organization, but wherever you want to start. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="565">A: Well, let's first talk about the organization of underground. </sentence><sentence id="566">In the early days of war, that means 1939, "40, there were multitudes of organizations, underground organizations, all eager to fight Germans. </sentence><sentence id="567">They ranged from the extreme left to the extreme right. </sentence><sentence id="568">In the extreme right, you had what probably what gave the rest of us the anti-Semitic, how you call it? </sentence><sentence id="569">The anti-Semitic, I'm fighting for a name, image. </sentence><sentence id="570">Those were the extreme right organization, Knesset, Natrilova Shevis Brenner (ph), where they considered that Poland is only for Poles. </sentence><sentence id="571">They were as close to the Nazi thinking that one could go, but they were soldiers; they were fighters, and they were supported from the West probably more than we were from England. </sentence><sentence id="572">Some of them when order came to consolidate all the fighting units, some of them didn't join and stayed separate, like in Knesset (ph) . </sentence><sentence id="573">Most of the unit except the branches of Knesset and except the Communists, Army , which were run by Stalin, by  2 stored for months waiting for something to happen out there where we wouldn't have to look for ladders, that the ladders were already there. </sentence><sentence id="574">We took the ladders and attacked them from balcony, rather than through the doors. </sentence><sentence id="575">It was so well thought through, so well organized, that it's incomprehensible sometimes. </sentence><sentence id="576">Numerous -- for instance, I took part in a liberation of a prisoner who was caught by gestapo, was tortured and we were afraid he might break. </sentence><sentence id="577">We went -- and they kept him since he ... </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="591">Q: ... okay, you were trying to ... this prisoner who you thought might break. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="593">A: Okay. </sentence><sentence id="594">And incidentally, his name is Tarchinski (ph), I remember still. </sentence><sentence id="595">And he was after being beaten, the doctors advised gestapo that he will die if he is not taken to hospital. </sentence><sentence id="596">So they took him to hospital with a gendarmes or gestapo man sitting by his bed. </sentence><sentence id="597">Well, we went to free him in German uniforms. </sentence><sentence id="598">We entered, nobody even stopped us. </sentence><sentence id="599">The man by the bed of our comrade didn't even lift himself off the chair when we entered the room. </sentence><sentence id="600">Several, several actions were performed in such a fashion that either German uniforms or gestapo uniforms were worn. </sentence><sentence id="601">I was myself in gestapo uniform two, three times on various actions. </sentence><sentence id="602">It's not universally known in the West, but some very, very high-ranking SS officers were executed in Poland. </sentence><sentence id="603">One of them was the head of the gestapo for the entire eastern region. </sentence><sentence id="604">His name was General Kiichira. </sentence><sentence id="605">If I remember, he was even son-in-law of Himmler. </sentence><sentence id="606">He was executed on Warsaw street. </sentence><sentence id="607">The death sentence was given to him for his activities against Poles and Jews, and he was executed. </sentence><sentence id="608">So you can see that we had the -- not only the judge, but we had also the executioners in the underground. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="625">Q: First of all, how was the underground economy? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="627">A: This is all entire nation underground. </sentence><sentence id="628">Schooling system, medical system, court system and then army. </sentence><sentence id="629">When the Warsaw uprising started on August 1, the so-called what we call code name Buja (ph), which is tempest. </sentence><sentence id="630">Tempest was declared, and out of the underground some 300,000 underground people came out in various parts of Poland and started hitting the German units. </sentence><sentence id="631">How the uprising in Warsaw started, 5 o'clock in the afternoon -- and again, every unit had objective. </sentence><sentence id="632">This unit was taking the powerhouse, this unit was taking post office. </sentence><sentence id="633">Some other unit was taking the railroad station or whatever it is. </sentence><sentence id="634">On 5 o'clock, August 1, 1944, windows suddenly opened and any German on the street was just killed from the window by people like you and me. </sentence><sentence id="635">Warsaw uprising was ready and was supposed to last four, five days at the most. </sentence><sentence id="636">And we had enough ammunition and supplies for that. </sentence><sentence id="637">By that time it was universally assumed by all of us that there will be landings in Vilna and Gdansk from England, that Marines will be in Poland. </sentence><sentence id="638">The Polish forces, the paratroop brigades that we had, will be dropped on Warsaw. </sentence><sentence id="639">Instead, what they did they took and annihilated that part of brigade in Arnheim. </sentence><sentence id="640">That was incidentally, under the leadership of General Sasaboski (ph). </sentence><sentence id="641">When you look at the movie theater "Bridge Afar," Sasaboski is mentioned and the paratroopers are mentioned in it. </sentence><sentence id="642">The Warsaw  3 uprising lasted 62 days instead of those four, five days. </sentence><sentence id="643">And I would say that almost everybody was involved in that fighting. </sentence><sentence id="644">Civilian people were digging the trenches, were putting the barricades on every street. </sentence><sentence id="645">Young children were used to take messages in between. </sentence><sentence id="646">Kitchens were set up my housewives all over. </sentence><sentence id="647">It was unbelievable. </sentence><sentence id="648">In first days, almost entire Warsaw was in our hands. </sentence><sentence id="649">After those five, six days when there was no ammunition, only that ammunition we had which we took from Germans, was taken. </sentence><sentence id="650">Germans used some unusual techniques. </sentence><sentence id="651">For instance, to give you an example. </sentence><sentence id="652">Barricaded, they cannot take. </sentence><sentence id="653">Any tanks they use gets burned by the Molotov cocktails from windows all over. </sentence><sentence id="654">Tank on narrow streets is not a good weapon to use. </sentence><sentence id="655">But they had armor, so the people were protected out there. </sentence><sentence id="656">As long as they stayed away from the area approaching the barricade, they could fire that cannon and then machine gun at will. </sentence><sentence id="657">And we couldn't do much because all we had is the rifles and then the pistols. </sentence><sentence id="658">What they did in a couple of instances in Warsaw, they surrounded the wives, mothers and children, put them in front of the tanks, and moved them toward the barricades. </sentence><sentence id="659">And the people behind the barricade see the mother, see their sister, maybe. </sentence><sentence id="660">They know what to do. </sentence><sentence id="661">You shoot your own or you let them break your barricade and make a breach into your defense line. </sentence><sentence id="662">Well, you're faced with decisions like that. </sentence><sentence id="663">I won't tell you what happened in those instances, but you figure out what you would do in a case like that. </sentence><sentence id="664">They also invented, I would say, what we call the Goliath. </sentence><sentence id="665">It's a little tank, small one, maybe one meter long. </sentence><sentence id="666">And they put on it half a ton, two- or three-quarter of a ton of dynamite, and this was electrically controlled and they could direct it. </sentence><sentence id="667">Here is a building which we're defending for two weeks, they cannot take it. </sentence><sentence id="668">They direct that right at the building and they explode it right at the building. </sentence><sentence id="669">Of course, not only this building but buildings around go with -- just like what you've seen here in the United States in car bombs. </sentence><sentence id="670">Warsaw finally fell after 62 days of furies, out of AK, some 17,000 died. </sentence><sentence id="671">Total population loss in Warsaw was over 300,000 in 62 days. </sentence><sentence id="672">If you look at it from the perspective of Vietnam War where in some dozen years our casualties were approaching 60,000, here it would give you an idea of the ferocity of the fighting. </sentence><sentence id="673">In 62 days, you have over 300,000 casualties. </sentence><sentence id="674">Of course, Warsaw negotiated the surrender with the German Army. </sentence><sentence id="675">The German Army was pulled from the eastern front, was pulled from wherever they could find them to just defeat Warsaw because that was their road from Russia to Berlin. </sentence><sentence id="676">At that time in other parts of Poland -- and incidentally, during the negotiations the Warsaw commander negotiated with Germans that the AK guerrillas and the fighters of Warsaw will be considered under the Geneva Convention. </sentence><sentence id="677">Up to that moment, they considered us bandits. </sentence><sentence id="678">In other words, anybody could shoot us without getting any responsibility for it, taking responsibility for it. </sentence><sentence id="679">The surrender conditions were that they all will be treated under the Geneva Convention. </sentence><sentence id="680">That means they will go to the regular prisoner of war camp, and that, they lived up to that, one must say. </sentence><sentence id="681">The rest of Poland continued fighting. </sentence><sentence id="682">The rest of Poland continued fighting and was fighting -- Soviet troops, of course, came in through treachery by inviting the Polish officers for the joint strategy sessions, the Russians invited them and those officers never came back. </sentence><sentence id="683"> 4 They landed all in Siberia. </sentence><sentence id="684">The troops without the officers were surrounded by Soviet troops, were disarmed and forcibly forced into a Polish Army under the Soviet command, which had an obedience to a Soviet puppet government in Moscow. </sentence><sentence id="685">They created a Polish government in Moscow consisting of some hard-nosed Polish Communists. </sentence><sentence id="686">I found myself in that army eventually, and in that army, incidentally, that army was being organized east of Lublin between Homel! </sentence><sentence id="687">and Lublin. </sentence><sentence id="688">In Lublin, on the outskirts of Lublin is Majdanek, and that's where my unit was stationed, in Majdanek. </sentence><sentence id="689">We had out of Majdanek five guards, which were put into this time, not an underground anymore, but a formal court. </sentence><sentence id="690">The court found them guilty of atrocities against the Polish and Jewish population, and they were sentenced to death. </sentence><sentence id="691">And the execution of the guards was performed in Majdanek itself. </sentence><sentence id="692">My company was assigned to put a barrier between the witnesses, the hundreds and thousands even of population, and the place of execution. </sentence><sentence id="693">The place of execution was very simple, the gallows was put up and the trucks came in with the open back. </sentence><sentence id="694">The guardsmen with their hands tied and their legs tied were stationed on the beds of the trucks. </sentence><sentence id="695">And on command, the trucks moved and they simply dropped and were hanged. </sentence><sentence id="696">We only hanged four of them because one of them hanged himself in the cell. </sentence><sentence id="697">In the unit, I was a company commander as a second lieutenant. </sentence><sentence id="698">That unit was training for battlefront activities, and after a few weeks, I discovered that most of the soldiers in the unit are the Polish guerrillas, AK. </sentence><sentence id="699">Officers like me who were commanding different companies, they were also AK. </sentence><sentence id="700">Well, we got together; we got together, and we have decided that we have to organize something within this brigade, when the allies finally show up in Poland, that we as a unit can then arrest all the Soviet officers in the unit and all the political officers in the unit and simply fully armed cross into the allied side. </sentence><sentence id="701">Well, after a few weeks, we accomplished that, and we had underground army within the Soviet Army. </sentence><sentence id="702">We made contact on the commander officer of the AK for the Lublin region, which was still operating. </sentence><sentence id="703">He was underground, he was not arrested by the Russians and gave himself under his command. </sentence><sentence id="704">This is probably silly to say at this point, but I will mention it. </sentence><sentence id="705">We made a proposal to this particular head of the underground for that region that in October when there was a big parade was going to be held in Lublin. </sentence><sentence id="706">And in that parade the entire Polish government formed in Moscow plus Marshal Orkorsowski (ph) and some Soviet generals were supposed to on the tribune receiving the parade of all the Polish troops, which were ready to go into battle. </sentence><sentence id="707">This is October/November 1944 at that time. </sentence><sentence id="708">We made a proposal that we give our soldiers live ammunition for that parade, and the moment we are in front of the tribunes, we open fire at the government and show the world that Poland does not want what Soviets are bringing, and that that government created by Soviets in Poland means nothing to us. </sentence><sentence id="709">We are obeying the government inland at that time which was cooperating fully with the United States, England and allies. </sentence><sentence id="710">Well, supposedly, the message was sent to them and came back saying, "Forget about what you're proposing because Stalin would then make out of Poland simply a Soviet Republic like he made it out of Latvia, Lithuania or Estonia." </sentence><sentence id="711">So we promptly forgot it. </sentence><sentence id="712"> 5

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="799">Q: I'm going to ask you stop at this point. </sentence><sentence id="800">When you were talking about the hanging of the guards at Majdanek, is this the period when you and the Soviet Army liberated Majdanek there? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="803">A: No, no. </sentence><sentence id="804">That was already four, six weeks after. </sentence><sentence id="805">Majdanek was liberated I believe in July somewhere, and this was happening July, August, September; end of September somewhere. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="809">Q: Were you part of the group that went in and liberated Majdanek? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="811">A: No, no. </sentence><sentence id="812">At that time I was still in the Polish underground in the area of Minsk. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="815">Q: And when you were speaking about the Warsaw rising and how people were fighting all over the country in the summer of "44, where were you at that time? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="817">A: Okay, a week before the Warsaw uprising started, we pretty much knew that the end was nearing. </sentence><sentence id="818">Because you could see on the major highways from east to west chaos. </sentence><sentence id="819">It reminded us of 1939, where you could civilians, you could see German soldiers individually, on bicycles, on foot, on horseback, on military vehicle, civilian cars. </sentence><sentence id="820">You could see that the panic was setting and that they were running from Russia. </sentence><sentence id="821">So a week before uprising started, we went to destroy all the communications between the east and west. </sentence><sentence id="822">That meant all the telephone lines, all the railroad lines going to Minsk to Warsaw. </sentence><sentence id="823">I was assigned the region between Minsk and Warsaw, and we simply blew up the rails. </sentence><sentence id="824">Somebody else did the telephone poles and got them down. </sentence><sentence id="825">Somebody else in the different regions west -- I mean east of Minsk did the same thing. </sentence><sentence id="826">Then we had a concentration of our entire area ordered for a certain time and certain date. </sentence><sentence id="827">And after accomplishing our blowing up of the rails, we decided to move to the concentration point. </sentence><sentence id="828">At that concentration point, there was supposed to be 22nd Infantry Regiment and Brigade Calvary which is the Mazovian  6 </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="841">Q: I hate to do this, but we're out of tape. </sentence><sentence id="842">It's a bad point to stop. </sentence><sentence id="843">Okay, let me just do something for a second. </sentence><sentence id="844">When we unfortunately stopped you, you saw the SS helmets. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="849">A: Almost automatically without thinking, I hit the bell on the fire engine, and we kept going on the road. </sentence><sentence id="850">And the Germans either because they are so disciplined, and to them it was very logical that somebody was driving -- that the fire engine was going towards the fire, didn't even think. </sentence><sentence id="851">We passed that turnoff where we were supposed to turn off and disappeared. </sentence><sentence id="852">What happened there, it was an SS Hermann Goring panzer division. </sentence><sentence id="853">Four days later when we went through the battlefield out there, we could see the remnants of some of the tanks who took part in that battle, mostly German tanks. </sentence><sentence id="854">On the concentration point, we had some 3,000 people concentrated, which was this regiment and the calvary brigade I mentioned before. </sentence><sentence id="855">The defensive lines were -- on several villages, we took our defensive lines and stayed on the defensive line awaiting the front somehow to roll over us. </sentence><sentence id="856">Because the front was still east of us, and they were withdrawing west. </sentence><sentence id="857">So that night I see planes very high, flying from west to east. </sentence><sentence id="858">One of them burns, comes down like a meteor, and that's it. </sentence><sentence id="859">The next morning, I'm going on a patrol with a group of soldiers to penetrate the woods to see if anything is going out which were like few hundred yards from us. </sentence><sentence id="860">In the woods, we see movement. </sentence><sentence id="861">We see uniforms which don't look German. </sentence><sentence id="862">That's where Soviet paratroopers with a radio station, they were dropped behind the German line. </sentence><sentence id="863">Well, we kind of waved at each other, the white thing. </sentence><sentence id="864">Started talking. </sentence><sentence id="865">From them we learned that they were parachuted behind. </sentence><sentence id="866">We told them we are the Polish guerrillas. </sentence><sentence id="867">We also told them that -- that morning, we found incidentally from that burning plane, we found one man with half-burned parachute. </sentence><sentence id="868">So we told them where buried the man. </sentence><sentence id="869">On the radio station, they passed that to their headquarters. </sentence><sentence id="870">Their headquarter wanted to know our strength, our location, where we were. </sentence><sentence id="871">Well, I wasn't going to give it to them, but I gave them a guide and sent them to the headquarters. </sentence><sentence id="872">They wanted information, headquarters could give it to them. </sentence><sentence id="873">Four days later, we were withdrawing -- and incidentally, our involvement at that time was very simple. </sentence><sentence id="874">We didn't get into any major fight. </sentence><sentence id="875">All we were doing was disarming single or two, three German soldiers running away. </sentence><sentence id="876">So it wasn't the war I was really trained for. </sentence><sentence id="877">Four days after that, we're passing through the area where we met this SS Hermann Goring division. </sentence><sentence id="878">And the burned bodies in tanks and the tanks were really telling us that that big tank battle between the Soviet tanks and German tanks took place there, and that the German tanks were waiting to jump on the moving Soviets. </sentence><sentence id="879">Most of our officers, as I mentioned, were invited for a strategy session. </sentence><sentence id="880">Never came back from that strategy session. </sentence><sentence id="881">The next time we heard from them was Ruzyne on Siberia. </sentence><sentence id="882">Soldiers were surrounded, disarmed and put in -- we made a proposal to them. </sentence><sentence id="883">Leave us as we are, arm us a little bit better and we go right now today with you for Warsaw, to liberate Warsaw. </sentence><sentence id="884">Well, how naive I was as a young boy, it was all preprogrammed what would happen to Warsaw. </sentence><sentence id="885">Stalin simply  7 wanted that to last until Germany finishes Warsaw, because he knew that all the fighters in Warsaw were anti-Communist. </sentence><sentence id="886">So he wanted Hitler to wipe out the anti- Communists for him, and that's precisely what happened. </sentence><sentence id="887">We as the faithful allies of America, England and the Western world, we were really let down and left to fend for ourself. </sentence><sentence id="888">I don't think we deserved that. </sentence><sentence id="889">We were the most faithful friends the West had at the time, but that's how the war sometimes ends. </sentence><sentence id="890">Lesson from it from my own personal experience is don't let the war ever happen on you own soil;
