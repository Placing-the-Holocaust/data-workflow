<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="22">A: After my father was demobilized from the army...uh...he... uh... built up a...uh... wine business and over a period of 20 years he built it into a very substantial wine wholesale business. </sentence><sentence id="23">Uh...finally, we had...uh...large cellars in the...I think it was in the 18th District in "I....1 remember the place very well. </sentence><sentence id="24">It is a magnificent large court yard with chestnut trees...uh...three offices...uh...and extensive underground cellars. </sentence><sentence id="25">At least I was very impressive by the fact that they were...uh....uh...barrels of wine higher than I was, which wasn't very difficult. </sentence><sentence id="26">I wasn't very tall at the time, but they were about the height of a man. </sentence><sentence id="27">And...uh...there were rows and rows of them. </sentence><sentence id="28">And there was an escalator going down...uh...along which I guess they were transferring the barrels into bottles and so on and so forth. </sentence><sentence id="29">And he supplied mainly restaurants and hotels. </sentence><sentence id="30">Some of the wine we also imported from other countries, like Yugoslavia and I expect Hungary and so on. </sentence><sentence id="31">Uh... </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="42">Q: You as a child! </sentence><sentence id="43">Tell me a little bit about your childhood. </sentence><sentence id="44">Did you go to school? </sentence><sentence id="45">Did you have friends? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="50">A: Yes. </sentence><sentence id="51">Well, uh...first of all, what I...I have to say something in general about the nature of my memories. </sentence><sentence id="52">Uh...the Nazi period stretches across...uh...the landscape of my memories of my mind almost like a Chinese war. </sentence><sentence id="53">You can...there are chinks here and there. </sentence><sentence id="54">You can look through them. </sentence><sentence id="55">You can catch a glimpse of some of the things that happened beyond the war...before it, but..-uh...this...this huge war has cast a long shadow, both backwards and forwards, and really dominates the landscape. </sentence><sentence id="56">But I do remember some of the things. </sentence><sentence id="57">Uh...We were substantially a middle class family. </sentence><sentence id="58">As I say, we always lived in the same house in which really means a street of front gardens. </sentence><sentence id="59">Each apartment house had little front gardens. </sentence><sentence id="60">I remember vividly these were beautiful gardens with...uh...flower beds...uh...carnations, forget me naught, roses...uh...and huge lilies. </sentence><sentence id="61">This was lilies I believe. </sentence><sentence id="62">Uh... The house itself...uh...uh...was really properly built. </sentence><sentence id="63">You know, in...in Vienna, you had houses that were built for centuries...uh...marble and...and brass and...and oak to us and so on and so forth, absolutely beautifully fitted out. </sentence><sentence id="64">Uh...At first we lived on the third floor and then we moved down stairs to a mezzanine, which is a kind of half floor. </sentence><sentence id="65">It's almost on the level of the second floor as they would call it here because the ground floor is called the first floor in...in...in America. </sentence><sentence id="66">Uh...We always had as far...as long as I remember it any way, live in maids. </sentence><sentence id="67">These were generally girls who came from the country and...uh...Mother...uh... was a very...uh... friendly and compassionate person. </sentence><sentence id="68">She was always... always busy in the house, mainly on cooking which was at that time a task that...that took up a good part of the day. </sentence><sentence id="69">Uh... The house was sparkling. </sentence><sentence id="70">Uh...I was a bookworm. </sentence><sentence id="71">I remember lying on my belly on the floor and seeing my reflection in the linoleum. </sentence><sentence id="72">Uh...I was lost in books. </sentence><sentence id="73">Uh...But I also had friends out in the streets and...uh...used to play...uh...kicking the ball around and playing with those little marbles which at that time were clay, glossy clay balls. </sentence><sentence id="74">As a matter of fact, some were glass, but I liked the clay better because they were so beautifully colored. </sentence><sentence id="75">Uh... do remember vividly. </sentence><sentence id="76">Now before...before I come to the elementary school, I want to say that there were two...uh...facts that I vividly recall. </sentence><sentence id="77">First of all, I had a rather strict father. </sentence><sentence id="78">And that was very much in accordance with the fashion of the times. </sentence><sentence id="79">These were patriotic figures. </sentence><sentence id="80">And I loved him very much. </sentence><sentence id="81">I remember the intense joy that I had when I heard the... his key grating in the lock. </sentence><sentence id="82">I knew it was my father's key. </sentence><sentence id="83">And I knew more or less what time he would come home. </sentence><sentence id="84">Mother was a very affectionate woman. </sentence><sentence id="85">I am afraid that she...uh...she spoiled me. </sentence><sentence id="86">She was over-protective. </sentence><sentence id="87">She was always hovering over me when I was eating. </sentence><sentence id="88">The side effect, of course, was that I became the worst eater in Europe. </sentence><sentence id="89">I mean it just came to a point that I couldn't even look at a cup of coffee or milk or whatever and not feel sick. </sentence><sentence id="90">I was a very, very bad eater. </sentence><sentence id="91">Yal. </sentence><sentence id="92">So that...that...that was...that was a strong memory. </sentence><sentence id="93">Uh...Somehow...uh...I was very much of a dreamer. </sentence><sentence id="94">Books were my world of escape. </sentence><sentence id="95">And I managed to enter this world and close the door behind me and live in it for a long time. </sentence><sentence id="96">Elementary school was just around the corner. </sentence><sentence id="97">Uh... Well around the corner. </sentence><sentence id="98">It was in a part of the street called, oddly enough, means beautiful street. </sentence><sentence id="99">It wasn't nothing very beautiful about that street, but the elementary school was called at the time. </sentence><sentence id="100">And I remember the first...I was a person...uh...not very independent, probably as a result of the kind of education of the upbringing. </sentence><sentence id="101">As I said, I was over-protected, and...uh...it was difficult for me to separate myself from home and go to school in the first place. </sentence><sentence id="102">But...uh...I remember vividly on one of the first days, the principal of the school, I remember the name of Pakoni lifted me on to his knee and I can see his friendly face. </sentence><sentence id="103">He was a person of Czech extraction, I believe. </sentence><sentence id="104">Uh...so he spoke a perfect German. </sentence><sentence id="105">I suspect that he might even have been born in Vienna. </sentence><sentence id="106">But, of course, you know, the Austrian empire at the time incorporated...uh... No, it had incorporated. </sentence><sentence id="107">At that time when I was born and Czechoslavakia was already an independent country. </sentence><sentence id="108">But before that it was part of the empire. </sentence><sentence id="109">Uh...So he took me on his knee and he asked me whom I loved more, my mother or him. </sentence><sentence id="110">I was intensely embarrassed. </sentence><sentence id="111">I'm telling this story to show that...uh...uh... Vienna was a place of mixed emotions for me. </sentence><sentence id="112">Anti-Semitism was endemic in Vienna but there were loving persons, of course. </sentence><sentence id="113">There were individuals who and I did experience affection and love from some of them. </sentence><sentence id="114">As a matter of fact, when he asked me this question, the door opened and Mother came in. ( </sentence><sentence id="115">Laughter) So that just adds to my embarrassment. ( </sentence><sentence id="116">Laughter) I don't know how I wiggled out of that one. </sentence><sentence id="117">Subsequently, we had a...a teacher by the name of Kanote. </sentence><sentence id="118">Uh...and...uh...she also singled me out as...uh...I guess I am...I am really sorry to say as one of her preferred students because I don't like this whole business of really singling out anybody. </sentence><sentence id="119">I am today for instance Professor at Rutgers University and...uh...1 am very much guided by...uh...maybe this experience and others that...uh...that I just like all my students. </sentence><sentence id="120">I like all the kids there. </sentence><sentence id="121">Uh...But in any case, she had...she had the Jewish pets and the Gentile pets. </sentence><sentence id="122">I was the Jewish. </sentence><sentence id="123">The Gentile was a fellow by the name of who is the son of policeman. </sentence><sentence id="124">I remember all these things so..so..so vividly. </sentence><sentence id="125">Uh...The reason I mention this again was to show you a little bit of the atmosphere there. </sentence><sentence id="126">Uh...And I remember one occasion when...uh...she would sometimes go out because I think that...uh...she had a bit of a flirt going with a...with another teacher by the name of Flashman in the class. </sentence><sentence id="127">And she asked me to monitor the class. </sentence><sentence id="128">And as soon as she left, the class broke out into some kind of rowdy behavior and I immediately was able somehow to control that and what I learned about myself instinctively, you know, and I only recall this on reflection now...was that in....in times of tension and so, I seemed to have...to...to psychologically understand ways of controlling myself, of being in...in complete possession of myself and consequently of the situation and it was something that stood me in good stead when the Nazis came in. </sentence><sentence id="129">Uh... </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="212">Q: Let's talk about that. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="214">A: Right...Well.. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="216">Q: When the Nazis came in. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="218">A: Yes. </sentence><sentence id="219">At that time...uh...that was, of course, I believe...uh... the date was the 11th of March, 1938. </sentence><sentence id="220">And...uh...We had at that time a live-in maid by the name of Fritzi Shumberger. </sentence><sentence id="221">The reason I mention her was she did play a little bit of a role afterwards and also she had a little emblem on her lapel. </sentence><sentence id="222">It was . </sentence><sentence id="223">It was...uh...in the shape of a boot, and subsequently we learned that it was the emblem of the leading Nazis. </sentence><sentence id="224">I say illegal because before the Nazis marched in, the Nazi party was not legal in Austria. </sentence><sentence id="225">However, personally, she was not...uh...hostile to us and I don't think that she behaved badly when all is said and done. </sentence><sentence id="226">Uh...1 do remember the speech of Shoosnick who was at that time Chancellor, " Chancellor. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="236">Q: Where were you? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="238">A: I was...I was in that apartment...in our apartment in 186 204. </sentence><sentence id="239">That was the first apartment on the left side...uh...as you came into the house and stepped up quite a number of steps. </sentence><sentence id="240">Uh...And I listed to...uh...his speech and do...do recall..-uh...some of the words he said. </sentence><sentence id="241">I believe he said To the death with red, white red, which is the color of the Austrian flag. </sentence><sentence id="242">Red, white, red. </sentence><sentence id="243">Uh...At least my memory tells me that he said the things that he said. </sentence><sentence id="244">And...uh...Fritzi Shumberger, that maid, and my brother next to me (clearing throat) Excuse me. </sentence><sentence id="245">Guess I'll have to drink something. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="254">Q: That's fine. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="256">A: (Drinking water) Uh...My brother Leo. </sentence><sentence id="257">He was the next oldest. </sentence><sentence id="258">I was the youngest in a family of four which was also was a kind of situation that...uh...had me on my guard most of the time. </sentence><sentence id="259">And...and what separated me from the next one was a period of 6 years, very substantial. </sentence><sentence id="260">But the other three...uh...were only separated in terms of 2 years and there was... So really there were two families. </sentence><sentence id="261">It was they and I. I always regarded myself as an outsider and I expect it was because of that large separation of time. </sentence><sentence id="262">Anyway, Leo was there and Fritzi and she said something, "Oh wonderful and so on and so forth." </sentence><sentence id="263">Uh...Because obviously, I think she was going out with somebody who was a Nazi and they...they were very joyful about Hitler coming in. </sentence><sentence id="264">As a matter of fact, many Austrians were....uh... </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="274">Q: Excuse me. </sentence><sentence id="275">I'm confused. </sentence><sentence id="276">Who was joyful. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="280">A: Fritzi Shumberger, our... our maid was very joyful about it and many Austrians were. </sentence><sentence id="281">In any case...uh...and my brother remarked...he made some kind of...uh...negative remark about it, saying that...uh...,you know, there may not be that much reason to be happy. </sentence><sentence id="282">I...In any case...I do...I do remember that. </sentence><sentence id="283">I also remember the next day looking out. </sentence><sentence id="284">First of all, there were...there were bombers going...coming overhead. </sentence><sentence id="285">Hugh, hugh...uh...machines, droning and very low, almost...uh...scraping the...the...the tops...the tops of the houses. </sentence><sentence id="286">Black, black planes. </sentence><sentence id="287">They looked black to me or maybe that's just a psychological memory. </sentence><sentence id="288">Uh...And every house was draped with a spastic of flags. </sentence><sentence id="289">Every house! </sentence><sentence id="290">And these were hugh flags. </sentence><sentence id="291">I am talking about apartment houses, five floors. </sentence><sentence id="292">And these were flags that...that went from the roof right almost down to the...to the sidewalk and I should imagine that...uh...there was a very active, highly organized Nazi underground movement. </sentence><sentence id="293">And they distributed all these these flags over night. </sentence><sentence id="294">Also, there were many Nazis in all the houses. </sentence><sentence id="295">There was a substantial proportion of Austrians and Nazis. </sentence><sentence id="296">Austria has always...uh... managed to portray itself only as the victim and I have to say most emphatically...and I don't want to be unjust to the many people in Austria who were good people and kind people...but there was a large population of haters in Austria. </sentence><sentence id="297">And I don't think there was a single country in the world that embraced Hitler so fervently as the Austrian nation. </sentence><sentence id="298">And those of us who were there know it, experienced it. </sentence><sentence id="299">Uh... do remember that...uh...somehow or other I managed to either to allow my mother to go out or slip...I probably slipped out. </sentence><sentence id="300">And I went pretty far afield because I found myself...uh...and this was probably not on the first week. </sentence><sentence id="301">It was probably some weeks after the entry. </sentence><sentence id="302">But it was a time when...when Hitler...uh...was...uh...uh...going around in a procession. </sentence><sentence id="303">I remember him...1 remember him standing in a motor car, standing upright. </sentence><sentence id="304">It was an open...uh... car. </sentence><sentence id="305">And the sidewalks were thronged with people. </sentence><sentence id="306">I mean there was just one mass of people all waving and shouting and...and...and jubilant. </sentence><sentence id="307">Uh... There was an ecstasy of joy. </sentence><sentence id="308">And I was standing there very quietly observing this. </sentence><sentence id="309">Uh...At that time...uh...people who knew you before suddenly didn't know you. ( </sentence><sentence id="310">Clearing throat) In our apartment house, we had...uh...there were quite a number of Jewish families in our apartment house. </sentence><sentence id="311">Uh...There were not many Gentile families, but I think... There were probably...it was probably half half. </sentence><sentence id="312">There might have been three or four...of two I know definitely that they were Nazis. </sentence><sentence id="313">Uh...One was called Garla, and he will appear later on because he tried to blackmail my father and caused his arrest. </sentence><sentence id="314">Uh...and the other one was Sargi, and this Sargi, you know, there was this special story there because they are...there was daughter and two sons. </sentence><sentence id="315">The two sons had been friends of my brothers. </sentence><sentence id="316">But the friendship, I think had already more or less fizzled out...uh...uh...maybe a year or two before the Nazis came, but...uh...actually entered, but obviously, it was probably on the side of their becoming Nazis. </sentence><sentence id="317">One was called Franz and the other Willi. </sentence><sentence id="318">Willi Sargi became an SS man, and Franz Sargi became an SR man. </sentence><sentence id="319">Uh...And it's...they...they never personally undertook any action against us, these people. </sentence><sentence id="320">And as a matter of fact, the daughter...I don't know her name...who was working...uh...as probably some secretary in the police headquarters, local police headquarters, was helpful to my mother. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="363">Q: How? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="365">A: I don't recall the exact circumstances. </sentence><sentence id="366">I think it probably was...it might have been connected with the arrest of my father. </sentence><sentence id="367">I am going to talk about it a little later on. </sentence><sentence id="368">But I know that my mother went...uh...to her and I seem to remember that when she came back that she said some nice things about...about her. </sentence><sentence id="369">But I don't remember the exact circumstances. </sentence><sentence id="370">I wasn't even told exactly what happened at that time. </sentence><sentence id="371">Uh...If I can stop a moment here because I have a sense that there was something happening... </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="379">Q: Can you hold...hold the tape a minute? </sentence><sentence id="380">Is that what you what you would like to do. </sentence><sentence id="381">H </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="385">A: Yal. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="387">Q: Can you stop the tape a minute. </sentence><sentence id="388">Tell me when it's on Bonnie. </sentence><sentence id="389">Okay. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="393">A: One of the things that...that I remember vividly...uh...was, of course, the fact that...uh...shortly after...uh...the annexation...uh...we had to stay there. </sentence><sentence id="394">And there was a...some obvious peculiar about celebrating festival of freedom of liberation. </sentence><sentence id="395">And I do remember my father sitting there at the table and saying...uh...that he really didn't have the heart to do it. </sentence><sentence id="396">But we decided that we do it anyway. </sentence><sentence id="397">And I...1 am sure it was the hardest and most difficult that we ever had. </sentence><sentence id="398">Just because it is a festival of liberation, and...uh...I don't need to tell you how we felt at that time. </sentence><sentence id="399">Uh...One of the...I had mentioned...] had mentioned...uh...Incidently I mentioned Willi Sargi, and I just want to add to this that...and it's strange how sometimes little things...uh...become memories that...that stand out way and beyond the significance. </sentence><sentence id="400">Because my...my sister, Leah, and we actually always called her Toni for some reason so I am going to refer to her as Toni. </sentence><sentence id="401">Uh...She had managed to blot out most of the things that happened at the time, but one thing she...she remembers vividly and she's told me about it two or three times. </sentence><sentence id="402">I mean whenever she mentions that, I can feel it...the strong emotions tied up with it, and it's a little thing. </sentence><sentence id="403">She remembers herself walking into the house one day and Willi Sargi, that...that fellow who had been friends of...uh...my family, of my brothers and possibly her too, was walking ahead and he opened the door and he closed it right in her face. </sentence><sentence id="404">It's such a little thing, but it will live with her as long as she lives. </sentence><sentence id="405">And so I say memories are strange things because so many more horrendous things happened afterwards. </sentence><sentence id="406">Uh...At that time, I was going to...the " * gymnasium. </sentence><sentence id="407">That was a Jewish High School. </sentence><sentence id="408">A very, very good high school. </sentence><sentence id="409">One of the two best in Vienna. </sentence><sentence id="410">Uh...And they had a very select...uh...cadre of...uh... teachers. </sentence><sentence id="411">One of them was a pretty woman poetist and...uh..., of course, at that time, you know, the curriculum and the standards of education are very high. </sentence><sentence id="412">That school closed its door in... after I graduated...uh... in 1938. </sentence><sentence id="413">It closed its door for good for over 50 years. </sentence><sentence id="414">I think they only recently reopened again, last year or so I think I've heard. </sentence><sentence id="415">And I remember that...uh...when we...uh... left...uh.. on the last day of school...uh...and there was a group of boys waiting outside to beat us up, but...uh...that was...that was the gymnasium. </sentence><sentence id="416">Uh...I had two brothers...uh...the oldest by the name of Gabe. </sentence><sentence id="417">He left for the United States...uh... early in 1938. </sentence><sentence id="418">He missed most of the...uh... Nazi period. </sentence><sentence id="419">I think he left...uh...uh...in the early summer, late spring or early summer. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="448">Q: How did he get out? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="450">A: We have...a part of my mother's family is American...had settled in America...uh...a generation or two ago. </sentence><sentence id="451">And they sent us affidavits and...uh...Gabe was the first one able to make use of it. </sentence><sentence id="452">So he went straight...uh...you know, as a important little passenger on the ship, he could close the door and luckily he missed...uh... most of the terrible things...uh...that happened afterwards. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="456">Q: Why did the rest of you not go with him? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="458">A: Well, ...uh...it took time. </sentence><sentence id="459">Affidavits, you know, affidavits, the processing and everything...uh...wasn't such a simple and easy matter. </sentence><sentence id="460">It took...uh...it took father almost a year...uh...to get out...uh...for instance. </sentence><sentence id="461">Uh...Leo...Leo was the second one who left, but...but his...uh...exodus was fraught with difficulties. </sentence><sentence id="462">In the first place, in summer he tried to escape over the border into France and he went with a friend by the name of .And...uh...he was caught by the French police and returned. </sentence><sentence id="463">And...uh...since...since my brother was...he was a very handsome fellow and quite a personality I would say...uh...He had no difficulty with the German border police and there were some SR SS men there. </sentence><sentence id="464">Uh...He had no problem whatsoever and they just let him go. </sentence><sentence id="465">Yal. </sentence><sentence id="466">And he returned to Vienna. </sentence><sentence id="467">And L...I still remember him coming up the street. </sentence><sentence id="468">I happened to be outside, and he was tanned and he...he...he looked so wonderful, like somebody who came from the mountain already or something like that. </sentence><sentence id="469">Uh...Shortly after that, he...uh...he went again. </sentence><sentence id="470">He escaped by Italy and by illegal ship...uh...to Palestine. </sentence><sentence id="471">So he got into Palestine, it was probably late summer of 1938, and when war broke out...uh... early in 1940 in Germany he volunteered. </sentence><sentence id="472">And he fought through all the campaigns...uh...so...uh...in North Africa and...uh... practically the whole length of Italy. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="490">Q: With which army? </sentence></p></dialogue>

Unfortunately, we didn't know. </sentence><sentence id="1059">The world didn't know how to cope with this psychological situation at the time so they thought you got out of it. </sentence><sentence id="1060">Let's forget it. </sentence><sentence id="1061">And that is essentially what happen, except you may forget it, but it doesn't forget you and...uh...it just goes on living within you. </sentence><sentence id="1062">Alright. </sentence><sentence id="1063">Uh...The Kristallnacht and its generally known that...uh...what triggered it was...uh...the assignation by a young Jewish boy...I think his name was...uh...Green... </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1088">Q: Don't worry about that. </sentence><sentence id="1089">What happened...Where were you at Kristallnacht? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1092">A: Okay. </sentence><sentence id="1093">Uh...I was on Kristallnacht, actually that day I was...I was in the carpentry workshop. </sentence><sentence id="1094">And...uh...I mentioned before the telephone call came so when the manager of the workshop took the call and turned to us and said, "Look. </sentence><sentence id="1095">There is something going on in town. </sentence><sentence id="1096">You'll be better off at home." </sentence><sentence id="1097">We knew immediately what...what is going to be. </sentence><sentence id="1098">We packed our...our stuff and...uh...we...uh... went...went home. </sentence><sentence id="1099">I remember... had forgotten where this ...this carpentry workshop was, but I should imagine by the appearance of the...uh...the neighborhood because I was waiting for a train. </sentence><sentence id="1100">I took a train, but I know what kind of..-uh... streets we went through. </sentence><sentence id="1101">Uh...It seemed to have been the inner city which is an unusual place for a workshop because these were splendid buildings. </sentence><sentence id="1102">And I remember standing...you see the...the...the trains in Vienna had an open platform...uh...either at...at the rear end so you could easily jump on and off and you could be standing there. </sentence><sentence id="1103">And I was standing along side. </sentence><sentence id="1104">It was close to me. </sentence><sentence id="1105">There was an elegant couple and, you know, in those times when people were elegant, they were elegant. </sentence><sentence id="1106">There was a very attractive lady and she was dressed in a beautiful silk dress it seemed to me, and a gentlemen and she was looking at the newspaper and seeing something and she turned to the man and said, "Look at this terrible things they're doing to the Jews in Germany. </sentence><sentence id="1107">Surely, this couldn't happen here." </sentence><sentence id="1108">I remember those words because...uh...first of all, there are a lot of... Really, the only words I remember from that...from that period actually spoken because within a few seconds or a few minutes or moments or very short time after that, we passed a side street. </sentence><sentence id="1109">The train went on a side street and there was this magnificent temple in flames. </sentence><sentence id="1110">And there was a Jew in costume with a long beard. </sentence><sentence id="1111">Obviously he must have been praying in the synagogue and he was running and there was a crowd running after him and he was like one of those you know, in the classic books that I was reading. </sentence><sentence id="1112">Uh...with a poem by Sheller about a Kraut chasing something or other. </sentence><sentence id="1113">And you flash by. </sentence><sentence id="1114">I mean the train, you know, how long does it take. </sentence><sentence id="1115">It was just a. And it was an ironic commentary on what that lady said...uh..to the man. </sentence><sentence id="1116">I remember coming home, which was actually the apartment of my sister and...uh...there I knocked on the door and you must...and you must...uh...not remember because you don't know of this, but bear in mind that these were heavy reinforced doors with not only massive...uh...wood, but also not the kind of plywood that is used now, but genuine oak or something like, but also...uh...uh...steel bars inside. </sentence><sentence id="1117">There's a whole...there's a whole steel door inside. </sentence><sentence id="1118">So these were fortresses. </sentence><sentence id="1119">I don't know why they were fortresses because there were very few thefts there. </sentence><sentence id="1120">But nonetheless, at least before the Nazis, in which case these were really thefts, but...uh...these...these doors were difficult to break down. </sentence><sentence id="1121">When I came home they very cautiously opened the door. </sentence><sentence id="1122">My...I found there my...my...my mother, my sister and her baby. </sentence><sentence id="1123">Her baby was...uh...only about 2 months old at the time. </sentence><sentence id="1124">Rose was born in August 1938. </sentence><sentence id="1125">So I can...I can position this in time because I...she was born in August 1938. </sentence><sentence id="1126">I left on the 18th of December 38. </sentence><sentence id="1127">Of course, it's the Kristallnacht, 11th of November. </sentence><sentence id="1128">Well, I knew that before. </sentence><sentence id="1129">So...uh...she was 2 months...2 months old. </sentence><sentence id="1130">And Father wasn't there. </sentence><sentence id="1131">I believe he must have been arrested. </sentence><sentence id="1132">And...uh...my brother-in- law had been arrested. </sentence><sentence id="1133">My...my sister says that happened on the morning of the Kristallnacht, but at any rate I know that he was...uh...sent to Dachau and he was in Dachau in fact over...over half a year. </sentence><sentence id="1134">Uh...How he got out of it alive, but...uh..and he went through terrible time there. </sentence><sentence id="1135">In any case, when I came home, something strange happened. </sentence><sentence id="1136">I mean I was always the youngster, the kid and so on. </sentence><sentence id="1137">And now L...I was the only man. </sentence><sentence id="1138">And I don't know whether this is some genetics or the biology of relatives, I just...I...the diffident, the shy, the book worm and so on, assumed control quite naturally and I said, "If somebody comes, we won't open the door. </sentence><sentence id="1139">We just don't open." </sentence><sentence id="1140">And this...well, my sister was always a person...my sister was not a person who was very assertive. </sentence><sentence id="1141">In any case, she would have taken a rather quiet role in the background. </sentence><sentence id="1142">But my mother was a very courageous person. </sentence><sentence id="1143">But I think as a result of all that had happened...of what happened to Father...of the fact that both of them were arrested, she became...she was very quiet and she just accepted...uh...my suggestion without any demurring. </sentence><sentence id="1144">Well, we didn't have to wait long. </sentence><sentence id="1145">Shortly after, it was before lunch time, we heard these...uh...very well known...uh... boots beating on the door and they weren't just beating on the door, generally accompanied by shouts...open up this that and so on. </sentence><sentence id="1146">We didn't open. </sentence><sentence id="1147">And I think probably...I have gone through some different phases in my life, but this must have been one of them because...uh... we tiptoed into the kitchen and so as not to be seen from outside or so we were on the fifth floor, but the house was built around the court yard and you could have looked in from the opposite wing. </sentence><sentence id="1148">So we had to stand pressed against the wall. </sentence><sentence id="1149">And my sister had to put her hand on the mouth of the baby. </sentence><sentence id="1150">It was a 2 month old baby. </sentence><sentence id="1151">And always be afraid that either she might stifle her inadvertently or that the baby would cry. </sentence><sentence id="1152">And here these men were battering on the door and you know, with the jack boots you can subject a door to some treatment and it went on, it seemed to me, for an eternity. </sentence><sentence id="1153">And what went through my mind was the scene of in Crime and Punishment. </sentence><sentence id="1154">was a criminal. </sentence><sentence id="1155">Yal. </sentence><sentence id="1156">But nonetheless, it was a scene of the most...and they were standing there in, I believe in the kitchen, after having committed the deed, and they hear some...some steps going up and then the door rattling and he is afraid that the lock might...might open up because...uh...this...uh...was just some...some kind of...uh... what do you call it in English? </sentence><sentence id="1157">It's...uh...we call it a..[t wasn't...it wasn't locked with a key, but it was locked with some...some kind of mechanical device. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1227">Q: Yal. </sentence><sentence id="1228">I know what you mean. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1231">A: Uh...And that scene flashed through my mind because I was always living half in the book and half outside. </sentence><sentence id="1232">And then we...and we could hear everything that was going on outside and then...uh...one man said to the other...apparently, he was the leader of the group. </sentence><sentence id="1233">He said to the other, "or whatever the name was, Go down and fetch a crow bar." </sentence><sentence id="1234">And this fellow went down. </sentence><sentence id="1235">And, of course, our...way back...uh...was closed. </sentence><sentence id="1236">We couldn't open. </sentence><sentence id="1237">They would have thrown us out the window. </sentence><sentence id="1238">At that moment, the door from a neighboring apartment opened and there was a woman... I had never spoken to her. </sentence><sentence id="1239">Mother had never spoken to her. </sentence><sentence id="1240">I don't know whether my daughter knew her. </sentence><sentence id="1241">She was a Gentile obviously. </sentence><sentence id="1242">And she said, "You know, I saw them go out about a hour ago. </sentence><sentence id="1243">You're wasting your time"...or words to that effect. </sentence><sentence id="1244">You could hear everything in that apartment. </sentence><sentence id="1245">You could hear things through the door. </sentence><sentence id="1246">And they went away. </sentence><sentence id="1247">And in the afternoon, they came back. </sentence><sentence id="1248">And, of course, I had said, "Look. </sentence><sentence id="1249">They come back in the afternoon. </sentence><sentence id="1250">We open immediately. </sentence><sentence id="1251">I don't want to go through this again." </sentence><sentence id="1252">Yal. </sentence><sentence id="1253">So when they came, we opened straight away. </sentence><sentence id="1254">But I, you know, my temper was...was sort of moving up, you know, again and I decided that I was going to sit at...uh... the coffee table in the saloon...uh...drinking a cup of coffee or tea or whatever was there as if...uh... 1 couldn't care a damn about what was going on, just to show my disdain, you understand. </sentence><sentence id="1255">I thought that this would make a significant impression. </sentence><sentence id="1256">I was really, you know, half serious, half child...uh. </sentence><sentence id="1257">And that's what I did. </sentence><sentence id="1258">And they came in and my sister had...uh...a side porch, you know with sliding glass doors and she displayed all kinds of...uh...lots of precious things...porcelain, crystal...uh...the things that you got for our wedding...uh...heirlooms, stuff of that sort. </sentence><sentence id="1259">And, of course, they were after it. </sentence><sentence id="1260">And one of the Nazis, a kind of clumsy fellow, who had never handled doors like this tried to open and he sort of fumbled around and he couldn't figure out how this...this door opened. </sentence><sentence id="1261">Yal. </sentence><sentence id="1262">Because the only door probably that he...he got to know was the door on hinges. </sentence><sentence id="1263">And I could see him sort of...1 could almost read his mind...and holding his foot, his leg up in order to kick the door in, and I jumped up. </sentence><sentence id="1264">Yal. </sentence><sentence id="1265">And confronted him as much as I could confront him. </sentence><sentence id="1266">I mean my head was probably the height of his breast bone. </sentence><sentence id="1267">And I said you know...and I again remember the words verbatim...there are two ways of opening this door. </sentence><sentence id="1268">I said, "One is you lift your leg and kick it in like that, and I just imitated what he was doing, and the other one is like this and I put out one little finger and I just made the door open. </sentence><sentence id="1269">And don't you think that's a better way. </sentence><sentence id="1270">And I looked him in the face and he looked back and no words were exchanged...no further word was exchanged between us. </sentence><sentence id="1271">And, of course, they packed all the stuff up and took it away and walked out. </sentence><sentence id="1272">And that was another visit. </sentence><sentence id="1273">It was the most terrible because of what happened in the morning and that could have easily ended up, as I say, with our flying out of the window. </sentence><sentence id="1274">Uh...If you don't mind, a few things occur to me. </sentence><sentence id="1275">I want to go back to them. </sentence><sentence id="1276">First of all (clearing throat), there was first of all two...two personal encounters and...uh...that I think of. </sentence><sentence id="1277">Uh...I had...I told you before that I had...I had learned in some way that in certain critical situations I could face up to things and somehow assert control. </sentence><sentence id="1278">It was almost a kind of...uh...psychological insight...some...some measure of certainty that I had at the time. </sentence><sentence id="1279">Some...some voice that came to me from outside myself. </sentence><sentence id="1280">And I remember that one of the times it happened was even before the Nazis came in. </sentence><sentence id="1281">Uh...It was winter time and I was dressed...uh...in a very nice winter coat. </sentence><sentence id="1282">It was a new coat. </sentence><sentence id="1283">with a herringbone and a velvet collar. </sentence><sentence id="1284">And here was a much bigger boat but ragged, obviously from very poor circumstances who came up and our steps met at the corner and I knew that he wasn't going to shake my hands. </sentence><sentence id="1285">I realized that he was gonna beat me up. </sentence><sentence id="1286">And I always had empathy for the underdog. </sentence><sentence id="1287">I had a very, very strong empathy. </sentence><sentence id="1288">I had really always a strong heart for poor people, for animals, for all things of that sort, and I felt ashamed actually of my...of our circumstances. </sentence><sentence id="1289">Even so, God knows,,...uh...I was luxuriating my...the presence of the coat with normally books, you know, or games of skills. </sentence><sentence id="1290">They never bought me a model set because I might break my leg or something, which I probably would have (chuckle) if they bought me one. </sentence><sentence id="1291">But I always had that...that feeling that...uh...I felt uncomfortable of having more than somebody else and so | didn't have to fake anything. </sentence><sentence id="1292">I...I really had an understanding for him and a feeling for him. </sentence><sentence id="1293">And it may have been this fact that sort of edged away fear because it took the place of fear. </sentence><sentence id="1294">It was...it was the feeling that possessed me. </sentence><sentence id="1295">And I said to him...uh..."You know, I want...uh...there's something I want to tell you." </sentence><sentence id="1296">And I said it in a way that...uh...somehow or other seemed to engage him, seemed to engage his interest. </sentence><sentence id="1297">I was listening and I told him about the fact that I wanted to go to Palestine and that many of us, even those of us who come from so-called...uh...homes that were more affluent really wanted to choose this life for ourselves and that I understand where he came from and understand his circumstances that...that many of...of friends of mine, people I know have chosen a life of work on the land, hard work. </sentence><sentence id="1298">Yal. </sentence><sentence id="1299">And there wasn't really as much difference between us as might appear. </sentence><sentence id="1300">And that I wasn't responsible for the fact that...that he was poor and that he was in difficult circumstances and we almost became friendly and they told...he told me about the fact that his father was beating him up and so on and so forth and, you know, his father was a drunkard. </sentence><sentence id="1301">But I will never forget the words that he said to me at the end and the words were...and this was a poor, maybe semi-literate, ragged youth, maybe a year before the Nazis came...I would say about... He says, "You know, Hitler is going to come here and then I am sorry.... am going to be sorry for all of you." </sentence><sentence id="1302">And these are words that I have forgotten easily. </sentence><sentence id="1303">That was one encounter. </sentence><sentence id="1304">The other one was already under the..-under the Nazis. </sentence><sentence id="1305">I was...uh...1 think walking home at the time and...it was and it was the place where our shul was, the little synagogue. </sentence><sentence id="1306">Uh... There were sitting in the front pew. </sentence><sentence id="1307">My father incidentally was the vice-president of the other group, which is...which was a Zionist philanthropic organization. </sentence><sentence id="1308">And my father was very active in public affairs and as a philanthropist, something that once saved him from the Nazis because I remember in a procession...procession that came by, and I was sort of listening at the window, and somebody was shouting, "Let's take old Schmeltzer," and...uh...somebody else said, "Oh, leave him. </sentence><sentence id="1309">At least he helps his own kind." </sentence><sentence id="1310">So strange things happened...uh...even in those times. </sentence><sentence id="1311">There was this shul in the and I was not far away. </sentence><sentence id="1312">As a matter of fact, midway up that street, in the where our shul was. </sentence><sentence id="1313">Our shul was at the corner of the where we lived in this. </sentence><sentence id="1314">Midway up there was a restaurant at that time. </sentence><sentence id="1315">And as I was walking...probably...I don't remember exactly whether I was walking home or walking away from...at any rate I suddenly was surrounded by something like a dozen boys. </sentence><sentence id="1316">It was like a ring around me. </sentence><sentence id="1317">And there were closing in on me. </sentence><sentence id="1318">And it was clear that they were going to beat me up. </sentence><sentence id="1319">All of them! </sentence><sentence id="1320">Together! </sentence><sentence id="1321">And again that particular sense came over me that allowed me to detach myself from my personal circumstance and take on another voice. </sentence><sentence id="1322">It was almost as if I was reading a book. </sentence><sentence id="1323">And imagination has its place at times. </sentence><sentence id="1324">And I said to them...[...I raised my hand because I realized you know, I have to do something that attracts attention...I raised my hand at the time and said, "Look. </sentence><sentence id="1325">Before you beat me up, I have something interesting to tell you. </sentence><sentence id="1326">And, of course, you know, rich boy...I mean...everybody is curious... mean no matter what. </sentence><sentence id="1327">I said, You know, what's happening here. </sentence><sentence id="1328">There's a dozen of you Gentiles, Christians who want to beat up one of me, one Jew. </sentence><sentence id="1329">Now what are you doing there. </sentence><sentence id="1330">You're really declaring that one Jew is as good as 12 of you." </sentence><sentence id="1331">And that...that sort of...that sort of made them look up. </sentence><sentence id="1332">Yal. </sentence><sentence id="1333">And I said, "I am going to tell the Nazi party about it and, you see, they'll be very angry at you." ( </sentence><sentence id="1334">Laughter) God knows where this came from. </sentence><sentence id="1335">Yal. </sentence><sentence id="1336">It's really absolutely absurd. </sentence><sentence id="1337">It's ridiculous, but it somehow engaged their attention and they started to discuss this matter amongst each other.

You know, war is a terrible thing, but I have to admit it's one of the most beautiful sights that I have seen. </sentence><sentence id="1455">And to see those silver planes. </sentence><sentence id="1456">I mean if you detach yourself from the horror and to see afterwards the denotations blossoming like great yellow, red flowers and then parachuting and then when the planes burst, there was a deeper color and then, the parachutes coming down like thistles. </sentence><sentence id="1457">Yal. </sentence><sentence id="1458">That was an unforgettable sight. </sentence><sentence id="1459">L...I felt very, very proud of those fighters that went up, and I am not a military person. </sentence><sentence id="1460">But, in any case, as I said to go back or to go forward, France fell and the Germans became very cocky, very arrogant. </sentence><sentence id="1461">And some of them threw their finger across the throat when they passed us. </sentence><sentence id="1462">Yal. </sentence><sentence id="1463">And I don't know what our feelings were at the time, frankly. </sentence><sentence id="1464">I think so many things had happened to us in the beginning that suddenly, I didn't...I didn't function too much emotionally. </sentence><sentence id="1465">Yal. </sentence><sentence id="1466">Uh...And suddenly, one day they decided to evacuate us to send us either to Canada or Australia. </sentence><sentence id="1467">I am not sure. </sentence><sentence id="1468">And we were...uh...meant to go on a certain ship. </sentence><sentence id="1469">I believe the name was Andora Star. </sentence><sentence id="1470">Somehow that name stuck in my mind. </sentence><sentence id="1471">I always associated it with that particular situation. </sentence><sentence id="1472">And all the Germans...uh... in our camp were sent on the Andora Star and there were some Jewish people, including a brother of my brother-in-law, from other camps. </sentence><sentence id="1473">He was interned too, of course, who was in the Andora Star. </sentence><sentence id="1474">Now we were taken off maybe a day or two before embarkation because...uh...Jewish...the Jewish Federation it. </sentence><sentence id="1475">All kinds of people were working frantically behind the scenes with the home office, with the war office, this that and the other thing. </sentence><sentence id="1476">Look...what...this...our Jewish with the... They are boys. </sentence><sentence id="1477">What you want to send them to Canada or Australia for with Germans. </sentence><sentence id="1478">They took us off the last moment. </sentence><sentence id="1479">You know what happened to the Andora Star. </sentence><sentence id="1480">It was torpedoed. </sentence><sentence id="1481">My brother-in-law's brother was killed among the others and later on when I was in again in another place called... I met one of the rare Jewish survivors of that ship incidentally so I...so I...1 know the story all around. </sentence><sentence id="1482">And what he told me was that when the ship was torpedoed, the Jews were down in the steerage. </sentence><sentence id="1483">I mean they were down, and the Germans and the British were up and they were close to...and they...they took possession of all the lifeboats and the Jews were not allowed into the life boats and he was swimming along and he said he must have been in the water a hour or so. </sentence><sentence id="1484">You can't measure time in that condition. </sentence><sentence id="1485">And he was almost losing his last ounce of strength, just couldn't go on and there was this life boat near him and he managed to swim up to it and stretch out his hand and get hold of it. </sentence><sentence id="1486">And I have to say this ironic episode that happened was that a British person...a British, one of the mates of the ship, said, "Sorry, old boy. </sentence><sentence id="1487">You know, full up. </sentence><sentence id="1488">This is not the last boat." </sentence><sentence id="1489">And the Germans said, "Oh, let the poor bastard on." </sentence><sentence id="1490">And they pulled him up and so he was saved. </sentence><sentence id="1491">Yal. </sentence><sentence id="1492">And I think he must have been one of the very, very, very rare Jewish survivors from the Andora Star. </sentence><sentence id="1493">And there was another occasion when death was just moving past me as if he didn't know me...or didn't know me or didn't really want to know me...uh...and...and...and many...many other people have stories of this kind. </sentence><sentence id="1494">And those of us who escaped...uh...many of us had many escapes before you could finally get away. </sentence><sentence id="1495">That takes us up to...uh...beyond...beyond the Andora Star and the return to...to internment to Lensfield. </sentence><sentence id="1496">No...We didn't return. </sentence><sentence id="1497">They didn't take us out, of course. </sentence><sentence id="1498">We remained in Lensfield, but shortly afterwards...uh...we were finally released and I remember the commandant of the camp wept. </sentence><sentence id="1499">Uh..There were a number of sterling British figures I have to say. </sentence><sentence id="1500">Uh...As I told...as I told you, Britain is one of the countries I have warm affection. </sentence><sentence id="1501">It's not that everybody was a saint, but you make an overall appraisal of a nation, of a civilization and in England I loved them and my...my brother in Palestine did not. </sentence><sentence id="1502">He saw...he saw the British from another...another angle, but I have to say that I experienced them in their own country and there are some just lovely, marvelous...uh...persons there and the general tone is...is...is just lot more civilized than the one I encountered generally in Austria. </sentence><sentence id="1503">I have to say that. </sentence><sentence id="1504">Very different. </sentence><sentence id="1505">Now...uh...uh...there was another officer there in the internment camp. </sentence><sentence id="1506">We called him Auntie. </sentence><sentence id="1507">We called him Auntie because he was such a passionately devoted soul. </sentence><sentence id="1508">He was such a lovely man. </sentence><sentence id="1509">Out of his own pockets, he would buy us things...socks and undergarments and stuff. </sentence><sentence id="1510">He was another one who cried when we left. </sentence><sentence id="1511">Yal. </sentence><sentence id="1512">He was a marvelous person. </sentence><sentence id="1513">Now...Don't...don't think that every British was like this, but you don't need to meet that many persons and they do leave...uh...a strong...uh...impression behind them. </sentence><sentence id="1514">Yal. </sentence><sentence id="1515">They sort of light the way. </sentence><sentence id="1516">It's almost as if fate...uh...has decided well, you know, you've gone through this, that and the other. </sentence><sentence id="1517">We'll send you a little light. </sentence><sentence id="1518">Yal. </sentence><sentence id="1519">So afterwards, when I got out of the internment...uh...there was an episode and here I am not absolutely certain about the...uh... timing of things or the sequence of events, but I know that my sister was evacuated to Spalding and I managed to be there. </sentence><sentence id="1520">I managed to be for a few months there, working the land, because I was then at the time on the war essential work order. </sentence><sentence id="1521">Uh...just to be close to her and I managed to survive some bombing attacks that practically pulled the house down over us because the Germans mistook Spalding for which was a nearby railroad station, you know. </sentence><sentence id="1522">And they bombed...they released all the bombs on Spalding. </sentence><sentence id="1523">Uh...Amongst other things...uh...they destroyed the zoo and killed a lot of animals there. </sentence><sentence id="1524">Uh...After that I...] was in...uh...I was in London for some time and I can't date that. </sentence><sentence id="1525">I know that I worked in a factory. </sentence><sentence id="1526">I know that L...uh...I thought up ways of speeding up production by a multiple of 2 or 3 by...because there were more machines there than...than people. </sentence><sentence id="1527">And I worked out a mathematical system whereby you could keep 3 or 4 machines in operation, you know, only attended by | person. </sentence><sentence id="1528">And you could do it faultlessly. </sentence><sentence id="1529">It wasn't even difficult. </sentence><sentence id="1530">However, I was watched by the supervisor. </sentence><sentence id="1531">You know it is very strange, you know. </sentence><sentence id="1532">And incidentally, I had a similar encounter because not everybody in Britain was giving their best for the war effort obviously, but many did and many were very heroic. </sentence><sentence id="1533">So again, humanity and with all its...but...uh...there was another occasion in Spalding. </sentence><sentence id="1534">In Spalding...uh...I worked for a period of time in the sugar refinery near the laboratory and...uh...I had...uh...another encounter of a similar nature where I wanted to be a little more productive than a certain person, a certain woman and...uh... She then...She became so angry with me because she...because I was in the laboratory...I was supposed to be testing the molasses in the various stages of preparation as to be come to refinement. </sentence><sentence id="1535">And she spread the story about me that I was a German spy. </sentence><sentence id="1536">But unfortunately...fortunately, rather, she was known as a liar. </sentence><sentence id="1537">Nobody paid any credence to her. </sentence><sentence id="1538">Uh...I was also in Cambridge. </sentence><sentence id="1539">So that was a very intense time. </sentence><sentence id="1540">I was also in Cambridge at some time...uh...but this was after I had gotten to... I returned to... It was in... That was a place around... You know... the great...uh...1 am making and liquor making and so on. </sentence><sentence id="1541">And we...we were living there in really terrible conditions. </sentence><sentence id="1542">The difference between and was difference between night and day...day and night rather because was an unsanitary camp. </sentence><sentence id="1543">It had been condemned by the British. </sentence><sentence id="1544">It had no facilities, no toilet facilities even and so on and so forth. </sentence><sentence id="1545">And we worked like slaves on the land. </sentence><sentence id="1546">I was there for about half a year. </sentence><sentence id="1547">Uh...I eventually left and I went to Cambridge. </sentence><sentence id="1548">I was followed by some of the...uh...at that time, a friend of mine, my alter ego almost and he went to Cambridge and...uh...I had the childish idea that I only needed to go to Cambridge and all universities would open their door and say, "Herr Schmeltzer, you know, now you are here. </sentence><sentence id="1549">Why didn't you come earlier? </sentence><sentence id="1550">You see, we have just the place for you." </sentence><sentence id="1551">Well, I ended up as a gardener in College. ( </sentence><sentence id="1552">Laughter) And I have to tell you it's...it's a really amusing little tale because at that time I was preparing...I was on one of my studies. </sentence><sentence id="1553">You see, in...in Vienna because my parents" forced me to study. </sentence><sentence id="1554">I didn't want to do it. </sentence><sentence id="1555">But once I had left and I wasn't under constraint, I felt that what I most passionately wanted in life was to study. </sentence><sentence id="1556">Yal. </sentence><sentence id="1557">I always read intensively and extensively, you understand. </sentence><sentence id="1558">Now I wanted to study. </sentence><sentence id="1559">So I thought going to Cambridge somehow or other was all you needed to do and say here I am and that's it. </sentence><sentence id="1560">Well, as I say, I became a gardener and I... am ashamed to say I used part of my time actually for study purposes. </sentence><sentence id="1561">What I did was that I...1 organized the study plan to two areas. </sentence><sentence id="1562">Uh...the...uh...liberal art things if you like, languages and literature and that kind of stuff and grammar, I had this little notebook that I could hold in the palm of my hand. </sentence><sentence id="1563">Mathematics and other things...mathematics I would rake out and smooth out a plot of land, you know, and I would... would draw geometric figures and so on on the land and work them out. </sentence><sentence id="1564">And then I would enter them in a little notebook. </sentence><sentence id="1565">But it turned out that the which were an administrative group of they were looking behind the window sills you know in the stately buildings and they were observing this strange person who was drawing figures in the soil, you understand. </sentence><sentence id="1566">And they couldn't figure out what it was I was actually doing, but it seemed to occupy me for an enormously length of periods of time and I seemed to be absolutely obsessed with it. </sentence><sentence id="1567">So I was eventually called there and the words that...that I...that they said to me were, you know, we have observed you over a period of time and...uh...frankly, most of the time you seemed to be scratching things in the ground or looking at the palm of your hand. </sentence><sentence id="1568">We couldn't figure out what it is you are doing, but you didn't do enough work so I am afraid we have to fire you. </sentence><sentence id="1569">So I drew myself up to...and I am not very enormous length at the time...I said, "I am really ashamed of you because this is supposed to be an intellectual...uh... institution and...uh...I can tell you that Iam probably more intelligent than any of the students you have, but they have lots more money than I have and if you were really an institution of learning and not of money, you would say, "Look. </sentence><sentence id="1570">We really want you here as a student, but obviously you don't know anything about things of that sort. </sentence><sentence id="1571">Good Day." </sentence><sentence id="1572">And I walked out. </sentence><sentence id="1573">And afterwards I was really kind of...I was almost trembling because I wasn't...I wasn't cock sure at all. </sentence><sentence id="1574">Yal. </sentence><sentence id="1575">I think it was...it was part of my general nature. </sentence><sentence id="1576">Anger that was kind of spilling out, you know. </sentence><sentence id="1577">In retrospect...uh...there was very little...they... they... they...that they could do about it. </sentence><sentence id="1578">I guess they were only acting according to their best understanding of the way the world worked. </sentence><sentence id="1579">And I was little...a bit outside the scheme of things. </sentence><sentence id="1580">So after Cambridge I thought...I almost...almost was 18. </sentence><sentence id="1581">I wanted to volunteer to be a fighter pilot. </sentence><sentence id="1582">Maybe this period of the planes flying over...also the fact...the fact that L..I just wanted to...to...] wanted revenge. </sentence></p></dialogue>
