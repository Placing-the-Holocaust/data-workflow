<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="644">A: Well, it started right after the end of hostilities in October 1939. </sentence><sentence id="645">I have a feeling -- it's a very well known fact that they were prepared for things, for the defeat, because after all, the Germans were very well prepared and we are a poor nation. </sentence><sentence id="646">We were not able to be prepared to such an extent as Germans were. </sentence><sentence id="647">So, they made plans for underground activities because they were hoping that the Allies in the West, England and France would definitely help. </sentence><sentence id="648">Sooner or later, we'll have to be prepared, officially if the Army is no longer in existence at least underground is active. </sentence><sentence id="649">So, they started organizing right away, 1940. </sentence><sentence id="650">On two levels, first of all the most important level was the military preparation. </sentence><sentence id="651">And the other level was the civil administration because they had to keep a network of people for the administration in case of the German occupation will collapse we'll have to take it over. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="660">Q: Did everyone know about it then and how did you find out about it and how was communication take place? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="662">A: Well, one day in , men I used to know when I used to go to high school, came and he says that he reprsents the underground organization would I be willing to join that. </sentence><sentence id="663">Things are -- with my background because I was active in boy scouts for all my life. </sentence><sentence id="664">I was a boy scout, scout master at the very end. </sentence><sentence id="665">Military preparation and training, so you will have to join us and help us. </sentence><sentence id="666">So, I agreed, and I had to be sworn in and originally we started with a small unit like I'd say 85 people that we could know of each other. </sentence><sentence id="667">The first assignment was just to take care of the weapons, prepare the weapons, hide them and keep them. </sentence><sentence id="668">That was quite an extensive activity and many people were involved in that. </sentence><sentence id="669"> 0 Another area was training. </sentence><sentence id="670">Of course other guys like say myself I was about 22 years old at the time, so I didn't have to be trained, but I had to be an instructor in a little group of say ten young fellows. </sentence><sentence id="671">I had to train them. </sentence><sentence id="672">Later on I was asked to join the officers group because I wasn't an officer. </sentence><sentence id="673">So, I took part in the training of that underground officers school. </sentence><sentence id="674">Of course we had lectures. </sentence><sentence id="675">We had all kinds of assignments outside in the woods. </sentence><sentence id="676">All kinds of instructors, professional officers from the Polish Army, experts on explosives. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="696">A: That was training after the level of sergeant, but I was there about six months maybe, and in my school I was about seven, eight months, at the officers school. </sentence><sentence id="697">Of course, that was in hiding. </sentence><sentence id="698">We are meeting -- only once I remember they decided to do some exercises in the field so we met, about twenty people there. </sentence><sentence id="699">Some of them friends, some of them from different areas, from different cities, but anyway no more than that. </sentence><sentence id="700">Besides the assignment was to concentrate on the communications to interrupt communications, to destroy telephone communication, to destroy some of the bridges. </sentence><sentence id="701">So we concentrated on the explosives, theory and some exercises with the real stuff, but not too much because it was very expensive and dangerous. </sentence><sentence id="702">It was dangerous, so we kept this to the minimum. </sentence><sentence id="703">We took part in the organized group we took part in certain things like I mentioned that the compulsory collection of the farm products, of the registers. </sentence><sentence id="704">Each small city had a register, extensive control of the people, of the farmers, of the amounts of farm products to be delivered. </sentence><sentence id="705">There was official record of that and they kept that in those offices in the administration of the cities. </sentence><sentence id="706">So, at one point, the underground authorities decided to destroy all of this just to show that the Germans will be helpless in case like that. </sentence><sentence id="707">They lose control of what was delivered, what is supposed to be delivered. </sentence><sentence id="708">They lost control of it so we worked on that systematically. </sentence><sentence id="709">We are destroying, and it worked very well, because people were able to hide more food for themselves. </sentence><sentence id="710">The Germans started panicking because so little food was delivered. </sentence><sentence id="711">OF course the communication, the communication was a very important thing in a case like that. </sentence><sentence id="712">We had our own communication between cities, so in other words, we knew in advance that the Gestapo is coming to our place. </sentence><sentence id="713">But the official way, there was no telephone because we destroyed the telephone connections. </sentence><sentence id="714">But we knew because we had our own networks. </sentence><sentence id="715">End of Tape #1  1 Tape #2 </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="736">Q: Let's go back and talk about the communication and how you knew the Gestapo was coming? </sentence><sentence id="737">How did the communications get to you? --- </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="740">A: We had a person working for the Post Office, the local Post Office. </sentence><sentence id="741">She was my future sister-in-law, and she was a member of my group, and at the same time she was in contact with a similar person working in a place in Hymernick (ph), which is about 18 miles away, and it was the headquarters of German police. </sentence><sentence id="742">So, of course, every movement of the police was observed and they have some people who were interested in knowing what they were planning to do next, where they were planning to go. </sentence><sentence id="743">So, there was a connection, and the intelligence knew roughly, I mean in most cases they know where they are going and when and so they would notify the person working in the Post Office in Hymernick (ph), who in turn would call our Zosha (ph), my sister-in-law and she would know in say half an hour they will be here so get ready. </sentence><sentence id="744">She would send a message on a bike. </sentence><sentence id="745">My younger brother used to come to me and then we spreading, used other people, so we used to disappear from the place for the duration of that visit. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="752">Q: Tell me what your parents knew about what you were doing and what they thought? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="754">A: Well, my parents, of course, they knew that I was involved in something, especially early in 1939 and early 1940 because some strangers were coming, people they didn't know from my organization used to visit me on special assignments. </sentence><sentence id="755">I used to disappear for a number of days. </sentence><sentence id="756">So, naturally at home there were always questions, where have you been. </sentence><sentence id="757">You better watch out. </sentence><sentence id="758">This is not good. </sentence><sentence id="759">You'll have to pay for this one day. </sentence><sentence id="760">Be careful. </sentence><sentence id="761">So, they knew quite well. </sentence><sentence id="762">Of course, I wasn't going to tell them the details, obviously I am involved and I should actually -- you should give me your blessings not to criticize me on that. </sentence><sentence id="763">My parents understood and they were 100 percent behind me. </sentence><sentence id="764">My father, naturally, was very much affected by what was going on because the Gestapo used to come a couple of times a month, at the beginning especially, and they used to call him and they used to ask him questions about my activities before I got arrested, naturally. </sentence><sentence id="765">They wanted to simply to coordinate things which they know with what was happening, but of course, my father didn't tell them anything. </sentence><sentence id="766">But he paid, with his health forms, because this was too much tension, too much aggravation, and he was suffering from some heart problems, and eventually he had a heart attack in 1945. </sentence><sentence id="767">He couldn't take it anymore. </sentence><sentence id="768">So, that was -- my mother survived, she was probably physically stronger and was able to survive that. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1488">A: Well, the organization was the smallest unit, was I don't know how it was equivalent to a post which would be corresponding to a small town. </sentence><sentence id="1489">Several posts would be a county, more or less corresponding to a county and several counties again, would be like a district and so forth. </sentence><sentence id="1490">On our level, it was the smallest unit in the organization. </sentence><sentence id="1491">Of course, we had a division of activities was first of all the military activities which included training and preparation for a specific assignments. </sentence><sentence id="1492">Collecting of weapons, ammunition, maintenance, and that will be the military part, as far as I remember. </sentence><sentence id="1493">Then would be a part like a diversion of sabotage. </sentence><sentence id="1494">Sabotage would have to perform certain tasks, disruption of communication in general or in particular cases according to the situation, according to the needs. </sentence><sentence id="1495">It would be run, usually by soldiers, former soldiers who used to be on active duty in Polish Army, because they used to be most of the time Junior Officers. </sentence><sentence id="1496">Then there would be the political side of it which would be the distribution of press or preparation of future needs of future administration, organizing of future councils which would be planning supply in case of uprising, would be in charge of preparation of food, supplies of food or medications, hospitals, but there was a unit also that took care of unfriendly acts of some people who were cooperating with the German authorities. </sentence><sentence id="1497">It could be done in various ways, the most common in situation would be to report some experiences some SS acts, some facts to Gestapo as an act of well loyalty I would say to Germans. </sentence><sentence id="1498">For some stupid reason he would discover that he was loyal to the German occupation. </sentence><sentence id="1499">He started to cooperate with them and he would be reporting all kinds of trespassers like , with the collection of food by farmers, stuff like that. </sentence><sentence id="1500">He would be sabotaging deliveries, so this is -- he would be reporting to Germans all kinds of irregular activities in that area, engaged in which actually were in the interest of Polish population, so these people were not too friendly to Poles. </sentence><sentence id="1501">So, I remember two or three cases that one case was a policeman of Polish nationality who was too eager to please German police, and he hurt so much Polish people, that he was reported to higher authorities, the underground Polish authorities, and the accusations were collected and facts were collected and he was executed in due course. </sentence><sentence id="1502">A similar situation was with another Pole that also was cooperating with German authorities, but not on a more or less on an economical level, like smuggling, stuff like that. </sentence><sentence id="1503">Smuggling was an important part, because a lot of people depended on smuggled food because the official quota that you got of food was not enough. </sentence><sentence id="1504">In certain circumstances you have to smuggle, or in many cases they were doing this for gain, but it was a necessary fact, necessary activity for the benefit of Polish population in general. </sentence><sentence id="1505">So if somebody was trying to disrupt this or report some activities of smugglers to German police, the act was unfriendly and if it continued for a number of occasions, so the guy deserved a penalty and in that particular case that I remember, that guy was executed. </sentence><sentence id="1506">Of course, a due course of law was applied to that situation. </sentence><sentence id="1507">There were certain underground jurist, lawyers, judges, of course not  3 employed by the current German administration, but they were original members of Polish jurisdiction. </sentence><sentence id="1508">So, they were knowledgeable. </sentence><sentence id="1509">They knew the law and they were able to issue a proper decision based on their experience and knowledge. </sentence><sentence id="1510">One case I know also, a third case, a Jew who was very friendly with the German police also reporting all kinds of activities to German police and he was I understand the story, he was warned several times not to do it. </sentence><sentence id="1511">He was even warned by some Jewish -- as a matter of fact, his family were telling him to stop that nonsense, but of course he was hoping that this way he will be able to survive, and his family, and so he was also killed. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1671">A: Well, the idea was to assemble everybody on that market place. </sentence><sentence id="1672">The younger people were able reasonably healthy people on the average, they were able to get there with their belongings, not much, small things necessary for life. </sentence><sentence id="1673">Probably they had their most valuable things on them, but anyway, the younger group could make it. </sentence><sentence id="1674">So, they were assembled around that market place and they were waiting for the older generation. </sentence><sentence id="1675">But with older people it's a different story. </sentence><sentence id="1676">So, some of them could walk and some of them could not walk. </sentence><sentence id="1677">Some of them were sick, simply sick in bed, so these people as I know from after everything was finished, they were killed on the spots by the Germans. </sentence><sentence id="1678">He couldn't walk, so he was killed. </sentence><sentence id="1679">Because later on the abandoned places, the buildings, the apartments, had to be cleaned and the dead bodies had to be removed because it was very dangerous. </sentence><sentence id="1680">So, I saw a couple of dead bodies when they were cleaning that. </sentence><sentence id="1681">There was a whole crew cleaning the place and mostly for middle age sick people or very old people, there was no chance, so they were either left in their bed, dead, or in that market place were shot, because they couldn't move. </sentence><sentence id="1682">Also, a lot of people who were sick on that march between Shedoweuf (ph) and which is I don't know about 18 miles, it was impossible for them to make it, so the older people were shot. </sentence><sentence id="1683">There were lots of dead bodies on the highway. </sentence><sentence id="1684">So that's what we prepared in the report to our authorities. </sentence><sentence id="1685">We mentioned as far as I remember it the idea was it was butchery, senseless because they simply acted like animals and they just left so much destruction and fear because everybody was psychologically -- the Polish people were very very worried after that. </sentence><sentence id="1686">I told you that the young people stopped living at their usual places of residence. </sentence><sentence id="1687">They left the houses. </sentence><sentence id="1688">Most of them went to the forest to join the partisan groups. </sentence><sentence id="1689">Others were just  6 moving to other places under assumed names with forged i.d. </sentence><sentence id="1690">cards. </sentence><sentence id="1691">That's how it started, terror, uncertainty, fear. </sentence></p></dialogue>
