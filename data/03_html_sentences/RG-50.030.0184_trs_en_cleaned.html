<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="66">A:I mean, they were talking about the war; and my father's concern was only that they're gonna take my brother--who is older than I am--and...and he's gonna get killed. </sentence><sentence id="67">That was the only concern. </sentence><sentence id="68">I mean, we didn't have a concern what's gonna happen, or the faintest idea what's gonna happen. </sentence><sentence id="69">And I...1 asked my mother, "Usually, how does a war really look? </sentence><sentence id="70">What happens?" </sentence><sentence id="71">And she told me her experience from the first world war. </sentence><sentence id="72">She said they were fighting near the railroad station. </sentence><sentence id="73">They brought up the wounded to the city. </sentence><sentence id="74">You know?And everybody sit in the house and they didn't go.... And that was the war. </sentence><sentence id="75">But it wasn't like this. </sentence><sentence id="76">The first Friday when Germany declared war, they bombed our city. </sentence><sentence id="77">I remember we got ready. </sentence><sentence id="78">We...my father brought a few sacks of flour home and...and...and oil and sugar and tea and whatever; and we stacked it up all in the attic, you know. </sentence><sentence id="79">And they figured, "We're gonna stay here until the war is over, so at least we'll have food;" because they didn't know how it's gonna turn out. </sentence><sentence id="80">But it wasn't like this. </sentence><sentence id="81">On Friday, when the...Germany crossed the Polish border...they declared war and they crossed the German border. </sentence><sentence id="82">Right away, they bombed our city. </sentence><sentence id="83">My father came running home from his business and he said, "It's very bad. </sentence><sentence id="84">It's very bad." </sentence><sentence id="85">And we ran all to the fields. </sentence><sentence id="86">And I remembered the...the corn. </sentence><sentence id="87">The fields were cut already, because when was in...in...September. </sentence><sentence id="88">And I got my...feet got all scratched up and hurt. </sentence><sentence id="89">And then we came home, and it quiet down. </sentence><sentence id="90">And a few days later the Russians came to us. </sentence><sentence id="91">Not the Germans. </sentence><sentence id="92">Because they made some kind of an agreement that the Russians will take this part, because we were so close to the River Bug. </sentence><sentence id="93">Maybe a week later, the Russians came and things weren't too bad. </sentence><sentence id="94">My father conducted his business again. </sentence><sentence id="95">And the Russian...being my father had..uh...had a wholesale from flour for the    bakery, the Russians took over one of the bakeries that my father supplied; and the officer came to sleep to us, you know, in the house. </sentence><sentence id="96">And then came all of a sudden an order that they made some kind of a pact that the Russians should go back and the Germans would come here. </sentence><sentence id="97">And he insisted and he begged my father to take his children and to go with the Russian army to Russia. " </sentence><sentence id="98">You know," he said, "the Germans are going to come. </sentence><sentence id="99">They...they're gonna do awful things to you." </sentence><sentence id="100">They knew, but we didn't. " </sentence><sentence id="101">And you have young children. </sentence><sentence id="102">They can go there in to Russia. </sentence><sentence id="103">They can study, and they can work, and you'll be alright." </sentence><sentence id="104">My father and my mother thought, "Here...here we have our home. </sentence><sentence id="105">We have our furniture. </sentence><sentence id="106">We have our things. </sentence><sentence id="107">We have our Passover dishes. </sentence><sentence id="108">We have these things." </sentence><sentence id="109">You know, at home. </sentence><sentence id="110">And we didn't want to go. </sentence><sentence id="111">My father didn't want to go. </sentence><sentence id="112">He said, "I didn't do nothing wrong. </sentence><sentence id="113">Why should I run?" </sentence><sentence id="114">You know, people who belong to the communist party or whatever, they ran. </sentence><sentence id="115">But we didn't have... my father said he doesn't have a reason why to run. </sentence><sentence id="116">He didn't go. </sentence><sentence id="117">And then the Germans took over. </sentence><sentence id="118">And when the first unit of Gestapo came into our city, they rounded up all the professionals, all the rich people, all the well-known people, all not-so-rich people, quite a few hundred...and they marched them out from the city. </sentence><sentence id="119">My brother went with my father, to be with him. </sentence><sentence id="120">They marched him out from the city in the...in the direction of Hrubieszow. </sentence><sentence id="121">That was where... Hrubieszow. </sentence><sentence id="122">And on the way they shot them all. </sentence><sentence id="123">One by one. </sentence><sentence id="124">They couldn't walk. </sentence><sentence id="125">They walked for a few days; and they shot my father, too. </sentence><sentence id="126">My brother pretended to be dead. </sentence><sentence id="127">And after they left, he had a wounded foot. </sentence><sentence id="128">He got into Be_ec. </sentence><sentence id="129">All the way...that's past Hrubieszow. </sentence><sentence id="130">It was a village. </sentence><sentence id="131">Be ec. </sentence><sentence id="132">And he hid there by a family, and got word to us that he's there. </sentence><sentence id="133">My mother went and brought him home. </sentence><sentence id="134">We nursed him, and he came back. </sentence><sentence id="135">That's how I lost my father. </sentence><sentence id="136">In 1939. </sentence><sentence id="137">He was 41 years old. </sentence><sentence id="138">And my mother, when they took us to Sobibor, we...we were...we kept my mother with us in Siedliszeze. </sentence><sentence id="139">We used to hide her during the day. </sentence><sentence id="140">In the evening, she came out. </sentence><sentence id="141">Because in Siedliszcze, in camp, we could go home. </sentence><sentence id="142"> They made like a ghetto...like a section we could come home to sleep. </sentence><sentence id="143">In the morning we went again so we...we succeeded in keeping our mother from "40...late "40 until "42, until they took us to Staw[-Nowosiolki, NB: labor camp in the Lublin district]. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="224">Q:Thank you. </sentence><sentence id="225">Let's...let's...uh...I just a little confused. </sentence><sentence id="226">Let's go back to Che_m and to you before we move on to the camps. </sentence><sentence id="227">Tell me what you did when you were still in Che_m. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="232">A:Uh...During the war? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="234">Q:During the war. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="236">A:Yeah, L...1 was the only. </sentence><sentence id="237">I had to help out. </sentence><sentence id="238">We had a little money and we had things that my father accumulated and we lived on that. </sentence><sentence id="239">We didn't live in the ghetto yet so we lived in our own house. </sentence><sentence id="240">My mother and I, we used to do little bit knitting and sew and make a little bit money with it, you know? </sentence><sentence id="241">That's the only thing my mother knew how to do is to knit very well. </sentence><sentence id="242">So she used to knit for the Polish people, for the Germans. </sentence><sentence id="243">They used to give her sugar for it, eggs. </sentence><sentence id="244">And then we could exchange this for other things. </sentence><sentence id="245">So things weren't too bad. </sentence><sentence id="246">And then I had two Polish families who were customers, my father's customers. </sentence><sentence id="247">And they really came forward with helping us, while we were.... One wife, one baker who had the bakery shop, you know, bakery.... She used to put everyday behind the fence where they had the bakery, a loaf of bread and a bag of coal--they used to bake with the wood and the coal--and a little bag with the flour, every day, and we picked it up. </sentence><sentence id="248">That was a fortune, because half we sold and could buy other things and half we used for ourselves. </sentence><sentence id="249">And then we had another one who later saved our lives. </sentence><sentence id="250">He used to help us out also a lot. </sentence><sentence id="251">He was very upset that they killed my father. </sentence><sentence id="252">He said, "If they killed your father, they took my luck  away." </sentence><sentence id="253">He believed so strongly in my father. </sentence><sentence id="254">We were very closely friends with this one. </sentence><sentence id="255">The children were close. </sentence><sentence id="256">The parents were close. </sentence><sentence id="257">We didn't...my...he didn't do nothing with...there goes back a story, which I'll get back to it later, how that relationship started. </sentence><sentence id="258">But he helped us survive, too; which was much easier than other families because if they had businesses and they had goods and that, they had to give up everything. </sentence><sentence id="259">You had to give up. </sentence><sentence id="260">You had to give up if you any forks...you had to give up if you had any silver, you had to give up if you had any gold. </sentence><sentence id="261">And the money was worthless. </sentence><sentence id="262">So the only way you could survive if you had something to exchange. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="291">Q:So they helped you? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="293">A:Oh, yeah. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="295">Q:When did it start? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="297">A:Go ahead. </sentence><sentence id="298">Go ahead. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="301">Q:When did it start to get very bad? </sentence><sentence id="302">What happened? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="305"> Ault started to get very bad the beginning of "41, when they made the ghetto. </sentence><sentence id="306">They made the ghetto; and all of a sudden they...uh...decided that all the Jews from the city have to move into one section. </sentence><sentence id="307">And they had to leave...we had to leave, like in a couple of hours. </sentence><sentence id="308">You could take only what you could take on your...back or in your hands. </sentence><sentence id="309">And they put us in with a woman with six children, in a room with a kitchen. </sentence><sentence id="310">And my mother wasn't a well woman, all those years that I can remember. </sentence><sentence id="311">And she couldn't...the poor woman couldn't sleep and she  couldn't...and she says, "I cannot stand it in..." You know, with my father gone, she lost a lot of will to live, I would say. </sentence><sentence id="312">And we decided, being we had family in Siedliszcze. </sentence><sentence id="313">At that time it wasn't a camp yet. </sentence><sentence id="314">It was just a village. </sentence><sentence id="315">So they let us know that we should come there. </sentence><sentence id="316">There's no ghetto. </sentence><sentence id="317">And we could stay there with them. </sentence><sentence id="318">There's plenty. </sentence><sentence id="319">So we packed up and we went, and we left Che_m and we went to Siedliszce. </sentence><sentence id="320">And there, it wasn't so bad. </sentence><sentence id="321">My brother worked in the mill, you know? </sentence><sentence id="322">And if he worked night shift, he used to steal some flour and some...uh... what's it called? </sentence><sentence id="323">Cream of wheat. </sentence><sentence id="324">You know? </sentence><sentence id="325">He used to put it in the cemetery behind the milk, and I used to go and pick it up at night. </sentence><sentence id="326">And it wasn't too bad. </sentence><sentence id="327">Once in awhile the gendarmerie--not the real Gestapo--used to come, and they would rob and they would steal. </sentence><sentence id="328">They would take away whatever you had, but you could live. </sentence><sentence id="329">And we stayed there until...and then they made the camp out of Siedliszcze, and again a ghetto. </sentence><sentence id="330">So we moved in also with an old lady in one room. </sentence><sentence id="331">But at that time I guess my mother got used to the conditions, and I guess the circumstances made her stronger and healthier, that she could go on. </sentence><sentence id="332">I don't know how, but she did. </sentence><sentence id="333">And we stayed...we used to go both to work, my brother and I. And she remained at home hidden. </sentence><sentence id="334">In the evening she came out and we were together. </sentence><sentence id="335">In the morning, the same thing; and that... that almost a year we were there with her. </sentence><sentence id="336">And then we heard that in May of 1942, they started with the Judenrein, you know, all of Poland. </sentence><sentence id="337">I don't know about Europe, but I, ah...Poland. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="372">Q:Excuse me. </sentence><sentence id="373">Do you mean Judenrat or Judenrein? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="376">A:Judenrein. </sentence><sentence id="377">Judenrein. </sentence><sentence id="378">Judenrats, they were all over in the meanwhile. </sentence><sentence id="379">Judenrein. </sentence><sentence id="380">And my aunt...and we knew that we're not gonna stay too much longer. </sentence><sentence id="381">So my mother's sisters from Che_m, which remained in Che_m, let us know if they should take us young--like my brother and myself--to a camp, Mom should come to them, because they believed they're    gonna be there over the winter and maybe.... So we left my mother... and all of a sudden one morning, you know, they didn't warn you or they didn't prepare you, one morning you're going away. </sentence><sentence id="382">So we packed up whatever we could, and my mother we hid; and she said at night she will go out, and she'll find a way to get to Che_m back to be with the family-- because they told us that no older people...older people...she was probably 40 or 41 cannot go...just young people. </sentence><sentence id="383">The people who worked in Siedliszcze. </sentence><sentence id="384">So my brother and I left, and it seems that my mother couldn't get in touch with her sisters because in the meanwhile they took them. </sentence><sentence id="385">They took everybody at the same time. </sentence><sentence id="386">And she got tired of sitting. </sentence><sentence id="387">That we found out after the war. </sentence><sentence id="388">Somebody who survived in Siedliszcze, that she went over to the police station and ask them they should shoot her and they shot her. </sentence><sentence id="389">That was the end. </sentence><sentence id="390">We didn't find out "til after the war. </sentence><sentence id="391">And my brother and I, we started our march from Siedliszcze. </sentence><sentence id="392">We didn't know, but it was to start in Nowosiolki, what I told you. </sentence><sentence id="393">You know?And I had a bundle and I grabbed whatever I could...new things and old things, because we felt...my mother said, "Take it. </sentence><sentence id="394">Maybe you'll be able to exchange for some....". </sentence><sentence id="395">You know in Europe, like my mother...she had old linen from my brother, and everything for the dowry in case.... You know, like they got ready for these things. </sentence><sentence id="396">And I had...I had a heavy coat on and I had those bundles and my brother had... And when I came to Nowosiolki, they...uh...rounded us up and they made in threes or in twos, and they started picking out who is going to go to work and who not. </sentence><sentence id="397">And as it came up to me, from that walk probably wading 40 kilometers in the mud. </sentence><sentence id="398">That was October. </sentence><sentence id="399">You know, in Poland, and the villages, I got...I turned yellow from aggravation. </sentence><sentence id="400">I turned yellow as a young girl. </sentence><sentence id="401">And when I came in front of those who selected...you know, who should go here, who should go there. </sentence><sentence id="402">So they put me with the old people. </sentence><sentence id="403">But one mistress of one of the Nazis who did that selecting was from Che_m, a Polish girl. </sentence><sentence id="404">And I went over and I said, "[Lee (ph)], look what they did to me." </sentence><sentence id="405">She says, "Come out." </sentence><sentence id="406">When I came out, she rubbed a little lipstick on my cheeks. </sentence><sentence id="407">I     was always very fortunate. </sentence><sentence id="408">Luck was with me. </sentence><sentence id="409">I can't say no. </sentence><sentence id="410">She rubbed a little lipstick. </sentence><sentence id="411">She said, "Take off the babushka." </sentence><sentence id="412">You know, I had a babushka; and she pushed me in again at the end of the line. </sentence><sentence id="413">And I went through with the young people. </sentence><sentence id="414">And they picked me out and the rest went; and they took us in to Staw-Nowosiolki. </sentence><sentence id="415">Staw-Nowosiolki, the conditions were unbelievable bad. </sentence><sentence id="416">So bad that one ate the other one alive almost, you know?No food. </sentence><sentence id="417">We were all pushed into one building. </sentence><sentence id="418">On top were the men. </sentence><sentence id="419">On the bottom the women. </sentence><sentence id="420">Filthy. </sentence><sentence id="421">Dirty. </sentence><sentence id="422">You know? </sentence><sentence id="423">Winter, they took us every day to work. </sentence><sentence id="424">You had to walk at least... you walked 30, 35 kilometers a day. </sentence><sentence id="425">We didn't have the proper clothing. </sentence><sentence id="426">You know? </sentence><sentence id="427">And I worked there for two months, and it were few people left over from the previous people. </sentence><sentence id="428">And they said, "Here is the last stage. </sentence><sentence id="429">From here you go to Sobibor." </sentence><sentence id="430">That's where we really found out about Sobiber, you know? </sentence><sentence id="431">We heard the rumors in May, when they send out some people from Siedliszcze, but just slight rumors. </sentence><sentence id="432">But there they told us that from here you go to Sobibor, and that's the end. </sentence><sentence id="433">And we were there... was there for two months. </sentence><sentence id="434">They gave us once a day a piece of bread, some potatoes--with the sand, with the peels, with a little water--but we had still some things from home, so we could.... Those who were from before, they had certain privileges. </sentence><sentence id="435">So they used to go into the countryside and exchange or buy; so we used to buy a little bit, you know? </sentence><sentence id="436">But the conditions were unbearable. </sentence><sentence id="437">You couldn't wash yourself. </sentence><sentence id="438">I remember my friend [NB: Hella Felenbaum or Zelda Metz] and myself; she escaped from Sobibor, too. </sentence><sentence id="439">She's not alive anymore. </sentence><sentence id="440">There was a river flowing behind that building. </sentence><sentence id="441">We used to go out at night and break the ice in order to be able to wash ourself. </sentence><sentence id="442">We didn't catch cold again. </sentence><sentence id="443">We didn't catch cold. </sentence><sentence id="444">Isn't that amazing? </sentence><sentence id="445">We didn't have no vitamins. </sentence><sentence id="446">Nothing! </sentence><sentence id="447">And there I was for two months. </sentence><sentence id="448">Those were the worst two months. </sentence><sentence id="449">I mean, except for Sobibor. </sentence><sentence id="450">You know? </sentence><sentence id="451">And one night they surrounded us, and they loaded us up early in the morning on horse and wagons. </sentence><sentence id="452">The farmers brought it. </sentence><sentence id="453">And then we knew where we are going. </sentence><sentence id="454">You know? </sentence><sentence id="455">But still...how     should I say? </sentence><sentence id="456">I never could see myself dead. </sentence><sentence id="457">Is that stupid? </sentence><sentence id="458">Yeah?

[NB: Shlomo Podchlebnik]. </sentence><sentence id="1130">They're both not    alive anymore. </sentence><sentence id="1131">And they killed the Ukrainian who went with them. </sentence><sentence id="1132">I worked...at that time, I worked in the weapon area. </sentence><sentence id="1133">I used to put in the bullets in the bands. </sentence><sentence id="1134">They brought a lot of Russian bullets, and they were rusty. </sentence><sentence id="1135">And...and they were low already on weapons, the Germans, because the Russian...the Russians started to push them back already. </sentence><sentence id="1136">So we used to clean them up with sandpaper and put them in the bands. </sentence><sentence id="1137">And there was the Ukrainian in charge. </sentence><sentence id="1138">We were two girls there. </sentence><sentence id="1139">And he always told me all sorts of stories. </sentence><sentence id="1140">He's gonna do this, and he's gonna do that, and he's gonna kill this one. </sentence><sentence id="1141">You know, I listened; but I didn't say yes or no. </sentence><sentence id="1142">I didn't say it's right or wrong, because you have to be...you had to be very careful. </sentence><sentence id="1143">All of a sudden, he says to me, "I see that some...it's a big commotion in the camp." </sentence><sentence id="1144">And he says, "You have to go back to the barrack back." </sentence><sentence id="1145">He closes up the weapon area, and we ran back to the barrack. </sentence><sentence id="1146">Everything was very close. </sentence><sentence id="1147">And we see like 12 or 14 people are walking on their knees from outside the camp into the camp. </sentence><sentence id="1148">And Frenzel and all of them they are behind them with the [pages (ph)], and they beat them and everything. </sentence><sentence id="1149">And they walked so until after camp where they used to sort...behind that barrack. </sentence><sentence id="1150">And then them came in to us, and "Roll call! </sentence><sentence id="1151">Right away!" </sentence><sentence id="1152">We all assembled and they said, "Aufmarsch stehen!" </sentence><sentence id="1153">So we figured this is it. </sentence><sentence id="1154">They're gonna take us to Camp [NB: probably she is referring here to Camp 3]. </sentence><sentence id="1155">So we said to ourself...I mean, it happen all in split second. </sentence><sentence id="1156">You really didn't have time to communicate even, you know. </sentence><sentence id="1157">Because when the bugle sounded, you had to be right away there, even before he started blowing. </sentence><sentence id="1158">So...and next to me and my girlfriend as we walked was Unterscharfiihrer Wolf [NB: Franz Wolf], also miserable. </sentence><sentence id="1159">I was at his trial too. </sentence><sentence id="1160">And he said, "Okay, now you're gonna see something special. </sentence><sentence id="1161">Nobody from you are gonna survive." </sentence><sentence id="1162">So we walked and as we came to that open field behind the Sortieren [Translation: "Sorting House" (German)], they assembled us like in a half moon. </sentence><sentence id="1163">You know? </sentence><sentence id="1164">And Frenzel held a long speech that...that what gonna happen if somebody escapes from Sobibor, and we shouldn't even think about it, and then he made the others pick     out 12 more. " </sentence><sentence id="1165">Otherwise," he said, "I'm gonna take 50." </sentence><sentence id="1166">And those...uh...those people didn't have no choice. </sentence><sentence id="1167">They...they was so beaten up. </sentence><sentence id="1168">You couldn't even tell their faces anymore. </sentence><sentence id="1169">And they picked out some more from us...blindly...they didn't look. </sentence><sentence id="1170">They didn't wanta take the one....

But it goes to show that people there, if they have the slightest chance they wanted to get out and maybe tell the world what happened. </sentence><sentence id="1177">You know? </sentence><sentence id="1178">Because we knew if we won't do it, the world will never know. </sentence><sentence id="1179">How would anybody know? </sentence><sentence id="1180">The dead people won't tell. </sentence><sentence id="1181">Like once two people made a tunnel underneath the barrack. </sentence><sentence id="1182">At that time the fence outside the field wasn't mined. </sentence><sentence id="1183">Later, they put in mines. </sentence><sentence id="1184">And they escaped. </sentence><sentence id="1185">They took us every...every 10th from us, and shot them in from of us. </sentence><sentence id="1186">Every 10th. </sentence><sentence id="1187">You know when you stand next to your friend and they take you and he look...that look in his face, it'll never leave me. </sentence><sentence id="1188">This is not all. </sentence><sentence id="1189">This is not all. </sentence><sentence id="1190">There were so many incidents every day. </sentence><sentence id="1191">Every day. </sentence><sentence id="1192">Like they went once to take apart a bakery in W_odawa, and they wanted to bring it here and build it here, which they did. </sentence><sentence id="1193">I don't know somebody said something. </sentence><sentence id="1194">They took two people, shot them in front of us. </sentence><sentence id="1195">Then the beatings every day, the 25 lashes on the bare flesh. </sentence><sentence id="1196">Until they didn't see blood, they didn't give up. </sentence><sentence id="1197">I mean, when I think back, I don't know how anybody survived. </sentence><sentence id="1198">Including myself. </sentence><sentence id="1199">Just to watch...to be able to control yourself, not to get at him and choke him or kill him or whatever. </sentence><sentence id="1200">You know? </sentence><sentence id="1201">You couldn't be sick there. </sentence><sentence id="1202">If you admitted that you're sick or you have a fever, you went. </sentence><sentence id="1203">So what we used to do, we used to cover up for them or hold them by the hands, drag them to work, hide them in the magazines where they kept until the evening and then take them back to the barracks. </sentence><sentence id="1204">I have a friend who survived...she lives in now Australia. </sentence><sentence id="1205">I mean, Wagner came in     once. </sentence><sentence id="1206">She used to work in the...in the laundry. </sentence><sentence id="1207">She used to wash the laundry for them. </sentence><sentence id="1208">She is...she is shorter than I am and slimmer than I am, a young girl. </sentence><sentence id="1209">And she worked so hard, and then she fell asleep in the bathtub and he caught her. </sentence><sentence id="1210">He gave her 10 lashes. </sentence><sentence id="1211">One kidney went right away. </sentence><sentence id="1212">She's still sick from it. </sentence><sentence id="1213">I mean things like that really got you. </sentence><sentence id="1214">Like one woman came and she brought a baby, and she kept it for two weeks in the camp and finally they...and they gave her a choice: "Either you give up the baby and you can remain." </sentence><sentence id="1215">She was a good seamstress. </sentence><sentence id="1216">Her husband was there, too. </sentence><sentence id="1217">He was "til the uprising. </sentence><sentence id="1218">Which mother's gonna give up her baby? </sentence><sentence id="1219">So they...he shot them both. </sentence><sentence id="1220">I mean if...if you watched things like this, it's... When you think back...I mean, I don't sleep yet. </sentence><sentence id="1221">It's gonna be 47 years that I escaped, and it's not one night that I go to sleep and all of Sobibdr doesn't march before me; and then I can fall asleep. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1342">A:We had once a transport which was probably the worst of all the transports. </sentence><sentence id="1343">The people must have resisted on the way to Sobibor, so they threw in like chlorine and the body...into the box cars, and the people were dead and they swell up. </sentence><sentence id="1344">And...and they...they were so thick, all of a sudden, and the whole transport came there, to Sobibor. ( </sentence><sentence id="1345">Pause) There were ...every day was something new. </sentence><sentence id="1346">They thought...they were miserable if they didn't have blood. </sentence><sentence id="1347">You know? </sentence><sentence id="1348">Like...like dogs, hounds, pit bulls they call them. </sentence><sentence id="1349">Yes? </sentence><sentence id="1350">They...they just couldn't take it, not to have; and if one day there was no transport, let's say, for one reason or another....Not a day went by with out...let's say a half a day, you know.... They took us out and in order not to let us think, you know, when we had let's say a half hour off, they would exercise with us in such manner that you could drop dead. </sentence><sentence id="1351">And if you didn't do it, they shoot...shot you, if you didn't continue. </sentence><sentence id="1352">I remember once the cook, he couldn't keep up. </sentence><sentence id="1353">He was old. </sentence><sentence id="1354">If I was 18, 19, he was 40. </sentence><sentence id="1355">So he was old...or 38, or whatever. </sentence><sentence id="1356">He couldn't keep up. </sentence><sentence id="1357">So they took him out and they beat him so badly, Frenzel, that you couldn't tell his face or head. </sentence><sentence id="1358">His nose from his eyes was just one ball of blood. </sentence><sentence id="1359">That was their pleasure. </sentence><sentence id="1360">And when you talk to them today, everybody followed orders and whatever they did wasn't wrong, even. </sentence><sentence id="1361">Wasn't their fault. </sentence><sentence id="1362">And that hurts. </sentence><sentence id="1363">It hurts. </sentence><sentence id="1364">When I went all those times to Germany, I was afraid. </sentence><sentence id="1365">Every middle-aged man or older man I saw, I saw him in a Nazi uniform. </sentence><sentence id="1366">I don't trust them, and I don't believe in them that they changed. </sentence><sentence id="1367">I said it at the trial. </sentence><sentence id="1368">If Frenzel would have a chance to wear a uniform, he would do it all over again; but maybe he would make sure now that we wouldn't escape to tell the story. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1401">A:We planned constantly. </sentence><sentence id="1402">And I think that kept us going. </sentence><sentence id="1403">If we would know this is it, why should goon? </sentence><sentence id="1404">To see another 10,000 Jews come and be killed, another 20,000 be killed? </sentence><sentence id="1405">That was not...that we wanted to see. </sentence><sentence id="1406">You know. </sentence><sentence id="1407">We had to. </sentence><sentence id="1408">Then after awhile you become so numb that you just...you don't react, you...you know? </sentence><sentence id="1409">And then, we felt we're next in line. </sentence><sentence id="1410">Everybody from us had a death sentence in their pocket. </sentence><sentence id="1411">It just was a matter of time. </sentence><sentence id="1412">But, we never gave up that hope to...for revenge. </sentence><sentence id="1413">And I think that kept us going. </sentence><sentence id="1414">If we had a miserable day, when they kill...like Wagner. </sentence><sentence id="1415">He decided to build a Strafskommando [NB: Strafkommando; "punishment brigade"]. </sentence><sentence id="1416">You know what "Strafskommando" means?"Strafskommando" means...uh..."Strafs" is "guilty." </sentence><sentence id="1417">A "guilty unit" from whoever didn't walk straight or didn't look him right, maybe, in the eye, he put them to...to a special unit. </sentence><sentence id="1418">And they had to work everything while running, not walk. </sentence><sentence id="1419">That was the "Strafs." </sentence><sentence id="1420">How long can you run? </sentence><sentence id="1421">And they get...and their ration was cut in half. </sentence><sentence id="1422">So we didn't get enough to begin with. </sentence><sentence id="1423">You barely could survive; but if this was cut in half... And...and every day somebody else was shot, and was shot. </sentence><sentence id="1424">And, you know, it was so terrible. </sentence><sentence id="1425">And every evening they gave us an explanation. </sentence><sentence id="1426">He didn't run fast enough, so they had to shoot. </sentence><sentence id="1427">And you know what builds up in you when you listen to those words. </sentence><sentence id="1428">It's just...1 don't know where we got the strength not to react right away, you know. </sentence><sentence id="1429">But we...we knew if we wanna plan an escape and if we wanna do it, we have to keep cool...keep our cool. </sentence><sentence id="1430">We constantly...we planned maybe this way, maybe only part of us, and maybe.... And then after it happened with the Waldhofskommando [NB: Waldkommando], where they killed 24 instead of 12, and when they two more of us escaped and they took every 10th one, we felt it's not right that one should escape and leave all the others to the mercy of them. </sentence><sentence id="1431">If there's gonna be an escape, everybody has to be given the chance. </sentence><sentence id="1432">Not everybody will know until  the last day, because you had to be very careful. </sentence><sentence id="1433">You ...you understand? </sentence><sentence id="1434">So when Leon started planning this way and that way and that way and this way.... And we didn't know what's going on outside the world. </sentence><sentence id="1435">We didn't know how far the war is and where the Russians are; because there was another thing if you get out, which we didn't think we will. </sentence><sentence id="1436">But we felt if they'll waste some bullets and kill us in the back, it would also be a revenge not to go to the gas chambers. </sentence><sentence id="1437">So then one day we saw marching in a Russian unit of POWs. </sentence><sentence id="1438">They took them out to work. </sentence><sentence id="1439">In the meanwhile they expanded the camp. </sentence><sentence id="1440">They...they made Camp 4, where they used to store ammunition because they started to prepare for the Bug...for the River Bug...for the offensive in the spring, you know? </sentence><sentence id="1441">And we saw...and those Russians came in, and we figured, "Why did they bring Russians here?" </sentence><sentence id="1442">You know? </sentence><sentence id="1443">In the evening you started talking and one said...turned out that they're all Jews. </sentence><sentence id="1444">They are POWs, but they're Jews. </sentence><sentence id="1445">And after a couple of days, Leon started to approach them, and talk to them; and we told them everything what's going on here. </sentence><sentence id="1446">They didn't know either. </sentence><sentence id="1447">They didn't know. </sentence><sentence id="1448">And they had the military know-how which we didn't have, you know; and they came in from the outside, and told us what's going on on the outside. </sentence><sentence id="1449">We needed that encouragement, you know. </sentence><sentence id="1450">It did us a lot of good to have somebody with military know- how, with...supporting our ideas. </sentence><sentence id="1451">And we started organizing, and after they came in and the plan was worked out that everybody at his place at work--usually wherever we worked, there was an SS man watching and a few Ukrainians--everybody at his place of work has to kill his SS and his Ukrainian at the same time, the same minute also. </sentence><sentence id="1452">So we organized and we prepared knives, you know. </sentence><sentence id="1453">And....

</sentence><sentence id="1618">You never cried. </sentence><sentence id="1619">But that night before the escape, we all cried and we said goodbye. </sentence><sentence id="1620">I mean, nobody in his right mind thought even that we're gonna get out. </sentence><sentence id="1621">Versh...? </sentence><sentence id="1622">You...you understand? </sentence><sentence id="1623">So we cried and cried and said goodbye and I fell asleep. </sentence><sentence id="1624">We...I went to sleep with my boots and with my...I had two skirts and three sweaters and you know, and a babushka and a coat. </sentence><sentence id="1625">And I went to sleep with everything. </sentence><sentence id="1626">Because we figured in case something leaks out and they'll find out during the night, that L...we should be ready to run because there's nothing to lose anyway. </sentence><sentence id="1627">Might as well! </sentence><sentence id="1628">And as I cried and I fell asleep, I had a dream. </sentence><sentence id="1629">And my mother came into the camp through the main gate and I said, "Mom, you know what we're gonna do." </sentence><sentence id="1630">She said,     "Yes, and I came because of that." </sentence><sentence id="1631">And she...she took me by the hand and she led me out to the main gate into a barn, and said, "Here, you'll go and you'll survive." </sentence><sentence id="1632">That was the end of the dream. </sentence><sentence id="1633">In the morning I told my next neighbor, slept a girl, and I said I had a funny dream. </sentence><sentence id="1634">She said, "Naw, you know you were thinking about it." </sentence><sentence id="1635">And I said, "You know what. </sentence><sentence id="1636">If I'll get out, I have to go to that barn and see what happens." </sentence><sentence id="1637">So after three days after we reached Sobibor again, we started walking again. </sentence><sentence id="1638">And meanwhile my wound started hurting and it got all pussy [NB: covered with pus], and I got fever. </sentence><sentence id="1639">All I had is a few lumps of sugar in my pocket and a piece of bread. </sentence><sentence id="1640">No water. </sentence><sentence id="1641">The worst thing was the water. </sentence><sentence id="1642">You know? </sentence><sentence id="1643">And by Saturday night, we fell asleep in a field with...not barley, something like it. </sentence><sentence id="1644">Yeah. </sentence><sentence id="1645">While I jumped down the fence and I got shot, that coat was so heavy it was hard for me to run; so I threw away the coat. </sentence><sentence id="1646">That was my biggest mistake. </sentence><sentence id="1647">But I didn't catch a cold. </sentence><sentence id="1648">Don't worry. </sentence><sentence id="1649">And we laid in that field. </sentence><sentence id="1650">In the morning...a whole night it rained very fine. </sentence><sentence id="1651">In the morning it started freezing. </sentence><sentence id="1652">You know, in Poland. </sentence><sentence id="1653">And I got up stiff. </sentence><sentence id="1654">I mean I couldn't stand up. </sentence><sentence id="1655">And I said to all of them, "Listen, there from far away I see a lonely little house. </sentence><sentence id="1656">I'm going into that house. </sentence><sentence id="1657">I cannot take it. </sentence><sentence id="1658">I have my satisfaction. </sentence><sentence id="1659">We killed the Germans. </sentence><sentence id="1660">I escaped from Sobiber. </sentence><sentence id="1661">But now, really, I cannot take it." </sentence><sentence id="1662">So they said, "You know what? </sentence><sentence id="1663">You go in and see if you can get some bread and something to eat, and we'll wait." </sentence><sentence id="1664">I said, "Okay." </sentence><sentence id="1665">As I started walking, one of the guys said, "I'll go with you." </sentence><sentence id="1666">I said, "Okay." </sentence><sentence id="1667">He came with me. </sentence><sentence id="1668">I knocked on the door. </sentence><sentence id="1669">There was an old man. </sentence><sentence id="1670">An old man! </sentence><sentence id="1671">He probably wasn't old. </sentence><sentence id="1672">No teeth. </sentence><sentence id="1673">He had a 20 year old son. </sentence><sentence id="1674">How old could he be? </sentence><sentence id="1675">But you know in Poland.... One room, the cow was in the room and the bed was in the room. </sentence><sentence id="1676">Everything was in the room. </sentence><sentence id="1677">As we opened the door, he told me, "You must be from Sobibor." </sentence><sentence id="1678">I said, "Yes." </sentence><sentence id="1679">He said, "You did the best thing that could help...happen to those Nazis." </sentence><sentence id="1680">He said, "What can I do for you?" </sentence><sentence id="1681">I said, "We need some food, and I need to wash my wound." </sentence><sentence id="1682">I showed him what I have. </sentence><sentence id="1683">He said, "Listen, you come into my barn. </sentence><sentence id="1684">I have to     go to church with my son. </sentence><sentence id="1685">If I won't come to church they'll get suspicious. </sentence><sentence id="1686">And when we'll come from church, I'll feed you." </sentence><sentence id="1687">So he took us into the barn and I said... Yeah, in the meanwhile, a third one came in. </sentence><sentence id="1688">He said, "You told me two." </sentence><sentence id="1689">I said, "This is it. </sentence><sentence id="1690">Only three." [ </sentence><sentence id="1691">NB: the two others with her were Samuel Lerer and Avram Kohn]. </sentence><sentence id="1692">The others saw that we are not returning, so they run away. </sentence><sentence id="1693">None of them survived. </sentence><sentence id="1694">So he took us into the barn. </sentence><sentence id="1695">We went up on the loft, you know, in the straw, and everything felt so good and warm. </sentence><sentence id="1696">And I said that whatever'll happen...he'll probably go for the Gestapo. </sentence><sentence id="1697">But he didn't go. </sentence><sentence id="1698">He went, and after a few hours he came back from church and his son brought us in bread and soup and hot milk and cheese; and I said to the guys, "That's our last meal, our last supper, probably." </sentence><sentence id="1699">And we ate, and he told us that soon it will get dark. </sentence><sentence id="1700">He'll take us into the house so we can clean up a little bit. </sentence><sentence id="1701">When it got dark he took us into the house. </sentence><sentence id="1702">He had a big pot of water boiling. </sentence><sentence id="1703">He told me to wash off my head. </sentence><sentence id="1704">He put some...his remedy, unsalted lard. </sentence><sentence id="1705">But it healed. </sentence><sentence id="1706">It healed. </sentence><sentence id="1707">Took care of the infection. </sentence><sentence id="1708">And we sat and we told him the story about Sobibor. </sentence><sentence id="1709">He was very interested. </sentence><sentence id="1710">And then he said, "What you want to do now?" </sentence><sentence id="1711">I said, "I have to go someplace; and if I won't find a refuge there, I'll come back and maybe you'll be able to help us." </sentence><sentence id="1712">He said, "Okay." </sentence><sentence id="1713">He give us some milk and some bread and some cheese and some onions. </sentence><sentence id="1714">You know, whatever he had. </sentence><sentence id="1715">And we had some money. </sentence><sentence id="1716">I wanted to give him some money. </sentence><sentence id="1717">I had money from home, too; and I...we hid it, and in the last day we took it with us. </sentence><sentence id="1718">He said, "You know what? </sentence><sentence id="1719">Keep the money. </sentence><sentence id="1720">Maybe there's somebody who won't give you without money." </sentence><sentence id="1721">And the young man waited with us until twelve, one o'clock, when it's got very quiet all around. </sentence><sentence id="1722">And he walked us to the woods and he showed us where it is. </sentence><sentence id="1723">And I asked him his name and the name of the village. </sentence><sentence id="1724">He didn't want to tell me. </sentence><sentence id="1725">He was afraid in case they catch us and they'll torture us. </sentence><sentence id="1726">You know? </sentence><sentence id="1727">And I didn't wanna tell him where I'm going, too. </sentence><sentence id="1728">So, anyway he took us; and from there to the place that I knew, that barn, was probably about 15 kilometers, maybe 18, which I could make in one     day easily. </sentence><sentence id="1729">It took us two weeks to get there because we walked only at night and in circles. </sentence><sentence id="1730">You know? </sentence><sentence id="1731">Because we were afraid in the daytime. </sentence><sentence id="1732">You see in the daytime we were in the woods because the Germans never went into the woods. </sentence><sentence id="1733">They were outside shooting in, but never went into the woods. </sentence><sentence id="1734">And after two weeks in the night I got a village I recognized. </sentence><sentence id="1735">We...we stood...we laid three days and three nights just near the main highway to be able to cross because the Germans had so much traffic...military traffic, and we had to wait for the moment just to cross. </sentence><sentence id="1736">So I recognize the...the barn, and I said, "This is the place." </sentence><sentence id="1737">And I knew this was one of my father's customers...the gentile that I told you helped us so much [NB: Stefan Marcyniuk]. </sentence><sentence id="1738">Matter of fact, when I was in Staw-Nowosiolki, he used to deliver bread for the Germans for us. </sentence><sentence id="1739">And I saw his man who used to bring the bread and I said, "Tell Marcyniuk that we are hungry." </sentence><sentence id="1740">He used to send us every day two-kilo loaf of bread. </sentence><sentence id="1741">The..the guy left it underneath the fence. </sentence><sentence id="1742">You know what it meant in a concentration camp...2 kilo bread? </sentence><sentence id="1743">It was a fortune! </sentence><sentence id="1744">So I recognized and I said, "This is the barn;" because we used to go as young kids. </sentence><sentence id="1745">He had a big farm. </sentence><sentence id="1746">We picked cherries, you know, like children. </sentence><sentence id="1747">Was not far from Che_m, about 10 kilometers. </sentence><sentence id="1748">And on the other side of the road, his mother used to live. </sentence><sentence id="1749">So I said, "I'm gonna knock on the other side." </sentence><sentence id="1750">And I knocked, and a man came out and he thought we are partisans; and, "Don't shoot!" </sentence><sentence id="1751">and, "Don't this." </sentence><sentence id="1752">I said, "I'm not gonna shoot you. </sentence><sentence id="1753">I'm not after you. </sentence><sentence id="1754">I'm after that man. </sentence><sentence id="1755">I need to settle something with him." </sentence><sentence id="1756">I didn't want to say. </sentence><sentence id="1757">So he said, "You know, he doesn't live here." </sentence><sentence id="1758">I knew he doesn't live there because he lived in the city. " </sentence><sentence id="1759">But he comes once in awhile here, every week, every two weeks," and so forth and so on. </sentence><sentence id="1760">And I said, "We have something to settle with him. </sentence><sentence id="1761">Don't worry." </sentence><sentence id="1762">He gave us some bread, just to get rid of us, and some onions...whatever they had. </sentence><sentence id="1763">And we waited. </sentence><sentence id="1764">I went away. </sentence><sentence id="1765">We waited. </sentence><sentence id="1766">When it got real quiet and all the lights were out in the village, we went into that barn. </sentence><sentence id="1767">And as I went into that barn, I mean as dark as it was, I said, "That's the barn my mother showed me in the     dream." </sentence><sentence id="1768">In the meanwhile, when we went into the barn a partisan group came into the yard; and those two guys [NB: Samuel and Avram] said, "Let's go with the partisans." </sentence><sentence id="1769">I said, "If you want to go, you're welcome. </sentence><sentence id="1770">I'm staying." </sentence><sentence id="1771">We also met a partisan group before; and they wanted to join, because it was the only way to survive the German party. </sentence><sentence id="1772">I said, "If you want to go to the partisan, please. </sentence><sentence id="1773">I'm not going. </sentence><sentence id="1774">I'm going to find out what's there." </sentence><sentence id="1775">And we climbed up the loft, with straw again. </sentence><sentence id="1776">We were at home already. </sentence><sentence id="1777">We stayed there about 3 days. </sentence><sentence id="1778">Nobody showed up. </sentence><sentence id="1779">So we got hungry. </sentence><sentence id="1780">So I said, "In the evening, we'll go to the neighboring village, and we'll buy something." </sentence><sentence id="1781">We went away, and we met...we went into a farmer. </sentence><sentence id="1782">He gave us, he gave us a bottle of milk. </sentence><sentence id="1783">He gave us some bread, whatever. </sentence><sentence id="1784">And we walked back. </sentence><sentence id="1785">We walked back. </sentence><sentence id="1786">We climbed up the loft, which straw was very solid, and one guy lost a bottle of milk. </sentence><sentence id="1787">It wasn't the bottle of milk. </sentence><sentence id="1788">It was just not to leave any traces that people are here. </sentence><sentence id="1789">And he...I said, "You better go down and in the dark try to find it." </sentence><sentence id="1790">And as he went down and he looked, and I told him in Jewish, "Did you find it?" </sentence><sentence id="1791">And as I said, "Did you find it," something jumped up from that loft like a white ghost, white linen pants. </sentence><sentence id="1792">And we got so scared. </sentence><sentence id="1793">And he said, "Who is it?" </sentence><sentence id="1794">I said, "Idel.". </sentence><sentence id="1795">That was my brother's name. </sentence><sentence id="1796">And he said, "You're dead." </sentence><sentence id="1797">And that was my brother in the loft, being there already 10 months. </sentence><sentence id="1798">And he said, "I'm gonna hold your hand until it get light because I know you're dead." </sentence><sentence id="1799">And when it started daylight, he saw me and I told him where I was and I told him that I'm here. </sentence><sentence id="1800">He saw the man. </sentence><sentence id="1801">He said, "Listen, he's gonna come any day here. </sentence><sentence id="1802">I'm gonna tell him only about you and one man." </sentence><sentence id="1803">And the third man, if he'll take you in, we're gonna keep the other one. </sentence><sentence id="1804">We're gonna share whatever food he'll give us." </sentence><sentence id="1805">He came after a few days; and they...he used to whistle, and my brother knew that the coast is clear and he can go out, because underneath the loft he built him a bunker underneath the ground. </sentence><sentence id="1806">My brother jumped out and he told him. </sentence><sentence id="1807">And he said to my brother he should call me out, and I came out and he just went like this. </sentence><sentence id="1808">He said, "If God put you together, I'm not going to     divide you. </sentence><sentence id="1809">Whatever will happen will happen to all of us." </sentence><sentence id="1810">And I was there "til the liberation. </sentence><sentence id="1811">He never found out that the third man was with us until liberation. </sentence><sentence id="1812">We shared the food and we kept him hidden. </sentence><sentence id="1813">Some story! </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2124">A:A few days before the liberation...1 mean, it was such a fancy farm and it had a wooden fence around; he was a very wealthy man in our city. </sentence><sentence id="2125">And over there, only his old mother lived. </sentence><sentence id="2126">He used to take care of the farm, but he didn't live there. </sentence><sentence id="2127">And the mother was senile, already. </sentence><sentence id="2128">And that was our luck. </sentence><sentence id="2129">Even if she would see us...once she saw me. </sentence><sentence id="2130">I walked down in the barn, you know, to stretch out my legs and she asked me, "Why...why you walking here?There's a war in the city?" </sentence><sentence id="2131">I said, "No. </sentence><sentence id="2132">I just came to visit. </sentence><sentence id="2133">I'm going back." </sentence><sentence id="2134">And a few days before...you know, we were already exhausted. </sentence><sentence id="2135">My brother was there 19 months, and I was already 9 months, without a table, a spoon of warm water all those 9 months, without cooked food because he didn't live there. </sentence><sentence id="2136">He couldn't cook for us. </sentence><sentence id="2137">Only he gave us enough bread. </sentence><sentence id="2138">And water. </sentence><sentence id="2139">Sometimes a little jam, a little margarine, you know, or something like this. </sentence><sentence id="2140">He gave us plenty of onions and plenty of garlic. </sentence><sentence id="2141">And I think that helped us, too. </sentence><sentence id="2142">And it was already the last days and all of a sudden we...and he told us that he built a bunker. </sentence><sentence id="2143">He owned a piece of woods past the farms, a little further down. </sentence><sentence id="2144">He said, "If you have a chance, run out from the barn and go to the woods, because the Germans are retreating and they're burning everything to ground, livestock and everything." </sentence><sentence id="2145">So we said, "Okay." </sentence><sentence id="2146">And as we got ready... ready...whatever we have to..you know...all of a sudden... yeah...before, the Germans came and set up shop in our yard. </sentence><sentence id="2147">And we are sitting and looking at them, you know, through the boards. </sentence><sentence id="2148">And two officers started cleaning their weapons and one shot the other. </sentence><sentence id="2149">I didn't know if it's on...on purpose or accident. </sentence><sentence id="2150">And they set up a court in the yard. </sentence><sentence id="2151">   And I said, "That's what we need. </sentence><sentence id="2152">Exactly. </sentence><sentence id="2153">The last day." </sentence><sentence id="2154">And in the meanwhile came an order that they have to leave. </sentence><sentence id="2155">And they left. </sentence><sentence id="2156">So we survived this. </sentence><sentence id="2157">The next day, all of a sudden, we figured soon it'll get dark...we'll go out in the fields because the corn and everything was very high already....
