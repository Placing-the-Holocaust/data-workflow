like an animal, you learn things. </sentence><sentence id="860">And one of the most important things that you learn is to observe. </sentence><sentence id="861">When you get into a place, the first

the guard down there, going back and forth, and when he turned his back | went the other way. </sentence><sentence id="898">| jumped on that, | was bleeding, my feet, and my hands  Harry Alexander 19 October 11, 1995 Page 19 were bleeding. </sentence><sentence id="899">| was going on all fours, | cut myself on the glass. </sentence><sentence id="900">| jumped on the lamp post, went down, and

id="902">And not run. </sentence><sentence id="903">Walk. </sentence><sentence id="904">Although you may be scared to death and frightened and any moment he will call you're name and, hey, where you
