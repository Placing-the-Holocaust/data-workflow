<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="551">A:Yes, initially was my family. </sentence><sentence id="552">My father went to live in a place on Ogrodowa Street , but I separated. </sentence><sentence id="553">I mean, as I told you before, I didn't live with my father anymore. </sentence><sentence id="554">Even before the war, I lived with my grandmother. </sentence><sentence id="555">So, I went to the place where my grandmother was living. </sentence><sentence id="556">Well, and from there I went to live in the kibbutz. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="563">Q:Fairly soon after the beginning? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="565">A:Very soon after I came to the ghetto. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="567">Q:Tell me, tell me a little bit about the ghetto itself, not just the kibbutz. </sentence><sentence id="568">But what the life was like there? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="571">A:To capsulize it, I would say it was hell on earth, because on an area which included several streets, I mean the wall which was running around the ghetto was like eleven miles long. </sentence><sentence id="572">So, within that area people were concentrated you know in Warsaw before the war, there were about, over 300,000 Jews, maybe more. </sentence><sentence id="573">And when the ghetto was created, the Germans herded into the ghetto Jews from the surrounding areas, from the smaller areas. </sentence><sentence id="574">And, finally there was like on this limited place, like almost half a million Jews living in terrible conditions, living on a, on a nutrition base which was below the subsistence level, attacked by dirt and hunger and soon the other killing factor was typhus which was rampant in the, German, in the Warsaw ghetto. </sentence><sentence id="575">Till this very day, you know, sometimes I get the terrible smell of carbole. </sentence><sentence id="576">I don't know what the English word for carbole is. </sentence><sentence id="577">That was a disinfectant that they were spraying in houses where cases of typhus broke out. </sentence><sentence id="578">And people were driven from those houses to public baths to, to, for so called de-lousing. </sentence><sentence id="579">Which was actually a place where you could get typhus because typhus is a disease by lice born...it's a lice born disease. </sentence><sentence id="580">And, well, look, we came to live in the ghetto in, in October 1940. </sentence><sentence id="581">By, by March my father was dead, starved to death, literally. </sentence><sentence id="582">Because once he was cut off from the ghetto, he was cut off from his clientele and from his, from his subsistence, you know. </sentence><sentence id="583">A terrible hunger was in my father's house because sometimes I was running from the kibbutz to see how my father is doing. </sentence><sentence id="584">And it was a sight which I will never forget. </sentence><sentence id="585">And I run to see my grandmother, whom  I loved, because she was the substitute of my mother, you know, and Randy, what can I tell you. </sentence><sentence id="586">These sights of my father and of my grandmother dying from starvation and terrible hygienic conditions, is a picture which haunts me till this very day, you know. </sentence><sentence id="587">And this is over half a century ago, and it torments me in terrible nightmares to this very day. </sentence><sentence id="588">My grandmother was lying on a, on a dirty bed because she was unable already to move from that bed, without food, and with her came to live some, a Jewish family, a young Jewish family with three little children. </sentence><sentence id="589">The mother was soon caught smuggling some food and she was put into the jail. </sentence><sentence id="590">And the father was going out with the eldest son which was like six years maybe old to find some work to earn some money. </sentence><sentence id="591">He usually came home empty handed because he was a barber and very few people needed his services in the ghetto. </sentence><sentence id="592">So, when I came to visit my grandmother, I saw these little children, you know turning into little monsters because when a person is subjected to starvation there are visible changes in their body you know. </sentence><sentence id="593">First people get swollen, and later on they become distorted. </sentence><sentence id="594">And these little children were like two little monsters, that I, and they were next to my grandmother who was also in a, in a state of decay. </sentence><sentence id="595">And sure, I remember she said to me in Yiddish, "Look in what state Iam." </sentence><sentence id="596">And I stood there, a young girl, you know, tears were running down my cheeks. </sentence><sentence id="597">I couldn't help them. </sentence><sentence id="598">The only...you know, living in the kibbutz we were much better off than other people because at least we had three meals a day. </sentence><sentence id="599">Very, very skimpy meals, but still like a piece of bread and a, and a bowl of soup. </sentence><sentence id="600">Sometimes I saved one of the pieces of bread that I got and I was bringing it to my father or a potato. </sentence><sentence id="601">It was nothing that could really change the situation, but it, that was the most I could do. </sentence><sentence id="602">And thinking of it now in hindsight, I think that was, that was a very terrible, I mean, it was a very  hard thing for me to do because I was hungry all the time too, you know. </sentence><sentence id="603">It's not a big deal to share with others when you have plenty, but it's very difficult to share with others when you are yourself hungry. </sentence><sentence id="604">Not only hungry, I came, my physical health deteriorated in the ghetto to a point where I fainted and I was taken to a clinic. </sentence><sentence id="605">And of course the doctor said she needs better nutrition. </sentence><sentence id="606">She needs not to work so hard. </sentence><sentence id="607">Speaking of work, what was I working in the ghetto. </sentence><sentence id="608">The members of the kibbutz, the boys, I mean the young men, we were not boys, but the young men usually worked on, on the Polish air field on Okzeie. </sentence><sentence id="609">Or in the geographical cartographic institute in Warsaw. </sentence><sentence id="610">But the girls were usually domestic helpers, you know. </sentence><sentence id="611">So, I was also a domestic help working for other Jews who were still wealthy in the ghetto. </sentence><sentence id="612">Because, you know, the differentiation was enormous in the ghetto. </sentence><sentence id="613">Not everybody was right away poor. </sentence><sentence id="614">There were many people who were well to do in the ghetto. </sentence><sentence id="615">So, well? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="663">Q:People who were well to do in the ghetto, weren't, were they able to help those of you who didn't have as much? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="665">A: Well, there was ZTOS, ZTOS is an acronym for Zydowskie Towarzystwo Opieki Spolecznej, and this was an institution who was supposed to take care of needy people. </sentence><sentence id="666">But there were, the need was so enormous as to the possibilities of supplying, that they couldn't meet all the, all the demand that people had. </sentence><sentence id="667">So, there was a big differentiation between people who had the means and could buy food which was smuggled into the ghetto. </sentence><sentence id="668">And between the people who right away became pauperized because they were cut off from their professions. </sentence><sentence id="669">And especially the people from the smaller communities. </sentence><sentence id="670">They were usually very poor to begin with. </sentence><sentence id="671"> They were right away, you know, candidates of starvation from, death from starvation. </sentence><sentence id="672">Which makes me think that usually there is this myth that Jews are rich people. </sentence><sentence id="673">This is a myth. </sentence><sentence id="674">In, in Poland before the war there was an enormous amount of Jewish people who were poor especially in the shetlach and in the smaller communities, people were not very rich. </sentence><sentence id="675">Usually the ratio between the rich and poor was such that there were a few rich people and the majority was poor. </sentence><sentence id="676">Well, you asked me if they helped. </sentence><sentence id="677">Maybe they did, but I don't think they could help a lot. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="691">Q:You, you mentioned that your father died very soon. </sentence><sentence id="692">Were you able to see him before he died? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="695">A:Yes I was. </sentence><sentence id="696">Yeah, I was running from time to time to see him, bringing him something to eat if I could, you know. </sentence><sentence id="697">It was a slow and painful death. </sentence><sentence id="698">I don't know if people can understand it, because in the United States I don't think that people starved to death. </sentence><sentence id="699">You can have poor people, probably people who do not have enough, but not starvation. </sentence><sentence id="700">In ghetto it was literally starvation. </sentence><sentence id="701">You died day after day. </sentence><sentence id="702">It took, it takes a couple of months to starve from, to die from starvation. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="711">Q:So, you were able to get back and forth and you, and that's how you knew that he died? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="713">A:Sure. </sentence><sentence id="714">One day a girl came to tell me that my father is dead. </sentence><sentence id="715">So, I ran over there, and there he was in that basement apartment...apartment, you can't call it apartment. </sentence><sentence id="716">He was on the floor in a pool, in a pool of his excrement. </sentence><sentence id="717">And that and the step mother was standing next to him, you know. </sentence><sentence id="718">Well, I didn't have much sympathy for her, but that's how it was. </sentence><sentence id="719">And I didn't have the money to pay for a decent burial. </sentence><sentence id="720">At that time you still could have a burial if you paid to the, to the Judenrat, to the Jewish council, about 15 zlotys they would bring a hearse and carry away the dead person. </sentence><sentence id="721">But we didn't have the money. </sentence><sentence id="722">So, what people, poor people, used to do is to put the cadaver out in front of the house. </sentence><sentence id="723">And then there were special wagons who came and picked up all of those dead people and brought them to the cemetery on Gesia Street. </sentence><sentence id="724">So, the next day I ran to that cemetery hoping to find my father there. </sentence><sentence id="725">And what I saw is, it was you know, a terrible nightmare. </sentence><sentence id="726">For the first time in my life I saw a pile of dead bodies, you know, like two stories high. </sentence><sentence id="727">Because the amount of dead people was so enormous and growing from day to day that the, the grave diggers couldn't keep up with the pace of the dead, you know, of the amount of people who were pouring into that cemetery. </sentence><sentence id="728">So they collected them, you know, piles, one upon the other, you know. </sentence><sentence id="729">And all these corpses, you know, the limbs intertwisted between, you know, with open mouths and I was a young girl, and the stench from that pile of human corpses was so terrible. </sentence><sentence id="730">It's a sweetish smell, you know. </sentence><sentence id="731">I don't have the words to describe it, but, it was, you know, hell was, even the word hell is not a word to describe it, you know. </sentence><sentence id="732">Though I couldn't find him on that pile, you know. </sentence><sentence id="733">I just couldn't make it, and I went back to the kibbutz. </sentence><sentence id="734">Well, I, there was no point in even telling about it because the majority of people in the kibbutz had parents in a similar situation. </sentence><sentence id="735">Not all of them, but some were in the same situation. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="759">Q:Let me ask you, how does a 16 year old girl deal with this? </sentence><sentence id="760">How do you handle this? </sentence><sentence id="761">I mean this is... </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="765">A:You handle as much as you can, you know. </sentence><sentence id="766">Like I said, I was lucky that I belonged to that group of young people. </sentence><sentence id="767">And we were, you know, it gave you a frame in which you could exist, you know. </sentence><sentence id="768">It gave you a sense of belonging. </sentence><sentence id="769">That's very important. </sentence><sentence id="770">You knew where you, who you belonged to. </sentence><sentence id="771">You knew where you stand and your life was organized. </sentence><sentence id="772">That's one way how you could cope with it. </sentence><sentence id="773">It was later on that I was completely abandoned and left all alone. </sentence><sentence id="774">That was a terrible time for me, but that came later. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="785">Q:Now, (technical conversation) where were your brothers at this point? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="787">A:Good question. </sentence><sentence id="788">My elder brother, who was ten years older than I was, escaped somehow from the ghetto and would, and went to the province hoping to find some work. </sentence><sentence id="789">He was already a married man and he had a boy five or six years old and he was hoping to find some work so that he could come back to the ghetto and somehow feed the family, but that was it. </sentence><sentence id="790">He went and he never came back. </sentence><sentence id="791">And I don't know what happened to him. </sentence><sentence id="792">Now, my younger brother was still in the ghetto too. </sentence><sentence id="793">And for a while he was working in a bakery, but then he joined a group or was sent to a group, I don't know exactly, but he was sent to a camp in Belzec. </sentence><sentence id="794">And we know what happened, later on I learned what happened in Belzec, but at that time I didn't know. </sentence><sentence id="795">I had some news from my cousins. </sentence><sentence id="796">Though, remember I told you that my uncle was killed in Katuszyn, and the children came back to Warsaw. </sentence><sentence id="797">Later on I got a letter from one of the cousins saying that my brother, my younger brother, escaped from the, from the camp, from the labor camp and was working as a farm hand in a Polish farm, but that was it. </sentence><sentence id="798">I didn't hear from him, never again. </sentence><sentence id="799">You know after the war, we were going to the Jewish community in Praga and the survivors used to write down their names in hoping to find other survivors. </sentence><sentence id="800">And I was looking for my brothers. </sentence><sentence id="801">They were not on the list of the survivors. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="817">Q: What was life like in this kibbutz in the ghetto? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="819">A: Well, it was, it was good, comparable to what was going on in other families. </sentence><sentence id="820">We kept ourselves clean, even though the premises were very limited, and we, we went to work like I said before. </sentence><sentence id="821">In the evenings and on shabbat, we used to gather and had discussions and had, you know, presentations by all kinds of literary men who used to come to the kibbutz. </sentence><sentence id="822">So, we were politically and intellectually active, in spite of the terrible conditions that existed in the ghetto. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="827">Q:How did you...you said you had, not a lot of food, but you were able to have three meals a day. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1037">A:Well, good question. </sentence><sentence id="1038">Like I said, we were a scout organization and we had good connections with the Polish scout organization. </sentence><sentence id="1039">And Irena Adamowicz was a good friend of Hashomer Hatzair, and she suggested that one of her acquaintances in this Polish scout organization would go to Vilna and find out what...we didn't know what happened in, in Vilna yet, until this delegate, his name was Henryk Grabewski, he went on a bike from Warsaw to Vilna and when he came, the idea was to get in touch with the, with our members of Hashomer Hatzair in Vilna. </sentence><sentence id="1040">But when he came and got in touch with the people, he learned what happened to the Jews of Vilna. </sentence><sentence id="1041">And when he came back, and told us about this, we were the first to realize that the Germans mean business, business of killing the whole Jewish nation. </sentence><sentence id="1042">You  see, the Germans didn't come out straight and said we are going to kill you all. </sentence><sentence id="1043">It was a step by step process. </sentence><sentence id="1044">The annihilation, if you summarize this you can see it in, in four major steps like the writer Raul Hilberg so eloquently put it. </sentence><sentence id="1045">He pointed out there were four major steps in the annihilation of the Jews. </sentence><sentence id="1046">There was identification, expropriation, ghettoization, and finally annihilation. </sentence><sentence id="1047">First you mark the Jews. </sentence><sentence id="1048">You put a "J" for Jew, Jude, into your passport. </sentence><sentence id="1049">You put on an armband, or a yellow star on your garb and you are right away separated from the non-Jewish population. </sentence><sentence id="1050">Then your property is taking away from you. </sentence><sentence id="1051">Your bank accounts, your, your factories, your, your real estate. </sentence><sentence id="1052">Everything. </sentence><sentence id="1053">Then you are herded into a ghetto, you are concentrated. </sentence><sentence id="1054">And finally from this concentrated places you are being driven to the death camps. </sentence><sentence id="1055">But this was a process which took years, it took months. </sentence><sentence id="1056">You had, they had to organize transports and all that stuff. </sentence><sentence id="1057">It was a big business. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1080">Q:When you got this information that Jews were being massacred, do you remember the dialog amongst your group and with your leaders at that point? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1082">A: Well, I was too young to be included in these discussions, but I remember that one day we were explained that we have to defend ourselves, that the Germans are going to kill us. </sentence><sentence id="1083">And this was a concept for me as a young girl which it couldn't get through my skull because why?You know, I remember a discussion that I had with my uncle, my other uncle, I had two uncles in Warsaw. </sentence><sentence id="1084">And when I came to talk to him I said, "Uncle, they are going to kill us off." </sentence><sentence id="1085">And he said, "Girl, what are you talking about? </sentence><sentence id="1086">They don't kill people for nothing. </sentence><sentence id="1087"> They kill only trespassers of the law. </sentence><sentence id="1088">As long as you remain in the framework of law, nothing can happen to you." </sentence><sentence id="1089">That was the concept, you know, that existed among Jews before they finally realized that, that they are going to be, you know, exterminated. </sentence><sentence id="1090">I'm hesitant to use the word exterminated. </sentence><sentence id="1091">Elie Wiesel in one of his articles made a good point in my opinion. </sentence><sentence id="1092">He said, "Only vermin are exterminated. </sentence><sentence id="1093">People are being murdered." </sentence><sentence id="1094">Well, the point is that the Germans considered the Jews as vermin. </sentence><sentence id="1095">You see, in order to kill people the killers have to be motivated to do it and in order to be able to kill so many people, you know, we talk about killing so many people. </sentence><sentence id="1096">People cannot understand that it was an enormous task to do. </sentence><sentence id="1097">You can not get away with killing millions of people right away. </sentence><sentence id="1098">And, the killers had to be properly prepared to that task. </sentence><sentence id="1099">And one of the points that enabled them to do it was the process of dehumanizing the Jews to instill in the killers the idea that the Jews are not people. </sentence><sentence id="1100">They are vermin. </sentence><sentence id="1101">They are dangerous, just like rats and lice and roaches are dangerous. </sentence><sentence id="1102">That's how, that's why we have to get rid of them, because they step on the moral fiber of the German nation. </sentence><sentence id="1103">And in order to preserve the integrity of the German nation, we have to get rid of this vermins. </sentence><sentence id="1104">That's how they could do the job. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1129">Q:Let's get back to you, your story. </sentence><sentence id="1130">So, after you got, I understand that after you got this information it was a real turning point in psychology and, and operations in a way? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1133">A:Yes. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1135">Q:Did they start training you for self defense at this point? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1137">A: Well, training, it's a big word because you see the idea of self defense in the Warsaw ghetto was born much earlier than the, the uprising, you know. </sentence><sentence id="1138">The uprising took place in "43, but the idea was born from the moment when we learned about Ponary, about Babi Yar, which took place in September "41, and we learned also from that courier, from that Polish courier that there is a group of young Jewish people who organized themselves in a partisan organization to fight the Germans, to defend themselves. </sentence><sentence id="1139">The FBO, an organization. </sentence><sentence id="1140">So, this idea swept to the Warsaw ghetto and we...we, by we I mean the youth organization...started to, to the nucleus of a self defense operation. </sentence><sentence id="1141">There was the beginning. </sentence><sentence id="1142">You know, at the time, when the first mass deportations from the Warsaw ghetto began in July 22, 1942, there was already the, the nucleus of the defense organization among Jews. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1149">Q:OK, but I want to know while you were there, were you, were people starting to try to get weapons. </sentence><sentence id="1150">Did they teach you certain things about how to protect yourself? </sentence><sentence id="1151">Did you talk about going to the forest versus staying in the ghetto? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1155">A:Look, I left the Warsaw ghetto in late summer or early fall "41. </sentence><sentence id="1156">So, I was not in the Warsaw ghetto anymore when the Jewish fighting organization was organized. </sentence><sentence id="1157">I was at that time on that farm. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1161">Q:Right, but when, what I'm asking is, when you got information about Vilna, about Ponary, you were still in the ghetto? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1163">A:No. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1165">Q:Oh, you were not even in the, you were out already? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1167">A:Yes. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1169">Q:OK, so, what you're talking about is the spirit and the mentality of what was going on in the ghetto, but you at this point were gone? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1171">A:Yes. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1173">Q:OK, I just wanted to clarify that. </sentence><sentence id="1174">Before you tell me about the farm, I'd like to learn a little bit more about the rest of the ghetto. </sentence><sentence id="1175">That there was an organizational structure, I believe. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1179">A:You mean the Warsaw ghetto? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1181">Q:Yes. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1183">A: Well, you know the ghetto was ruled by the Judenrat, by the Jewish council, which was appointed by the Germans. </sentence><sentence id="1184">And it was an instrument in the German hands to, you know, to enforce all the laws that the Germans wanted to implement into the Jewish community. </sentence><sentence id="1185">And at the beginning, the attitude to the Judenrat was people didn't know what to figure out, you know, what to make out of it. </sentence><sentence id="1186">After all this was the only official presentation of the Jewish community, and they were the distributor of food. </sentence><sentence id="1187">They were, you know, providing all these services needed in any community like health services, burial services and work. </sentence><sentence id="1188">And, the big change, the attitude towards the Judenrat change was the first expulsion from the ghetto. </sentence><sentence id="1189">After that, you know, when it became obvious that the Jews driven out from the ghetto are being killed, so this was the turning point in the whole existence of the ghetto. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1197">Q:When are you talking about, what period? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1199">A: Well, it was like I said the first mass deportation from the Warsaw ghetto was in "42. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1203">A:] wasn't there. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1205">Q:No, I know that, but while you were in the ghetto did you, were you aware of the Judenrat, did you... </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1207">A:Sure. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1209">Q:Did you know any of those people? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1211">A:Not personally. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1213">Q:What was your impression? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="1215"> Alt was, it was the institution in the ghetto. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1217">Q:Were they fair? </sentence><sentence id="1218">Did they try to help people in need? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1221">A:Yeah, they tried to help people, within their framework, you know. </sentence><sentence id="1222">Everything was within the tules prescribed by the Germans. </sentence><sentence id="1223">You see, the, the Judenrat, the policy was to appease the Germans. </sentence><sentence id="1224">The policy was, that the ideas by the leaders of the Judenrat was like my uncles, as long as you stay in the framework of law, you, you have a chance of surviving, which turned out to be false later on. </sentence><sentence id="1225">But at the beginning neither the members of the Judenrat or the, or the regular population didn't realize it. </sentence><sentence id="1226">You see, the Germans were, were lying all the time to the Jews. </sentence><sentence id="1227">They were purposely deceiving them. </sentence><sentence id="1228">You know, the Germans are known as an orderly people. </sentence><sentence id="1229">Everything has to be done orderly according to their rules. </sentence><sentence id="1230">And one of the tules was to keep the Jews in the dark, because if you don't, there will be panic. </sentence><sentence id="1231">And it's much more difficult to, to handle a panicky situation than you can handle an orderly situation. </sentence><sentence id="1232">Let me add one word. </sentence><sentence id="1233">In order to, to maintain this principle, the Judenrat had at their disposal the Jewish police, you know, the Ordentlich. </sentence><sentence id="1234">And that was a terrible thing because by terrible thing I mean that the Germans succeeded to make the Jews participating in the process of killing Jews. </sentence><sentence id="1235">You see, I don't know if I expressed myself well. </sentence><sentence id="1236">The idea, the German idea was to involve the Jews in the process of extermination and they succeeded, and the Jewish police were participating because they were the one who were  rounding up the people to send them to the death camps. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1254">Q:Now, I still want to stick with the time that you were in the ghetto, so that's about a nine month period or something. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1276">Q:Did you go to any concerts or theater, anything like that? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1278">A:Personally I didn't, but other people did. </sentence><sentence id="1279">I mean, you see my existence in the ghetto was limited by the living in the kibbutz and going occasionally to my father and my grandfather. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1308">Q:Did you feel safe in the ghetto? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1310">A:I can't answer that question. </sentence><sentence id="1311">It was later on when I tried to make it on the Aryan side that sometimes the existence in the ghetto gave you more security than to be on the outside. </sentence><sentence id="1312">But when I was in the Warsaw ghetto it was still the ghetto. </sentence><sentence id="1313">You see, there was...the Warsaw ghetto had a different picture before the first expulsion and after the first expulsion. </sentence><sentence id="1314">It changed dramatically. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1320">Q:OK, but what, so while you were there, were there any roundups or killings or any, any sense of this? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1322">A:Of course. </sentence><sentence id="1323">I mean the Germans used to come and round up people who were politically suspect and to my astonishment and to my disappointment I have to say that there were Jews who were, you know, in the services of the German Gestapo and they were denouncing Jews. </sentence><sentence id="1324">That's how, you know, our leaders were rounded up. </sentence><sentence id="1325">Josef Kaplan and Szmuel Breslaw, were killed in the ghetto because they were denounced and the Germans came and killed them. </sentence><sentence id="1326">And there were killings...for any transgression you, you were killed because that was the only penalty the Jews deserved. </sentence><sentence id="1327">There was only one penalty, killing you. </sentence><sentence id="1328">For any transgression, even for without transgressions. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1371">A:Well, the Warsaw ghetto was described in so many ways that it seems, to me, futile to repeat it. </sentence><sentence id="1372">Only, what I can tell you the most outstanding features in the Warsaw ghetto, when I was there, were hunger and typhus. </sentence><sentence id="1373">People were dying at, at an incredible rate every single day. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1387">A:This was late "41, like September "41. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1389">Q:OK. </sentence><sentence id="1390">You started to tell me before that you were going to get on a train which left the ghetto. </sentence><sentence id="1391">Why don't you tell me how you got out. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1395">A:Well, I told you already, I jumped into a street cart, and the guy who was with me Amnon Klukowski, he jumped first, extended his hand to me and I grabbed his hand and I jumped into the running street car. </sentence><sentence id="1396">I was young then. </sentence><sentence id="1397">I wasn't looking then like I look today. </sentence><sentence id="1398">I, I hurt my knees by doing it, but we came through the ghetto. </sentence><sentence id="1399">We removed our arm bands and we get off the car as soon as we could. </sentence><sentence id="1400">As soon as we found ourselves on the Aryan side because we, we, you didn't know who the people in the street cart were. </sentence><sentence id="1401">They could denounce you or they could keep their mouths shut but you never know so it was safer to get off and to walk. </sentence><sentence id="1402">I must say that some of the Polish street car drivers were nice and cooperative and understanding because sometimes they would slow down the pace of the running cart so that people could jump into. </sentence><sentence id="1403">It was at that time mostly for smuggling purposes, you see, you got out from the ghetto. </sentence><sentence id="1404">You buy, bought some food over there and you tried to smuggle in back, into the  ghetto. </sentence><sentence id="1405">But we were not smuggling, we were just smuggling ourselves out from the ghetto. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1418">Q:So, after you got off of the street car, what did the two of you do? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1420">A: Well, we start walking, and a group of Polish youngsters came after us and you know, "Hey Jews from the ghetto, hey Jews from the ghetto." </sentence><sentence id="1421">But Amnon, my companion, succeeded in chasing them off and nothing, no harm came to us at that point. </sentence><sentence id="1422">The real dangerous point was at the railway station, when you came to the railway station, which was, you know, crawling with, with people waiting for Jews. </sentence><sentence id="1423">We called them shmaltzovniks. </sentence><sentence id="1424">There were people you know the scum of the Polish society who made it a profession to hunt down Jews and you know, live on, on this ransom money, whatever they could take from them, money, jewelry whatever. </sentence><sentence id="1425">And sometimes it ended up in only taking their possessions away, but sometimes they took their possessions away and denounced them to the Germans. </sentence><sentence id="1426">So, when we came to that railway station, it was swarming with shmaltovniks, and one came up to us and said hey, don't be in such a hurry, where are you going you Jew Boy. </sentence><sentence id="1427">But Amnon had the right attitude and he started, you know, to answer him in a foul Polish language because that's how you could get rid of them. </sentence><sentence id="1428">And we finally succeeded to get on the train in the last moment. </sentence><sentence id="1429">Again jumping on the already moving out from the, from the station. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1440">Q:Let me ask you something. </sentence><sentence id="1441">I guess you were about 16 at the time. </sentence><sentence id="1442">Do you remember whether this was kind of exciting, an adventure? </sentence><sentence id="1443">Were you afraid, you know, what your mood was... </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="1448">when you were leaving the ghetto to go the next place? </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1449">A:Well, first of all when I found myself outside the ghetto it was a tremendous feeling of, of relief, you know to be again on normal streets, you know. </sentence><sentence id="1450">To walk like, again like a normal person. </sentence><sentence id="1451">Not to walk among dead people or people confined to be dead. </sentence><sentence id="1452">The sun was shining, you know. </sentence><sentence id="1453">It was an exhilarating experience, you know. </sentence><sentence id="1454">Boy, you know, when you are young you want to live and it, I enjoyed very much the sense of being free again, even for a short while, but that's how it was. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1461">Q:So you jumped on the train? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1463">A:Yeah, and we came to Zloty Potok. </sentence><sentence id="1464">Zloty Potok is a station that you had, had to get off and you had to walk some twenty some kilometers to the farm. </sentence><sentence id="1465">It's in the area of Czestochowa. </sentence><sentence id="1466">So we came there and we were like twenty some people on that farm. </sentence><sentence id="1467">Each pair had another story to tell when they came, you know, how they succeeded in getting out of the ghetto. </sentence><sentence id="1468">But soon it was already full and soon there was not much work to do on the farm so, and people need to eat. </sentence><sentence id="1469">We couldn't sustain all the people from the work on the farm, so the majority of the group went to Czestochowa, and they established a kibbutz there on Berka Joselewieza One, in the ghetto of Czestochowa. </sentence><sentence id="1470">There was a group of five people who remained on the farm to keep the farm hoping that next summer we'll be able to resume our activities, and I was among the group who stayed on the farm. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1483">A:The farm before the war belonged to, it was on a territory owned by a Jew called Praszker. </sentence><sentence id="1484">There was a big factory. </sentence><sentence id="1485">I think they were producing, what is it...bricks, and Josef Kaplan one of our leaders succeeded in, in arranging, in arranging for us that we could come to that place and actually create the farm. </sentence><sentence id="1486">We created it, you know. </sentence><sentence id="1487">Why a farm and not any other kind of employment, because you see, as a, as a youth organization, as a Zionist organization, even before the war we prepared ourselves to refarm workers to live on a kibbutz in, in later Israel, so that's what we wanted to do. </sentence><sentence id="1488">We had kibbutzim even before the war on farms, and this was one of the farms that we created in that small community. </sentence><sentence id="1489">We had a cow. </sentence><sentence id="1490">We had a horse. </sentence><sentence id="1491">We had some goats and some sheep and we had the fields. </sentence><sentence id="1492">We were, we were growing potatoes. </sentence><sentence id="1493">We had some, we had an orchard with plums. </sentence><sentence id="1494">We had, we planted some vegetables and we were hoping, you know, first of all to nourish ourselves and maybe to sell some of that. </sentence><sentence id="1495">But like I said, it was late in the summer and we couldn't sustain all the people. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1602">Q:So, there was no division of responsibility? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1604">A:No, no. </sentence><sentence id="1605">We just tried...and during that winter we had visitors from our leaders in Warsaw and that's when the idea of self defense was instilled in us. </sentence><sentence id="1606">They were already acquainted with what happened in, in the territories occupied by the Soviets. </sentence><sentence id="1607">And they told us the terrible truth that's awaiting us and that we have to defend ourselves. </sentence><sentence id="1608">So, how are we going to defend ourselves? </sentence><sentence id="1609">To defend means to have weapons. </sentence><sentence id="1610">Where do you take the weapons from, you know. </sentence><sentence id="1611">We didn't have the money. </sentence><sentence id="1612">Even if we could find some dealers and clandestine weapons. </sentence><sentence id="1613">We didn't have the money to buy the weapons so what we did is we equipped ourselves with knives, whatever we had. </sentence><sentence id="1614">It, it was a determination among our groups, they are not going to take us alive. </sentence><sentence id="1615">We will fight, whatever we can. </sentence><sentence id="1616">With some vitriole, with some knives, whatever we can. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1636">A:Yes. </sentence><sentence id="1637">Arieh Wilner came to the farm in the spring of 1942. </sentence><sentence id="1638">He was on his way to Bendzin, which was a Polish city incorporated into the Reich. </sentence><sentence id="1639">His aim was to spread the idea of self defense in those communities too. </sentence><sentence id="1640">And it was Arieh who brought the idea of self defense to our group. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1646">Q:What kind of a man was he? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1648">A:A fantastic man. </sentence><sentence id="1649">He was so handsome and so...you know, I couldn't help being infatuated with him, you know. </sentence><sentence id="1650">I fell in love with him and we had precious moments, you know, together...no sex...but still very, very nice moments and then he went to Bendzin. </sentence><sentence id="1651">I saw him later in the Warsaw ghetto because I rejoined the Warsaw ghetto later on. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1656">Q:How, so, how long did you stay on this farm? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1658">A:Well, from more or less from September "41 till May "42. </sentence><sentence id="1659">In May "42 we had to leave the farm because the situation was changed. </sentence><sentence id="1660">The idea that the Germans are going to kill us was spread already among the young Jewish youth organizations. </sentence><sentence id="1661">It became one of the factors in our lives and there was no need already to be on the farm. </sentence><sentence id="1662">Besides we couldn't exist. </sentence><sentence id="1663">We couldn't sustain ourselves. </sentence><sentence id="1664">So, the rest of us, the four of us joined the group in the Czestochowa ghetto and the kibbutz. </sentence><sentence id="1665">We joined the kibbutz and we were there in the kibbutz till September "42. </sentence><sentence id="1666">While I was in the kibbutz in Czestochowa, I was working on one of the farms, which before the war belonged to the youth organizations. </sentence><sentence id="1667">And at that time, the first Akcja, the first deportation from the Warsaw ghetto took place and we had the first escapees  from the Warsaw ghetto coming to our place in the ghetto Czestochowa. </sentence><sentence id="1668">At that time, I was supplied with a false birth certificate and it was decided that I should leave the ghetto and go to the Aryan side and be a courier, or be, you know, a link to someone on the Aryan side. </sentence><sentence id="1669">And I went with Tosia Altman and a group of young girls who were even younger than I was. </sentence><sentence id="1670">But they escaped from the ghetto and Tosia picked them up and brought them to Czestochowa because where could you run. </sentence><sentence id="1671">You could run from one ghetto to another ghetto. </sentence><sentence id="1672">I went out from the Czestochowa ghetto. </sentence><sentence id="1673">I came back to the farm, which was deserted by that time, with a young girl there. </sentence><sentence id="1674">I met Tosia Altman with the young girls from the ghetto, and we all went to the ghetto in Krakow. </sentence><sentence id="1675">You see, the idea was that you ran from one ghetto to another and especially to another ghetto which had already a deportation Akcja or operation, whatever the English word would be for that. </sentence><sentence id="1676">Because after a while...you see, if a ghetto was big and the number of Jews was large they couldn't take them all at one time, you know. </sentence><sentence id="1677">Even if you could put on a train 500 or 600 Jews you have to do it piecemeal. </sentence><sentence id="1678">So, usually after the first deportation there was relatively, a time of relative peace before you knew that they will come again. </sentence><sentence id="1679">So, we were running to those ghettos that had already these Akcja. </sentence><sentence id="1680">And we came to the ghetto of Krakow. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1705">Q:What was your, when you say that they thought that you may be able to serve as a courier, what was your job? </sentence><sentence id="1706">What kind of information were you passing? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1709">A:It was not information at that time. </sentence><sentence id="1710">My first task was to take care of these young girls and bring them to a safer place. </sentence><sentence id="1711">Safer was a relative notion, but at that moment, Krakow was safer than  Warsaw, you know. </sentence><sentence id="1712">Warsaw was in the throes of the expulsion. </sentence><sentence id="1713">The operation in Warsaw lasted two months, you know. </sentence><sentence id="1714">From July to September or October, the beginning of October. </sentence><sentence id="1715">That was my first task, to take these girls and in case we were interrogated, I would have this paper, this birth certificate that I am Polish. </sentence><sentence id="1716">That was my first task. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1726">Q:When you were sent out from Czestochowa, did, did you have any either ambivalence about leaving the other people who now you were very close with, I assume, or any fear of going out somewhat on your own? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1728">A:Sure. </sentence><sentence id="1729">I was already very close to Abraham Silberstein who later on became my husband. </sentence><sentence id="1730">It was very hard for me to part with him. </sentence><sentence id="1731">And it was hard to part with the other girls. </sentence><sentence id="1732">We liked each other very much. </sentence><sentence id="1733">It was a very good spirit reigning among us, you know, real friendship. </sentence><sentence id="1734">I haven't experienced this warmth of good relationship ever since. </sentence><sentence id="1735">It was hard for me to separate myself from them, but on the other hand, I was, I was exhilarated, it was a chance for me to get out from the ghetto. </sentence><sentence id="1736">Instinctively, you felt that you had much more chances outside the ghetto than inside, you know. </sentence><sentence id="1737">A lot depended on your instincts at that time. </sentence><sentence id="1738">Sure, but, you said whether I fear to go, you asked me if I...of course, I feared. </sentence><sentence id="1739">Fear was the constant feeling that accompanied me since the war began until the war ended. </sentence><sentence id="1740">You live in constant fear. </sentence><sentence id="1741">Day by day, week after week, month after month, year after year. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1756">Q:I don't know much about Czestochowa. </sentence><sentence id="1757">Was that when...you lived there for a few months, I guess? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1760">A:Yes. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1762">Q:What was that like as compared to when you were living in Warsaw? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1764">A: Well, it was like the same thing only on a smaller scale, you know. </sentence><sentence id="1765">The pattern was the same, you know. </sentence><sentence id="1766">You lived in a commune. </sentence><sentence id="1767">You went to work. </sentence><sentence id="1768">You tried to conduct some cultural activities but, you know, the danger of being deported was hanging over us like the Demoelitus sword. </sentence><sentence id="1769">After what happened in Warsaw we knew it was going to happen in other places and we were informed, as a matter of fact the youth organizations were much, more, much better informed than regular Jews. </sentence><sentence id="1770">So, that was, you know, it changed the whole attitude to what was going on, you know. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1778">Q:Was this a closed ghetto like the Warsaw ghetto? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1780">A:Sure, it was closed but it wasn't so heavily guarded as the Warsaw ghetto. </sentence><sentence id="1781">The Warsaw ghetto was surrounded by a big brick wall ten feet high topped with crushed glass and there were fourteen gates leading into the ghetto. </sentence><sentence id="1782">At each gate you had three policemen, a German, a Polish and a Jewish policeman. </sentence><sentence id="1783">So, you couldn't get out. </sentence><sentence id="1784">But in Czestochowa it wasn't so terrible, there was no wall against the ghetto. </sentence><sentence id="1785">There were streets assigned to be the ghetto. </sentence><sentence id="1786">If you had the courage to go to, to the non-Jewish part you could do it. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1794">Q: And did you do the same kind of work there as before like helping out in someone's home. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1796">A:No, I was working on the farm. </sentence><sentence id="1797">I was assigned to a brigade who was, the task of the brigade was to collect, what would be the English word...caterpillars. </sentence><sentence id="1798">We were assigned to a field where they were growing cabbage and the cabbage was infested by, by worms and there were caterpillars all over the, the cabbage beds. </sentence><sentence id="1799">Our task was to collect these things. </sentence><sentence id="1800">They smelled terribly and you had to collect them and many of them were squashed under your hands, you know. </sentence><sentence id="1801">I described it in more detail in my memoirs. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1808">Q:When it was decided that you were going to get Polish papers, did anybody talk to you about how you might have to act differently or did they teach you certain things, how to cross yourself, anything? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1810">A:No. </sentence><sentence id="1811">The idea was only...the idea that was transmitted to us is that from now on you have to defend yourself. </sentence><sentence id="1812">The Germans are going to kill us. </sentence><sentence id="1813">Defend yourself in any way you can. </sentence><sentence id="1814">Don't be direct to the, to the umschlagplatz, which was, you know, the assembly place in Warsaw or in any other ghetto. </sentence><sentence id="1815">Don't go to these trains. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1822">Q:But that was basically all the direction you were given? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1824">A:Yes, and I was given a false birth certificate which was, you know, it was like a ticket to life. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1826">Q:Do you know how they got it? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1828">A:Yes, they were in contact with some people who were manufacturing these birth certificates. </sentence><sentence id="1829">The problem only was that on that certificate I was three years older than I really was. </sentence><sentence id="1830">So, I had  sometimes trouble with look my age. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1835">Q:So, your first mission was to take these girls to Krakow? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1837">A:Yes. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1839">Q:How long did you stay there? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1841">A:For a few weeks, not too long. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1843">Q: What was the life like there by comparison? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1845">A:It was the same thing like in the Warsaw ghetto. </sentence><sentence id="1846">Hunger, typhus, desolation, on top of everything our group became illegal. </sentence><sentence id="1847">By illegal I mean we were not local Jews. </sentence><sentence id="1848">We were coming from another city, and it was the task of the Jewish police in Krakow to round up all these illegal Jews. </sentence><sentence id="1849">Evidently they had to report to the German authorities how many Jews they have in the ghetto and they had to, to give exact numbers. </sentence><sentence id="1850">So, we were illegals and they were hunting us so we were hiding. </sentence><sentence id="1851">In the ghetto we were hiding. </sentence><sentence id="1852">I was put in some attic, you know, and kept there for days in a row without being even able to go to the, to the rest room, or, you know, being delivered food like to, to a pet or animal, you know. </sentence><sentence id="1853">And in a very short time, we became infected by lice. </sentence><sentence id="1854">We were dirty. </sentence><sentence id="1855">We were smelly, hungry, desolate. </sentence><sentence id="1856">And the, I decided that we have to run again because we couldn't live there. </sentence><sentence id="1857">You know, a paradoxical situation arose, even in the Jewish ghetto, we were illegal. </sentence><sentence id="1858">We couldn't even stay  in the Krakov ghetto unless we were ready to die there on that attic. </sentence><sentence id="1859">So, we decided to run and we ran to a ghetto in Tarnow, which just had an Aktion. </sentence><sentence id="1860">And we came over there. </sentence><sentence id="1861">I will never forget the sight over there. </sentence><sentence id="1862">It was, you know, like after a real pogrom, you know. </sentence><sentence id="1863">Households, the doors open, broken glass, pillow cases ripped up and, you know, the feathers in the air. </sentence><sentence id="1864">Domestic utensils spread all over the place. </sentence><sentence id="1865">People in hiding, those who succeeded not to be rounded up. </sentence><sentence id="1866">And they were not even hostile towards us. </sentence><sentence id="1867">They were indifferent. </sentence><sentence id="1868">You know, it was, an inhumane situation already existed there. </sentence><sentence id="1869">The relations between people were not already normal. </sentence><sentence id="1870">They were not human relations any more. </sentence><sentence id="1871">   Tape #3 </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1900">Q:When we stopped, you were talking about what it was like arriving in Tarnow after an Aktion. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1902">A: Well it was a terrible sight you know. </sentence><sentence id="1903">It was, desolation everywhere, you know. </sentence><sentence id="1904">The people that we met were scared and suspicious and not willing to talk to us. </sentence><sentence id="1905">Even like, it didn't matter to them anything because they were at the brink of an abyss and that changes the psychology of a person. </sentence><sentence id="1906">You stopped caring about others. </sentence><sentence id="1907">You stopped caring about anything. </sentence><sentence id="1908">I saw the people, young people having sex almost publicly. </sentence><sentence id="1909">And I asked one of them later on, why would you do that and he said, "Well, I don't know if I'll live tomorrow. </sentence><sentence id="1910">I want to taste life what it is like before I go to, to die." </sentence><sentence id="1911">To make a long story short, the, the atmosphere was macabre. </sentence><sentence id="1912">To me I couldn't stand it. </sentence><sentence id="1913">I couldn't stay there another day. </sentence><sentence id="1914">There was no where for me to go. </sentence><sentence id="1915">I didn't know anybody. </sentence><sentence id="1916">The girls got attached to some groups and they didn't want to go with me anymore, only one girl went with me, Julcia Fiks, Ester. </sentence><sentence id="1917">Julcia was her clandestine name. </sentence><sentence id="1918">Her real name was Ester Fiks. </sentence><sentence id="1919">She came with me and we ran back to the Krakow ghetto. </sentence><sentence id="1920">The situation didn't improve in the Krakow ghetto, and that's when I decided that I will run away from the ghetto into the Aryan side. </sentence><sentence id="1921">I had no contact with my Hashomer Hatzair people anymore. </sentence><sentence id="1922">I had no money, maybe a few zlotys, you know. </sentence><sentence id="1923">I had no food. </sentence><sentence id="1924">I had no place to live. </sentence><sentence id="1925">On top of everything, I heard stories like other Jewish girls escaped from the ghetto into the Aryan side and they were scooped up and killed. </sentence><sentence id="1926">In spite of all this, in spite of these rumors, I decided to do it because it became obvious to me that I will sooner or later be scooped up by the Jewish police and handed over to the Germans and sent away, and I didn't want that to happen because I knew what happened to scooped up Jews. </sentence><sentence id="1927">So, I  one day joined the working brigade going from the ghetto to work on the Aryan side. </sentence><sentence id="1928">At a suitable moment, I detached myself from that group, take off my, took off my armband and I had this false birth certificate in my pocket and, viola, I was a Polish girl. </sentence><sentence id="1929">There was no where to go, no place, no money, no contacts, no where. </sentence><sentence id="1930">So, for hours I was walking the streets aimlessly just walking, until I could make some decision. </sentence><sentence id="1931">I remember I came, I came to a church and went into the church and it was very soothing. </sentence><sentence id="1932">The inside was cool and so quiet. </sentence><sentence id="1933">It was a temporary relief, you know from all the horrible sights that I saw. </sentence><sentence id="1934">But I had to make a decision what to do with myself because there was a curfew time, you know, after seven or eight in the evening, I don't recollect exactly, nobody was to be found on the streets and I had to make a decision before that time. </sentence><sentence id="1935">So, in spite of the rumors that I heard about Jewish girls being killed, I went to a German hospital and I offered my services. </sentence><sentence id="1936">I was asking if they need some help. </sentence><sentence id="1937">They told me that they are not the hiring office, that if I want to apply I should go to a certain place on a certain street. </sentence><sentence id="1938">They gave me the number, and I went there from the hospital to that office and I had that conversation with the hiring woman. </sentence><sentence id="1939">And she hired me. </sentence><sentence id="1940">Well, I should add that I made myself as presentable as I could, you know, after that existence in the ghetto, you know. </sentence><sentence id="1941">I was still in a very poor physical shape. </sentence><sentence id="1942">And, you know, I was dirty and I didn't even have a place where to wash up. </sentence><sentence id="1943">But somehow I succeeded to make a good impression on that interviewing woman. </sentence><sentence id="1944">She gave me the job and I said when can I report to work. </sentence><sentence id="1945">She said if you want you can come tomorrow. </sentence><sentence id="1946">So, I went and I became a member of the, of the staff of that German hospital. </sentence><sentence id="1947">It was on Marka, Swistego Marka Street in Krakow. </sentence><sentence id="1948">And I was assigned to the kitchen as a kitchen helper, kitchen help, and I was working there, cleaning the vegetables and it was a very hard time for me because all of a sudden I had to become a Polish girl with all the Polish mannerism, which I didn't have. </sentence><sentence id="1949">One thing stood in my favor was the Polish language. </sentence><sentence id="1950">I was in very good command of the language. </sentence><sentence id="1951">So, at least they couldn't suspect me right away. </sentence><sentence id="1952">You, see that was an impediment for many, many Jews. </sentence><sentence id="1953">That even if they spoke Polish, they didn't spoke a pure Polish. </sentence><sentence id="1954">There was always a Jewish accent in it and the Poles could detect you right away. </sentence><sentence id="1955">The Germans couldn't, but the Poles could. </sentence><sentence id="1956">So, I was working there for some time and it was very hard for me because the women in that group of kitchen helpers, they were churlish and their language was foul. </sentence><sentence id="1957">Each time I heard them talk, I was red in the face, you know. </sentence><sentence id="1958">I was a young girl with no sexual experience, and here I was among women who were prostitutes, who were mostly maids who worked previously before the war in Jewish households. </sentence><sentence id="1959">The very lowest levels of Polish society, but somehow I managed to stay there. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="2184">What, what prompted you to go work in a German military hospital? </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2185">A:Good question. </sentence><sentence id="2186">Because I overheard that in that German hospital girls are coming for work. </sentence><sentence id="2187">Some were killed but I took the chance maybe they won't recognize me. </sentence><sentence id="2188">I didn't know where to go. </sentence><sentence id="2189">You are in a strange city. </sentence><sentence id="2190">You don't know where to go. </sentence><sentence id="2191">You don't have money. </sentence><sentence id="2192">You have to disappear from the street before seven o'clock in the evening. </sentence><sentence id="2193">Where are you going? </sentence><sentence id="2194">Like I said, it was Russian Roulette. </sentence><sentence id="2195">I just knew that I heard that this place was, was hiring people so I went there. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2207">Q:This was just conversation on the street or you just heard about it? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2209">A:T heard about it in the ghetto. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2211">Q:So how long did you work there? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2213">A: worked there from about November of "42 to March "43. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2215">Q: What else happened there? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2217">A:While I was working there. </sentence><sentence id="2218">Well one thing is that...on Christmas Eve, "42, "43, the kitchen chef arranged a big party, a Christmas party and of course I participated in that party and I was terribly afraid to get drunk, because I didn't know what I might say when I will be drunk. </sentence><sentence id="2219">On the other hand I didn't want to show that I am not drinking because that would be an indication, you know, only Jewish girls didn't drink. </sentence><sentence id="2220">Polish girls drank, especially that group of girls had no objections of imbuing themselves with vodka. </sentence><sentence id="2221">So, I was drinking, and I became drunk for the first time in my life, but even in the straight, state of drunkenness I didn't lose my, my ability not to talk of what need not to be said. </sentence><sentence id="2222">I didn't lose my hold on myself completely. </sentence><sentence id="2223">But that turned out to be very beneficial for me because after that party I was one of the group. </sentence><sentence id="2224">It was like battle christening for me. </sentence><sentence id="2225">I made it. </sentence><sentence id="2226">I was Leoska. </sentence><sentence id="2227">I wasn't Leah anymore, I was Leoska and it was okay. </sentence><sentence id="2228">The girls they took advantage of me. </sentence><sentence id="2229">They sent me to steal food for them. </sentence><sentence id="2230">I did it because I wanted to be accepted and I was, and that's how, how I could exist among them. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2245">Q:Did you make any friends there? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2247">A:I, later on I made friends with one Jewish girl who also came to work there. </sentence><sentence id="2248">Her name was Ursula and from the moment she came to work I suspected her of being Jewish because you know, you had a sense of distinguish right away your own people. </sentence><sentence id="2249">And to prove that she's Jewish one day when we went down to the cellar to pick up the potatoes or vegetables I started to hum the Jewish national anthem, the Hatikva, and I figured if she's not Jewish she won't react to it, but if she is she might and she did. </sentence><sentence id="2250">And we became friends. </sentence><sentence id="2251">It was very beneficial for me because she was, her sister who was a married woman already was hiding with her husband on the Polish side in Krakow and she used to take me to them. </sentence><sentence id="2252">So, that was the first honest human contact that I could have after I left the ghetto. </sentence><sentence id="2253">And it was a big relief. </sentence><sentence id="2254">The other important thing that happened to me at that time was that I stole a gun from one of the Germans. </sentence><sentence id="2255">It happened that way. </sentence><sentence id="2256">Tosia Altman, one of the leaders in my youth organization knew where I was. </sentence><sentence id="2257">She knew that I am in that, that I work in that hospital. </sentence><sentence id="2258">And evidently other members of the organization knew. </sentence><sentence id="2259">So, one day on my way from work to the place where I lived, I met one of our members. </sentence><sentence id="2260">His name was Tadek, Tuvia Szajngot was his real name. </sentence><sentence id="2261">And we knew each other from the ghetto in Czestochowa. </sentence><sentence id="2262">He was one of the escapees from the Warsaw ghetto. </sentence><sentence id="2263">And he stayed in the Tarnow ghetto. </sentence><sentence id="2264">He came, he was purposely waiting for me. </sentence><sentence id="2265">He knew that I would leave work at a certain time and we met and during that conversation he instilled in me the idea that maybe I could steal a gun. </sentence><sentence id="2266">The hospital has Germans and each of them has a weapon. </sentence><sentence id="2267">And one day it happened. </sentence><sentence id="2268">I describe it in more detail in my memoirs, so I don't think it's important to go over it again and again. </sentence><sentence id="2269">I succeeded in taking out a parabellum and I hid it in my place where I was living until after a while Tadek came and picked it up. </sentence><sentence id="2270">And it did a good job later on in the, in the uprising and the, during the uprising in the Czestochowa ghetto. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2295">Q: Weren't you scared? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2297">A:I was scared to death -- you mean when I was stealing it? </sentence><sentence id="2298">It was one of the most romantic experiences in my life. </sentence><sentence id="2299">I became so frantic that for a moment I thought I'm going out of my mind because there was a moment when I grabbed the gun out of the scabbard, what is the name, the word...and I put it into my panties and went from the room where the Germans -- you know the room was empty when I took it. </sentence><sentence id="2300">There was nobody in it and it was a split second decision whether I'm going to do it or not, and I did it. </sentence><sentence id="2301">And here I am with that gun in my hand which I put into my panties. </sentence><sentence id="2302">I run out from room. </sentence><sentence id="2303">Luckily across that room was the rest room. </sentence><sentence id="2304">I ran into that rest room and didn't know what to do with it now. </sentence><sentence id="2305">What was I going to do with that thing. </sentence><sentence id="2306">So, I climbed on the toilet and there was a, a window. </sentence><sentence id="2307">The window was leading to a little roof which was nothing but the top of, of a garbage bin and I left it there, and I went back to the kitchen, you know. </sentence><sentence id="2308">But inside there was such a storm running in me that I had to use all my humanly possible power to, to control myself, you know. </sentence><sentence id="2309">I was red in my face. </sentence><sentence id="2310">My mouth was dry like a sole. </sentence><sentence id="2311">I was trembling. </sentence><sentence id="2312">I was afraid that my, that people would notice some physical changes in myself. </sentence><sentence id="2313">So, I tried as best as I could to control myself and I succeeded. </sentence><sentence id="2314">Nobody suspected me. </sentence><sentence id="2315">I was probably the last person they would suspect of stealing that gun. </sentence><sentence id="2316">Later on, you know, there was an alarm. </sentence><sentence id="2317">There was, you know, Gestapo came and the police came. </sentence><sentence id="2318">They arrested the German whose gun I stole, but I succeeded in getting out that, that gun from that hospital. </sentence><sentence id="2319">Well, around March I got a letter from Tosia Altman, that Arieh Wilner, one of our leading persons in the organization, was caught by the Gestapo and he's under investigation and that I should leave immediately, the hospital, because in all probability Arieh, which was, you know, Jurek was his pseudo name in occupation time that Jurek might have some picture of me and maybe even some letters from me to him. </sentence><sentence id="2320">So, I had to leave immediately, which I did. </sentence><sentence id="2321">On my way out from the hospital and I was running away, I had people coming to the Wache, to the check points, you know to the guards at the entrance, people asking for Leokadia Bukowska. </sentence><sentence id="2322">That was my Polish name. </sentence><sentence id="2323">And I ran out in a fit of, of anxiety from that building, running like crazy in front of me, just like a hunted animal, literally, you know. </sentence><sentence id="2324">And I jumped into a street cart, not knowing where it's going. </sentence><sentence id="2325">It didn't matter to me, just to be far away, as far away from that hospital as possible. </sentence><sentence id="2326">And in my wild imagination I thought that some people are after me, you know. </sentence><sentence id="2327">I was suspecting, maybe those who were asking me were told that I just left the place and they were running after me. </sentence><sentence id="2328">So I, you know, in the, in the street cart the seats were, were, you know, benches, one on one side of the street cart and the other on the other side. </sentence><sentence id="2329">People sit vis-a-vis each other. </sentence><sentence id="2330">And there were two guys who were looking at me all the time, and I didn't know why they are looking at me, but of course suspicion right away, you know. </sentence><sentence id="2331">They, they must be those guys who came to catch me. </sentence><sentence id="2332">Anyway, I don't know whether this was true or my wild imagination. </sentence><sentence id="2333">Maybe they were just looking at me, you know, as a young girl, or maybe they just saw that something wrong is with me. </sentence><sentence id="2334">Anyway, I jumped out from that street cart and ran straight into a house and hid myself in the attic, covered myself up with some, with some shmates, some rags and I laid there for several hours. </sentence><sentence id="2335">I heard some talks on the, on the, in the back yard but I didn't know whether it relates to me or not. </sentence><sentence id="2336">Anyway, after several hours I succeeded somehow to calm down, to regain my posure, no my, to regain my balance again and I ventured, ventured to get out into the street and there was nobody waiting for me in the street. </sentence><sentence id="2337">And I got in touch with that girl, Ester Fiks. </sentence><sentence id="2338">She was working in another German institution called the Soldatenheim. </sentence><sentence id="2339">I got in touch with her. </sentence><sentence id="2340">I knew where she's working and we decided to run away. </sentence><sentence id="2341">And we ran away to Lwow, Lemberg. </sentence><sentence id="2342">We took a train and came there and we tried to, to establish ourselves over there, but a sense told us that this is not a good place to, for us. </sentence><sentence id="2343">It was full of Ukrainians and Ukrainians were collaborating with the Germans. </sentence><sentence id="2344">The atmosphere was not good for us and the very same day we took another train back, but not to Krakow anymore. </sentence><sentence id="2345">We went to the ghetto and took it to Czestochowa, and we got into the ghetto in Czestochowa.

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2399">A:I met with my friends from the kibbutz in Czestochowa from Berka Joselewicza and among them was Abraham Silberstein who was one in the group who stayed in the, at the farm after the rest when to Czestochowa and I learned at that time that they are organizing an uprising, that they are not going to be scooped up by the Germans. </sentence><sentence id="2400">That they will fight when the time comes. </sentence><sentence id="2401">| also learned that an uprising is being in preparation in the Warsaw ghetto. </sentence><sentence id="2402">And after a few days, we recuperated, you know, could wash ourselves and bring ourselves to, to, to look normally, me and the other young girl, Ester Fiks, decided to go to Warsaw to get into the Warsaw ghetto. </sentence><sentence id="2403">If we are going to fight, we are going to fight in the Warsaw ghetto. </sentence><sentence id="2404">One of the reasons was Warsaw was where I grew up and belongs to me. </sentence><sentence id="2405">Another is that Arieh  Wilner whom I loved was there and I wanted to be with him, whether we are going to fight, I want to be with him. </sentence><sentence id="2406">And the third reason was that Ester's little brother Bolus was in Warsaw and she wanted to be close to him to take, you know, supervise him somehow take care of him. </sentence><sentence id="2407">So, we decided to go to Warsaw, and we came to Warsaw. </sentence><sentence id="2408">And we entered the ghetto. </sentence><sentence id="2409">You usually entered by way of a working battalion from the Aryan side going at the end of the day into the ghetto. </sentence><sentence id="2410">So, we joined a battalion and went into the ghetto. </sentence><sentence id="2411">And I came to the headquarters of the Jewish fighting organization on Zamenhofa. </sentence><sentence id="2412">Let me tell you, when I came to the ghetto it wasn't the same ghetto that I left in "41. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2436">A:Different. </sentence><sentence id="2437">It was a ghost town, because at that time the ghetto was already, the population of the ghetto was reduced from half a million to only sixty or fifty thousand people. </sentence><sentence id="2438">And they were concentrated in a small, much smaller area. </sentence><sentence id="2439">And you went through a zone which was an inhabited zone, you know, with all the aspects of a ghost town, you know. </sentence><sentence id="2440">A town after a terrible pogrom, you know. </sentence><sentence id="2441">And it was, it was like coming into a world out of this world. </sentence><sentence id="2442">A world that your senses cannot even comprehend all this, you know. </sentence><sentence id="2443">You see houses abandoned. </sentence><sentence id="2444">People domiciles, people's way of living destroyed and you had to go through  that area very quickly. </sentence><sentence id="2445">You were not allowed to linger around. </sentence><sentence id="2446">Well, I came to that, to that center of the Jewish fighting organization and I met Arieh Wilner over there. </sentence><sentence id="2447">He was in a terrible state because it was after the, after he was interrogated by the Gestapo and he was tortured terribly. </sentence><sentence id="2448">He was, there is an exact description of his tortures by Henryk Grabowski, the Pole who was the scout and who succeeded to rescue him from one of the, of the working camps that he was put into. </sentence><sentence id="2449">Anyway, it wasn't the same Arieh that I knew in Spring. </sentence><sentence id="2450">He could barely talk to me. </sentence><sentence id="2451">He was in a state of depression and maybe he didn't want to talk to me. </sentence><sentence id="2452">I don't know. </sentence><sentence id="2453">After a few days, we wanted to join the working groups. </sentence><sentence id="2454">I remember the discussion they had between the leaders of ZOB, Zydowska Organizacja Bojowa, Mordechaj Awelewicz, Icchak Cukierman, and Cywia Lubetkin, and they decided it would be better to send me out from the ghetto to be a courier. </sentence><sentence id="2455">I had the attributes than to stay in the ghetto. </sentence><sentence id="2456">It was too late to train me. </sentence><sentence id="2457">They didn't have enough weapons even for the people who were organized already in groups. </sentence><sentence id="2458">So, I was smuggled out from the ghetto. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3508">Q:In reading...I don't need to ask you to go through all of the details of daily life there because you've described it very well in your manuscript, but there are certain aspects that were very interesting to me. </sentence><sentence id="3509">One is that you, in spite of these very, very difficult conditions every day, you had ways to kind of keep your self, keep your spirits alive. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3518">A:As a group, there were different phases of the existence. </sentence><sentence id="3519">Most of the time you know, depending on which time of the five years we are talking, there were times when I was completely on my own. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3522">Q:No, I'm talking about in this house on Promyka Street . </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3524">A:Oh, oh, that was a very interesting period because you know we were like 15 people after the five left and we were, you know spread on the floor and here we are. </sentence><sentence id="3525">We can't go out, so we used to stay all day long in that hiding and only in the evening we used to go out, you know, and, to relieve ourselves, to cook something if there is, if there was something to be cooked. </sentence><sentence id="3526">And, you know, to shave or to wash, wash, if you had some water, because we didn't. </sentence><sentence id="3527">And, like I said, we were often plagued by visits of Germans coming down. </sentence><sentence id="3528">But we found one way of relieving the tension, which was enormous, you know. </sentence><sentence id="3529">You live with that pent up anxiety, was a pent up fear that you can be discovered any moment. </sentence><sentence id="3530">And there were such moments because the Germans started to build a trench in front of our house. </sentence><sentence id="3531">It was supposed to be a barricade before the onslaught of the Russian army. </sentence><sentence id="3532">And the window from that basement, from that laundry room, was camouflaged by sacks of sand. </sentence><sentence id="3533">But as they were building this trench, the sacks were falling off and the sand was coming off from the  windows and they could look into the windows and see us on the floor there. </sentence><sentence id="3534">So, the danger became very eminent. </sentence><sentence id="3535">You know, like I said at the beginning, I'm not a religious person, but, this was one of the miracles that happened, that people were not discovered. </sentence><sentence id="3536">I don't know how the history of the Jewish uprising in the ghetto would look today if these people were caught and, and annihilated because you know history is made by, by what people tell you. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3551">Q:What, so, what did you do to relieve the tension? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3553">A:We established at one time a system by which every day a person would, would have a presentation, whether a lecture or talk about something. </sentence><sentence id="3554">We had one guy in the group who was like our living calendar. </sentence><sentence id="3555">A very nice guy. </sentence><sentence id="3556">His name was Zygmaunt Warman. </sentence><sentence id="3557">He was a lawyer by profession. </sentence><sentence id="3558">A tall, big guy. </sentence><sentence id="3559">Unfortunately he became sick in that hiding and he was coughing constantly and he was a mortal danger when the Germans were coming out and there were situations when the Germans were in the main room where the old women were. </sentence><sentence id="3560">The four old women were in a separate room. </sentence><sentence id="3561">We were in the laundry hiding. </sentence><sentence id="3562">Anyway, this Zygmaunt became our living calendar. </sentence><sentence id="3563">Each morning he would wake us up and said, "Hello everybody,"...let's say..."today is October 15, Wednesday, 1944." </sentence><sentence id="3564">So, at least we didn't lose the track of time. </sentence><sentence id="3565">We knew what day it was. </sentence><sentence id="3566">And like I said, everybody would, would tell a story, you know, something. </sentence><sentence id="3567">So, we kept ourselves this way. </sentence><sentence id="3568">Somehow to die from boredom. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3585">Q:Now, this may or may not be an appropriate question. </sentence><sentence id="3586">But here you all are, 15 people in a very small space, day in, day out. </sentence><sentence id="3587">Obviously there wasn't much privacy. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3591">A:No, there was no privacy at all. </sentence><sentence id="3592">And in the beginning of course, we were, you know, in a very awkward position, you know, because we, some of us didn't know the other people. </sentence><sentence id="3593">But after a while when you live under this kind of conditions, you know, privacy flees out through the window...there was no window! </sentence><sentence id="3594">Anyway, there was no privacy. </sentence><sentence id="3595">You couldn't, you see, we had a sink in that room, being a laundry, we had a sink and it was a blessing, because you can go and urinate, but you couldn't do the other thing in the sink, so we had to wait till the night. </sentence><sentence id="3596">And we were also dressed, very, in very weird costumes, costumes. </sentence><sentence id="3597">I mean, we were dressed in what we could find in the adjoining abandoned buildings, you know, nightshirts or gowns or whatever it was. </sentence><sentence id="3598">Some ball gowns, you know, we were looking weird, especially the girls, you know. </sentence><sentence id="3599">So, when somebody was going to the sink, there were all kinds of comments and...

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3617">Q:Were there, I mean I know that prior to this you talked about the fact that there were strict moral codes. </sentence><sentence id="3618">But I can't believe that people living in this intimacy, so much need to relieve tension, that there weren't sexual relationships. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3621">A:You are quite right about that, and the truth is that there were couples among these people, you know. </sentence><sentence id="3622">Couples from before the war, and these people of course were together. </sentence><sentence id="3623">Besides, you were lying on a floor of a small room in a way that one body touched the other body. </sentence><sentence id="3624">There was no way you could escape it, you know, and there was some sexual activity among the people, in a surreptitious way, but there was. </sentence><sentence id="3625">But like I said, the majority were couples anyway. </sentence></p></dialogue>

Many Poles threw away their identification because it's the end of the Germans, it's Poland again. </sentence><sentence id="3649">This euphoria of the first day of the Uprising was enormous, you know, such a burst out of Polish patriotism. </sentence><sentence id="3650">So, many people were throwing away their papers. </sentence><sentence id="3651">They don't want any German papers anymore. </sentence><sentence id="3652">I was lucky not to throw away mine. </sentence><sentence id="3653">And I showed them my papers, and another German was interrogating Sabinka a few yards away from me. </sentence><sentence id="3654">He asked... the German who was interrogating me asked me, "Who's she?" </sentence><sentence id="3655">I said, "She's my grandmother." </sentence><sentence id="3656">Because we agreed among ourselves that if we are caught I would say that she is my grandmother.

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3973">Q:What was it like, this return of all people from, all these people, from different areas and different experiences and horrors. </sentence><sentence id="3974">What was it like everybody coming back? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3977">A: Well, it was a very intensive time, you know, because like you said, different kinds of people were coming and each of them had a hair raising story to tell. </sentence><sentence id="3978">So, we were constantly hearing all kinds of stuff. </sentence><sentence id="3979">Things that now everybody knows because in hind sight you, you learned a lot of things. </sentence><sentence id="3980">But at that time, certain things we heard for the first time, like what was going on in concentration camps. </sentence><sentence id="3981">I was never in a concentration camp, but there were people coming from these camps and starting telling their stories. </sentence><sentence id="3982">And slowly, you know, step by step, the terrible reality of the five years of German occupation began to unfold. </sentence><sentence id="3983">And people coming from Russia they had their stories too, you know. </sentence><sentence id="3984">Soon, we started to organize ourselves and I was assigned we were, we did...1 mean...again our commanding people, I mean the people at the top of the group, like Yitzhak Zuckerman and others, I mention his name more often than others because almost all the leading people of Hashomer Hatzair died in the war except maybe for Chaika Grossman and well, we started to organize not only to, to have a gathering point for Jews to come to, but also to send out people to look for liberated Jews, you know. </sentence><sentence id="3985">Because when people were liberated by the Soviet Army, the first impulse of people was going back to their places. </sentence><sentence id="3986">That was the natural instinct, to see if somebody survived, if the house survived, if something can be rescued. </sentence><sentence id="3987">So, I was assigned to, to do that with another girl. </sentence><sentence id="3988">Her name was Krysia Biderman. </sentence><sentence id="3989">Actually her real name was Sarah Biderman, Krysia was her pseudo name during the war. </sentence><sentence id="3990">And we were 4 traveling criss-cross Poland looking for surviving Jews, and we found them. </sentence><sentence id="3991">And sometimes these meetings were so packed with emotion I lack the words to describe it, you know. </sentence><sentence id="3992">Because the idea that we are really survivors couldn't sink in yet. </sentence><sentence id="3993">You were full of apprehensions that maybe it will change again, you know. </sentence><sentence id="3994">For, for years you were...lived like a hunted animal. </sentence><sentence id="3995">It, it gets into your psyche. </sentence><sentence id="3996">It's very difficult to get rid of that feeling that you are not in danger anymore. </sentence><sentence id="3997">All these self defense mechanisms are still with you, you know, and in many cases people were reluctant to admit that they are Jews. </sentence><sentence id="3998">In many places, places they didn't want to talk to us. </sentence><sentence id="3999">They didn't know who we are. </sentence><sentence id="4000">But there were also cases when we came and we got such a warm welcome. </sentence><sentence id="4001">I remember... don't even remember which place, what was the name of the place, but we came to a small place and there was a Jewish family there and we got a very warm welcome. </sentence><sentence id="4002">We were tired, you know, traveling constantly and the ways and she gave us a good supper and she put us into bed and we could wash. </sentence><sentence id="4003">And it was real Jewish hospitality that was known before the war which was absent during the war and again, you know, it was like slowly coming back to life. </sentence><sentence id="4004">And a year later, after the liberation, there was a terrible pogrom in Kielce, a city called Kielce. </sentence><sentence id="4005">It's between Krakow and Warsaw, yeah. </sentence><sentence id="4006">And after that it was very hard to, to...to make people believe that they are out of danger. </sentence><sentence id="4007">The nightmare was coming back, and this time not from the Germans but from the Poles. </sentence><sentence id="4008">And many people didn't want to talk to us so we were leaving the address in case they would change their mind and in case they would decide to leave and if they come to Warsaw or to Lodz, or Wroclaw, we gave them addresses where they could come and get instructions and help and if they wanted to get out of Poland. </sentence><sentence id="4009">And within the first years after the liberations, thousands of Jews left Poland. </sentence><sentence id="4010">There was an 5 organized exodus and there was a clandestine exodus called Bricha, but people were leaving Poland. </sentence><sentence id="4011">Of course there was always a number of Jews who stayed, you know, but not many. </sentence><sentence id="4012">Out of a population, of a Jewish population of over three millions, only 240,000 registered after the war. </sentence><sentence id="4013">That should give you an estimate. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="4360">A:Look, the self preservation instinct in a person is terribly strong, especially when you are young. </sentence><sentence id="4361">As you get older, this instinct diminishes, it slacks down. </sentence><sentence id="4362">But when you are young, you want to live. </sentence><sentence id="4363">You don't want to die. </sentence><sentence id="4364">It's one of the most intensive drives in a human being, self preservation. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="4528"> 8 </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="4529">A:You see, in a family, there are things you, you couldn't tell young people what the real reality was because you were afraid it might warp their emotional growth. </sentence><sentence id="4530">You couldn't tell them about Aktions and killings and killing centers. </sentence><sentence id="4531">So, you were keeping it from them. </sentence><sentence id="4532">But kids are usually very smart. </sentence><sentence id="4533">They would listen and they would pick up here and there an article, or here and there a book and they as they grew they realized and they had to face a terrible reality. </sentence><sentence id="4534">Because all of a sudden their parents were not normal parents. </sentence><sentence id="4535">Like, by normal, I mean like those in Israel who, you know, didn't make, didn't...those who were local Jews who didn't go through the Holocaust. </sentence><sentence id="4536">And we were different. </sentence><sentence id="4537">And childrens don't want to be different. </sentence><sentence id="4538">They want to be like anybody else. </sentence><sentence id="4539">So, they hold a grudge against us, you know sort of, you know. " </sentence><sentence id="4540">Why, why do you always have to talk about the Holocaust." </sentence><sentence id="4541">And how can I not talk about it when not only my immediate family perished in it, but the whole Jewish-Polish-Jewish community in Poland was destroyed. </sentence><sentence id="4542">How can you forget a thing like that and not talk about it. </sentence><sentence id="4543">But it takes courage to face it, and the truth also is that after the war, people didn't want to hear it. </sentence><sentence id="4544">They didn't want to know about it. </sentence><sentence id="4545">There was a time when it was taboo. </sentence><sentence id="4546">In Israel, in any other places, and it was only later years that sort of...I think that the film Shoah made a big change in the attitude and people started to think. </sentence><sentence id="4547">Besides, I think that people needed a certain distance from, in time, a perspective. </sentence><sentence id="4548">It was all too fresh after the war to come to certain conclusions or to certain, what would be the English word, to certain understandings. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="4569">Q:So was this painful for you that people didn't want to talk about it? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="4571"> 9 </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="4572">A:Yes it was, it was, you see because in addition to being a Holocaust survivor, once you are being transplanted from one geographic entity to another one, once you become an immigrant it's very difficult to adjust to a new country. </sentence><sentence id="4573">Even though, theoretically, you know that this is your state it's a Jewish state and everybody's Jewish, but you are still an immigrant and an immigrant is automatically a half idiot. </sentence><sentence id="4574">You come to a country. </sentence><sentence id="4575">You don't know the language of that country. </sentence><sentence id="4576">You cannot express yourself. </sentence><sentence id="4577">You, you start, you acquire a few basic words and you come to a store and you're a laughing stock because instead of, of buying... I came to a store and I bought a pair of stockings. </sentence><sentence id="4578">I came home and realized that one is damaged. </sentence><sentence id="4579">I went back to the store and I say in Hebrew, you know, you don't understand Hebrew, ah well...anyway, instead of saying I want another stocking I said give me another "men" Of course she was laughing her head off. </sentence><sentence id="4580">What do you want? </sentence><sentence id="4581">Getteb and Gebber...you know, the consonants change. </sentence><sentence id="4582">Yeah, it was difficult. </sentence><sentence id="4583">And then I had to go through that process again when I came to the United States. </sentence><sentence id="4584">I was again an immigrant, and again this transplanting process. </sentence><sentence id="4585">It's very difficult. </sentence><sentence id="4586">Again a new culture. </sentence><sentence id="4587">Again a new adjustment. </sentence><sentence id="4588">Again a new language, new habits, new environments, new requirements at work. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="4606">Q:I'm curious why you came to the United States? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="4608">A:I came, that's a very personal question, but to answer your question, it was not because of political reasons, it was because of personal reasons. </sentence><sentence id="4609">My husband couldn't find any work and we were on the thresh of poverty in Israel. </sentence><sentence id="4610">I was the only breadwinner in the family. </sentence><sentence id="4611">Well, let's not go into it. </sentence><sentence id="4612">0 </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="4618">Q:Is there anything else that you want to add right now? </sentence><sentence id="4619">Because I think I've probably, I mean I could ask you more questions but you've given me a wealth of information and insight and I'm wondering if there's something else you would like to say? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="4622">A: Well, I would like to say that I'm glad that people slowly begin to understand what the Holocaust really was. </sentence><sentence id="4623">There is a whole range now of excellent researchers and people of, of science who study these things. </sentence><sentence id="4624">I lately read about this excellent book by David Goldhagen. </sentence><sentence id="4625">He has an excellent point, you know. </sentence><sentence id="4626">His point is that it was not only the Nazi regime, but it was...the title of his book is the willing, "Hitler's Willing Executioners" and the point he's making is that not only the regime but the whole German population was part of that terrible thing that, you know happened. </sentence><sentence id="4627">That they were part of the annihilation of Polish or East European Jewry. </sentence><sentence id="4628">He's not the first who came up with that principle. </sentence><sentence id="4629">Before him there was another excellent book by Christopher Browning," An Ordinary Man", and he gives an account of how these so-called ordinary Germans became mass killers and it's all based on German documents which makes these publications important. </sentence><sentence id="4630">Because the other documentation coming from Jewish sources, the non-Jews or anti-Semites would say the Jews have a tendency to exaggerate. </sentence><sentence id="4631">They are always see themselves as victims, but not with the German sources. </sentence><sentence id="4632">Here is black and white and they could not deny them. </sentence><sentence id="4633">Although there are those who denied that the Holocaust ever existed, you know, but... You know, that reminds me of a Polish saying, if I translate it into English, they would say, "If you spit on a prostitute, she would say it's raining." </sentence><sentence id="4634">That's what happening to all those who denied the Holocaust. </sentence><sentence id="4635">They would say that. </sentence><sentence id="4636">How can you deny obvious things. </sentence><sentence id="4637">You cannot. </sentence><sentence id="4638">But there have always been Jew haters and there are still Jew haters. </sentence><sentence id="4639">As long as there is hate in the world there will never be peace. </sentence><sentence id="4640">We see it not only on the Jewish case, look what's happening in ex-Yugoslavia, what's happening Biafra, what's happening in India. </sentence><sentence id="4641">What's 1 happening in other places. </sentence><sentence id="4642">You would think that people would learn something from it, what happened, but in my opinion, people didn't learn a thing. </sentence><sentence id="4643">History, if you don't learn from your mistakes, you are bound to repeat it. </sentence><sentence id="4644">Some people would ask me do you think that the Holocaust is possible again. </sentence><sentence id="4645">My answer is yes, it's possible, because you see the German ideology killed not only people it killed moral principles. </sentence><sentence id="4646">Before you can kill people, you first have to kill the moral principles. </sentence><sentence id="4647">Then it's possible to do and you can see in the world today, where are moral principles. </sentence><sentence id="4648">People became sort of indifferent to calamities, and that's a dangerous thing. </sentence><sentence id="4649">That's what I would like to add. </sentence><sentence id="4650">If you ask me. </sentence></p></dialogue>
