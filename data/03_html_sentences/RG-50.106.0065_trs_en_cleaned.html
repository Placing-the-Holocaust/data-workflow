<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="340">Q: Let's back up a little bit. </sentence><sentence id="341">Why did you try to keep volunteering? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="344">A: Iwasa patriotic American. </sentence><sentence id="345">That's the only reason. </sentence><sentence id="346">Not because -- I had heard things, but it didn't affect me that much. </sentence><sentence id="347">I felt that it was my job. </sentence><sentence id="348">I had heard about Hitler; I can't say that I didn't. </sentence><sentence id="349">But it didn't affect me that much only because I didn't pay too much attention to any of that. </sentence><sentence id="350">And I was in there because I wanted to change my life, for one thing. </sentence><sentence id="351">And for another thing, I wanted to get into the service. </sentence><sentence id="352">I wanted something different. </sentence><sentence id="353">I wanted some adventure, so to speak. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="364">Q: Was your being Jewish a factor in volunteering? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="366">A: Very little. </sentence><sentence id="367">And it all goes back to my mother who kept drumming my being Yiddish, my being Jewish, over and over and over again until I just couldn't take any more. </sentence><sentence id="368">So I tried to be as -- not that I tried to be a goy, but I tried to be as non-Jewish as I could possibly be. </sentence><sentence id="369">And I got along with most everybody. </sentence><sentence id="370">I never suffered any real discrimination, although some of the boys who were in my outfit were religious and they took Fridays off and that sort of thing. </sentence><sentence id="371">And they were discriminated against, not me. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="378">Q: Had you talked in detail with your parents about what was happening -- this is before you were drafted -- about what was happening? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="380">A: Never. </sentence><sentence id="381">This is solely my own doing. </sentence><sentence id="382">The only one I talked to really about it was my girlfriend, who is my wife now. </sentence><sentence id="383">And my parents just wouldn't -- didn't understand. </sentence><sentence id="384">They were European people. </sentence><sentence id="385">My mother, who is my second mother, was just as good to me as my original mother, who I barely remembered. </sentence><sentence id="386">And we had no rapport with each other. </sentence><sentence id="387">I couldn't talk to them. </sentence><sentence id="388">My father was busy in the grocery store. </sentence><sentence id="389">My second mother was there helping him. </sentence><sentence id="390">And I never saw my father, really. </sentence><sentence id="391">He'd go into the store before I got up, come back from the store after I was in bed. </sentence><sentence id="392">As a matter of fact, I remember one time I walked into the house and I looked into their bedroom as I passed. </sentence><sentence id="393">It was a railroad flat. </sentence><sentence id="394">And I looked into the bedroom and there was my father in bed. </sentence><sentence id="395">I had never seen my father in bed. </sentence><sentence id="396">And I looked in. </sentence><sentence id="397">I says, "Hi, Pop. </sentence><sentence id="398">How are you?" </sentence><sentence id="399">He says, "Not so good." </sentence><sentence id="400">I says, "What's the matter?" </sentence><sentence id="401">And I sat down. </sentence><sentence id="402">And it was like almost the first time I ever sat down with him. </sentence><sentence id="403">I says, "What's the matter?" </sentence><sentence id="404">He says, "I hurt my back and I can't move." </sentence><sentence id="405">And then I said to him, "Pop, this is the first time I have ever seen you in bed sick." </sentence><sentence id="406">I says, "I've never seen you that way before." </sentence><sentence id="407">He says, "Herbert," he says, "I can't afford to be sick." </sentence><sentence id="408">What I'm trying to bring out is, that was my upbringing, the work ethic and so on and so forth. </sentence><sentence id="409">But close to my parents, I never was. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="440">Q: Let's jump ahead a little bit. </sentence><sentence id="441">You were drafted and you're now in England. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="444">A: England, a place Conington. </sentence><sentence id="445">We spent about three months there. </sentence><sentence id="446">Very, very pleasant experience. </sentence><sentence id="447">And then we moved down to Southampton, which was a staging area for the invasion of Europe. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="454">A: 628th Light Equipment Engineers. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="456">Q: Of? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="458">A: Well, we were switched from army to army because we were a small outfit, about 100 men. </sentence><sentence id="459">And we worked the shovels and the road graders and the bulldozers, and so on, clearing roads and so on. </sentence><sentence id="460">We were doing that in England as well. </sentence><sentence id="461">And we were moved from the -- we originally went over, I think it was the First Army. </sentence><sentence id="462">And then we were transferred as we went down to the Third Army. </sentence><sentence id="463">And then in Europe, I think we wound up with the Seventh Army. </sentence><sentence id="464">I'm not quite sure of these details. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="472">Q: And now you're in Southampton? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="474">A: Southampton, waiting for the invasion. </sentence><sentence id="475">We were in Southampton I guess it must have been about a month until the invasion. </sentence><sentence id="476">And we went over about D-plus 10, 12, something like that. </sentence><sentence id="477">D-Day plus 10. </sentence><sentence id="478">I wasn't part of the initial invasion. </sentence><sentence id="479">But it was a little harrowing. </sentence><sentence id="480">And we got stuck on a sand bar. </sentence><sentence id="481">And finally they got us off and they were bombing us and so on and so forth. </sentence><sentence id="482">From there, we landed on Utah Beach. </sentence><sentence id="483">I didn't even remember the beach until I sort of looked it up for my company. </sentence><sentence id="484">Utah Beach. </sentence><sentence id="485">And then from there, we sort of went inland through the hedgerows and so on. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="498">Q: At this point, did you know anything about what was happening to the Jews or did you know anything about camps in general? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="500">A: Absolutely not. </sentence><sentence id="501">We were so busy embroiled in what we were doing because we were under fire here and there, bombardments and so on. </sentence><sentence id="502">And I didn't have time to worry about anybody else but myself, actually. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="506">Q: What was it like for you to see dead bodies at that point? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="508">A: Oh, that's when we went into Germany. </sentence><sentence id="509">We had gone into Germany through Aachen. </sentence><sentence id="510">I remember that. </sentence><sentence id="511">And somebody said to us, "Hey, fellows, you better get up to this camp. </sentence><sentence id="512">There are a lot of dead bodies up there." </sentence><sentence id="513">A civilian told us. </sentence><sentence id="514">And we went there. </sentence><sentence id="515">And those are the pictures that I show you of what we actually saw. </sentence><sentence id="516">They never even had a chance to pick up the bodies. </sentence><sentence id="517">The bodies didn't even smell yet because they were so new. </sentence><sentence id="518">The Germans had left voluntarily because they were afraid of who was coming. </sentence><sentence id="519">And they took off. </sentence><sentence id="520">And we got there about an hour after they had shot a lot of the people. </sentence><sentence id="521">And we saw ovens -- I saw them myself -- with bodies piled in front of the ovens. </sentence><sentence id="522">The ovens seemed to be too small for the bodies. </sentence><sentence id="523">But then there was a ravine with a bunch of bodies in that they had spread lime on. </sentence><sentence id="524">And then it began to dawn on me what I was looking at. </sentence><sentence id="525">And then I became a Jew. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="545">Q: We'll talk about Ohrdruf in a moment. </sentence><sentence id="546">Let's go back a little bit to France. </sentence><sentence id="547">Anything else -- any other combat experiences or any fighting that you went through in France? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="551">A: Well, we were bombarded. </sentence><sentence id="552">And during the Bulge, the Germans were really shooting. </sentence><sentence id="553">We weren't an infantry outfit; we were an engineer outfit. </sentence><sentence id="554">And we had to move back into France until the invasion was over, the German invasion was over. </sentence><sentence id="555">And then as they cleared it up, we began to move in. </sentence><sentence id="556">And when we first got into Germany, it was -- really, there were snipers firing at us and so on and so forth. </sentence><sentence id="557">But I was never in any real hand- to-hand or person-to-person combat per se. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="565">Q: Did you see any dead bodies at that point? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="567">A: Oh, all along. </sentence><sentence id="568">In France we always saw dead bodies. </sentence><sentence id="569">I'm talking about dead bodies of Germans. </sentence><sentence id="570">And all the way through, we had seen dead bodies. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="575">Q: How did you feel about seeing a dead body? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="577">A: At first, I was appalled. </sentence><sentence id="578">And after that, strangely enough, you get used to seeing bodies. </sentence><sentence id="579">You don't pay any attention to them. </sentence><sentence id="580">And if there's an odor, you walk over to the other side, but you leave the bodies there. </sentence><sentence id="581">We were just -- it's a matter of survival, really, being in the service under those conditions. </sentence><sentence id="582">And you're worried about yourself. </sentence><sentence id="583">That is, until I got to the concentration camp. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="591">Q: Was your unit made up of other Jews? </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="615">Q: Did you ever talk among yourselves about what was happening to Jews? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="617">A: No. </sentence><sentence id="618">And that surprises me. </sentence><sentence id="619">I'm so dedicated now to that sort of thing. </sentence><sentence id="620">I wasn't before. </sentence><sentence id="621">I really wasn't. </sentence><sentence id="622">And it's been since the site of the holocaust, since being in the concentration camp, that I really became Jewish. </sentence><sentence id="623">As a matter of fact, my son didn't want to be bar mitzvahed, but I made him become bar mitzvahed and so on. </sentence><sentence id="624">These two girls that I brought with me are fairly religious. </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="625">Q: Allright. </sentence><sentence id="626">Now you've crossed over the border into Germany. </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="627">A: Well, I think the first town I remember was Aachen. </sentence><sentence id="628">And then we moved past Aachen and we were told about the concentration camp which I just told you about. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="637">A: Yeah. </sentence><sentence id="638">See, I can understand German a little bit because I spoke a little Yiddish. </sentence><sentence id="639">And I was amazed to find out that I could talk German. </sentence><sentence id="640">As a matter of fact, I became the interpreter between the Germans and my outfit because the boy, "Hey, Bitter, he talks German." </sentence><sentence id="641">I was really talking Yiddish. </sentence><sentence id="642">That's where we found out, and that's where we went to the concentration camp. </sentence><sentence id="643">There were a few of us. </sentence><sentence id="644">I don't remember who they were. </sentence><sentence id="645">I know that my two buddies were among them but I don't remember who else. </sentence><sentence id="646">And then we saw the bodies -- </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="647">Q: Wait. </sentence><sentence id="648">Let's back up a little bit. </sentence><sentence id="649">All right. </sentence><sentence id="650">This German townsperson tells you that there is acamp. </sentence><sentence id="651">And so what was the next thing that you did? </sentence><sentence id="652">Did you report this to your superior? </sentence><sentence id="653">What happened? </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="654">A: No, no. </sentence><sentence id="655">We just -- a bunch of us went to where we -- he said there was a lot of dead bodies there. </sentence><sentence id="656">We didn't know whether they were Germans or Jewish or Americans or anything, so we went there. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="680">Q: Why did you want to go there? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="682">A: Only to see what was there. </sentence><sentence id="683">We were told there were bodies. </sentence><sentence id="684">And we had to find out what they were, whether they were Americans, whether they were Germans, whether they were -- we didn't know anything about, really, the concentration camps. </sentence><sentence id="685">We did not expect a concentration camp per se. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="690">Q: What was the name or what were you told that the name of this location was? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="692">A: He just told us where it was. </sentence><sentence id="693">He didn't give us any name or anything like that. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="696">Q: How did he describe the location? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="698">A: He says, "There's a camp with bodies 3 miles away up this road." </sentence><sentence id="699">He says, "Why don't you go up there and look at it." </sentence><sentence id="700">See, the Germans were terribly afraid of us. </sentence><sentence id="701">They didn't want to be tortured. </sentence><sentence id="702">They thought that maybe we would come in and torture them. </sentence><sentence id="703">And of course, we weren't looking to cause any havoc. </sentence><sentence id="704">So we wanted to see what the bodies were that were up in this camp. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="712">Q: What date was this? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="714">A: Idon't remember the date. </sentence><sentence id="715">It was right after we went into Germany, after the -- better still, it was the day before Eisenhower, Bradley, and -- </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="716">Q: Patton? </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="717">A: -- Patton were there. </sentence><sentence id="718">Of course, they came later. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="725">A: I found out later. </sentence><sentence id="726">And that's one of the things that bugged me because we didn't know where we were, just that we were past Aachen and that there was this camp. </sentence><sentence id="727">And the pictures will show you exactly what we saw as we went through the fences. </sentence><sentence id="728">There was no resistance. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="733">Q: Okay. </sentence><sentence id="734">You are three young soldiers in a Jeep? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="737">A: Yes. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="739">Q: And you are driving up this road. </sentence><sentence id="740">What's the first sight that you see? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="743">A: We saw this fence, which was a barbed wire fence. </sentence><sentence id="744">And as we drove in, we saw bodies lying all over the area. </sentence><sentence id="745">And we couldn't believe it. </sentence><sentence id="746">We didn't even know they were Jewish or anything like that. </sentence><sentence id="747">We just saw the bodies. </sentence><sentence id="748">And then we went in. </sentence><sentence id="749">And there were a number of people who were alive. </sentence><sentence id="750">A number of people. </sentence><sentence id="751">And they began to yell in Yiddish to us. </sentence><sentence id="752">And I understood Yiddish. </sentence><sentence id="753">And I began to talk to them and they began to tell us what went on, what camp it was. </sentence><sentence id="754">And this was all new to us. </sentence><sentence id="755">We had never experienced anything like this. </sentence><sentence id="756">And there was one Polish boy in that camp who spoke Yiddish. </sentence><sentence id="757">And surprisingly enough, he had a bicycle. </sentence><sentence id="758">And he held onto that bicycle. </sentence><sentence id="759">And he was the one that showed us around from place to place, showed us where they slept, showed us where the bodies were. </sentence><sentence id="760">And we were just absolutely appalled. </sentence><sentence id="761">That was a real revelation. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="781">Q: You had a camera with you? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="783">A: Yes. </sentence><sentence id="784">L always carried a camera. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="787">Q: And you so you took pictures? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="789">A: Oh, yeah. </sentence><sentence id="790">It was after an hour or two of being there that we took the pictures because this Polish boy wanted food or whatever he wanted. </sentence><sentence id="791">And he took us around to the camp. </sentence><sentence id="792">And we wanted to see what it was. </sentence><sentence id="793">I had my camera with me all the time. </sentence><sentence id="794">And he took us into a -- these long cottages where they slept. </sentence><sentence id="795">Unlike what I've seen in the movies, these were like stalls for cattle, really. </sentence><sentence id="796">And there was a wooden bar in between the stalls. </sentence><sentence id="797">And they were packed with hay. </sentence><sentence id="798">And that's where they slept. </sentence><sentence id="799">They slept one right next to another. </sentence><sentence id="800">You could barely move in the stalls. </sentence><sentence id="801">And we went up and down. </sentence><sentence id="802">And then we saw the bodies in the -- outside the ovens. </sentence><sentence id="803">I didn't see a crematorium there. </sentence><sentence id="804">I didn't know whether they were gassed or -- we didn't think of asking these questions. </sentence><sentence id="805">And then he took us to this pit where there must have been 500 bodies, something like that, covered with lime. </sentence><sentence id="806">And what they were going to do with these bodies is throw them into the pit because they couldn't burn all of them. </sentence><sentence id="807">They were going to throw these bodies into the pit, but they didn't have time. </sentence><sentence id="808">There was no time because the Americans were there. </sentence><sentence id="809">And they didn't know who we were. </sentence><sentence id="810">All the Germans knew was that the Americans are coming, let's get out of here. </sentence><sentence id="811">And there wasn't a German in that camp as we walked in. </sentence><sentence id="812">But we see the Jews firsthand. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="837">Q: What was your feeling when you first heard Yiddish words from these prisoners? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="839">A: I'm just trying to think. </sentence><sentence id="840">It was -- I wasn't really affected yet, but I began to talk to various -- and of course, there was some communication problem because a lot of the Yiddish that they spoke, I didn't speak. </sentence><sentence id="841">For example, one of the Jewish guys we had with us, we used him as a KP. </sentence><sentence id="842">And he said to me one day -- we gave him a room when we came into this town. </sentence><sentence id="843">And he said to me, "Do you do you speak Yiddish? </sentence><sentence id="844">All right. </sentence><sentence id="845">Komm zu mine Zimmer." </sentence><sentence id="846">He said, "Come to my room." </sentence><sentence id="847">He wanted to show me something because we were Jewish, and so on and so forth. </sentence><sentence id="848">And I says, "Okay. </sentence><sentence id="849">I says, "But was is dat Zimmer?" </sentence><sentence id="850">I had never heard of the word "Zimmer." </sentence><sentence id="851">He says "It's Zimmer," and he showed us. </sentence><sentence id="852">And he took me up to the room that he was staying in. </sentence><sentence id="853">And I says, "You mean a room?" </sentence><sentence id="854">And this is the truth because there are certain idiomatic expressions that pick up the language. </sentence><sentence id="855">I never knew that a room was a Zimmer. </sentence><sentence id="856">And so that's the kind of Yiddish. </sentence><sentence id="857">I spoke a fractured Yiddish but enough to understand what was going on. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="877">Q: How did you feel when they spoke Yiddish and you realized that these prisoners were Jewish? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="879">A: It didn't quite hit me immediately or anything like that, but I began to feel it. </sentence><sentence id="880">And it was only when I met these girls that I began to realize what had -- the bodies, of course, you can't misinterpret. </sentence><sentence id="881">But I began to understand what was going on in this place, what was going on in Germany. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="885">Q: What was the condition of the bodies? </sentence><sentence id="886">Had they looked like they had endured starvation? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="889">A: We didn't look that closely. </sentence><sentence id="890">They were dead, and they weren't dead very long. </sentence><sentence id="891">We assumed that they had been shot. </sentence><sentence id="892">They may have been shot just before we came there. </sentence><sentence id="893">But they couldn't get rid of all of them. </sentence><sentence id="894">And that was not a big camp. </sentence><sentence id="895">It was a small camp. </sentence><sentence id="896">But there wasn't enough time to get rid of all of them. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="905">Q: When did you know the name of the camp? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="907">A: I'm not quite sure. </sentence><sentence id="908">I think it may have been while I was there somebody may have mentioned it or something like that. </sentence><sentence id="909">I'm not quite sure where I learned the name. </sentence><sentence id="910">But I never heard the name after I left until I began to ask people and try to research and find out whether there was a camp like that. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="915">Q: And the name of the camp? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="917">A: Ohrdruf. </sentence><sentence id="918">O-D-H-R-U-F, something like that. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="921">Q: So you learned the name of it, you said, when you were there, that it was Ohrdruf? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="923">A: Yeah. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="925">Q: Allright. </sentence><sentence id="926">You have seen these bodies. </sentence><sentence id="927">You walk around. </sentence><sentence id="928">Any other impressions that you can talk about? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="933">A: Well, we were there just a good part of the day. </sentence><sentence id="934">Now, it wasn't our job to remove the bodies or do anything else. </sentence><sentence id="935">We had to contact I think it was the civil government of the U.S. Army. </sentence><sentence id="936">They would come in and take care of the government and so on and so forth. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="941">Q: But you said that there were a lot of other American soldiers already there? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="943">A: From my company. </sentence><sentence id="944">We were the first company to walk in there. </sentence><sentence id="945">There must have been -- in my company, there must have been 25, 40 guys. </sentence><sentence id="946">And of course, the word spread after that that there was this camp. </sentence><sentence id="947">And that's where Eisenhower must have found out about it and so on. </sentence><sentence id="948">But they came the next day. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="955">Q: How do you know that? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="957">A: Isaw them. </sentence><sentence id="958">I was there. </sentence><sentence id="959">In other words, we went back. </sentence><sentence id="960">We didn't stay far from them because we were bivouacking, actually. </sentence><sentence id="961">And we went back. </sentence><sentence id="962">And we didn't know they were coming. </sentence><sentence id="963">And all of a sudden the gates open up and an entourage comes in, maybe 100 or 200 people. </sentence><sentence id="964">I don't know. </sentence><sentence id="965">And of course the bodies had remained there overnight. </sentence><sentence id="966">There was nothing we could do. </sentence><sentence id="967">And they came in and they were looking around and the cameras and all that sort of jazz. </sentence><sentence id="968">And they went through the place. </sentence><sentence id="969">And somebody was explaining to them what had happened and so on. </sentence><sentence id="970">In other words, the hierarchy of the military had come in, and they learned about what happened and they were showing it to the general. </sentence><sentence id="971">And I believe that was the first camp, maybe the only one, that the three generals were there. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="988">Q: So you actually saw General Eisenhower? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="990">A: General Eisenhower, General Bradley. </sentence><sentence id="991">I'm not quite sure about Patton. </sentence><sentence id="992">He was there, but I didn't quite see him. </sentence><sentence id="993">He was sort of walking on his own, more or less. </sentence><sentence id="994">But Eisenhower and Bradley were together. </sentence><sentence id="995">Wherever they went, they were together with a bunch of colonels and military muck-mucks or whatever they call them. </sentence><sentence id="996">And they were explaining to the general what had happened there. </sentence><sentence id="997">They had heard it from one of the boys. </sentence><sentence id="998">So then they repeated to the generals exactly what kind of a camp it was, what it was, and so on. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1008">Q: I'm sure you're aware of the famous quote from General Eisenhower that he wrote to Churchill -- and I'd just like to maybe read it a little bit and see what your reaction is to it -- that he sent in a letter to Churchill after he had been at Ohrdruf. " </sentence><sentence id="1009">The things I saw beggar description. </sentence><sentence id="1010">The visual evidence and the verbal testimony of starvation, cruelty, and beastiology were overpowering. </sentence><sentence id="1011">I made the visit deliberately in order to be ina position to give firsthand evidence of these things, if ever in the future there develops a tendency to charge these allegations merely to propaganda." </sentence><sentence id="1012">When he said he saw evidence of starvation, cruelty, and beastiology -- </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1013">A: Idon't know about beastiology, but I know cruelty, starvation. </sentence><sentence id="1014">That's something I had never mentioned, the fact that they were emaciated people. </sentence><sentence id="1015">These people were skin and bones. </sentence><sentence id="1016">And we tried to help them, but we didn't have food with us. </sentence><sentence id="1017">We had some K- rations and so on. </sentence><sentence id="1018">We did the best we could. </sentence><sentence id="1019">And that's why we decided to come back the next day, to see if we could be of any -- we didn't know that the generals were coming. </sentence><sentence id="1020">And we brought back some food and so on and so forth, but it didn't amount to anything. </sentence><sentence id="1021">And we were just appalled by what we had seen. </sentence><sentence id="1022">And really, I can't honestly say that it sunk in at that particular time. </sentence><sentence id="1023">The bodies, had they not been Jewish I would have felt the same way more or less at that time. </sentence><sentence id="1024">And we went through. </sentence><sentence id="1025">We were interested in seeing. </sentence><sentence id="1026">We couldn't believe that something like this existed, that people could be so cruel as to shoot them, starve them, hang them, which is in those pictures. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="1041">We just couldn't believe it. </sentence><sentence id="1042">And if anybody tells you he realized what it was -- maybe Eisenhower did, but we didn't until it began to sink in. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1045">Q: What did you say and what did the Jewish prisoners say to you? </sentence><sentence id="1046">What kind of thoughts? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1049">A: They were all anxious to tell me their stories. </sentence><sentence id="1050">Strangely enough, Jewish people love to relate their problems and what had happened to them. </sentence><sentence id="1051">And those that could -- a lot of them were too weak to even talk. </sentence><sentence id="1052">You know, they told us about where they came from, what had happened to them, and so on. </sentence><sentence id="1053">But there were so many stories that one story ran into another. </sentence><sentence id="1054">There were so many terrible stories. </sentence><sentence id="1055">And they're all most willing to talk And as a matter of fact, what I really found out more than anything else were the girls. </sentence><sentence id="1056">I don't want to get too far ahead. </sentence><sentence id="1057">I really found out what really happened. </sentence><sentence id="1058">They were explicit and they were able to explain. </sentence><sentence id="1059">But as far as I was concerned, we heard so many stories at the same time, all terrible stories. </sentence><sentence id="1060">And it's like somebody pricking your finger here, here, here, here, and you couldn't know where it hurts only because there are so many different spots that it hurts. </sentence><sentence id="1061">And we had heard so many terrible stories that there were too many to affect us, so to speak. </sentence><sentence id="1062">I don't know if you can understand that. </sentence><sentence id="1063">But after a while, we began to understand what was going on. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1079">Q: Did your other -- the other soldiers that you were with speak Yiddish, the two others? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1081">A: No. </sentence><sentence id="1082">I was the only one that spoke Yiddish, so to speak. </sentence><sentence id="1083">And therefore, I was able to relate to some of these people better than some of the others. </sentence><sentence id="1084">Of course, a lot of them just didn't understand. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1089">Q: Did you touch any of them? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1091">A: Oh, sure. </sentence><sentence id="1092">I held their hand. </sentence><sentence id="1093">I spoke to them. </sentence><sentence id="1094">I sat with them. </sentence><sentence id="1095">We were there for hours. </sentence><sentence id="1096">And then strangely enough, here are people who are dying, who -- we picked ourselves up and we left. </sentence><sentence id="1097">It's a terrible thing not to realize the degradation that went on and the cruelty that went on. </sentence><sentence id="1098">After all, we were in a war. </sentence><sentence id="1099">And yet we were able to pick ourselves up and leave. </sentence><sentence id="1100">I don't know if I could do that today, leave back to the bivouac area knowing that we were going to come back the next day with whatever we could. </sentence><sentence id="1101">And it wasn't very much. </sentence><sentence id="1102">But then the military government moved in right after we left, and I guess they took care of them. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1115">Q: How did you know that you were the first Americans to come in? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1117">A: There was nobody else there. </sentence><sentence id="1118">I'm sorry. </sentence><sentence id="1119">There was absolutely nobody else there. </sentence><sentence id="1120">We walked in through the gates, opened up the gates. </sentence><sentence id="1121">They weren't locked. </sentence><sentence id="1122">Rather, the gates -- the barbed wire gates. </sentence><sentence id="1123">We opened them and walked right in. </sentence><sentence id="1124">We could see the scenes of the dead from outside the gates. </sentence><sentence id="1125">And we just went in. </sentence><sentence id="1126">And there was absolutely nobody there. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1137">Q: Were you frightened when you first saw the piles of dead bodies? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1139">A: No. </sentence><sentence id="1140">We had seen dead bodies all along. </sentence><sentence id="1141">And we came in and we were just curious to know what it was that we were looking at. </sentence><sentence id="1142">We really didn't know what we were seeing, at the beginning. </sentence><sentence id="1143">And then we realized. </sentence><sentence id="1144">I may be contradicting myself but the thoughts are coming so quick and so fast. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1151">Q: This is Tape 1, Side B, of the interview of Herbert Bitter. </sentence><sentence id="1152">Before we continue, I'd like to clarify some facts that we talked about on the previous side. </sentence><sentence id="1153">You had said that you had come over the border into Germany into the town of Aachen. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1157">A: That's correct. </sentence><sentence id="1158">And then from Aachen, I just don't remember where we went because I was completely unfamiliar with Germany. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1161">Q: And then you eventually got to the vicinity of the Ohrdruf camp, and you said you were staying in a village and that a man told you there's a camp 3 miles down the road. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="1163">Do you remember the name of the village? </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1164">A: It might have been Erfurt or Aachen. </sentence><sentence id="1165">I'm not quite sure. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1168">Q: Not Aachen. </sentence><sentence id="1169">You mean -- </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1170">A: Excuse me. </sentence><sentence id="1171">Erfurt or Ohrdruf. </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1172">Q: Ohrdruf. </sentence><sentence id="1173">And then the other point we should clarify are the dates when you got to Ohrdruf camp and when you saw Eisenhower. </sentence><sentence id="1174">Because it is understood that Eisenhower was there on April 12th, which was the date that President Roosevelt died. </sentence><sentence id="1175">Do you have anything to say about that, about when you were there? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1180">A: Icertainly do. </sentence><sentence id="1181">I believe if 1 got there on April 4th, which I think I got there, the following day, Eisenhower and Bradley came to that camp. </sentence><sentence id="1182">That was the very next day because the bodies were still there as we saw them the day before. </sentence><sentence id="1183">And they came and they looked over, and they had a small contingent of people with them. </sentence><sentence id="1184">I don't remember who they were. </sentence><sentence id="1185">And then they left. </sentence><sentence id="1186">Now, the next thing I know is that I saw pictures of the fact that Eisenhower was there. </sentence><sentence id="1187">There seemed to be a lot of people there. </sentence><sentence id="1188">And the day that Roosevelt died, he was supposed to have been there or Bradley and Patton were supposed to have been there. </sentence><sentence id="1189">Now, on the day that Roosevelt died, I was in Dresden. </sentence><sentence id="1190">Now, I had seen the concentration camp on April 4th, I believe honestly, so that Eisenhower and Bradley were there the day after I was there. </sentence><sentence id="1191">And then they may have come back with photographers and with whoever. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1204">Q: Okay. </sentence><sentence id="1205">Before we leave Ohrdruf, I just wanted to ask you again some of your impressions and other sites that you saw. </sentence><sentence id="1206">Did you have a sense of the layout of the camp? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1210">A: More or less. </sentence><sentence id="1211">As we came in, we saw the bodies. </sentence><sentence id="1212">To the right of the gate -- I'm trying to recall because these are things you really don't forget -- were the barracks where the sleeping areas were laid out like in stalls, like cattle, only they were low 2-by-4s that separated each bunk. </sentence><sentence id="1213">And that's all they had. </sentence><sentence id="1214">And they were filled with straw. </sentence><sentence id="1215">And then we went from there. </sentence><sentence id="1216">We saw an oven, and there were a bunch of bodies piled up outside the oven. </sentence><sentence id="1217">However, the ovens seemed to be too small to handle the bodies. </sentence><sentence id="1218">And as we went further, we saw this long pit where there must have been hundreds of bodies covered with lime. </sentence><sentence id="1219">And evidently they were preparing to lay the bodies into the pit so they could bury them and bodies above that and so on. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1231">Q: You are 25 years old, a young man, and obviously not prepared for this. </sentence><sentence id="1232">How did you handle this or do you remember what thoughts were going through your mind when you saw piles of bodies and ovens and lime pits and so forth? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1235">A: Well, it didn't quite hit me at that time, only because going through France and the invasion and everything, I had seen a lot of bodies. </sentence><sentence id="1236">This was a terrible, terrible thing. </sentence><sentence id="1237">And then of course we realized that they were Jews. </sentence><sentence id="1238">We felt a little bad. </sentence><sentence id="1239">But you must understand that it doesn't hit you suddenly. </sentence><sentence id="1240">You're looking and you say "That's a terrible thing." </sentence><sentence id="1241">And then you go on and so on. </sentence><sentence id="1242">It's only after visiting there, after being away from there that I began to realize. </sentence><sentence id="1243">And it was only after I spoke to some girls who told me what they had gone through that I began to realize that this is true. </sentence><sentence id="1244">This is a holocaust. </sentence><sentence id="1245">And it gradually over a period of time began to sink in. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1257">Q: Did you have any trouble sleeping that night after you saw these sites? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1259">A: No. </sentence><sentence id="1260">Peculiar thing to say, I had no trouble at all. </sentence><sentence id="1261">Because remember when you're in the service you're worrying about your own being, and nothing is important as taking care of yourself. </sentence><sentence id="1262">And I felt badly. </sentence><sentence id="1263">I can't say that it just passed over me. </sentence><sentence id="1264">We started to talk about it, some of the boys and us, and then we began to realize how terrible a thing it was. </sentence><sentence id="1265">That's why when I see people who are not Jewish or people who don't care, they can't believe it. </sentence><sentence id="1266">And I can understand why they can't believe it because it's too much to believe. </sentence><sentence id="1267">It's too much to take in at once. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1277">Q: Did you feel any kind of kinship with the Jewish prisoners? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1279">A: Always. </sentence><sentence id="1280">Because I met Jews throughout Europe, I met refugees, I met a lot of Jews, and I spoke to some of them. </sentence><sentence id="1281">As a matter of fact, we had one Jewish refugee that we took with us, and he served as a KP, a kitchen police. </sentence><sentence id="1282">He served as a KP for us. </sentence><sentence id="1283">And I befriended him and we talked quite a bit, but we never really talked about details. </sentence><sentence id="1284">He may not have known about all of these things. </sentence><sentence id="1285">He was just a refugee. </sentence><sentence id="1286">And we talked quite a bit because I spoke -- I was one of the only people in my outfit that spoke Yiddish, and that's why I was able to communicate. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1295">Q: How old was he and where did you find him? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1297">A: He must have been about 35 years old. </sentence><sentence id="1298">We found him walking along the road. </sentence><sentence id="1299">And he asked if he could be part of our outfit. </sentence><sentence id="1300">He wanted to get to Israel. </sentence><sentence id="1301">And we said, "Well, we're not going to Israel. </sentence><sentence id="1302">We're going in the opposite direction." </sentence><sentence id="1303">He says, "Can I go with you?" </sentence><sentence id="1304">He says, "I have to eat." </sentence><sentence id="1305">So we gave him an American uniform. </sentence><sentence id="1306">We set him up. </sentence><sentence id="1307">Nobody knew who he was. </sentence><sentence id="1308">And I communicated with him on a regular basis only because of the Yiddish. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1322">Q: And whereabouts did you find him? </sentence><sentence id="1323">What country? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1326">A: I'm not quite sure. </sentence><sentence id="1327">It may have been in France, but I'm not quite sure. </sentence><sentence id="1328">It's just that he was with us for quite a length of time. </sentence><sentence id="1329">And actually, when we came back to Marseilles to go over to the Philippines for the invasion, we had to get rid of him because we couldn't go aboard ship with him. </sentence><sentence id="1330">So we had some of the boys put him in a truck, took him down to the shipyards in Marseilles. </sentence><sentence id="1331">They put him on a ship that was going to eventually wind up in Israel. </sentence><sentence id="1332">And I never heard from him after that. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1340">Q: Do you remember his name? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1342">A: Meischer (phonetic). </sentence><sentence id="1343">That's as much as I remember. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1346">Q: Had you heard of a place called Buchenwald when you were in Ohrdruf? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1348">A: No. </sentence><sentence id="1349">Asa matter of fact, I didn't know it was a satellite until I went to Yad Vashem, and they told me it was a satellite of Ohrdruf. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1352">Q: Of Buchenwald? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1354">A: Of Buchenwald. </sentence><sentence id="1355">Excuse me. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1358">Q: How many days were you at -- in the Ohrdruf area? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1360">A: Several days. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1362">Q: And how many times did you go back to the camp? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1364">A: We went back the next day and possibly once more. </sentence><sentence id="1365">And then we had to move on. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1368">Q: Did you say that you had brought food back? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1370">A: Yes. </sentence><sentence id="1371">We brought whatever we could bring back, but it certainly wasn't enough. </sentence><sentence id="1372">It was a drop in the bucket. </sentence><sentence id="1373">And we knew that the civil police were coming behind us because they had been notified and they had been told about what we had found. </sentence><sentence id="1374">I didn't do the notifying myself, but somebody did. </sentence><sentence id="1375">And I guess they eventually came. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1382">Q: So just to clarify, you're saying that you were one of the first to come into the camp because there were no other soldiers around? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1384">A: I think we were the first because there was nobody in that camp when we went in. </sentence><sentence id="1385">We opened the gates -- the barbed wire gates and we walked in. </sentence><sentence id="1386">And this is what we saw. </sentence><sentence id="1387">Those pictures that I showed you are what we saw. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1392">Q: Were there any dead SS? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1394">A: No. </sentence><sentence id="1395">Only civilians. </sentence><sentence id="1396">Only people who were either shot or died in some way, and then the few that were just wandering around the camp with no place to go and nothing to do. </sentence><sentence id="1397">They were sort of lost. </sentence><sentence id="1398">They were in a fog. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1404">Q: Did you feel any differently after this experience at Ohrdruf than before? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1406">A: I felt a kinship and a compassion. </sentence><sentence id="1407">But as I said, it didn't hit me until I had left the camps and I had spoken to some -- the Jewish girls that I had met along the way. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1410">Q: Well, let's move on. </sentence><sentence id="1411">So you then were ordered to leave that general area? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1414">A: Yes. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1416">Q: And where did you then move? </sentence><sentence id="1417">Did you go eastward? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1420">A: Well, we went toward Cologne because I remember being in Cologne. </sentence><sentence id="1421">And the war was beginning to wind down. </sentence><sentence id="1422">And on the way -- and I'm not quite sure where this factory was -- we came across a factory. </sentence><sentence id="1423">And really, I didn't come across the factory. </sentence><sentence id="1424">One of the officers came to the headquarters and said, "Hey, Bitter, are you Jewish?" </sentence><sentence id="1425">I said, "Yeah." </sentence><sentence id="1426">He says, "Boy, you're going to have a good time." </sentence><sentence id="1427">I says, "What do you mean?" </sentence><sentence id="1428">He says, "I found a factory full of Jewish broads," and that's exactly the way he put it. </sentence><sentence id="1429">And he says, "They can't talk to anybody." </sentence><sentence id="1430">He said, "I can't talk to them." </sentence><sentence id="1431">He says, "Let me drive you there and I'll pick you up." </sentence><sentence id="1432">I say, "Can I be there that long?" </sentence><sentence id="1433">He says, "I'll pick you up. </sentence><sentence id="1434">I'll come and I'll wait for you." </sentence><sentence id="1435">He says, "But Have a good time." </sentence><sentence id="1436">He was being very facetious. </sentence><sentence id="1437">And we went there and the picture that I brought with me, the picture of the four girls standing outside this factory. </sentence><sentence id="1438">And I went up to the, girls knowing that they were Jewish. </sentence><sentence id="1439">I said [Yiddish/German expression] which means, "What are you doing, girls?" </sentence><sentence id="1440">And they were so excited at the fact that there was a Jewish soldier there. </sentence><sentence id="1441">They had never seen an American-Jewish soldier. </sentence><sentence id="1442">They had not seen anybody. </sentence><sentence id="1443">They knew they were liberated because the Germans had left. </sentence><sentence id="1444">And they grabbed me, literally grabbed me, pulled me into the building, and took me to the second floor. </sentence><sentence id="1445">And I heard screaming and yelling of the girls. </sentence><sentence id="1446">And they put me up on a -- almost like a stage. </sentence><sentence id="1447">And there were girls coming from all over the building. </sentence><sentence id="1448">I swear to you, there must have been 100 to 200 girls, all disciplined. </sentence><sentence id="1449">All sat down. </sentence><sentence id="1450">There was one girl who took charge, and she explained to them who I was. </sentence><sentence id="1451">And we spoke in sort of Yiddish. </sentence><sentence id="1452">And then she said, "I want you to" -- in Yiddish she said, "I want you to hear the stories of some of these girls. </sentence><sentence id="1453">I want you to know what we went through." </sentence><sentence id="1454">And I says, "All right." </sentence><sentence id="1455">And I sat there for the next two or three hours just listening. </sentence><sentence id="1456">And each girl, she said, "Yanni (phonetic), get up and tell your story. </sentence><sentence id="1457">Myrtle, get up and tell your story." </sentence><sentence id="1458">And one by one, there must have been 20 girls, that had -- and they told how they had been raped and taken advantage of and all of that. </sentence><sentence id="1459">And I began to feel. </sentence><sentence id="1460">I wanted to kill somebody after listening to these girls. </sentence><sentence id="1461">And finally they finished. </sentence><sentence id="1462">They said, "Do you want to hear more?" </sentence><sentence id="1463">I says, "No. </sentence><sentence id="1464">That's enough." </sentence><sentence id="1465">And of course, I had to get back. </sentence><sentence id="1466">And the officer was waiting for me. </sentence><sentence id="1467">So I says, "Maidloch (phonetic), I'll be back tomorrow." </sentence><sentence id="1468">I says, "What can I bring you," I says, "in the way of food?" </sentence><sentence id="1469">She says, "Food, we're all right on." </sentence><sentence id="1470">She says, "But can you bring us a few sidurim," prayer books. </sentence><sentence id="1471">And I says, "Well, we don't have many, but I'll pick up every one I can find." </sentence><sentence id="1472">And I went back and I got about three or four from the boys in the camp. </sentence><sentence id="1473">And I went back the next day with some food, whatever it was, and the girls just couldn't get over me. </sentence><sentence id="1474">I was a hero. </sentence><sentence id="1475">I was the first liberator that they saw. </sentence><sentence id="1476">And I spent a good part of the day with them. </sentence><sentence id="1477">I took my own Jeep. </sentence><sentence id="1478">And we spent some time, and then I left. </sentence><sentence id="1479">And of course, I took a picture with the girls or all the girls. </sentence><sentence id="1480">Here is the Jewish girls liberated from the German factory, slave labor. </sentence><sentence id="1481">And it was interesting. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1545">Q: Now, can you tell me again where this factory was? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1547">A: It was after Aachen. </sentence><sentence id="1548">And I cannot remember the distance. </sentence><sentence id="1549">I can't remember the factory or what they did in the factory, as a matter of fact. </sentence><sentence id="1550">But the whole building was full of girls. </sentence><sentence id="1551">Only girls. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1557">Q: How much later after Ohrdruf did you come across this factory? </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1563">A: We were heading eastward. </sentence><sentence id="1564">We were heading eastward toward -- we wound up in a place called Weida, Germany, which was in the Russian section. </sentence><sentence id="1565">And we spent quite a bit of time there. </sentence><sentence id="1566">And then of course we doubled back to go to Marseilles. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1571">Q: And you don't know what kind of factory it was? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1573">A: No, have no idea what they made. </sentence><sentence id="1574">They were so busy telling me about their experiences, not what they were, not -- but they wanted people to know how they suffered. </sentence><sentence id="1575">And believe me, they let me know how they suffered. </sentence><sentence id="1576">And it was then that the whole thing was coming together, that I began to realize what was going on in there. </sentence><sentence id="1577">It's not one incident that sets you apart. </sentence><sentence id="1578">It's all of these incidents together. </sentence><sentence id="1579">And you begin to realize there's a pattern there. </sentence><sentence id="1580">And that's what I began to realize. </sentence><sentence id="1581">As a matter of fact, I myself -- I don't know if I told you, I was sitting in a Jeep in France. </sentence><sentence id="1582">And they had liberated some camps. </sentence><sentence id="1583">I think it was in Poland or somewhere else. </sentence><sentence id="1584">I don't know. </sentence><sentence id="1585">And I read the article in Stars and Stripes. </sentence><sentence id="1586">And I read about how these people suffered. </sentence><sentence id="1587">And I closed the Stars and Stripes, put them away, and I went about my business like it didn't affect me in any way. </sentence><sentence id="1588">It does affect me now. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1605">Q: How long did you stay in that area of the labor factory? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1607">A: Two days. </sentence><sentence id="1608">I was there the first day. </sentence><sentence id="1609">I had to go and get on with the outfit. </sentence><sentence id="1610">So I was there the first day. </sentence><sentence id="1611">And then the second day I came back by myself with the sidurim. </sentence><sentence id="1612">And I spent a good part of the day. </sentence><sentence id="1613">I had my own Jeep. </sentence><sentence id="1614">And then I went back to my outfit. </sentence><sentence id="1615">And that was it. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1625">Q: Did you talk about this with the -- Was there a chaplain that you could talk things over with? </sentence><sentence id="1626">And if so, did you? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1629">A: No, because we had to move on. </sentence><sentence id="1630">There was nobody I could really talk to because we were an individual outfit. </sentence><sentence id="1631">We were -- we had to be attached to various armies to do the work for them and so on and so forth. </sentence><sentence id="1632">So there was nobody I could talk to. </sentence><sentence id="1633">And I knew that behind us was a civil and military governments who were cleaning up and taking care of whatever we saw. </sentence><sentence id="1634">And of course, the Germans didn't know any of this was going on. </sentence><sentence id="1635">None of it. </sentence><sentence id="1636">And they were very, very happy to see the Americans because they didn't want to see the Russians. </sentence><sentence id="1637">So they were very, very happy to see us and welcome us. </sentence><sentence id="1638">And they had white flags outside of all the buildings. </sentence><sentence id="1639">And it was a very, very nice thing. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1651">Q: Why do you say that your experience at the women's slave labor factory made an </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1652">A: Because they were individual stories. " </sentence><sentence id="1653">It happened to me," they say. " </sentence><sentence id="1654">This is what happened to me." </sentence><sentence id="1655">And then another one said, "This is what happened to me." </sentence><sentence id="1656">And when you hear so many individual stories, not a group of people talking with one story, there are a group of people talking with many, many stories, that has to affect you even if you're not Jewish. </sentence><sentence id="1657">And it affected me. </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1658">Q: Were these women wearing yellow stars? </sentence></p></dialogue>
