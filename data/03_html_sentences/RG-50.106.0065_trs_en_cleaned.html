<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="884">A: I'm just trying to think. </sentence><sentence id="885">It was -- I wasn't really affected yet, but I began to talk to various -- and of course, there was some communication problem because a lot of the Yiddish that they spoke, I didn't speak. </sentence><sentence id="886">For example, one of the Jewish guys we had with us, we used him as a KP. </sentence><sentence id="887">And he said to me one day -- we gave him a room when we came into this town. </sentence><sentence id="888">And he said to me, "Do you do you speak Yiddish? </sentence><sentence id="889">All right. </sentence><sentence id="890">Komm zu mine Zimmer." </sentence><sentence id="891">He said, "Come to my room." </sentence><sentence id="892">He wanted to show me something because we were Jewish, and so on and so forth. </sentence><sentence id="893">And I says, "Okay. </sentence><sentence id="894">I says, "But was is dat Zimmer?" </sentence><sentence id="895">I had never heard of the word "Zimmer." </sentence><sentence id="896">He says "It's Zimmer," and he showed us. </sentence><sentence id="897">And he took me up to the room that he was staying in. </sentence><sentence id="898">And I says, "You mean a room?" </sentence><sentence id="899">And this is the truth because there are certain idiomatic expressions that pick up the language. </sentence><sentence id="900">I never knew that a room was a Zimmer. </sentence><sentence id="901">And so that's the kind of Yiddish. </sentence><sentence id="902">I spoke a fractured Yiddish but enough to understand what was going on. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1213">Q: This is Tape 1, Side B, of the interview of Herbert Bitter. </sentence><sentence id="1214">Before we continue, I'd like to clarify some facts that we talked about on the previous side. </sentence><sentence id="1215">You had said that you had come over the border into Germany into the town of Aachen. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1219">A: That's correct. </sentence><sentence id="1220">And then from Aachen, I just don't remember where we went because I was completely unfamiliar with Germany. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1223">Q: And then you eventually got to the vicinity of the Ohrdruf camp, and you said you were staying in a village and that a man told you there's a camp 3 miles down the road. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="1225">Do you remember the name of the village? </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1226">A: It might have been Erfurt or Aachen. </sentence><sentence id="1227">I'm not quite sure. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1230">Q: Not Aachen. </sentence><sentence id="1231">You mean -- </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1232">A: Excuse me. </sentence><sentence id="1233">Erfurt or Ohrdruf. </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1234">Q: Ohrdruf. </sentence><sentence id="1235">And then the other point we should clarify are the dates when you got to Ohrdruf camp and when you saw Eisenhower. </sentence><sentence id="1236">Because it is understood that Eisenhower was there on April 12th, which was the date that President Roosevelt died. </sentence><sentence id="1237">Do you have anything to say about that, about when you were there? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1242">A: Icertainly do. </sentence><sentence id="1243">I believe if 1 got there on April 4th, which I think I got there, the following day, Eisenhower and Bradley came to that camp. </sentence><sentence id="1244">That was the very next day because the bodies were still there as we saw them the day before. </sentence><sentence id="1245">And they came and they looked over, and they had a small contingent of people with them. </sentence><sentence id="1246">I don't remember who they were. </sentence><sentence id="1247">And then they left. </sentence><sentence id="1248">Now, the next thing I know is that I saw pictures of the fact that Eisenhower was there. </sentence><sentence id="1249">There seemed to be a lot of people there. </sentence><sentence id="1250">And the day that Roosevelt died, he was supposed to have been there or Bradley and Patton were supposed to have been there. </sentence><sentence id="1251">Now, on the day that Roosevelt died, I was in Dresden. </sentence><sentence id="1252">Now, I had seen the concentration camp on April 4th, I believe honestly, so that Eisenhower and Bradley were there the day after I was there. </sentence><sentence id="1253">And then they may have come back with photographers and with whoever. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1266">Q: Okay. </sentence><sentence id="1267">Before we leave Ohrdruf, I just wanted to ask you again some of your impressions and other sites that you saw. </sentence><sentence id="1268">Did you have a sense of the layout of the camp? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1272">A: More or less. </sentence><sentence id="1273">As we came in, we saw the bodies. </sentence><sentence id="1274">To the right of the gate -- I'm trying to recall because these are things you really don't forget -- were the barracks where the sleeping areas were laid out like in stalls, like cattle, only they were low 2-by-4s that This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="1275">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="1276"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection separated each bunk. </sentence><sentence id="1277">And that's all they had. </sentence><sentence id="1278">And they were filled with straw. </sentence><sentence id="1279">And then we went from there. </sentence><sentence id="1280">We saw an oven, and there were a bunch of bodies piled up outside the oven. </sentence><sentence id="1281">However, the ovens seemed to be too small to handle the bodies. </sentence><sentence id="1282">And as we went further, we saw this long pit where there must have been hundreds of bodies covered with lime. </sentence><sentence id="1283">And evidently they were preparing to lay the bodies into the pit so they could bury them and bodies above that and so on. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1298">Q: You are 25 years old, a young man, and obviously not prepared for this. </sentence><sentence id="1299">How did you handle this or do you remember what thoughts were going through your mind when you saw piles of bodies and ovens and lime pits and so forth? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1302">A: Well, it didn't quite hit me at that time, only because going through France and the invasion and everything, I had seen a lot of bodies. </sentence><sentence id="1303">This was a terrible, terrible thing. </sentence><sentence id="1304">And then of course we realized that they were Jews. </sentence><sentence id="1305">We felt a little bad. </sentence><sentence id="1306">But you must understand that it doesn't hit you suddenly. </sentence><sentence id="1307">You're looking and you say "That's a terrible thing." </sentence><sentence id="1308">And then you go on and so on. </sentence><sentence id="1309">It's only after visiting there, after being away from there that I began to realize. </sentence><sentence id="1310">And it was only after I spoke to some girls who told me what they had gone through that I began to realize that this is true. </sentence><sentence id="1311">This is a holocaust. </sentence><sentence id="1312">And it gradually over a period of time began to sink in. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1324">Q: Did you have any trouble sleeping that night after you saw these sites? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1326">A: No. </sentence><sentence id="1327">Peculiar thing to say, I had no trouble at all. </sentence><sentence id="1328">Because remember when you're in the service you're worrying about your own being, and nothing is important as taking care of yourself. </sentence><sentence id="1329">And I felt badly. </sentence><sentence id="1330">I can't say that it just passed over me. </sentence><sentence id="1331">We started to talk about it, some of the boys and us, and then we began to realize how terrible a thing it was. </sentence><sentence id="1332">That's why when I see people who are not Jewish or people who don't care, they can't believe it. </sentence><sentence id="1333">And I can understand why they can't believe it because it's too much to believe. </sentence><sentence id="1334">It's too much to take in at once. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1344">Q: Did you feel any kind of kinship with the Jewish prisoners? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1346">A: Always. </sentence><sentence id="1347">Because I met Jews throughout Europe, I met refugees, I met a lot of Jews, and I spoke to some of them. </sentence><sentence id="1348">As a matter of fact, we had one Jewish refugee that we took with us, and he served as a KP, a kitchen police. </sentence><sentence id="1349">He served as a KP for us. </sentence><sentence id="1350">And I befriended him and we talked quite a bit, but we never really talked about details. </sentence><sentence id="1351">He may not have known about all of these things. </sentence><sentence id="1352">He was just a refugee. </sentence><sentence id="1353">And we talked quite a bit because I spoke -- I was one of the only people in my outfit that spoke Yiddish, and that's why I was able to communicate. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1362">Q: How old was he and where did you find him? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1364">A: He must have been about 35 years old. </sentence><sentence id="1365">We found him walking along the road. </sentence><sentence id="1366">And he asked if he could be part of our outfit. </sentence><sentence id="1367">He wanted to get to Israel. </sentence><sentence id="1368">And we said, "Well, This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="1369">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="1370"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection we're not going to Israel. </sentence><sentence id="1371">We're going in the opposite direction." </sentence><sentence id="1372">He says, "Can I go with you?" </sentence><sentence id="1373">He says, "I have to eat." </sentence><sentence id="1374">So we gave him an American uniform. </sentence><sentence id="1375">We set him up. </sentence><sentence id="1376">Nobody knew who he was. </sentence><sentence id="1377">And I communicated with him on a regular basis only because of the Yiddish. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1394">Q: And whereabouts did you find him? </sentence><sentence id="1395">What country? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1398">A: I'm not quite sure. </sentence><sentence id="1399">It may have been in France, but I'm not quite sure. </sentence><sentence id="1400">It's just that he was with us for quite a length of time. </sentence><sentence id="1401">And actually, when we came back to Marseilles to go over to the Philippines for the invasion, we had to get rid of him because we couldn't go aboard ship with him. </sentence><sentence id="1402">So we had some of the boys put him in a truck, took him down to the shipyards in Marseilles. </sentence><sentence id="1403">They put him on a ship that was going to eventually wind up in Israel. </sentence><sentence id="1404">And I never heard from him after that. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1412">Q: Do you remember his name? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1414">A: Meischer (phonetic). </sentence><sentence id="1415">That's as much as I remember. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1418">Q: Had you heard of a place called Buchenwald when you were in Ohrdruf? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1420">A: No. </sentence><sentence id="1421">Asa matter of fact, I didn't know it was a satellite until I went to Yad Vashem, and they told me it was a satellite of Ohrdruf. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1424">Q: Of Buchenwald? </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1434">Q: And how many times did you go back to the camp? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1436">A: We went back the next day and possibly once more. </sentence><sentence id="1437">And then we had to move on. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1440">Q: Did you say that you had brought food back? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1442">A: Yes. </sentence><sentence id="1443">We brought whatever we could bring back, but it certainly wasn't enough. </sentence><sentence id="1444">It was a drop in the bucket. </sentence><sentence id="1445">And we knew that the civil police were coming behind us because they had been notified and they had been told about what we had found. </sentence><sentence id="1446">I didn't do the notifying myself, but somebody did. </sentence><sentence id="1447">And I guess they eventually came. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1454">Q: So just to clarify, you're saying that you were one of the first to come into the camp because there were no other soldiers around? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1456">A: I think we were the first because there was nobody in that camp when we went in. </sentence><sentence id="1457">We opened the gates -- the barbed wire gates and we walked in. </sentence><sentence id="1458">And this is what we saw. </sentence><sentence id="1459">Those pictures that I showed you are what we saw. </sentence><sentence id="1460">This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="1461">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="1462"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1482">Q: Did you feel any differently after this experience at Ohrdruf than before? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1484">A: I felt a kinship and a compassion. </sentence><sentence id="1485">But as I said, it didn't hit me until I had left the camps and I had spoken to some -- the Jewish girls that I had met along the way. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1488">Q: Well, let's move on. </sentence><sentence id="1489">So you then were ordered to leave that general area? </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1498">A: Well, we went toward Cologne because I remember being in Cologne. </sentence><sentence id="1499">And the war was beginning to wind down. </sentence><sentence id="1500">And on the way -- and I'm not quite sure where this factory was -- we came across a factory. </sentence><sentence id="1501">And really, I didn't come across the factory. </sentence><sentence id="1502">One of the officers came to the headquarters and said, "Hey, Bitter, are you Jewish?" </sentence><sentence id="1503">I said, "Yeah." </sentence><sentence id="1504">He says, "Boy, you're going to have a good time." </sentence><sentence id="1505">I says, "What do you mean?" </sentence><sentence id="1506">He says, "I found a factory full of Jewish broads," and that's

says, "Let me drive you there and I'll pick you up." </sentence><sentence id="1510">I say, "Can I be there that long?" </sentence><sentence id="1511">He says, "I'll pick you up. </sentence><sentence

id="1515">And we went there and the picture that I brought with me, the picture of the four girls standing outside this factory. </sentence><sentence id="1516">And I went up to the, girls knowing that they were Jewish. </sentence><sentence id="1517">I said [Yiddish/German expression] which means, "What are you doing, girls?" </sentence><sentence id="1518">And they were so excited at the fact that there was a Jewish soldier there. </sentence><sentence id="1519">They had never seen an American-Jewish soldier. </sentence><sentence id="1520">They had not seen anybody. </sentence><sentence id="1521">They knew they were liberated because the Germans had left. </sentence><sentence id="1522">And they grabbed me, literally grabbed me, pulled me into the building, and took me to the second floor. </sentence><sentence id="1523">And I heard screaming and yelling of the girls. </sentence><sentence id="1524">And they put me up on a -- almost like a stage. </sentence><sentence id="1525">And there were girls coming from all over the building. </sentence><sentence id="1526">I swear to you, there must have been 100 to 200 girls, all disciplined. </sentence><sentence id="1527">All sat down.
