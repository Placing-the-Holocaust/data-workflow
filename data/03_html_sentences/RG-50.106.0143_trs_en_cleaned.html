<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="341">Q: Do you know why your father didn't raise you from birth to be bilingual because he's -- he had lived in America? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="343">A: I think he was afraid to teach us English. </sentence><sentence id="344">Just -- actually, my father, even though he was an American citizen, he served in the German army during World War I. And again, that was another reason that he f-felt, like many Jews that was in the German army during World War -- World War I, figured that they would not ever be arrested. </sentence><sentence id="345">And even when my father lost his business, his tailor shop and was moved -- a-and we had to go and live in this apartment, he had to go into slave labor, but he figured that's the worst that the Germans will do to him, they forced him into forced labor. </sentence><sentence id="346">And -- but still he never thought that he'd ever be arrested. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="584">A: No, I think -- yes, we did. </sentence><sentence id="585">We went to school through 1942, again to a Jewish school, and of course there were many, many kids in one class. </sentence><sentence id="586">And learning, I would say most of my schooling was self studied at our mother. </sentence><sentence id="587">Yeah, I think probably our mother taught us more how to read than what we learned in school. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="638">A: Well, that was another problem a-after the Kristallnacht, when she cou -- only had a choice to go to -- to stores by -- owned by Jews, between five and six o'clock in the evening. </sentence><sentence id="639">And -- and what I think my mother did, she went to the store long before five o'clock so that she would be one of the first in line to buy what necessary food products she could get. </sentence><sentence id="640">And it was very, very small. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="644">Q: Prior to that, I understand that the Germans forced the Jewish men to take the name in their identification papers of Israel and the mothers -- or the women to take the name of Sarah. </sentence><sentence id="645">Did that happen to your parents? </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="672">Q: Had your parents, or especially your father, ever thought of leaving at this time, or did they make any efforts to try to leave? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="674">A: Yes. </sentence><sentence id="675">Back in 1934, I understand, they did make an effort to leave and we all got as far as Holland. </sentence><sentence id="676">But -- it may have been 1936, we got as far as Rotterdam I think, but I think the Germans already were doing a lot of things and even though they haven't -- hadn't invaded Holland yet, but the -- the -- they forced my father to go back to Berlin. </sentence><sentence id="677">Apparently the -- he didn't have the proper papers to leave Germany. </sentence><sentence id="678">And of course -- and he had to pay -- every penny he had, he had to pay just to get back to Berlin, and he just didn't have the financial resources to get us -- to get us back out. </sentence><sentence id="679">But then again he was so convinced, being an American, that they are going to leave him alone. </sentence><sentence id="680">They" ll give him a rough time, but he felt he'd be left alone. </sentence><sentence id="681">And again, like a lot of people, especially business people were arrested and sent to concentration camp, going back to 1941 and 1942. </sentence><sentence id="682">My father wasn't arrested until 1943, and I think there are USHMM Archives RG-50. </sentence><sentence id="683">106*0143 17 records here at the Holocaust Museum, the date he was arrested, even the transport number. </sentence><sentence id="684">I do not remember now. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="697">Q: But -- but you were saying, to go backwards, that in 1936 he was able to get you -- the four of you to -- to -- th-the four of you in family to -- to Rotterdam? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="699">A: I believe it was 1936, I cannot be sure of the dates, cause again I was too young, I -- I know we moved someplace, and -- but I do not know. </sentence><sentence id="700">But I know through when I lived with my cousins after I came here to the U:S., they said that he took us all once to Holland then had to turn back, but then he ran out of money. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="703">Q: Now, you're attending school, you're in your new, smaller apartment. </sentence><sentence id="704">Your father is doing slave labor, your mother is trying to get food and you're attending school with your brother? </sentence><sentence id="705">And did you again have any contact with non-Jews then, children your age? </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="717">A: I do not remember, I do not think we played games. </sentence><sentence id="718">I just cannot remember that we ever played games. </sentence><sentence id="719">I think the times were so complicated. </sentence><sentence id="720">I think in school the teachers concentrated more in group learning and little bit of Hebrew, you know, we studied like the Hebrew alphabet and so forth. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="829">A: Again, here is a mind that is blank, I don't remember. </sentence><sentence id="830">I do remember being with other Jewish kids, sometimes walking to school together. </sentence><sentence id="831">And I don't think a day went by where we didn't -- weren't -- not beat up, bu-but mistreated by the German kids, especially Hitler youth kids and Hitler youth was 10 years and ol -- over. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="847">Q: And again, did you confide in your -- in your parents? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="849">A: Oh yes, oh definitely. </sentence><sentence id="850">And again, I don't remember what my parents said. </sentence><sentence id="851">My mother just said well, those days will pass by, just be patient. </sentence><sentence id="852">These were, I think, what my parents were saying. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="857">Q: So you felt your parents were a comfort to you at this time. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="859">A: Oh, very much so. </sentence><sentence id="860">Very much so. </sentence><sentence id="861">Our parents did comfort us as much as they could. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="865">Q: And so then it's 1941, you're still at school, your father is doing slave labor -- </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="866">A: Right. </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="867">Q: -- and life goes on. </sentence><sentence id="868">Any recollection during that year, or even with Pearl Harbor in December, any -- the bombing of Pearl Harbor in December and Americans going into the war. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="871">A: No, we -- we didn't know about that. </sentence><sentence id="872">I did know that Franklin Roosevelt was president. </sentence><sentence id="873">I do remember this, but I do not remember Japan bombing Pearl Harbor. </sentence><sentence id="874">I never even heard of Pearl Harbor, so no, I did not know anything like that. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="879">Q: Now, you said this German woman who was your midwife was an acquaintance of your family. </sentence><sentence id="880">Was there any relationship with her during this time? </sentence><sentence id="881">Had you known about her at this point in your life, in 1940 -- 41? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="885">A: Yes, I did, because there were times, going even back to 1939 where we did visit her at her apartment. </sentence><sentence id="886">And she had a -- an apartment in the better part of Berlin, Scheneberg and we did visit her. </sentence><sentence id="887">Sometimes she had dinner for us. </sentence><sentence id="888">And, in fact there were times th -- when she picked us up where we lived and we did remove our Star of David when we had to wear it, and we went with USHMM Archives RG-50. </sentence><sentence id="889">106*0143 22 her to her apartment and there we were very safe because she also -- I think she had a special I.D.or something, that she was a high ranking Nazi member, a personal friend of Hitler. </sentence><sentence id="890">So nobody bothered her when -- especially when we were with her, too. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="899">Q: Was she married? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="901">A: No, she was never married and at that time she was probably in her middle 50's. </sentence><sentence id="902">She died when she was 79 years old, I believe, a-after the war. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="905">Q: I'm sure you're always asked how do you explain the fact that this Nazi party member was so helpful to you. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="907">A: Okay. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="909">Q: Even at that time, and we'll get to more later, of course. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="911">A: Okay, when I was younger I couldn't figure that out at all, but now, being older and seeing what has happened, my guess is that she was such a Nazi fanatic, she was a good friend of Hitler and deep inside she was convinced that Hitler did not know what was going on. </sentence><sentence id="912">She used to tell that to my father, to my mother, that Hitler doesn't know what's going on. </sentence><sentence id="913">Once he learns what's going on, he's going to stop that. </sentence><sentence id="914">And I believe because of that mentality, she was convinced if she would be caught helping us, that Hitler would free her and she would say everything to Hitler. </sentence><sentence id="915">A-And I think that's the only reason that I can think of why she helped us. </sentence><sentence id="916">And of course she mu-must also feel that she brought me onto this world. </sentence><sentence id="917">And I think that's the only reason. </sentence><sentence id="918">And I think I'm the only Jewish person she ever assisted in a birth. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="927">Q: Did she deli -- she did not deliver your brother? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="929">A: No, she did not. </sentence><sentence id="930">My brother I think was delivered at a Jewish hospital in Berlin. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="933">Q: And how is that you were not? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="935"> USHMM Archives RG-50. </sentence><sentence id="936">106*0143 23 </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="937">A: Again, I don't know. </sentence><sentence id="938">I--1---I th -- somehow either my father or my mother befriended her, and I guess this would have been my mother's actually third child, me, and I guess she wasn't as uncomfortable being assisted by a midwife. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="941">Q: So, were you born at home? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="943">A: Yes, I was. </sentence><sentence id="944">In fact it was -- my father ha -- actually, he had two stores, one of them was within two blocks of each other and the first store is where I was born. </sentence><sentence id="945">I think that was in Petsalozzi(ph) strasse. </sentence><sentence id="946">And then later on Leipne(ph) strasse, which was at Kristallnacht. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="951">Q: So you would go t-to her house and -- the four of you a-and visit with her, and fi -- through 1941 and did life go on in this difficult way til 1942? </sentence><sentence id="952">And then what happened in 1943? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="955">A: Well, in 1943, one day our father didn't come home. </sentence><sentence id="956">And again, we did have a number of n- non-Jewish friends that were against the Hitler regime. </sentence><sentence id="957">And it was one woman that says, leave your apartment, the Germans are arresting everybody. </sentence><sentence id="958">They took your father away, he's -- he was arrested. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="963">Q: So that's how you heard, through this woman? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="965">A: That's right, who was a friend of ours and she -- I think she owned a -- a laundry or something like that. </sentence><sentence id="966">But, just outside the Jewish section of Berlin. </sentence><sentence id="967">And -- and she is the one that told us, and it's -- really, it was very close. </sentence><sentence id="968">When we gathered the few things that we owned -- as I say we, my mother, my brother and I, the few things we owned, we left the apartment and there was a back entrance. </sentence><sentence id="969">We went out the back entrance and we understand that the SS came up the front entrance. </sentence><sentence id="970">So we just barely escaped. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="977">Q: How much time elapsed between the time the woman told you and the time you left? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="979">A: Again, I'm guessing here, I would say less than an hour. </sentence><sentence id="980">It was very, very close. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="983">Q: So your father was taken away when he was on the labor battalion? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="985"> USHMM Archives RG-50. </sentence><sentence id="986">106*0143 24 </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="987">A: That is correct, he was, right from work taken away. </sentence><sentence id="988">And again, from what I see, the record showed he was shipped to Auschwitz and probably -- again, talking to Auschwitz survivors, they say normally what happened is when they arrived in Auschwitz, they had two sides. </sentence><sentence id="989">One side they were tattooed and they were in the work parade, the other side di -- were not even -- didn't even get a number, they were put in the gas chamber and my father was one of those. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="993">Q: Your father was what, late 40's, or 50 by then? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="995">A: I would say he was -- I think my father was in the early 50's at the time. </sentence><sentence id="996">Well, my father, I--I can probably figure it out. </sentence><sentence id="997">I am not sure. </sentence><sentence id="998">He was born either 1981 or 1991. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1009">A: Right. </sentence><sentence id="1010">And again, he was murdered in Auschwitz, roughly two days after he arrived there from what other people tell me that have been there. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1015">A: Right. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1017">Q: And where did she and you go? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1019">A: Okay, again we're going right back to this Nazi midwife. </sentence><sentence id="1020">She, because of her friendship with Hitler, had a summer cabin in the outskirts of Berlin. </sentence><sentence id="1021">And only high ranking SS officers could have cabins there. </sentence><sentence id="1022">And this is where she put us. </sentence><sentence id="1023">She told all the other officers, military officers, mostly SS, that our father was a -- a --I guess a colonel or something in the army -- ar -- German army and he was out in the fronts in -- in the front line in ka -- Russia. </sentence><sentence id="1024">And we lived there, right amongst the SS, or the wives of the SS. </sentence><sentence id="1025">But then of course wintertime came along -- </sentence></p><p><sentence id="1026"> USHMM Archives RG-50. </sentence><sentence id="1027">106*0143 25 </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1028">Q: Well -- well now wa -- wait a minute, what about papers? </sentence><sentence id="1029">Did you mother -- wh-wh-when this happened in the beginning, what kind of papers did your mother have? </sentence><sentence id="1030">She didn't have these papers. </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1031">A: Fraulein Noelting, the midwife, she provided my mother with papers, where we went under different names and us kids went under different names. </sentence><sentence id="1032">And again, she was right up with her party and we ha -- there was bombing and a lot of civilians were killed during bomb air raids back in the 40's. </sentence><sentence id="1033">And so this midwife, she found out what family with -- what mother with two children were killed at a certain -- our age, were killed at certain a-a-apartments, or houses. </sentence><sentence id="1034">And she got us those types of identification. </sentence><sentence id="1035">And that's how we lived. </sentence><sentence id="1036">Of course, then after six months or so, people were wondering -- sometimes my -- maybe I should go -- my brother and I would act like we'd go to school. </sentence><sentence id="1037">We'd wear the bags to go as if we were going to school, but we never did go to school. </sentence><sentence id="1038">We didn't dare go to school because of every child had to go into physical training and then you take a bath. </sentence><sentence id="1039">Well, us being boys, being circumcised would give us away. </sentence><sentence id="1040">So we never went to school. </sentence><sentence id="1041">But then people got kind of suspicious, they -- nobody ever saw us in school, other kids. </sentence><sentence id="1042">So this midwife says, you have to leave from there. </sentence><sentence id="1043">And then again we took on different I.D. and we moved from area to area, place to place. </sentence><sentence id="1044">Some of the places I do not know, but I -- </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1045">Q: So the first location you stayed for six months. </sentence><sentence id="1046">What was your new identification, who were you? </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1047">A: I was -- it so happened I was Horst Grossman. </sentence><sentence id="1048">My mother was a Grossman, I don't know what her first name was, and my brother was a Grossman. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1112">Q: What's it like -- what was it like to see a swastika? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1114">A: Fear. </sentence><sentence id="1115">Just plain fear. </sentence><sentence id="1116">Of course you saw it, no matter where you went you saw it. </sentence><sentence id="1117">And the swastika was actually easier to get used to. </sentence><sentence id="1118">The thing that bothered me was the -- the skull that the SS had on, or even some soldiers that were affiliated with the SS all wore that -- that skull. </sentence><sentence id="1119">That was, to me, worse than the swastika. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1126">Q: Why? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1128">A: Well, because I knew that were the ones that would kill the Jews -- they would kill us, and we knew that. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1130">Q: Were you ever afraid when you were with these young German boys that you would let your guard down and say something that was inappropriate? </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1164">Q: Did the SS people come to visit? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1166">A: No, they didn't, because again they knew to -- as far as they knew, our father was in the Russian front and -- and my mother always showed like she was so sad, she didn't know where Father was exactly, that they pretty much left her alone, as far as 1 can remember. </sentence><sentence id="1167">And we didn't mix too much with the -- and most of them didn't even have kids there, and -- because again they were probably, most of the people there were in their late 30's, early 40's and they had kids who are -- probably were in se -- in Seattle, I almost said. </sentence><sentence id="1168">They were probably in Berlin taking training in the Hitler youth, because they were all Hitler youth age. </sentence></p></dialogue>

train, railcar that I was in was mostly -- were mostly Russian soldiers, men and women soldiers. </sentence><sentence id="1590">There were, I think, a couple of kids my age in there and a few other women and men, Germans, Jews, I do not know. </sentence><sentence id="1591">Then there were a whole bunch of people on the floor of the train that were already dead, or were trampled to death, or been there a lot longer. </sentence><sentence id="1592">I don't know how long they save, you know, kept the train in Berlin until it was full, completely full. </sentence><sentence id="1593">So there were a number of people that I know were dead. </sentence><sentence id="1594">There was nothing to eat, no water and no sanitation facilities. </sentence><sentence id="1595">And it was -- it was the worst

they were SS, they were volunteers to be there, I think knew the allies were right outside the camp because Dachau was liberated April 29". </sentence><sentence id="1602">And this was let's -- let's say this was April 20". </sentence><sentence id="1603">And so I think to be maybe he or she, whoever opened the railcar door figured maybe they'd get better treatment. </sentence><sentence id="1604">And so that door opened and whoever was strong enough, jumped out. </sentence><sentence id="1605">I followed a bunch of Russian soldiers. </sentence><sentence id="1606">There must have been 15 or 20 of them that I followed, and it wasn't too far. </sentence><sentence id="1607">We ended up on a camp where there were nothing but Hitler youth and a few German soldiers. </sentence><sentence

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1790">A: No, I would say the Russian soldiers helped me and actually kept me from getting down on the ground, because they knew if I would fall, I wou -- could be dead, because I'd be trampled USHMM Archives RG-50. </sentence><sentence id="1791">106*0143 44 on. </sentence><sentence id="1792">And I will say the Russian -- incidentally, they treated me well, and treated my brother well after they liberated Berlin. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1911">A: Well -- that's right. </sentence><sentence id="1912">Well, I think my brother would have done the same thing. </sentence><sentence id="1913">Again, maybe our mother brainwashed us in there -- in this. </sentence><sentence id="1914">And I think maybe this Frau Noelting told us whenever things like happen, what to do, I -- I think, but I just knew what I had to do, especially when I couldn't follow the Russians and here I was all alone. </sentence><sentence id="1915">And -- and I decided, well, the only way I'm going to make it is put on the Hitler youth uniform, and hoping that I wouldn't be forced to take a rifle and start shooting. </sentence><sentence id="1916">And again, I didn't know like, at the time that the allies were out or the -- outside the Dachau camp that the ger -- Russians were outside, I didn't know that. </sentence><sentence id="1917">But I knew, we all knew the war was coming to an end, and we even knew that before I was arrested. </sentence><sentence id="1918">We knew it was the end of the war coming. </sentence><sentence id="1919">Well, we knew that and th-the word spread. </sentence><sentence id="1920">People, Germans that were against the regime weren't afraid to talk any more that much. </sentence><sentence id="1921">And I used to hear people say, look at all those tanks there -- to other people -- look at those tanks, there's not enough gasoline to operate the tanks, they're out of gas. </sentence><sentence id="1922">And so the Germans weren't quite as afraid any more. </sentence><sentence id="1923">But of course afterwards, and I -- I do know women, I know men that would say, oh we're -- we have a secret weapon. </sentence><sentence id="1924">This just when the Russians were really fighting for Berlin, where we were, we have secret weapons and they going to take them, they're going to kill the -- all the Russians that are coming in. </sentence><sentence id="1925">There were still those fanatics around and I heard women say, oh, if these Russians should come in, I'm going to pour boiling water on them. </sentence><sentence id="1926">And I'll do everything, they'll never get me, I'll kill them, and so forth. </sentence><sentence id="1927">Of course, after the Russians USHMM Archives RG-50. </sentence><sentence id="1928">106*0143 47 came in, oh how sweet you are. </sentence><sentence id="1929">And -- and honestly, the Russians would wa -- rape the women right out in daylight in the street. </sentence><sentence id="1930">Again, things I didn't know until it came true. </sentence><sentence id="1931">And you know, I had no remorse on those women that used to -- I used to hear in the train station that they are going to kill the Russian, they are going to knife them to death or they're gonna put boiling waters on them. </sentence><sentence id="1932">That's how they felt then, and then they were friends. </sentence><sentence id="1933">So, the Russians that came into Berlin were completely uneducated. </sentence><sentence id="1934">They had no common sense, and they were -- in fact, I wouldn't be surprised if those were released prisoners, because the Russian -- I think the front line soldiers were maybe from Siberia, or people that were politically arrested or other -- some reason other arrest. </sentence><sentence id="1935">And they were -- they were not the nicest people, and yet to us kids, they treated us well. </sentence><sentence id="1936">And of -- of course after Berlin was divided between the Russians, the French, the British and the U.S. troops, we then went to live with this midwife. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2210">A: Right, well, having been away from really, the Jewish religion for all these war years, we were taught by this American serviceman, who was very Orthodox, and he probably knew as much as a rabbi, and he made sure that we learned all the prayers and says we have to be Bar Mitzvah. </sentence><sentence id="2211">And even though I was only 12 years old and my brother were 13, he recruited one of the Jewish chaplains fr -- chaplains from his American company in the army and we were officially Bar Mitzvah, went through all the various prayers. </sentence><sentence id="2212">And I do not know the exactly -- exact date, but I would say it was some time in 1946 and probably I would -- I'm guessing now, between March and April of 1946 when we were Bar Mitzvah, becau -- </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2213">Q: So you were already 13, cause you were 13 in January. </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2214">A: Ah, no I wa -- that's correct, I was 13 in January, so I was th -- that's right, I was 13 and my brother was 14. </sentence><sentence id="2215">And of course, he was a year late before he could be Bar Mitzvah. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2706">A: Graduated from high school in 1951 and then I applied to go to the University of Missouri law school, since I had two uncles from my mother's side that were lawyers. </sentence><sentence id="2707">We also had uncles that were dentists, mostly from our mother's side. </sentence><sentence id="2708">In fact, I know of one uncle who was in Shanghai during the war, and I met somebody in Seattle who -- whose dentist was my uncle in Shanghai. </sentence><sentence id="2709">But anyhow -- </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2710">Q: You -- bu-but you were -- what about undergraduate at college? </sentence><sentence id="2711">What do you mean you applied to law -- you wanted to apply to law school? </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2712">A: Lapplied after I got out of high school, I applied to go to the University of Missouri and then eventually go into law school, right? </sentence><sentence id="2713">Well, when I took the entrance examination for the University of Missouri, apparently my score on the English part of the test was above average. </sentence><sentence id="2714">And I was told that I cheated because the results of the test score was much higher than it possibly could have been with the lack of education I have had and the short time that I have been in the U.S. I did ask to take the test over again, but back in 1951 that was not done. </sentence><sentence id="2715">At -- times have changed today. </sentence><sentence id="2716">But so -- since I could not go to the University of Missouri, I didn't really know what I wanted to study then, because my goal was to be a lawyer, just like my parents wanted me to be a lawyer, my brother to be a dentist. </sentence><sentence id="2717">And so I was 18 and a half years old, or almost. </sentence><sentence id="2718">They were just starting to draft 18 and a half year olds, so I decided to join the army and get that out of my -- out of my life here. </sentence><sentence id="2719">And so I joined the army. </sentence></p></dialogue>
