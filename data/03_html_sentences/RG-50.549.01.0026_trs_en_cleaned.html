<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="145">Was there a sense that they were watching you? </sentence><sentence id="146">It seems that if they arrested you when you went home and you didn't live there, they must have somehow known you were coming? </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="147">A: Well, yes, there was the fear that one could be re-arrested and then it would not have been a police prison but it would have meant to be sent to the concentration camp of Dachau. </sentence><sentence id="148">Now Dachau at that time was not an extermination camp but it was a camp of terror. </sentence><sentence id="149">And personally violent persecution. </sentence><sentence id="150">At that time the, a few friends of mine were shot in Dachau. </sentence><sentence id="151">And the proverb, if you can call it that, was created: shot while attempting to escape. </sentence><sentence id="152">Now, so | lived in Germany having been relieved from the duty to report to police stations, and | had the goal, as soon as possible, as early as possible, to be able to leave Germany. </sentence><sentence id="153">And particularly so because on a visit to Nuremberg, not to my village, | had arranged, my mother had arranged to meet me in Nuremberg in order to spend a pleasant weekend together. </sentence><sentence id="154">When she came home from that visit, she was ordered by the Mayor of the village to come to the village counsel and she was told, Mrs. Schnaittacher, if you have been here today, during the day or yesterday, we would have arrested you. </sentence><sentence id="155">We give you the opportunity to defend yourself. </sentence><sentence id="156">My mother had been extremely courageous and  ontactrefieannedjustanmiang er hither btemelortabnattfiexaliaton Fritz Schnaittacher 8 [Date not labeled] Page 8 she screamed at them that if they wanted to arrest her, they should do so right now because the following day she was going to leave the area to live with her mother. </sentence><sentence id="157">And that's what she did. </sentence><sentence id="158">And that, the , the precarious actions of my mother, and my Uncles and Aunts, was my never-ending burden and sorrow here.| had, and that is, goes for so many of the refugees. </sentence><sentence id="159">We had an interesting, rewarding time here. </sentence><sentence id="160">Cost of living was extremely low and even though | only earned at the beginning $13.00 a week, it was fully adequate to keep me alive. </sentence><sentence id="161">And to enable me on weekends to go hiking and we had a wonderful time. </sentence><sentence id="162">It is interesting to note that this now is the late fall of 1933. </sentence><sentence id="163">My brother had lived here already. </sentence><sentence id="164">He came, not because of the Nazis, in 1929 at the behest of an Uncle of mine, who lived here, had lived here for some years and had a going business and was not married and therefore didn't have any other children. </sentence><sentence id="165">And my brother entered his business and later on | joined him. </sentence><sentence id="166">We lived in the utmost of comfort, earning $13.00, $15.00, $17.00 a week. </sentence><sentence id="167">On 96" Street and Western Avenue. </sentence><sentence id="168">Across the street from the, what's the name of the hotel? </sentence><sentence id="169">The Hotel Paris, which had a swimming pool and we could go swimming every night, for 25 cents. </sentence><sentence id="170">And it was really a wonderful way of living. </sentence><sentence id="171">Burdened only by our concern for our in Germany. </sentence></p></dialogue>
