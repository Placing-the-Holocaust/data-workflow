Nazis, or when Anschluss came, in March of 1938, and the German army marched in unopposed, either by Austria or any other international community, and apparently with the tacit backing of Mussolini in Italy, the reception that I saw of the German troops, you know the Nazis, by the Austrian population was overwhelming. </sentence><sentence id="14">And for example, many of the active socialists, even those in the underground, switched parties and joined the Nazi party. </sentence><sentence id="15">Some of them warned my father that because they knew, now the Nazis would know about his underground
