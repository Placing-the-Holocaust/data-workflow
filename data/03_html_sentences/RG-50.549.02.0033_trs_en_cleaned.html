<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="15">Q: Okay. </sentence><sentence id="16">Let me -- Let me ask you to go back. </sentence><sentence id="17">You did a video interview about your experiences during the war -- </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="18">A: Mm-hm. </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="19">Q: -- with the museum in Washington. </sentence><sentence id="20">But let's go back a bit and you've talked about this somewhat in that interview. </sentence><sentence id="21">Let's take it back maybe to a couple months before the </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="25"> USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0033 3 end of the war. </sentence><sentence id="26">If you could just briefly describe what -- what your circumstances were, where you were, who you were with, and what was happening at that time. </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="27">A: Well, we were liberated in, I think the third of December, of 1944, by the Scottish army and they were followed by I guess British and the Americans. </sentence><sentence id="28">But I don't know much about that any more. </sentence><sentence id="29">The -- Couple of months before that, we suffered immensely under real war conditions. </sentence><sentence id="30">In September they started dropping the troops in Arnum, and since I lived in Fenlow at that time, which isn't so far, we saw, actually it -- all the troops coming over in big airplanes, and it was on a Sunday, it was brilliant, sunny day, and I'll never forget it, because it was just immense. </sentence><sentence id="31">It -- It was never ending, big airplanes and little airplanes, which we later on found out were gliders, and that's really when our liberation sort of started, from that moment on, we were practically constantly under fire. </sentence><sentence id="32">And we -- we couldn't go outside any more and we didn't have gas and electricity and things like that. </sentence><sentence id="33">And life became very, very difficult. </sentence><sentence id="34">I was still in hiding of course, and a few very dangerous things happened to my personally. </sentence><sentence id="35">We had no food so my stepmother and her daughter went out to get food in the field, like cauliflowers an-and potatoes and things like that, cause the farmers couldn't get it, because the man didn't go outside, they -- the Germans were very much aware of the man and they wanted them to go to help them in Germany, I guess. </sentence><sentence id="36">So, and then, it was a couple of -- maybe -- it was in October, maybe then already, that some Germans came to the house. </sentence><sentence id="37">I was there with my stepfather, who was in bed, because he was on strike. </sentence><sentence id="38">The Dutch government had told all the people who worked for the railroad that they had to go on strike, so he did. </sentence><sentence id="39">And there USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0033 4 was a son in the house, who was supposed to be working for the Germans. </sentence><sentence id="40">So, he was also somewhere hiding in the house, so I had to open the door. </sentence><sentence id="41">And the Germans said they wanted to look in the house, and they looked in the house, and they decided the house was good. </sentence><sentence id="42">And they told me they were going to come back in the evening to live in our house for awhile. </sentence><sentence id="43">So, for about two weeks, I think, they lived with us. </sentence><sentence id="44">And they sometimes asked for me, but I was every night very, very tired, so when they came in, my stepmother told them that well, I was so tired, I wasn't used to doing the housework and all that sort of stuff, so I always went to bed early. </sentence><sentence id="45">So they never saw me. </sentence><sentence id="46">Course, they were scared that if they found out I was Jewish, that the whole family would be killed. </sentence><sentence id="47">So, when the war came closer and closer, the Germans left, because they -- they stayed away from the real fighting apparently. </sentence><sentence id="48">And then in December, we were finally liberated, but that was sort of difficult too, because the -- the Germans had recreated all the people who lived in our little town, and they had to all go across the River Maus, into Germany, and then up north, into the northern part of Holland. </sentence><sentence id="49">And they wanted all the regular people out of town, and they wanted to go -- go [indecipherable] us for the Americans and the British who were coming. </sentence><sentence id="50">So, my stepparents decided that I, who had no papers at all, was too much of a danger to take along on that kind of a trip, and so we all went into hiding. </sentence><sentence id="51">The man stayed somewhere, I don't know where, but we, the women, stayed in a bombed-out house, and there we stayed for a couple of days. </sentence><sentence id="52">There was some food, there was water and that's where we were liberated. </sentence><sentence id="53">And it was, of course, still very, very dangerous, because the troops didn't cross the river, and it was constant bombarding and USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0033 5 grenade fire. </sentence><sentence id="54">So, we somehow crawled to our house, and then the British decided that they didn't want us there, so we were evacuated to another town, and there we stayed til I think the middle of April. </sentence><sentence id="55">In the meantime, Holland wasn't even liberated altogether, so while I was in the other town with my step-parents, and the son and the daughter, we were free. </sentence><sentence id="56">My step-parents kept on asking me, very unnoticed for me, really, my name and my -- my father's name. </sentence><sentence id="57">And then the next day they ask me my mother's name, and so they came -- in a couple of weeks they came to know who I really was, cause you never talked about it and you never wrote that down. </sentence><sentence id="58">And they apparently gave that to a Jewish organization who was trying to find all the children. </sentence><sentence id="59">And then they -- that organization decided that maybe it was a good thing for me to go to Israel, but -- then Palestine, but I didn't want to hear about that, cause I wanted to know if I still somehow, would find my parents back. </sentence><sentence id="60">I had no idea where they were. </sentence><sentence id="61">So, they -- they decided they were going to keep me in the house for -- I don't know how long, maybe they would have taken me forever. </sentence><sentence id="62">And then my father, who was hidden in Amsterdam first, but later on left for northern Holland, somehow got himself involved in underground work. </sentence><sentence id="63">He was an artist and he was good in doing precise pictures, so he put part of the province where he was in, an-and mapped it for the underground and that was sent to England, so that when the troops were coming, that they knew exactly where every house was, and where every little obstacle would be. </sentence><sentence id="64">And then somehow he was caught by the Germans. </sentence><sentence id="65">They came in the house to check something. </sentence><sentence id="66">He and the owner of the house were sent to prison because they were listening to the English radio when the Germans walked in. </sentence><sentence id="67">And thank USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0033 6 God my father didn't reveal that he was Jewish, and they never found out that he was Jewish, so he spent a couple of months in jail. </sentence><sentence id="68">And had they known he was Jewish, they would, of course, have killed him instantly. </sentence><sentence id="69">But he was liberated there. </sentence><sentence id="70">And as it was, the troops apparently traveled with lists of children who were liberated. </sentence><sentence id="71">So, when my father came out of prison, they somehow presented him with a list. </sentence><sentence id="72">And my maiden name is D" Ancona, D'A, and when -- in Holland, it's -- the A counts as the main letter, so my name was on top, and my father found out that I was okay. </sentence><sentence id="73">But then the problem was he was up north and I was down south and there was no transportation in Holland, especially in the part where I was, everything was damaged and bombed, and there were no roads, there was no public transportation, no trains, no buses, nothing. </sentence><sentence id="74">So, since my father had worked for the underground, he got some letters from important people, I would say, who gave him permission to travel. </sentence><sentence id="75">So he somehow talked himself into being allowed to cross the rivers, and you know, on a bicycle without tires. </sentence><sentence id="76">And he came one day to -- to the house where I was hidden, and I then lived in freedom. </sentence><sentence id="77">And well, he knocked on the door, and we didn't get many visitors there, and so when I heard a man speak, I knew right away it was my dad. </sentence><sentence id="78">And at that time I found out that my mother was caught by the Germans and that she had gone away, that she was in the holding camp, Westerbork, and after that was sent to wherever, and that we had no way of knowing if my mother had survived. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="147">A: Well, my par -- we were -- we were -- we all went in hide -- in hiding at same time. </sentence><sentence id="148">I was taken by an organization to the southern part of Holland, and to a family that I had never met in my life, didn't know the people, and -- </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="149">Q: You say an organization, do you know the name of it, or who those people were? </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="150">A: Ah, well they called them Emfay, which is in Dutch, the same as LTD. </sentence><sentence id="151">And the -- the organization was started by a man, Mr. Debrown, which was not his real name, and he had helpers, young man and young women, who took the kids from the Germans. </sentence><sentence id="152">When - - When you were picked up from your home in Amsterdam, small children were put in a - - sort of what -- what used to be a school, and the parents were across the street in what used to be a theater. </sentence><sentence id="153">And then, before they went on transport to Westerbork, and those children, those young children were taken care of by Jewish people, most likely, I think, nurses, and people who took care of kids. </sentence><sentence id="154">And they went out for walks sometimes. </sentence><sentence id="155">And the organization had made it their business to steal some of those children. </sentence><sentence id="156">So, every day when some of those kids were walked outside to get a little fresh air, -- and I'm sure that it was prearranged with help inside, that certain children were going to be taken away. </sentence><sentence id="157">So </sentence></p><p><sentence id="158">   USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0033 8 they had as many clothes on as possible. </sentence><sentence id="159">And then they walked at the end of the line, cause there were like maybe 10 or 15 kids, and then at the end, and then those young people came and just stole them away. </sentence><sentence id="160">And how they organized getting rid of their papers and -- I have no idea. </sentence><sentence id="161">I guess that's known in -- in Holland how it went, but those children were just rescued. </sentence><sentence id="162">And I was still at home. </sentence><sentence id="163">I was one of the very, very last in Amsterdam, who lived in their own house and that was because we are Sephardic. </sentence><sentence id="164">My father and my mother both are from Sephardic descent, and the Germans, with all their crazy rules and regulations had, at some point said that most of the Sephardine were going to be descendants from Aranos, which most likely was true, and we were not really Jews, we were Christians. </sentence><sentence id="165">So, my parents tried everything in the world to get us declared non-Jews, not because they didn't want to be Jews, but you know, it was important not to have to go to the other side of the world. </sentence><sentence id="166">I don't know what -- what my parents knew about what was waiting on the other side of the fence. </sentence><sentence id="167">I didn't know an awful lot, because as much as possible was kept away from me. </sentence><sentence id="168">But I knew, and everybody knew that, that it wasn't very good. </sentence><sentence id="169">So, we were in Holland; in Amsterdam still quote quote free, in October of 1990 -- in 1943 were -- and was practically no Jew left in Amsterdam walking the streets. </sentence><sentence id="170">There was no school any more, and there was no organiz -- organized life for Jews any more. </sentence><sentence id="171">So, on the 16" of October, my father decided that since we weren't declared non-Jews, we had to go. </sentence><sentence id="172">So, my father found this organization and they said they would have a place for me. </sentence><sentence id="173">So, on mon -- and one morning they came -- and the lady came to pick me up and she took me along to the station and there she handed me to a    </sentence></p><p><sentence id="174"> USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0033 9 young man, and he took me on the train with another child that I never saw again, and we traveled a long distance. </sentence><sentence id="175">We had to change the pla -- the train in the station and we took another train. </sentence><sentence id="176">Then we finally came at the destined place and this young man said to me, "Well, you just wait here." </sentence><sentence id="177">And he took the young man with him and came back maybe three quarters of an hour later, half an hour later, without the young man, but that a -- that time that I had to wait at that station was like -- like a year. </sentence><sentence id="178">It was never ending, and here I was, I was in -- I mean, I was 13 years old. </sentence><sentence id="179">I was -- I was child, but I was -- I was aware of the dangers. </sentence><sentence id="180">I had no name, I didn't know where I lived, I -- I -- I -- I was nobody, and if they -- somebody had come up to me and said, "Where are you going, what are you doing, are you waiting for somebody?" </sentence><sentence id="181">I couldn't say anything. </sentence><sentence id="182">So, I was very, very scared. </sentence><sentence id="183">And then when he came back, he came on back with a -- with a bicycle, so I went with him on the bicycle and he dropped me off at this family. </sentence><sentence id="184">And there I stayed for the rest of the year and -- and another year. </sentence><sentence id="185">And I was very, very different from my own home. </sentence><sentence id="186">I came from a middle class family, nothing very fancy, but these people, the man was working for the railroad, he repaired railroad cars. </sentence><sentence id="187">And they were fine people, there's nothing to s -- be said about them, they were risking their life for me, they knew what they were doing. </sentence><sentence id="188">And they were terrific. </sentence><sentence id="189">But it was an altogether different life than what I was used to. </sentence><sentence id="190">They were going to church all the time, they read the Bible, they prayed every day and I wasn't used to that at all, cause my parents were atheist, and -- not that they wanted to deny they were Jewish, but there was absolutely no religion in my house, and so -- </sentence></p><p><sentence id="191">  USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0033 10 </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="192">Q: And these people were not Jewish, that you're with, or they are? </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="193">A: No, no, no, they were Christians. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="195">Q: Yeah, right. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="197">A: They were Christians where I lived now. </sentence><sentence id="198">So, everything was different, and of course I -- [had just said goodbye to my parents, my father and my mother, and I knew very well that that wasn't all that sure that I would ever going to see them again. </sentence><sentence id="199">So, at -- it was very traumatic, and -- but I had to adjust, I had no choice. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="203">Q: When you -- When you were in this house, with these people that you'd never met before and they're not from your background, and they're not from your religion or whatever, but they -- did you realize at the time how much of a risk they were taking to -- </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="204">A: Oh, I knew that, yeah, hundred percent, yeah, I knew that if somebody was going to come, that th-the man would most likely be killed, and the son, who was 16 or so at that time, would have had a hard time, too, and maybe the whole family. </sentence><sentence id="205">You never knew what the Germans were going to do. </sentence><sentence id="206">But, no, they knew very well what they did, and after the war, I asked them why did you do this? </sentence><sentence id="207">And then my stepmother told me that somebody who was sent by one of the clergy in that town, came to their house and asked if they would take a child, a Jewish child. </sentence><sentence id="208">And she was willing to say yes right away, but she thought it was prudent to ask her husband if he was thinking the same way. </sentence><sentence id="209">So, she said, "Well, you have to wait til my husband comes home from work and I can tell you tonight." </sentence><sentence id="210">So, as it happened, their oldest daughter was going to leave home, and that is very important because in those days, you couldn't buy beds, you couldn't buy linens,   ontectnetonancedjusmtneey for ther biormatierabouttfistecion </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="218"> USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0033 11 you couldn't buy blankets, you couldn't buy anything, even if you had the money, it wasn't available, and so they could only take me if they had a spare bed. </sentence><sentence id="219">So when the daughter left, I could take her place, so they told the man who came from the underground, they could only have a girl, because I could stay with their other daughter in the same room. </sentence><sentence id="220">So that's how come I found this place, or they found the place for me. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="224">Q: And in this place, where these people who were, at first anyway, are strangers, and they're [indecipherable] </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="225">A: It was very strange. </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="226">Q: I was going to ask you, what was it like to be there? </sentence><sentence id="227">How did you act, how did you feel? </sentence><sentence id="228">Did you feel quickly like part of the family, did you kind of keep to yourself, how did they react? </sentence><sentence id="229">You know, what was that like? </sentence><sentence id="230">That's a strange situation to be in. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="236">A: It's -- It's -- It's -- It's an awful situation to be in cause, number one, I was very nervous that I had left my parents, and that this -- this -- this whole town was -- was -- you know, it was so different from a big city, and everything in tha-that household was different than -- than in my house, and I -- I was -- I'm an only child, so I wasn't used to brothers and sisters, and once I was settled a little bit, you know, they started to tease me and J wasn't used to that at all. </sentence><sentence id="237">And I don't think I've cried a lot, because ed -- I knew -- I was old enough to realize that crying wasn't going to help. </sentence><sentence id="238">And I knew also that I had to behave myself and that I couldn't be this spoiled brat and that I had to adjust, because if I didn't do that, maybe the people wouldn't want to keep me, and where was I going to go then? </sentence><sentence id="239">I had nowhere to go. </sentence><sentence id="240">And that is the -- an -- an awful feeling. </sentence><sentence id="241">If -- If they had put  ontectnetonancedjusmtneey for ther biormatierabouttfistecion USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0033 12 me out on the street, I wouldn't have had any place to go. </sentence><sentence id="242">I was far, far, far away from even non-Jewish friends that I knew, but I had no money, I had no papers, I had -- I had nothing. </sentence><sentence id="243">And I think that was the scariest part, that I had to really be as perfect as could be, because I couldn't risk any problems in that house, so when they teased me I had to take it and they didn't do that to be mean to me, but they were just used to it and I was not. </sentence><sentence id="244">I couldn't go to school. </sentence><sentence id="245">The daughter went to a parochial school, but that was a long walk and there was no transportation at that time any more either. </sentence><sentence id="246">So, they didn't want me to risk that big long walk to school. </sentence><sentence id="247">So I had to stay home and in the beginning I tried to do a little bit of my schoolwork, but my head wasn't there. </sentence><sentence id="248">So, my stepmother said, "Well, I didn't get you in here to be my maid, but maybe it would be a good idea to help me once in awhile." </sentence><sentence id="249">So I -- I helped my stepmother with making the beds, and in those days, everything was breaking, so we had to sew a lot and mend a lot and I'm pretty handy when it comes to that, so I helped and I liked that. </sentence><sentence id="250">And I loved to scrub, so I -- I learned a lot. </sentence><sentence id="251">I learned a lot of things that my mother never would have taught me, and that came in handy later, I think. </sentence><sentence id="252">So, I -- I had to do things during the day, cause I was bored stiff otherwise. </sentence><sentence id="253">And so my stepmother and I got along very well. </sentence><sentence id="254">When she went shopping, she sho -- most of the time took me along, cause she wouldn't let me home alone, and so we went shopping and -- but there wasn't much to shop, so we didn't do that too much. </sentence><sentence id="255">And so that was the -- my daily job, to help and do as much as I could to -- to not be a nuisance. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="363">A: Unreal, unreal. </sentence><sentence id="364">We -- We -- We didn't know where my mother had gone. </sentence><sentence id="365">We knew my mother was caught at the place where she was in hiding, and after jail and I don't know what else, she ended up in -- in Westerbork, in that camp before you go to -- to Germany or Poland. </sentence><sentence

of stuff, which was like an exemption, my mother had had that in her papers and the Germans didn't first want to recognize that, but when she was in that camp, with the help of friends who lived there for quite awhile, they recognized that. </sentence><sentence id="368">So, my mother was sent to Theresienstadt, and that was sort of the show camp for the Germans. </sentence><sentence id="369">And that -- My father knew that she had been sent to Theresienstadt. </sentence><sentence id="370">But we also knew, after the war, that not everybody stayed in Theresienstadt, and so for the rest, we had no knowledge of what had happened to my mother. </sentence><sentence id="371">My -- My mother came back, though, she told us what had happened, and she did the rounds. </sentence><sentence id="372">She stayed in -- She was caught in July of "44, which most likely is why she was still alive, because it was sort of at the end of the war. </sentence><sentence id="373">She -- She went from Theresienstadt to Auschwitz, and there she stayed for about two weeks. </sentence><sentence id="374">And she didn't talk much about that, but when she did talk about it, she said it was hell, and it was worse than hell. </sentence><sentence id="375">They sort of stayed together, 10 Dutch women, and what was the best thing in Auschwitz was that if there was a transport to go somewhere else, cause nothing could be worse than Auschwitz. </sentence><sentence id="376">So, one evening, all the people who knew about that there was a transport going, were lining up outside somewhere. </sentence><sentence id="377">And another story goes that everybody who is up front ends up going on transport, and the ones who are left over are going to be killed, that they knew. </sentence><sentence id="378">However, the Germans liked doing nasty things, so when all those women are fighting and -- and -- and -- and being excited about going away from Auschwitz, were standing in line, they let them turn around, so the ones who were standing in front were standing in the back and the ones who standing in back were </sentence></p><p><sentence id="379"> USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0033 17 standing up front. </sentence><sentence id="380">That saved my mother's life, because my mother otherwise would have been in the back, instead of in the front. </sentence><sentence id="381">Then she was transported to Lanzing, which was -- I guess nobody knows about that concentration camp. </sentence><sentence id="382">It was part of Mauthausen, in Austria.

work in that kind of an industry have to get extra food, have to drink a lot of milk, can't do it more than so many months, I guess, in a year, and there are strict rules, but for Jewish women that
