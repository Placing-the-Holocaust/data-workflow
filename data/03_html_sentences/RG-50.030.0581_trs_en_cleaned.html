<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="426">A: Well, I was aware of the tremendous sense of frustration of the American Jewish community. </sentence><sentence id="427">But on the other hand, I was aware of the complexities of the leadership. </sentence><sentence id="428">I mean, like Rabbi Wise, who had good relationship with Roosevelt, and so he had to be very careful in open criticism of the Department of State. </sentence><sentence id="429">I was aware of the American Jewish committee and their ambivalence about being too supportive of the Zionists, because after all, we Jews are religion rather than a nationality, and I was very much identified with the idea that Jews are both a religion and a nationality. </sentence><sentence id="430">And so I would say I had a quite advanced knowledge, not only what was going on in the U.S. or in Germany, or in much of the rest of Europe, what was going on in the Soviet Union. </sentence><sentence id="431">When I was at Cornell, there was a pretty active communist youth group, and I was among the Jewish kids who were very much opposed to the Soviet Union, because of -- even though they seemed to be wi -- quite progressive, they were a dictatorship. </sentence><sentence id="432">And so I was active in the Hillel Society and that group was very much opposed to the Soviet Union, whereas there   http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection Interview with Joseph Eaton " May 27, 2010 were a lot of -- not a lot, but there was a sufficiently active group of students at Cornell that felt that the Soviet Union had the solution to mankind's future. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="441">Q: What sort of activities was your group, the Zionist group at Hillel doing? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="443">A: Well, first of all, we were very critical of the Soviet Union; of its dictatorship, the concentration camps, the labor camps, Stalin. </sentence><sentence id="444">We did not think they are progressive. </sentence><sentence id="445">There were lots of arguments. </sentence><sentence id="446">And so, I had friends among the anti- communists, but you know, I did become a Republican as a result, but I was politically active, and one of my friends was a Iraqi Jew. </sentence><sentence id="447">The only Jew ever sent by the Iraqi government, on a scholarship of the government. </sentence><sentence id="448">They every year sent over some students to get an American degree, and Mayer(ph) Sofaya(ph) was the only one who was Jewish who they ever selected. </sentence><sentence id="449">And so we became very friendly, and through him I learned a lot of what was going through the Arab world, and I did -- was invited to his wedding in Egypt in 1945, and actually went to the wedding. </sentence><sentence id="450">I didn't get there on time, but I actually met him in Cairo, in -- at the end of 1945, and that another interesting story, how knowing him enabled me to come to Palestine in 1945. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="559">Q: Let me ask two questions; one is, do you attribute his response just to the fact that he was disappointed that there was no food, or do you think any of this was anti-Semitic, or anti-intellectual? </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="708">A: In the psychological warfare division, the key person was a Austrian named Captain Hans Harber(ph), and he had become important because he -- he married the daughter of -- the father of Ted Kennedy and the other Kennedys, who had been ambassador to Great Britain. </sentence><sentence id="709">The way Hans Harber(ph), who was himself a refugee from Austria -- he became extremely well-known because of his personal history. </sentence><sentence id="710">Harbie(ph) was the son of a Hungarian Jew named Baeckeshee(ph), who edited the scandal sheet of Budapest, and who had shot himself in the foot in World War I, so he wouldn't have to serve. </sentence><sentence id="711">And Hans had been very ashamed of his father when the war broke out in-- World War II, in "39, he signed up in the Foreign Legion and was taken prisoner by the Germans and escaped, and wrote a book about the whole situation; his service, his family, and it became a best seller. </sentence><sentence id="712">So this is how, because of the book, he was invited to lecture all over the country and Europe, and this is how he met his future wife. </sentence><sentence id="713">And then he signed up in the American army, and he dising -- distinguished himself in North Africa. </sentence><sentence id="714">He was a   Interview with Joseph Eaton 8 August 1, 2010 journalist who had studied the history of Hitler and his family. </sentence><sentence id="715">So he was appointed to head the psychological warfare units, and was regarded by top level executives as a intelligent, sophisticated analyst of what was going on in Europe. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="725">Q: Now, before you could b -- enter psy -- the PSYOPS division, did you have to undergo any security clearances, any other special exams? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="727">A: If I did, they h-had all the information about me, so I-- I would -- I do not recall. </sentence><sentence id="728">My hunch is they did make the security clearance. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="731">Q: And what sort of special training did they give you at Camp Ritchie? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="733">A: Well, the training we got was a a-analysis of how the German army was structured; tactically, strategically, chains of command. </sentence><sentence id="734">We studied the German propaganda techniques. </sentence><sentence id="735">We studied the British American policies that Harber(ph) had worked out with the British, which contrasted to the Hollywood approach, that at the beginning had been kind of adopted, a kind of advertising that we have now, in which you oftentime make claims that are not -- that are misleading. </sentence><sentence id="736">The British had decided before Dunkirk, that the only way they could win in Europe is to adopt a policy of always telling the truth. </sentence><sentence id="737">So at Dunkirk they reported their defeat, the problems of evacuating everybody, the losses, and they broadcast these facts to the Germans over BBC, and the French and so on. </sentence><sentence id="738">And you know what, they were facing a tremendous loss, had the Germans had succeeded, and continued this  http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection Interview with Joseph Eaton deg August 1, 2010 policy and psychological warfare had adopted the policy of not using propaganda, they -- you know, the way Americans advertise. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="747">Q: And how did they define your mission? </sentence><sentence id="748">Did you have a mission statement? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="751">A: The mission statement was to get the Germans as -- first of all, to believe in what they were being told by the U.S. and by the British, and second, to get the Germans to question their regime, on the basis of what was difficult for the Germans. </sentence><sentence id="752">In other words, we'd -- we -- to simply say the Germans were unfair and unjust and so on, wasn't going to work, because they felt that Germany, in order to survive, had to do some terrible things, that's war. </sentence><sentence id="753">We had to focus on inconsistencies in German policies from the point of view of the German public and the differentiation between what was good for the general public, and what was good to the me -- for the maintenance of the regime. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="773">Q: And when did your unit ship out to Europe? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="775">A: We shipped out in "43, and were sent to London, there to work with the British and get trained for British American cooperation. </sentence><sentence id="776">We had -- that time we had not yet attacked Europe at Omaha Beach, but we were being readied for that event. </sentence><sentence id="777">We knew that sooner or later we would invade Europe, but of course we didn't know when it would happen. </sentence><sentence id="778">But that was our training. </sentence><sentence id="779">And especially writing reports, working with British -- actually, we were being investigated carefully by British intelligence. </sentence><sentence id="780">They didn't trust -- and I learned later that the Americans, our particular unit was sent to a villa in the outskirts of London, which was very comfortable, but of course the blitz was going on. </sentence><sentence id="781">Any time you got hit by a bomb, that was it, a whole block would be wiped out by one bomb. </sentence><sentence id="782">And -- but the villas were run by women -- British women soldiers, who did -- who fed us, who looked after our clothes, who woke us up in the morning, who made sure that we had, you   http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection Interview with Joseph Eaton 8 August 1, 2010 know, were properly fed and had all the comforts. </sentence><sentence id="783">What we didn't realize, that they also were carefully making notes on all of us, and had conversations. </sentence><sentence id="784">Their job was to make sure that we would be able to function in a proper fashion. </sentence><sentence id="785">And then, about five weeks after the invasion of France, we landed at Omaha Beach at a time when it was no longer dangerous, because actually, American troops had liberated Paris. </sentence><sentence id="786">So we landed and there was a bus waiting, and we drove directly to Paris. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="800">Q: Now, won't you tell me about what your day to day work was? </sentence><sentence id="801">And I know that you were writing leaflets, but what was the source of information, how did you get the information that you we -- based on your reports, and how did you decide what went into the reports that you were writing? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="804">A: Well, the leaflets had to appeal to Germans. </sentence><sentence id="805">So what we did is we looked at the tactical situation, and then presented it to the Germans as this is what is happening in the battlefields. </sentence><sentence id="806">And giving them facts about what was going on, which by 1940 -- late 1943 - 1944 was no longer entirely favorable to the Germans. </sentence><sentence id="807">I mean, we were still incurring losses, but we were beginning -- you know, in Africa we actually were able to defeat Rommel and prevent the capture of Egypt. </sentence><sentence id="808">So, depending on what happened that day, we would write a leaflet, and then we would think of some other things that might make Germans question the policies of their government. </sentence><sentence id="809"> Interview with Joseph Eaton *deg August 1, 2010 </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="816">Q: And how independent were you in terms of what you put in? </sentence><sentence id="817">Who had to approve these leaflets? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="820">A: The 10 men working in teams of one or two or thr -- not more than that, would prepare a leaflet, or a news broadcast, and they would be reviewed by Captain Harber(ph). </sentence><sentence id="821">And he had the authority to say yes or no. </sentence><sentence id="822">There was a colonel, but the colonel was somebody who had come from the broadcasting industry, who worked well with Harber(ph), but really Harber(ph) was the authority, as somebody who understood what was going on in Europe. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="826">Q: And how did you disseminate these leaflets once you wrote them? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="828">A: Well, we did nothing, they were just -- they were just exercises. </sentence><sentence id="829">The -- I think at times -- no, I don't think, I know at times our products were shown to high officials, probably Patton and Bradley and Eisenhower, to give them an idea what psychological w-warfare we'd be doing. </sentence><sentence id="830">But it was all practice. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="834">Q: So none of these ever made it to Germany, or -- </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="836">A: I don't know. </sentence><sentence id="837">They -- they may very well have been dropped. </sentence><sentence id="838">Certainly I knew that once we were at Radio Luxembourg, everything we did was being dropped. </sentence><sentence id="839">I don't know whether, before we actually occupied Luxembourg, and Radio Luxembourg, and operated from there, whether the British had decided that simply it was enough to have the BBC, simply because to drop leaflets meant to use air  http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection Interview with Joseph Eaton *deg August 1, 2010 power, and every plane we could spare was being used to bomb. </sentence><sentence id="840">So I sort of doubt that they would drop leaflets, when we had no capacity to occupy, to get Germans to surrender, and so on. </sentence><sentence id="841">So I'm not sure that -- there may have been some tactical use used in the radio brod -- broadcast, but -- but we didn't get that kind of feedback. </sentence><sentence id="842">But I doubt very much that we dropped any leaflets before we were in a capacity to take prisoners. </sentence></p></dialogue>

he didn't know of any other Jew who survived. </sentence><sentence id="1346">Well, apparently the people in military government looked after him subsequently. </sentence><sentence id="1347">He was seep -- he got a job in military government as somebody who could be trusted, and ultimately turned out to be a member of the city council and became head of a new Jewish community, because there were a few survivors who drifted back to Aachen and so the province decided to facilitate the development of a Jewish community, and he actually became its head, I think, for the rest of his life.

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2016">Q: And how long did you remain in Straubing? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2018">A: Well, my job ended when the newspaper was turned over back to a German editorial board, about November deg45. </sentence><sentence id="2019">By that time, nearly all the newspapers, maybe with a week or two difference, were turned over to the Germans, and the program of U.S. operated German newspapers came to an end. </sentence><sentence id="2020">And I had    86 Interview with Joseph Eaton August 1, 2010 accumulated enough points to be sent home. </sentence><sentence id="2021">But because of the fact that there was a army program that permitted soldiers in Europe to visit relatives if they were available, I decided to take advantage of that, and I went, I think to Bad Nauheim, and asked to meet with my brother in Palestine. </sentence><sentence id="2022">And that was approved, but a few hours later, while waiting around, I was told sorry, Sergeant Eaton, Palestine is closed. </sentence><sentence id="2023">The British have closed Camp Litwinski, near Tel Aviv, a recreational facility for American sailors and soldiers, and ask all Americans to leave. </sentence><sentence id="2024">There's no way for you to go to Palestine because there were several generals who wanted to go to Palestine for Christmas, but who were refused. </sentence><sentence id="2025">So I f-- thought quickly, and said, but could I meet my brother in Cairo? </sentence><sentence id="2026">If you can get transportation. </sentence><sentence id="2027">So I gave them the address of a school friend at Cornell University, a Jew from Iraq, who had moved from Baghdad to Cairo, and I knew his address because he had sent me an invitation to his wedding in Cairo. </sentence><sentence id="2028">So I got permission to go [indecipherable] I wanted to see my brother, and so they approved it. </sentence><sentence id="2029">And when the orders were printed, they were printed like all other orders, to carry out the instructions of the commander, without specifying anything except I was put on detached duty for two weeks in Cairo to carry out instructions of the theater commander. </sentence><sentence id="2030">That was Eisenhower. </sentence><sentence id="2031">So, my commanding officer, who knew why I was leaving, what I went doing, said that's wonderful. </sentence><sentence id="2032">I don't care how long you   Interview with Joseph Eaton *7 August 1, 2010 stay, because when you g-go back, you going home. </sentence><sentence id="2033">We don't need you any more. </sentence><sentence id="2034">So again, I'm not sure every commanding officer would have taken that position. </sentence><sentence id="2035">So, I had to find my way to go to Cairo. </sentence><sentence id="2036">Well, there was no -- I didn't get orders, transportation orders, because there was no way to get to Cairo from Straubing, Germany. </sentence><sentence id="2037">So | packed up a duffel bag and hitchhiked to Rome, because I knew in Rome we had an air force base, and I had found out that we had planes flying from Rome to the Middle East. </sentence><sentence id="2038">So when I got to Rome, I found out that there were no planes going to Palestine, there were no planes going to Cairo, but there were a lot of planes going to India, and they had to stop off in Baghdad to refuel. </sentence><sentence id="2039">So, showing my orders, I got orders to fly to Baghdad and then I would find a way of going to Cairo from Baghdad. </sentence><sentence id="2040">Nobody told me how I would do it. </sentence><sentence id="2041">I got to Baghdad, and in Baghdad a British officer looking at my orders said, you are very lucky Sergeant Eaton, we have a plane going to Cairo in an hour. </sentence><sentence id="2042">But I didn't want to go to Cairo, I want to go to Palestine. </sentence><sentence id="2043">So I said, well I can't go to Cairo now, I have to go to Baghdad first. </sentence><sentence id="2044">He said, it doesn't say in your orders. </sentence><sentence id="2045">I said, I have to go to Baghdad first. </sentence><sentence id="2046">And, I can't let you go to Baghdad, it's does -- not in your orders. </sentence><sentence id="2047">So I said, would you put in writing that you're refusing to let me go to Baghdad? </sentence><sentence id="2048">He didn't want to do that, so instead, he accepted my request and he issued a voucher for me to go to the best hotel in Baghdad, where the British  Interview with Joseph Eaton degdeg August 1, 2010 officers were staying, to get a room at British expense. </sentence><sentence id="2049">And I said I would find a way of getting to Cairo by bus. </sentence><sentence id="2050">And I did. </sentence><sentence id="2051">I got ahold of a bus, there were bus service every few days from Baghdad to Damascus. </sentence><sentence id="2052">And from Damascus I got a ba -- a bus to Ruspina. </sentence><sentence id="2053">And then I spent three and a half weeks in Palestine, in American uniform, knowing that under British rules, I'm not supposed to be there. </sentence><sentence id="2054">No one ever stopped me. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2096">Q: Just stop you one second. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2098">A: And the French really were willing to be part of a new Europe, but it was the Jews who prevented this. </sentence><sentence id="2099">So that as a -- an -- and this was also in deg45 already. </sentence><sentence id="2100">In "46 the British felt they could not change the policy in Palestine, and therefore actually you had a rebellion of Jews against the British. </sentence><sentence id="2101">And the whole uncertainty of what would happen to all these displaced persons, the ba -- of course, after my newspaper was over, and I no longer had a position, I -- I was offered a job in military government in Germany by the U.S. Army, with a pro -- with a promotion to captain. </sentence><sentence id="2102">But I didn't want to live among Germans, and I wanted to finish my academic career, so -- and I didn't really like the American policy in general, which was to work very closely with the lower level German officials, which I didn't particularly like, although today I realize that if we had done what we did in Iraq, of dismissing the infrastructure of Saddam Hussein, we really didn't have the  http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection Interview with Joseph Eaton .deg August 1, 2010 means to govern the country. </sentence><sentence id="2103">And so we really didn't have much of a choice, except to use a great many officials in the same positions that they had occupied under the Nazis, as long as they had not been excessively active, and known to have been -- have -- have en-engaged in atrocities. </sentence><sentence id="2104">So major anti-Semites, judges who convicted too many people to death for stealing food, or for racial fo -- fo -- disapproved sexual relations or things like that, they lost their job. </sentence><sentence id="2105">But most judges, most Nazi judges stayed as Nazi judges. </sentence><sentence id="2106">And so by the time I could have become maybe the governor of this or that city in Germany, I would have had to deal with these kinds of officials, so no, I wanted to finish my PhD. So that -- the -- but certainly the -- one other thing is, once I started to go back i-- go into teaching, my focus was on my professional career. </sentence><sentence id="2107">So I had research ideas, and I got adequate funding for research. </sentence><sentence id="2108">So I focused on research, I didn't return to my army days or take a look at my extensive files of what happened in World War II. </sentence><sentence id="2109">I didn't think of myself of somebody who was a historian of Germany, World War II. </sentence><sentence id="2110">I had lots of interesting records of things I did, and they were put in boxes, and these boxes got transported from this home to that home, and I was always too busy to really look at them, of what was in there, because I had many other interesting professional challenges, until after my retirement, I started looking at the material. </sentence><sentence id="2111">And I'm now engaged in writing a history of how my family interacted with the German culture over many   http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection Interview with Joseph Eaton *deg August 1, 2010 centuries. </sentence><sentence id="2112">Because one has to face the fact that historically, Germany was never just a country of Germans. </sentence><sentence id="2113">There was always an existing minority that had a very important function, namely the Jews. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2133">Q: And when you look at all the documents that you accumulated when you were in the army, you're looking at them fresh after so many years, is there anything that surprises you, that you view differently in retrospect than you did at the time? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2135">A: Yes. </sentence><sentence id="2136">The -- I mean, for hundreds of years, on both sides of my family, they remained Orthodox, even though a large proportion of the German Jews became Reform Jews. </sentence><sentence id="2137">On my father's side they were quite conservative. </sentence><sentence id="2138">On my mother's side, they took advantage of modern secular education, but they remained Orthodox. </sentence><sentence id="2139">I had relatives as far back as 1835 who went to Palestine, because they wanted to live there. </sentence><sentence id="2140">I-- on my mother's side, I had people going to Palestine, 1882.The -- so that my family was clearly Orthodox. </sentence><sentence id="2141">Two of my brothers remained Orthodox. </sentence><sentence id="2142">My oldest brother and I, especially under the influence of the Holocaust, I became convinced there is no superior po-power looking after exactly what's happening to any of us. </sentence><sentence id="2143">And that if there is some rational power that explains the incredible complexity, and the -- the uniformity of many things in nature; the fact that we have DNA that we shor -- share with earthworms and with butterflies. </sentence><sentence id="2144">There's s-some incredible rationality that somehow has developed an evolution for    Interview with Joseph Eaton * August 1, 2010 which I have no explanation. </sentence><sentence id="2145">But I don't think there is a god who decides that I've been a good person, or I have had significant faults, on the basis of which my afterlife would be. </sentence><sentence id="2146">So, I-- I am not an Orthodox Jew today. </sentence><sentence id="2147">And -- but Iam identified with the Jewish community for ethnic reasons. </sentence><sentence id="2148">So from that point of view, I had an opportunity to do things during those unusual periods of time, which the only other time I was able to express my interest in being Jewish is when I took a job for five years to establish a school of social work in Haifa University, and they needed an outside person who was not involved in Israeli politics. </sentence><sentence id="2149">And so they brought me in because university wanted to establish a school that would compete with Hebrew University and have a different ideology, so I took that job. </sentence></p></dialogue>
