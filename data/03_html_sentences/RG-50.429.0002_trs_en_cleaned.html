<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="861">Q: Do you remember how you and some of the other athletes felt when this took place? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="863"> 14    15 </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="864">A: We felt, we felt that they, we felt that they should have been given the opportunity to participate, an opportunity to win a gold medal and which they would have won a gold medal. </sentence><sentence id="865">They still would have won that relay team, regardless whether Jesse Owens or Ralph Metcalfe was on it or not. </sentence><sentence id="866">They still would have won. </sentence><sentence id="867">But they didn't give those boys a chance. </sentence><sentence id="868">And that's why Marty today, to this day, is very bitter about that, about that decision. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="874">Q: Describe what it was like being at the games when you weren't running. </sentence><sentence id="875">Uh the mood, the pageantry, did you see Hitler regularly? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="878">A: Well everything, we saw Hitler every day when he came out to the games, but you see, he was so far away just like myself, uh sitting in the, in the stand, he was too far away for us to even see, see the image of him, see. </sentence><sentence id="879">We knew he was there. </sentence><sentence id="880">We knew each time he came into the game because you know the German people you know, you know, naturally would create a commotion when he, when he entered the stadium, when he entered the stadium. </sentence><sentence id="881">But me personally, he was too far away from me to make out just, just what he looked like other than from, from those pictures that I've seen some, seen of him see. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="886">Q: Try to paint for me a picture of what it was like at the games, what it felt like, what it looked like, because I didn't have that option? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="888">A: Well at the games, at those particular games in 1936, they were a very fine set of games. </sentence><sentence id="889">That was my first experience you see. </sentence><sentence id="890">That was my first experience of, of, of being in the Olympic games. </sentence><sentence id="891">It was very, very exciting. </sentence><sentence id="892">The events were run off with precision, the athletes didn't have to wait around when their event was called, the starter started, started your event. </sentence><sentence id="893">You knew the Germans, you knew they're, they're a stick, they're a stickler for things being done just right. </sentence><sentence id="894">And that's the way they, that's the way they ran the games. </sentence><sentence id="895">Because in talking with some of the old timers who had followed the Olympic games prior to the 1936 games that, that I participated in, they said they that the Berlin games were the finest Olympic games that they'd ever witnessed. </sentence><sentence id="896">That was the, that was the statement they made. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="920">A: Well, the flags, the only flags that, that was, that took place was when after the athlete's completed their event. </sentence><sentence id="921">Now, when the American, when the Americans won, the American flags went up. </sentence><sentence id="922">And of course, it was, if it was a foreign country that was part of, part of the race, took third or second, whichever the case 15    16 may be, or even first, their, the flags representing their nations went up. </sentence><sentence id="923">Those are the only flags that were waving. </sentence><sentence id="924">And of course in the, in the uh bleachers, some of the, some of the uh spectators were waving flags. </sentence><sentence id="925">Some of the Americans were waving little flags you see, showing their, their enthusiasm for, for their, for their countrymen winning or the country women winning. </sentence><sentence id="926">That was the type of fanfare that you saw during the games. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="935">Q: A lot of cheering. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="937">A: A lot of cheering. </sentence><sentence id="938">That's, that's always the case you see. </sentence><sentence id="939">They do a lot of cheering. </sentence><sentence id="940">Although from my experience, you know, the athletes never hear it though. </sentence><sentence id="941">They never hear what's going on. </sentence><sentence id="942">Cause they're concentrating on what they're doing. </sentence><sentence id="943">They're concentrating on that race. </sentence><sentence id="944">So they don't, they don't hear the cheering. </sentence><sentence id="945">They don't even hear what people say. </sentence></p></dialogue>
