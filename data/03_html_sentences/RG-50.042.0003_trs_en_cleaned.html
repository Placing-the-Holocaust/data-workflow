the 1930s, and why don't you tell me how old you were and what you remember of daily life as it was impacted by the Nazi party, how it came into greater and greater power--pogroms, laws... </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="4">A: Now, well actually I think I should start in the, let me see, I was born in 1910, so that would have been around 1930 when the Nazi party really came into being. </sentence><sentence id="5">And I remember that they were then a party #26, we had many, many political parties in Germany at that time, and they were party #26. </sentence><sentence id="6">They had advantage over other political parties such as the communists and democrats because they had a lot of money backing behind them and when they marched into a certain neighborhood, they had beautiful shiny boots and beautiful uniforms and they marched in military uh formation, whereas, democrats and the communists at that time, they were organized, but they were like a bunch of people running down the street, as compared to well-organized march of the Nazis. </sentence><sentence id="7">We lived at that time in an area called ----------------- in Hamburg, Germany, which was a working class neighborhood. </sentence><sentence id="8">I would say, very largely communist, not necessarily party members, but certainly sympathizers. </sentence><sentence id="9">There was one particular day I remember quite vividly, when the Nazis decided they wanted to march down the main street in our neighborhood, by the thousands incidentally. </sentence><sentence id="10">And, we...didn't exactly like the idea, this was our neighborhood, our turf. </sentence><sentence id="11">There was a lot of shooting. </sentence><sentence id="12">Machine guns had been mounted on roofs, would shoot into the air. </sentence><sentence id="13">Group, and so forth, and that became a very bloody affair. </sentence><sentence id="14">This was only one time. </sentence><sentence id="15">I guess it, I'm not quite sure about the date, but it was in 1930, a very early 1930. </sentence><sentence id="16">I was involved in many of the anti-Nazi street fights, and ----------, I was never a member of a party really, but certainly a sympathizer. </sentence><sentence id="17">But then I was only 20 years old or 21 years old, so I had a lot of things that I wouldn't do today. </sentence><sentence id="18">And, it is generally assumed that the Holocaust, and it rightly so, actually started until 1942, when the death camps came into being, but that's not really quite true, not in my opinion because the first boycott of the Jewish stores happened in April 30, 1932! </sentence><sentence id="19">Where they took all, this is a long time before the holocaust started, as per se holocaust. </sentence><sentence id="20">They uh, boycotted the doors of the Jewish stores, put the name "juden" on the windows and so forth, and they marched in front of those stores for prevent customers from going in, but there were many people, I remember very vividly, one    particular store in the area that we lived in was a cigar store, it sold cigars and cigarettes. </sentence><sentence id="21">I know, my neighbors went in there, they never smoked a cigarette in their life, they just went in there to spite the Nazi movement at that time, they were not very much in favor of it. </sentence><sentence id="22">But we have to put this in a proper context, things were very bad in Germany. </sentence><sentence id="23">Unemployment was perhaps, I'm not sure of this now, but I would say perhaps 20% people weren't working, there, there was no jobs to be had, and as time went on, they became more and more sympathetic to the Nazi movement, first, I would imagine, for economic reasons and secondly, it became very popular to be antisemitic because it was easiest thing in the world, if you want to hate somebody, the Jews are always around! </sentence><sentence id="24">They can be hated. </sentence><sentence id="25">So, in my opinion, the actual holocaust, with the exception of the death camp, started in 1932, and, as I said before, April the 30th. </sentence><sentence id="26">A group of young men, friends of mine, we used to hang around together, we were quite active in dancing and all this kind of thing. </sentence><sentence id="27">We decided we're going to join the army. </sentence><sentence id="28">It was not an army, it was called uh...Arbeitz, Arbeitz, Arbeiten, I don't recall exactly the name of it. </sentence><sentence id="29">It was a labor camp, in which we had regular military training except for weapons. </sentence><sentence id="30">That was against the Versailles Treaty at that time, which had been still obeyed then. </sentence><sentence id="31">We had no weapons, but we marched in military formation and, and we used uh, uh spades, shovels, as rifles, which marching and all this kind of thing, we had a regular military training. </sentence><sentence id="32">At that time that I went in there, it was, nobody asked me if I was Jewish, and I didn't mention it, so we all got accepted into this uh camp. </sentence><sentence id="33">Somehow or other, I don't recall how, they found out that I was Jewish. </sentence><sentence id="34">I was sta-uh stationed in Marineburg, East Prussia, which was right near the city of Elding, also in East Prussia, and Elbing then was German, but it had been independent uh earlier. </sentence><sentence id="35">It's been kicked back and forth between Poland and Germany for many years. </sentence><sentence id="36">We marched from Marineburg to Elding, which was, I'd say, about 30 kilometers, and we stood guard for Hitler, and I claimed to have very distinct, uh, I don't know what I should call it. </sentence><sentence id="37">I probably was the only Jew in the world that ever stood guard for Hitler. </sentence><sentence id="38">I saw him as close as I see you right in front of me now. </sentence><sentence id="39">He was making a speech at the city in Elding, and as he walked by us, reviewing the troops, he was a little man, everyone knows the mustache and his hairdo, and he looked perfectly calm and we stood out there waiting for him to finish, which took about 3 hours. </sentence><sentence id="40">When he came out, and he marched by us again toward his car, the man looked, and I remember this very vividly. </sentence><sentence id="41">He looked as, like a maniac, he talked himself into a total frenzy. </sentence><sentence id="42">I don't believe that he even knew what he was speaking about anymore, because he was, he looked a, a person that has not control over his emotions anymore. </sentence><sentence id="43">It was found out somehow or other, as I said before, that I was Jewish, and I was discharged from this camp. </sentence><sentence id="44">I must have been in there, I don't remember exactly, I'd say close to a year. </sentence><sentence id="45">This was in 1932. </sentence><sentence id="46">Nothing much happened between 1932 and 1935 except the regular political uh marches through neighborhoods that they weren't wanted and so forth, and in the meantime, the Nazi party grew, and grew in popularity. </sentence><sentence id="47">A lot of the German fellows, young fellows, they weren't really antisemitic or anti anything, but they had    nothing to do, they had no jobs, and here, they come around they give them a beautiful pair of boots, and they give them a nice shirt and a pair of britches, and have a gun in your hip, you know, you can go out and shoot somebody, it's okay, you'll get away with it. </sentence><sentence id="48">Now, that became very popular, but in 1935, actually it was September 15, a new law came into being, and that a German family could not have a gentile maid, there were many Jewish families were quite wealthy too, and they had a maid, a live-in maid. </sentence><sentence id="49">They could not have a live-in maid under the age of 55, for apparently, obvious reasons. </sentence><sentence id="50">They also at the same time a law took effect that did not allow a Jewish person, male or female, to go with a Gentile person, male or female. </sentence><sentence id="51">At that time, I was going with a nice young lady that I had gone with for some time, and we were out camping, I remember very well, I had a kayak, and we went out camping near Hamburg, and there was a fellow and, next to us, near us, in another little camp with a tent, we slept in tents. </sentence><sentence id="52">He wanted to make a date with this young lady that I was going with, and she didn't want any part of it. </sentence><sentence id="53">He reported me to, to the Gestapo, and I was arrested for going with a gentile girl. </sentence><sentence id="54">I got six months in prison, solitary confinement in 1935. </sentence><sentence id="55">When I was released, I became known as a habitual criminal in the eyes of the Nazi party. </sentence><sentence id="56">I was a habitual criminal. </sentence><sentence id="57">I never did anything criminal in my life, but as far as they're concerned, being, doing something against the law was enough to make me a habitual criminal. </sentence><sentence id="58">As a result of that image that was put on us, I was arrested again 3 years later, on June 14, 1938 at 4 o'clock in the morning. </sentence><sentence id="59">We had gone to a birthday party of my sister in law. </sentence><sentence id="60">I was already married. </sentence><sentence id="61">I had a baby, my wife was pregnant again. </sentence><sentence id="62">Four o'clock in the morning there's a banging on the door. </sentence><sentence id="63">We woke up, we said, "What are they? </sentence><sentence id="64">Crazy? </sentence><sentence id="65">They want to continue the party 4 o'clock in the morning?" </sentence><sentence id="66">And I yelled, "Go on home! </sentence><sentence id="67">That's enough!" </sentence><sentence id="68">And the banging persisted and I opened the door, and there came 2 plain clothes men with guns, "You're under arrest." " </sentence><sentence id="69">Under arrest? </sentence><sentence id="70">What for? </sentence><sentence id="71">I didn't do anything." </sentence><sentence id="72">No questions asked. </sentence><sentence id="73">I said, "Would you mind getting out so my wife can get up?" </sentence><sentence id="74">He says, "Oh, that won't bother us." </sentence><sentence id="75">I said, "It may bother her." </sentence><sentence id="76">So, they stepped outside the door, and I got up, I got dressed, they took me to a police station near the area where we lived. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="165">A: Okay. </sentence><sentence id="166">We had gone to a birthday party on June the 14th, so some friends of ours who had come home, must have been about midnight, somewhere around midnight. </sentence><sentence id="167">Four o clock in the morning, we had a banging on the door, and I thought those were our friends coming back to continue the celebration. </sentence><sentence id="168">I said, "Come on, go on home, it's enough already. </sentence><sentence id="169">You know, 4 0 clock, got to work tomorrow." </sentence><sentence id="170">The knocking persisted, I opened the door, and two plain clothes men with guns came in to the room, "You're under arrest." " </sentence><sentence id="171">Under arrest? </sentence><sentence id="172">What for? </sentence><sentence id="173">I didn't do anything." </sentence><sentence id="174">No questions asked. </sentence><sentence id="175">They didn't push us around at that point. </sentence><sentence id="176">I was, I got dressed, they took us to a police station in the neighborhood where we were. </sentence><sentence id="177">I got into a room perhaps as large as this one right here. </sentence><sentence id="178">There must have been 2 or 300 people in there, and we didn't know what was going on. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="179">"What are you, what are you here for?" " </sentence><sentence id="180">I don't know, I didn't do anything." </sentence><sentence id="181">We didn't know anything. </sentence><sentence id="182">Nothing. </sentence><sentence id="183">We had absolutely no idea what was going to happen. </sentence><sentence id="184">All we knew, we were under arrest. </sentence><sentence id="185">Around 7 0 clock or 6 0 clock in the morning, they loaded us all on trucks, and they took it to a remote train station in a place called Foulsborough. </sentence><sentence id="186">It's a name, it's in a, a suburb of Hamburg. </sentence><sentence id="187">The trucks were supported by a police--well, those are storm trooper cars, not really police cars, the private police had nothing to do with it. </sentence><sentence id="188">They had a car in front of the truck, and car in back of the truck and one on each side with bloodhounds. </sentence><sentence id="189">To be facetious, they wanted to be sure nobody gets lost, you know. </sentence><sentence id="190">They took us to the train station, and we were loaded, we were loaded into regular trains, not boxcars, as what happened later. </sentence><sentence id="191">We were not in boxcars, we went in a regular train, and then, several hours of train ride, we didn't where we, we had no idea what was happening, and you can imagine some older people, I was just a young fellow, but there were some older people--started crying, we didn't know, what did we do? </sentence><sentence id="192">When we got to Berlin, they loaded us back on trucks again, no that is not correct. </sentence><sentence id="193">We went to a town called Oranienburg, which is a suburb of Berlin. </sentence><sentence id="194">How far outside of Berlin, I don't know. </sentence><sentence id="195">The train stopped, they shoved us all out of the train, and we began to march towards the camp. </sentence><sentence id="196">We still didn't know what was going to be, we had no idea. </sentence><sentence id="197">Along the train ride, some, we had to run, there was no walking. </sentence><sentence id="198">One particular incident I recall (pause) like it was yesterday, an old gentleman with the name of Solomon, I'll never forget. </sentence><sentence id="199">He must have been well in his 70s, he simply couldn't run. </sentence><sentence id="200">He couldn't run, he had to walk. </sentence><sentence id="201">He couldn't run and he collapsed, and he laid in the road, and one of the storm troopers, a tall young fellow, very slender, very tall, stepped on this throat (blows his nose), this is true. </sentence><sentence id="202">Unbelievable but true, till the man was dead. </sentence><sentence id="203">We had to pick up his body, and throw him to the side of the road, and we continued on into the camp, where we were assembled in a courtyard, and a strange incident happened at that time. </sentence><sentence id="204">We faced a barrack, a door on the right, a door on the </sentence></p><p><sentence id="205">   left. </sentence><sentence id="206">People went in the left door, came out the right door, entirely different people. </sentence><sentence id="207">Their hair was shaven off, they had a prisoner's uniform on, the very wide striped uniform. </sentence><sentence id="208">My number was 6199. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="209">A strange thing happened as I mentioned before. </sentence><sentence id="210">My parents were separated. </sentence><sentence id="211">I hadn't seen my father, and he was my step father I must say, in perhaps 8 years, maybe 9 years, right after I was bar mitvahed, my parents separated for a specific reason, and I hadn't seen him in all these years, and I saw him, met him in that camp. </sentence><sentence id="212">It was uh, hard to describe the emotion. </sentence><sentence id="213">My father was a very, very big man, he weighed 350 pounds. </sentence><sentence id="214">And I introduced myself, he didn't recognize me of course. </sentence><sentence id="215">And we became a family again. </sentence><sentence id="216">While we were in camp, I tried to take care of him as much as I could. </sentence><sentence id="217">There wasn't too much that I can, could do at the time, but, I just have to mention it because this all relates to a very traumatic experiences in my life. </sentence><sentence id="218">We worked ten hours a day if I remember correctly. </sentence><sentence id="219">We slept on straw, on strawbacks, it was a uh jude sack filled with straw. </sentence><sentence id="220">I guess that's common uh you know, under certain circumstances, many people sleep that way, and we worked 10 hours a day. </sentence><sentence id="221">On a field that was approximately a square kilometer, somewhere around that area. </sentence><sentence id="222">One area of this field was quite high, the other area was quite low. </sentence><sentence id="223">The area had to be leveled, and what was done was they had tracks running from one end to the other. </sentence><sentence id="224">On those tracks were mining cars. </sentence><sentence id="225">Now in this country, a mining car is square. </sentence><sentence id="226">Over there a mining car is a triangular shape. </sentence><sentence id="227">Steel mining cars, and each train had about ten of these mining cars on it. </sentence><sentence id="228">On each one of those mining cars storm trooper was standing with a re--and we had to run from one end of this field to the other, shovel the mining cart full of dirt, and return to empty it out on the lower end. </sentence><sentence id="229">If anyone would have told me at that time that I can run 40 kilometers a day, I'd say you're crazy. </sentence><sentence id="230">But I did. </sentence><sentence id="231">Day after day after day. </sentence><sentence id="232">The food was barely edible, I remember one particular incident, it so happens I hate broccoli, and they had broccoli soup for 3 days in a row, and for 3 days in a row I didn't eat anything, just dry bread. </sentence><sentence id="233">The other prisoners gave me some of their bread. </sentence><sentence id="234">They ate the soup, I got the bread. </sentence><sentence id="235">I just couldn't eat it because if I had I would have gotten sick. </sentence><sentence id="236">Psychological? </sentence><sentence id="237">Certainly, but I'm entitled. </sentence><sentence id="238">At one time, they assembled us in a courtyard. </sentence><sentence id="239">They had machine gun towers all the way around, and they were shooting machine gun bullets over our head, maybe a foot above our head, and they said, they made a, the commander made a speech, they said that if Germany, this was the time of Germany taking over the-------------- in Czechoslovakia. </sentence><sentence id="240">They said if Germany gets involved in the war because of -------------, these machine guns will be lowered and we're going to kill you all. </sentence><sentence id="241">We, we were hoping that this wasn't going to happen. </sentence><sentence id="242">Perhaps, many people will recall a Christian pastor with the name of Niemoller. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="243">He was arrested from the pulpit in a little church somewhere in Midwestern Germany because he simply didn't believe in the Nazi doctrine, and he was preaching openly against it, and he was arrested and put in camp, it became like an international incident at the time. </sentence><sentence id="244">I met him in -------- Sachsenhausen. </sentence><sentence id="245">What they did to this man, one human being doing this to another, is beyond description. </sentence><sentence id="246">This man in the perhaps 6 months that he was in our camp, aged 25 years. </sentence><sentence id="247">Perhaps I    shouldn't say this, but they literally made him eat his own waste, but he lived through it because he had very strong faith. </sentence><sentence id="248">I just mention this to convey what one human being can do to another. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="249">When you read this in a book it's one thing, when you see it and it actually happens it's quite another, I assure you. </sentence><sentence id="250">While I was in the camp I had pneumonia. </sentence><sentence id="251">The commander used to come in and inspect the sleeping quarters. </sentence><sentence id="252">There was no living quarters, we only had beds in the barracks, and other than that, we stayed outside, there was no anywhere where we could relax or assemble, no way. </sentence><sentence id="253">And he used to hold his nose, "Uh, these Jews stink, I can't stand it." </sentence><sentence id="254">This of course is all in German. </sentence><sentence id="255">One time, we were assembled, and I always tried to make it my business to stay in a back row. </sentence><sentence id="256">We always had 3 or 4 rows of soldiers. </sentence><sentence id="257">I tried to stay in the back row not to be conspicuous in any way. </sentence><sentence id="258">One time it just didn't happen, I was standing in the front row. </sentence><sentence id="259">And as the guards walked by, they stopped in front of me, and I dreaded that because I knew this might happen. </sentence><sentence id="260">And he says to me, "Why are you laughing?" </sentence><sentence id="261">I was in no mood to laugh, I assure you, but as far as he was concerned, I laughed. </sentence><sentence id="262">He says, "You're going to hang. </sentence><sentence id="263">In two weeks from today you're going to hang." </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="264">Q: We have to stop and reload. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="265">beep </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="266">Q: Now this time when you start, back up to where they lined you up, and just tell that whole thing again, they used to line us up and I used to try to stay in the back row, include all that, okay?

"Don't give us any excuses." </sentence><sentence id="428">They opened the window and they threw me out the window onto the platform of the train. </sentence><sentence id="429">They held me for, I was searched, I mean totally searched, nude searched, and they said, "Something wrong here. </sentence><sentence id="430">You didn't report to the Gestapo this morning. </sentence><sentence id="431">You're running away from something. </sentence><sentence id="432">We're going to call Hamburg." </sentence><sentence id="433">Whether they did or not, I really don't know. </sentence><sentence id="434">At midnight, they let me out, and I was allowed to go to another train that went into Amsterdam. </sentence><sentence id="435">I stayed in Amsterdam, I waited for my wife. </sentence><sentence id="436">She was not allowed to come, the American consul wouldn't give her, her Visa at that time because she just had a baby and she had some veins in her thighs that were very prominent, and he wanted to wait till that cleared up, and then he gave her, her passport. </sentence><sentence id="437">I waited in Holland for 6 weeks until we came to this country. </sentence><sentence id="438">Why do you think people had such a hard time, other people had such a hard time realizing what was happening. </sentence><sentence id="439">How do Jews not understand that...I don't quite understand your question. </sentence><sentence id="440">Why did Jews not understand?Yeah, how did people not realize what was happening?Well, I'm sure I was among them. </sentence><sentence id="441">When Hitler was party #26, we all said, "Ah, he's never going to anything. </sentence><sentence id="442">It's a great big joke. </sentence><sentence id="443">Doesn't mean anything." </sentence><sentence id="444">What we did not realize, I don't think many of the German people didn't realize, that's not the right phrase really. </sentence><sentence id="445">We're all Germans. </sentence><sentence id="446">I was a German at that time. </sentence><sentence id="447">What many of the people didn't realize, let's just generalize it, is that they had a backing of the most powerful people in Germany. </sentence><sentence id="448">He had the backing, what, how he sold them, I have no idea. </sentence><sentence id="449">I think maybe the background of it was money or, or power perhaps more than anything else. </sentence><sentence id="450">Power. </sentence><sentence id="451">The Kroops and the Thyses, they financed his whole campaign, and there was a friction as well. </sentence><sentence id="452">The so-called aristocratic Germans. </sentence><sentence id="453">They were not in favor of Hitler. </sentence><sentence id="454">And to prove a point, they made attempts to kill him after he became the big man, and they all got killed in the process. </sentence><sentence id="455">But he had a backing of the big industrialists in Germany. </sentence><sentence id="456">They were very much in favor, they saw billions of --------------, and power and conquest from other countries, Germany, you know, today Germany, tomorrow the world. </sentence><sentence id="457">That was the philosophy, that was their, their big phrase. </sentence><sentence id="458">We all thought it was a joke. " </sentence><sentence id="459">Ah, it won't amount to nothing, just another political party." </sentence><sentence id="460">And as far as the Jews were concerned they said, "Well, maybe it's not so wrong after all," because there was no killings at the point. </sentence><sentence id="461">We all knew from the book, Mein Kampf that he was very extreme antisemitic, but we never thought, nobody in his wildest dream can really imagine that it can, that anything can come to such extremes. </sentence><sentence id="462">Nobody can imagine. </sentence><sentence id="463">I don't believe    that anyone in the world can visualize six million people assembled in one place, and he killed 6 million people. </sentence><sentence id="464">Six million! </sentence><sentence id="465">It's incredible such a figure. </sentence><sentence id="466">Along with 5 million non-Jews, such as Jehovah's Witnesses, or anyone who did not believe in his philosophy. </sentence><sentence id="467">Life meant nothing, it's the most expe-expendable thing in the world. </sentence><sentence id="468">Life is the cheapest thing you can get. </sentence><sentence id="469">Nobody paid much attention to it at that time. </sentence><sentence id="470">Nobody, you can't in your wildest dreams imagine that anything can go to such extremes. </sentence><sentence id="471">And actually the extreme started in 1940 at the Wannsee Conference in Berlin, outside of Berlin, where Reinhardt Heidrich was appointed was appointed to be in charge of the quote unquote final solution. </sentence><sentence id="472">Of course, Reinhardt Heidrich was killed in Lidisi, Czechoslovakia. </sentence><sentence id="473">He was assassinated, and as a result of his assassination, in Lidisi, Czechoslovaki, the whole town was obliterated. </sentence><sentence id="474">Totally, every living thing, every man woman and child was killed in that town in revenge of Reinhardt Heidrich's death. </sentence><sentence id="475">When Heinrich was killed out, Eichmann took over the Final Solution. </sentence><sentence id="476">At that time, of course, I was already in this country. </sentence><sentence id="477">Let's go back and I want you to tell me again the story of being in the, the army , how you and a group others and nobody knew you were a Jew, and how you guarded Hitler. </sentence><sentence id="478">Tell me that whole story as though you haven't told it to me before because there was a very loud plane when you told that story, so...I didn't even hear the plane. </sentence><sentence id="479">Just do it again as though you haven't' told me. </sentence><sentence id="480">I was 22, and a bunch of my friends, we were buddies, non-jewish fellows. </sentence><sentence id="481">I lived in, I must, I must say I lived in a non-Jewish neighborhood, not totally, but predominantly. </sentence><sentence id="482">Right a--I believe it was on my 22nd birthday. </sentence><sentence id="483">I went to my mother, I said, "You know, I'm going to join the army." </sentence><sentence id="484">She said, "What are you, out of your mind? </sentence><sentence id="485">You can't join the Nazi army!" " </sentence><sentence id="486">Why not? </sentence><sentence id="487">All the other guys do." </sentence><sentence id="488">So, we all signed up at the same time. </sentence><sentence id="489">There was no question asked if I was Jewish or not Jewish, and we all signed up, and I was stationed in a town called Marienburg, it was in East Prussia. </sentence><sentence id="490">This was about 30 kilometers away from a city called Elbing, which was in Gdansk, it's the biggest city in Gdansk, that's exactly what it was. </sentence><sentence id="491">No, I'm sorry, that's cor-incorrect . </sentence><sentence id="492">Gdansk is a city. </sentence><sentence id="493">Elbing is near Gdansk in the same general area. </sentence><sentence id="494">This has got to be voided. </sentence><sentence id="495">This is not...Just start it again. </sentence><sentence id="496">And leave out those, just leave, just use any name---------------------, but start    again on you start again on your 22nd birthday. </sentence><sentence id="497">Yeah, we decided, a bunch of them, we were friends, we decided to join the army, but, I must say that the army was not weapons. </sentence><sentence id="498">We had military training in every aspect, except we had no weapons. </sentence><sentence id="499">We used shovels or spades as shoulder weapons, shoulder arms. </sentence><sentence id="500">Other than that, we had regular military training. </sentence><sentence id="501">Nobody wanted to know that I was Jewish, and uh, I don't know the exact date, we went to, from Marienburg, where I was stationed, to Elbing, a city about 30 kilometers away, where Hitler was to make a speech, and when he spoke, he spoke for 3 hours, like Castro, he can go on forever. </sentence><sentence id="502">I happened to be in the front row of the formation, and as Hitler looked like a, a little person, he's a normal man, short, with a mustache and a hairdo, and perfectly normal. </sentence><sentence id="503">He walked into this hall in Elbing, where he spoke for 3 hours, and when he came back, the man was totally frenzied. </sentence><sentence id="504">He, I, he didn't even, he didn't look any more normal than anything can, you can imagine. </sentence><sentence id="505">He talked himself into a total frenzy. </sentence><sentence id="506">Whenever he made a speech, he was a great orator, he hypnotized the masses. </sentence><sentence id="507">They would have killed their own mother if he said "Go kill "em." </sentence><sentence id="508">He had that ability to hypnotize the people. </sentence><sentence id="509">And I claim a very dubious distinction to be probably the only Jewish fellow that ever stood guard for Hitler. </sentence><sentence id="510">This is true. </sentence><sentence id="511">Do you remember, did you hear the speech?No. </sentence><sentence id="512">It was on speakers, I believe, I, I really am not sure, I don't think we heard it. </sentence><sentence id="513">No, I don't believe so. </sentence><sentence id="514">I don't even know if they had a P.A. system in those days. </sentence><sentence id="515">Do you have any other direct knowledge of Hitler. </sentence><sentence id="516">Did you ever see him any other time?Only on, in normal appearances when he came to the city, you know, when he was riding in a car down the street, like you might see President Bush riding down uh, Commercial Blvd. </sentence><sentence id="517">or something. </sentence><sentence id="518">You know, other than that I had no contact with him. </sentence><sentence id="519">We seen them all, like Goebbels and Herring and Hitler and Goering and all of those people, and Rosenberg, and Hess, but only in passing, when they came to the city to visit. </sentence><sentence id="520">You talked about antisemitism and you talked about being more German or being more Jewish. </sentence><sentence id="521">Talk to me about that. </sentence><sentence id="522">No, I didn't quite mean it that way. </sentence><sentence id="523">To the best of my knowledge, my family has lived and was    born in Germany for 400 years. </sentence><sentence id="524">I, at one time, many years ago, went through a certain procedure with the American Red Cross, and they found out how far we went back in Germany, and while I was always very Jewish, my nationality wasn't Jewish, my nationality was German. </sentence><sentence id="525">I was born there, my parents, grandparents, great grandparents, I don't know how far back. </sentence><sentence id="526">They were all born, as a consequently we weren't Jewish first, we were German first. </sentence><sentence id="527">I must say, I feel the same way about this country today. </sentence><sentence id="528">I'm American first and Jewish second, and I think anyone should be that way. </sentence><sentence id="529">I think you're country comes first. </sentence><sentence id="530">Who was it that said, "My country right or wrong, my country." </sentence><sentence id="531">And that's how I feel about America. </sentence><sentence id="532">And at the time, I didn't know any different. </sentence><sentence id="533">I was in Germany, I was born there and lived there, and I was German. </sentence><sentence id="534">Being Jewish was my religion, which had nothing to do with the nationality at that time. </sentence><sentence id="535">See, we didn't know any different. </sentence><sentence id="536">We didn't make a special point of being Jewish. </sentence><sentence id="537">I was brought up in a Jewish home and all of that, and I went to a Jewish school, but there was no special em--uh, no special emphasis made out of that. </sentence><sentence id="538">It was just a normal way to live. </sentence><sentence id="539">Okay. </sentence><sentence id="540">We have to reload. </sentence><sentence id="541">Wentworth Films; Holocaust; 7-1/2 IPS; 60 cycle sync;

sheep to the slaughter. </sentence><sentence id="545">I'm sure you've heard that. </sentence><sentence id="546">How do you feel about that?Uh, at the time that the actual slaughter happened, I was already in this country. </sentence><sentence id="547">But, I have to refer to a statement I made earlier, when I equate a certain situation with Ethiopia, when Mussolini went in there, and the Ethiopians were fighting with slingshots against tanks. </sentence><sentence id="548">I like to say to the people who make that kind of a statement, that Jews went to the slaughterhouse like sheep. </sentence><sentence id="549">How do you fight machine guns and submachine guns with your bare hands? </sentence><sentence id="550">I'd like, I'd like them to tell me how this can be when you're surrounded by hundreds of storm troopers with heavy weapons, and you stand there naked. </sentence><sentence id="551">Men, women and children in the yard. </sentence><sentence id="552">How do you expect to fight back? </sentence><sentence id="553">That's a very, very foolish statement. </sentence><sentence id="554">They did not go willingly I assure you. </sentence><sentence id="555">That's a very,    very foolish thing to say, and I get very emotional about that, when somebody says that thing. </sentence><sentence id="556">They stand in that yard, naked men, women, and children, surrounded by machine guns and submachine guns, and they, people expect them to fight back? </sentence><sentence id="557">You don't have the strength to fight. </sentence><sentence id="558">You don't have the emotion to fight. </sentence><sentence id="559">You are scared stiff. </sentence><sentence id="560">Believe me, I know what I'm talking about. </sentence><sentence id="561">Those people who make that kind of a statement, they have never been in a situation like this. </sentence><sentence id="562">Ob-ob-obviously otherwise they wouldn't say anything like that. </sentence><sentence id="563">You can't fight that. </sentence><sentence id="564">Whether they wanted to or not. </sentence><sentence id="565">But the fight should have started before, when the world knew from 1932 that antisemitism became very, very strong and, and ultimately they must have known or should have known what will happen. </sentence><sentence id="566">Nobody came to our aid, nobody helped the Jews. </sentence><sentence id="567">They help everybody else, but the Jews, they're very expendable, they don't mean nothing. </sentence><sentence id="568">We had been crossing through----------------5,000 years, and nobody ever came to our help. </sentence><sentence id="569">And those days, certainly, not, the whole world stood by and, I can't believe for a moment, well, I have to make another statement that just came back to me. </sentence><sentence id="570">When the St. Louis, the ship, the St. Louis, and came into Miami Harbor with 856 men, women and children aboard, and our beloved President Roosevelt sent them back to certain death, back to Hamburg. </sentence><sentence id="571">What's the excuse for that? </sentence><sentence id="572">I mean the president couldn't invoke his executive to aid, to save 856 lives? </sentence><sentence id="573">856 lives! </sentence><sentence id="574">In this country of then 132 million people. </sentence><sentence id="575">And they sent them back to certain death. </sentence><sentence id="576">And I know people come and ask me why we didn't fight back. </sentence><sentence id="577">Come on. </sentence><sentence id="578">One thing you said was what a waste of the Nazis did on extermination. </sentence><sentence id="579">What a what they did on?Waste, they wasted, they spent so much effort and intelligence and effort on...Yes, they did. </sentence><sentence id="580">Well, that was the plan after the Wannsee Conference. </sentence><sentence id="581">Prior to that, I don't believe, uh, I don't believe, I'm not sure, I don't believe that it was in the Nazi doctrine to eliminate the Jews as arace. </sentence><sentence id="582">I do believe that they wanted them to leave the country. </sentence><sentence id="583">They didn't want the Jews in Germany, but I don't think the killing was part of their philosophy at the time, that came later. </sentence><sentence id="584">So as long, like in my case for instance, and many, many others, many, many others, I'm certainly not unique in any way, uh (coughs), excuse me. </sentence><sentence id="585">At that time, as I said before, if they wanted you to leave the country, they did let you out. </sentence><sentence id="586">And many people went to, all over the world, they went to, I have cousins that went to China because they had no place else to live, or nobody wanted them, Australia didn't want them, England didn't want them, nobody wanted them. </sentence><sentence id="587">Why? </sentence><sentence id="588">Because we're    Jewish. </sentence><sentence id="589">Eh, nobody wants the Jews, they're filth. </sentence><sentence id="590">It's a terrible thing, but the world is to blame for that, not one govt. </sentence><sentence id="591">I don't believe that the killing was part of their original plan, that came afterwards, I think. </sentence><sentence id="592">No, no way of proving it, it's just my opinion. </sentence><sentence id="593">What happened to your parents? </sentence><sentence id="594">And, do you want to talk about other members of your family?Yes. </sentence><sentence id="595">As I said before, my parents were separated. </sentence><sentence id="596">This was my stepfather. </sentence><sentence id="597">My first, oh yeah, let me give you my life story. </sentence><sentence id="598">My real father I never knew, so I'm the subject of twice-broken home, as actually, it didn't turn out too bad really. </sentence><sentence id="599">My real father I never knew, he left my mother with 3 children and she never heard from him again. </sentence><sentence id="600">I was then 2 years old. </sentence><sentence id="601">I never saw him in my life. </sentence><sentence id="602">I don't what he did, I don't know anything about him. </sentence><sentence id="603">All I know is his name. </sentence><sentence id="604">My mother remarried when I was 7 years old, and there was specific that they did not stay together. </sentence><sentence id="605">They separated when I was, it was after my bar, my bar mitzvah, I'd say I was about 15 years old, so it must have been somewhere around 1925 or so, they separated, and I hadn't seen my father ever in the meantime, except at the time when I got into a concentration camp when I met him. </sentence><sentence id="606">MY mother was killed in Treblinka. </sentence><sentence id="607">She was shot in Treblinka. </sentence><sentence id="608">I know this from 2 sources. </sentence><sentence id="609">First from the Red Cross. </sentence><sentence id="610">Many years ago we made an inquiry from the --------------, actually, not the Red Cross. </sentence><sentence id="611">And I also have a cousin who now lives in Sweden. </sentence><sentence id="612">I'm not sure that he's still alive. </sentence><sentence id="613">He was an electrician and he was in Treblinka also and he saw my mother. </sentence><sentence id="614">He wasn't killed because he was useful, he was an electrician by trade, so he, he stayed alive, and eventually wound up in Sweden. </sentence><sentence id="615">Was married and had children, but I don't know anything about him, but my mother was killed in Treblinka in 1942 I believe. </sentence><sentence id="616">My sister was married, had 2 children. </sentence><sentence id="617">She was killed by bombs. </sentence><sentence id="618">They found her body and they got her the next morning. </sentence><sentence id="619">With her husband and her son. </sentence><sentence id="620">She also had a daughter that by now must be in her 50s, I would imagine, like my children, or maybe a little bit older, but, went somewhere into the farming area, but I don't know anything about it. </sentence><sentence id="621">When we were in Hamburg in 1982, incidentally, it's very interesting, we were invited by the German government all expenses paid, including spending money every day, to come to Germany to see the city again. </sentence><sentence id="622">At first, I didn't want to go. </sentence><sentence id="623">I said, "I don't want any part of this." </sentence><sentence id="624">We were in, well, let me go back a little bit. </sentence><sentence id="625">We were in Switzerland, we went to Israel and Switzerland and Italy and England in 1972. </sentence><sentence id="626">And while we were in Switzerland, we went to Hamburg. </sentence><sentence id="627">Just for one day, my wife wanted to see my mother's grave, and we went to Hamburg. </sentence><sentence id="628">And I cracked up totally .Everything came back to me. </sentence><sentence id="629">I remember, I wanted take a -----------, we got into the hotel room, never forget it, I was terrible, I was terrible, not uh the situation, I was terrible, and the TV wasn't, I didn't know how to put the TV on, and the room, the hotel room, and some German guy you know,   came in and put it on, and he said, "Well, you Americans, you don't know anything." </sentence><sentence id="630">I threw him out of the room, and I became almost wild. </sentence><sentence id="631">Couldn't stand it. </sentence><sentence id="632">We only stayed that one day, so when this 10 years later, when we got the invitation to come back to Germany, I didn't want to go, I said to my wife, "I, L, I, I'm not going to go, I get sick and all that. </sentence><sentence id="633">Then I reconsidered as time went on, I said, "You know, the hell with, we can take side trips, we can go to England, we can go to Switzerland, we can go to Israel. </sentence><sentence id="634">They paid all expenses. </sentence><sentence id="635">The lady that was in charge, I must say, we stayed in a very fine hotel. </sentence><sentence id="636">The lady that was in charge was a very, very nice lady. </sentence><sentence id="637">You could really see that she felt what we went through, and that, I mean, the city of Hamburg had at one time, I don't know, I think 60,000 Jews or something like that, was a big city, 3 million people, we had about 60,000 Jews, there was nothing left, and all the big stores that used to be owned by Jewish people are now, have now been taken over by the Nazi party those days, and eventually probably through generation their father, grandfather now owns it or whatever. </sentence><sentence id="638">And this lady felt very sorry for us, she, they, I asked her, "What's the purpose of inviting us? </sentence><sentence id="639">Do you expect anyone to change his mind to come back to live here after living in America for 50 years?" </sentence><sentence id="640">She says, "No, no. </sentence><sentence id="641">That's not really the purpose. </sentence><sentence id="642">It is perhaps, to ease our conscience a bit.". </sentence><sentence id="643">That was her statement. </sentence><sentence id="644">We stayed there for I think 10 days, it was very nice, really very nice, the city of Hamburg is beautiful city. </sentence><sentence id="645">It was 75% destroyed, and after war, through the Marshall Plan, naturally American money, we built it up again into beautiful city, it really is a very beautiful city. </sentence><sentence id="646">Thank you. </sentence><sentence id="647">I asked everything I wanted. </sentence><sentence id="648">Thank You. </sentence><sentence id="649">All right. </sentence><sentence id="650">We have to do one other thing. </sentence><sentence id="651">We have to, actually we can't do it till the coffee stops perking, probably, thank you very much. </sentence><sentence id="652">Your welcome. </sentence><sentence id="653">I hope L..It was very....The following will be 30 seconds of room tone for interview with Edward Adler. </sentence><sentence
