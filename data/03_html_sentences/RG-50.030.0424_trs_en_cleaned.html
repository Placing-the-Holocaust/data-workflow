and I didn't eat, nothing. </sentence><sentence id="1212">We wanted to see the end of the war. </sentence><sentence id="1213">And I was laying there underneath and then a guy -- we couldn't get up. </sentence><sentence id="1214">It was underneath. </sentence><sentence id="1215">You couldn't stand up, nothing. </sentence><sentence id="1216">You had to lay there and one guy comes to me on his stomach, comes closer to me and he says, "Show me your hand." </sentence><sentence id="1217">And I showed him my hand and he started to do it like this and he started to do it like this, and I show him. </sentence><sentence id="1218">He said, "You know something, I think I don't have a watch. </sentence><sentence id="1219">We don't have watches, but roughly I would say about a half an hour we will be liberated." </sentence><sentence id="1220">I heard this, I thought to myself, what he's crazy!How does he know. </sentence><sentence id="1221">And it was I should say about a half an hour and I hear screaming, hurray and this and that and we came out. </sentence><sentence id="1222">We came out. </sentence><sentence id="1223">There were Hungarian people but they came over to that person who told me that in half an hour we'll be liberated. </sentence><sentence id="1224">It came out that he was a rabbi from Budapest. </sentence><sentence id="1225">They start to kiss him, to grab him, the Hungarian people. </sentence><sentence id="1226">Then, came into the block, a rabbi , he was an officer in the Seventh Army. </sentence><sentence id="1227">He wrote a book, "I Liberated Buchenwald." </sentence><sentence id="1228">That was him, and he came to our block with two Jewish soldiers. </sentence><sentence id="1229">They start to talk Jewish to us. </sentence><sentence id="1230">Now he wrote that book, "I Liberated Buchenwald" and he was in my synagogue as my rabbi invited him, and he had a speech. </sentence><sentence id="1231">He told the story that he liberated Buchenwald, what happened, and he said, "Is somebody here that was in Buchenwald?" </sentence><sentence id="1232"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection And I stood up and I raised my arm. </sentence><sentence id="1233">He said, "Oh, come on up." </sentence><sentence id="1234">I went to the stage and he says, "See, I have a live witness." </sentence><sentence id="1235">I said "Yes, rabbi, you're looking pretty good, you look good and that time you looking pretty good I recognize you. </sentence><sentence id="1236">You liberated my block. </sentence><sentence id="1237">You came into my block and that was block number one, it says it right on the corner." </sentence><sentence id="1238">And he says, "Yes." </sentence><sentence id="1239">So, he was a guest in my synagogue. </sentence><sentence id="1240">So, this was at that time the end actually of the war. </sentence><sentence id="1241">They find a lot of German soldiers on the towers. </sentence><sentence id="1242">They took them off and they took them away. </sentence><sentence id="1243">What they did with them, the Americans, that was very, very interesting. </sentence><sentence id="1244">What happened, I was looking to do something, to go out. </sentence><sentence id="1245">To do something, I didn't know what to do. </sentence><sentence id="1246">And I walked, walked with the two brothers that were in the same block. </sentence><sentence id="1247">We walked in the direction of in the city where Hitler built his Nazi party there. </sentence><sentence id="1248">I started to sing "Where shall I go, where shall I go." </sentence><sentence id="1249">I started to sing in Jewish , and I started to sing this song and a German woman heard me singing and she pulled me into the house. </sentence><sentence id="1250">She invited me, she wanted me to sleep over there, but I didn't want it. </sentence><sentence id="1251">I didn't know what was going to happen here. </sentence><sentence id="1252">We had to stay in the place, but she gave me to eat. </sentence><sentence id="1253">At that time she says "You're singing very nice. </sentence><sentence id="1254">I like your singing. </sentence><sentence id="1255">What are singing?" </sentence><sentence id="1256">So, then I had to go back. </sentence><sentence id="1257">I went back and the Seventh Army organized us and then they put us on trains and we went to Landsberg, our group went to Landsberg, which that was before a German camp and the Americans took away from them. </sentence><sentence id="1258">They should have a place where to put us in. </sentence><sentence id="1259">So, we went there and we lived there and the room where I was I had about six or seven people sleep in there, two beds. </sentence><sentence id="1260">That's the place where I met my wife, through somebody. </sentence><sentence id="1261">That's the camp I was and I took, I had a job at that time, they give me a big job I should take care that the camp should be clean. </sentence><sentence id="1262">I took over this job, to take care, to be the manager, that the camp should be clean. </sentence><sentence id="1263">Clean the steps, rooms and everything. </sentence><sentence id="1264">Then I took over, which I have the picture I think with me. </sentence><sentence id="1265">General Lucius Clay came into the camp and I started to look and he liked the job that I did, and there was a chief of police, which he didn't want to be anymore the chief of the police. </sentence><sentence id="1266">He went to the United States. </sentence><sentence id="1267">He went through the trouble to go to America. </sentence><sentence id="1268">I took over as an assistant from him his job which Lucius Clay gave me the job. </sentence><sentence id="1269">I have the picture here. </sentence><sentence id="1270">I think I should have the picture here with another fellow, which he was a sergeant with me. </sentence><sentence id="1271">We made a picture and the guy who introduced me to my wife. </sentence><sentence id="1272">He was in the picture. </sentence><sentence id="1273">He was in the police department. </sentence><sentence id="1274">It's a fact that he's in Israel now and here I think a sewing factory. </sentence><sentence id="1275">I was looking up for the other sergeant who I was with him, I went to New York and I came to the United States and I couldn't find him. </sentence><sentence id="1276">I was looking for him. </sentence><sentence id="1277">I couldn't find him. </sentence><sentence id="1278">Q.

No, they grabbed a few of them. </sentence><sentence id="1282">Actually, they didn't do anything. </sentence><sentence id="1283">What could they do with them. </sentence><sentence id="1284">They gave them to the Americans, to the Seventh Army, to the soldiers. </sentence><sentence id="1285">Whatever they did with them, I don't know. </sentence><sentence id="1286">They actually, they didn't kill them right away, right there, with machine guns. </sentence><sentence id="1287">Whatever happens with them, they just got them and that's it, as prisoners. </sentence><sentence id="1288">Q. Did the American soldiers feed you? </sentence><sentence id="1289">Did they give you medical --?A. Yes. </sentence><sentence id="1290">They took maybe not even an hour, trucks came into that camp with a lot, a lot of food, all kinds of food. </sentence><sentence id="1291">It's a fact that people were eating so much that they would die and they would choke themselves and they died from overeating. </sentence><sentence id="1292">That's what happened right there, right in Buchenwald. </sentence><sentence id="1293">That's how much food they got. </sentence><sentence id="1294">They give us plenty to eat, plenty, from everything. </sentence><sentence id="1295">Yes, they bring in medicines and everything, doctors, everything. </sentence><sentence id="1296">It didn't take long. </sentence><sentence id="1297">Q. Did you go through a process. </sentence><sentence id="1298">I mean did they clean you, did they delouse you, any of that kind of thing?A.

How long were you in Buchenwald after liberation before you went to Landsberg?A. A short time. </sentence><sentence id="1303">Q. A few weeks or a few days?A. Not a few days, the same day they took us away. </sentence><sentence id="1304">We didn't go back to the barracks to sleep. </sentence><sentence id="1305">Oh no, it was finished. </sentence><sentence id="1306">I don't know if everybody went to Landsberg. </sentence><sentence id="1307">Some of them went to Salzheim, you know. </sentence><sentence id="1308">They separated two groups I think. </sentence><sentence id="1309">Q. Do you remember how you were feeling when you got liberated?A. Like I was liberated?Q. How you were feeling?A. The feeling was -- I had a bad feeling, I had nobody. </sentence><sentence id="1310">I lost the whole family. </sentence><sentence id="1311">That's what I was thinking. </sentence><sentence id="1312">That was the first thing, that I was left alone. </sentence><sentence id="1313">That was the worst thing to me. </sentence><sentence id="1314">So, I suppose to go at that time to Treblinka on the train and you see I was one of the lucky ones, but how good is it that I lost a whole family. </sentence><sentence id="1315">I was left alone. </sentence><sentence id="1316">Q. Did you have thoughts about trying to go back to Warsaw and find people?A. Actually I wanted to go back to Warsaw to find out, you know, but I knew, I knew that I wouldn't find anybody. </sentence><sentence id="1317">I knew what happened with them. </sentence><sentence id="1318">They were all dead. </sentence><sentence id="1319">The only thing that I was thinking was maybe go back to Warsaw and ask, maybe go to the government and    maybe they have some records or something, but my brother, that was the only thing. </sentence><sentence id="1320">But I figured, who am I going to ask. </sentence><sentence id="1321">You see, the Germans, they destroyed the documents. </sentence><sentence id="1322">They destroyed everything. </sentence><sentence id="1323">No records. </sentence><sentence id="1324">So, I didn't want to go back, but I went back but it was with my group, with my synagogue, my rabbi. </sentence><sentence id="1325">We went back now about three years ago. </sentence><sentence id="1326">We went back to Warsaw and that's all. </sentence><sentence id="1327">Q. Before we talk about Landsberg, is there anything else you want to add about Buchenwald?A. Yes. </sentence><sentence id="1328">The last few days in Buchenwald before the end of the war, I had to go to work. </sentence><sentence id="1329">They took me out to work and I worked in a certain place there and we had a guard, a German soldier with the machine gun watching us, we should run away. </sentence><sentence id="1330">We were working there and one guy was sick and tired, he couldn't take it anymore. </sentence><sentence id="1331">So, what happened, they had the rule at that time, the Germans, if you walked away from the place where you worked, say you worked in this area. </sentence><sentence id="1332">When you start to walk away 50 feet the soldier had the right to shoot the person, to kill him. </sentence><sentence id="1333">So, that guy, one guy was tired. </sentence><sentence id="1334">He didn't care. </sentence><sentence id="1335">He started to walk away from the place where he did the work. </sentence><sentence id="1336">So, that German soldier who was watching us went to that guy. </sentence><sentence id="1337">He walked about ten, fifteen feet away already and he wanted to start to walk, so he started to walk, so that soldier walked over to him and he says to him, "Why are you walking away from the place where you work. </sentence><sentence id="1338">You know I have the right to shoot you if you walk 50 feet away from the place you work." </sentence><sentence id="1339">He says, "I don't care. </sentence><sentence id="1340">Shoot me. </sentence><sentence id="1341">I'm sick and tired of it already. </sentence><sentence id="1342">I want to die." </sentence><sentence id="1343">He says, "You're foolish. </sentence><sentence id="1344">The war will take another few days. </sentence><sentence id="1345">It's going to be the end of the war. </sentence><sentence id="1346">Why do you do this. </sentence><sentence id="1347">Don't do this. </sentence><sentence id="1348">Come back." </sentence><sentence id="1349">And he walked back to the place. </sentence><sentence id="1350">That was very nice from that soldier to tell him that. </sentence><sentence id="1351">He didn't want to shoot him. </sentence><sentence id="1352">He didn't want to kill him. </sentence><sentence id="1353">It's a fact that a few days later it was the end of the war. </sentence><sentence id="1354"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection Q.

Was there a time when you were more afraid than another time or not?A. I tell you about the same. </sentence><sentence id="1403">You could never tell what the Germans are going to do next, what they're going to do next. </sentence><sentence id="1404">It was very hard to predict things like that. </sentence><sentence id="1405">Nothing good. </sentence><sentence id="1406">You couldn't predict nothing good. </sentence><sentence id="1407">Everything bad. </sentence><sentence id="1408">Q.
