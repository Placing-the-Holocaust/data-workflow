<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="11">A: I was born in 1934. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="13">Q: And could you tell us a little bit about your life before the war. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="15">A: My life before the war was very, very nice. </sentence><sentence id="16">I remember living in a very nice house, actually an apartment on the Pest side of Budapest. </sentence><sentence id="17">You probably know the city is divided by the Danube and the part that I lived in we had mostly apartment houses as opposed to the other part which was private homes. </sentence><sentence id="18">And I was...uh...besides my parents, obviously, I had...uh...nannies and governesses and we led a very, very comfortable life with lots of vacations and...uh.. parties and I went to elementary school. </sentence><sentence id="19">And... uh...in school we had...uh...we had religious education in the public school system...uh...besides the languages, arts, geography, history and math, everybody went to their own religious classes during that particular period so as Jewish children went to a class where a Rabbi taught Jewish history, Hebrew, whatever. </sentence><sentence id="20">Catholics went to Catholic class and Protestants went to Protestant class and everybody mingled and got along very well and I was never aware of Jewish or not Jewish or anything else pertaining to religion until much later. </sentence><sentence id="21">And until 1944, which was when I was 10 years old, I really don't recall anything particularly disrupting my life. </sentence><sentence id="22">In retrospect, now I understand that many things were going on since 1939. </sentence><sentence id="23">I was aware that my father was in labor camp, but I thought that was just being a soldier and he always came back. </sentence><sentence id="24">Uh...He went several times and came back and I...my mother did go help my father...run my father's business. </sentence><sentence id="25">My father was in paper...wholesale paper manufacturing business. </sentence><sentence id="26">Uh...But otherwise I, personally, was not aware of having to be afraid or being concerned until 1944. </sentence><sentence id="27">And that was a particularly special day in my life because my birthday is March 18th and I was having my 10th birthday party in my...my home with all my friends. </sentence><sentence id="28">They were really my parents" friends, children who I was brought up with, as well as some of the mothers and a lot of the nannies or governesses. </sentence><sentence id="29">And it was an early evening party of hot dogs, and...uh...we lived on a fairly main street. </sentence><sentence id="30">We heard marching of soldiers and we looked out the window and the German  army at that point, to my recall, was occupying Budapest. </sentence><sentence id="31">Hungary was the last of the Eastern European countries to be occupied. </sentence><sentence id="32">Poland and the other countries had already had German troops in them. </sentence><sentence id="33">And everybody started running around and there went my party. </sentence><sentence id="34">Everybody went home. </sentence><sentence id="35">And the reason being that they were all afraid and that the Germans at that time were occupying Budapest and...uh...that's when our whole world really fell apart. </sentence><sentence id="36">Uh... There were a lot of negotiations. </sentence><sentence id="37">I didn't really know what was going on. </sentence><sentence id="38">Everybody tried to keep the children from worrying and...uh...we lived in...uh...a designated house that was called the Jewish house...uh... which happened to have been the building which we were in. </sentence><sentence id="39">What that meant is that several houses, apartment houses, were designated Jewish houses where the Christians had the option to stay or go. </sentence><sentence id="40">In a Jewish house, the Jews stayed and the ones that were not the Jewish houses, the Jews had to leave. </sentence><sentence id="41">Also we had a fairly large apartment, and we were only allowed to live in one room. </sentence><sentence id="42">But because my father was fairly active in the Jewish community, we were able to pick the families to move into all the other rooms. </sentence><sentence id="43">So we had friends and family move in. </sentence><sentence id="44">Uh...My parents" bedroom because our...our room. </sentence><sentence id="45">We had friends in the living room and somebody else in the dining room and somebody else in my...in my old room. </sentence><sentence id="46">Uh...That's when I first was aware of the fact that things were not quite the same. </sentence><sentence id="47">Also, one of the laws that came to pass at the time was that Jews could not have help, servants or whatever you want to call them. </sentence><sentence id="48">And...uh...so all our so-called staff, which consisted of my governess and a cook and a maid, had to leave. </sentence><sentence id="49">Uh... </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="85">Q: What were the sanitary facilities like? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="87">A: Uh... Well, it was difficult because we had bathrooms and all that but it was a...it was really really interesting from a child's point of view. </sentence><sentence id="88">It was a time of sharing and pulling together. </sentence><sentence id="89">I was an only child, so I thought it was just terrific to have all these children running around and I was always brought up very properly, to behave myself and speak when I was spoken to, and here they were all these people running around. </sentence><sentence id="90">And one of my father's very good friends who was a lawyer and had a great deal of...a tremendous sense of humor wrote poetry for the bathroom, to the effect that the men were to put the toilet seats down after use and all sorts of funny things. </sentence><sentence id="91">We just thought that this was great fun and we played jokes...uh...on the grownups and...uh...but things did progressively get worse because... And one of my first personal experiences as a child was when a little girl who lived in the building, who stayed in the building...all the Gentiles chose to stay in the building in their own apartments, but they kept the whole apartment. </sentence><sentence id="92">And one little girl said...I asked if I could play with her in that afternoon as we usually had, and she said no, she couldn't play with me. </sentence><sentence id="93">I said, "Well, how about tomorrow?" </sentence><sentence id="94">And she said, "No, she can't play with me tomorrow either." </sentence><sentence id="95">And I said, "Well, why not?" </sentence><sentence id="96">And she said, "Because you're Jewish." </sentence><sentence id="97">And I said, "Well, I don't really understand what that means or what does that have to do with  anything anyhow." </sentence><sentence id="98">And she said well, she didn't know either, but her parents said that she couldn't play with a Jewish child." </sentence><sentence id="99">So... </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="113">Q: What was a typical day like for you? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="115">A: Well, by this time we weren't going to school. </sentence><sentence id="116">We were only ...Jews were only allowed to shop and market in the stores late in the afternoon. </sentence><sentence id="117">They were only allowed on the street ..uh...for an hour or so, when the produce and most of the stuff was gone and what was there was not terrific. </sentence><sentence id="118">Uh...my father would go to the Jewish Community Center to see what he could do. </sentence><sentence id="119">Uh...My father was a prominent person in the Jewish community so that the wealthy Jews still had some influence and were able to do such things, such as acquiring the...the Star for our building to remain in our house and...uh...to get much more information than we would have gotten otherwise. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="125">Q: Tell us about the Star. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="127">A: There was a Star outside the house that designated being a Jewish building so anybody that would pass by that was not Jewish building would know that this was a Jewish Star...Jewish house and...uh...the Jews had to wear yellow Stars. </sentence><sentence id="128">Had to be exactly put on each item of clothes as a certain measurement that had to be...and it had to be put on the left upper shoulder of each garment. </sentence><sentence id="129">In other words, that when you went out on the street, you should always be identified and if somebody wanted to spit on you, kick you, shoot you, take you away, that's what you were to do. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="133">Q: Did you go out on the streets? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="135">A: Yes, I did go out on the streets. </sentence><sentence id="136">We did go out. </sentence><sentence id="137">I have this...my...my little boyfriend who is 11, and he and I would go out and do some stuff in the neighborhood. </sentence><sentence id="138">We would also buy newspapers and sell them within the building. </sentence><sentence id="139">And...uh...we also, I remember...nobody in my family smoked, but people did. </sentence><sentence id="140">Europeans smoked a lot. </sentence><sentence id="141">And we would pick up cigarette butts from everybody...wherever we could find them, take out the leftover tobacco and roll them in tissue paper. </sentence><sentence id="142">I have no idea where we got the tissue paper. </sentence><sentence id="143">And sell them to the smokers, because there was a shortage of all things. </sentence><sentence id="144">And so having this and, of course, the fact that we were children everybody bought it for us and we decided that we would support our parents because we did realize that nobody was working. </sentence><sentence id="145">And I'm not sure we supported them, but it was again great fun. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="157">Q: Did you have any frightening instances on the street? </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="158">A: No, I never had any frightening instances on the street. </sentence><sentence id="159">No. </sentence><sentence id="160">Uh...I did have...uh...a lot of fun things in the... in the apartment as a I said because we were friends and we had all the people. </sentence><sentence id="161">We played tricks on people and stuff like that. </sentence><sentence id="162">But, it was getting to be frightening because you ...you had sense of doom. </sentence><sentence id="163">You had a sense that there was... there was a lot of whispering going on, and sometimes not knowing what is going on is almost as bad as sharing and being told that okay, these are the things that can happen. </sentence><sentence id="164">Uh...There were a lot of trucks...uh...obviously, going on the street with lots of people in it, and everybody was making up stories about where they were going. </sentence><sentence id="165">Labor camp, to the country, all sorts of things, but it was...it was getting obvious even at my age that people were being picked up, but I didn't know why. </sentence><sentence id="166">And this lasted from about the middle of March until...uh...the fall in October. </sentence><sentence id="167">And in October, the Jewish houses did no longer protect the people that were there. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="178">Uh...my parents were able to...uh...get the Wallenberg protection papers. </sentence><sentence id="179">Raoul Wallenberg, under the Swedish king, was able to protect and save a lot of people. </sentence><sentence id="180">They were designated Swedish houses, protectorates, where they claimed that Jews could be saved and we did go to such a house...uh...for one night and they had hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of people. </sentence><sentence id="181">I don't know how many. </sentence><sentence id="182">But my parents decided that there were just two many Jews under one roof and if the...if the Germans really wanted to get rid of a whole bunch at a time, we would be better off going somewhere else where...where it would not be so obvious that we're together. </sentence><sentence id="183">I think that night that we left our home in October was the first time that I was really scared and I think that was the experience that, as a young adult, stayed with me for a long time. </sentence><sentence id="184">I was very attached to a pillow that I carried. </sentence><sentence id="185">We had no suitcases to take with us because we had to travel light. </sentence><sentence id="186">Uh...we were dressed, all of us, in several layers of clothes so as to have some warmth and have some change and I did take my pillow. </sentence><sentence id="187">And...uh...I also had long...long hair. </sentence><sentence id="188">I had long braids which were cut in case the sanitary facilities were non existent and I shouldn't get lice. </sentence><sentence id="189">And I remember asking my parents...uh...where're we going to sleep that night. </sentence><sentence id="190">And my parents said, "We didn't know." </sentence><sentence id="191">We were just hoping that somebody would take us in. </sentence><sentence id="192">I said, "But we have to have a bed. </sentence><sentence id="193">We have to sleep." </sentence><sentence id="194">And that was really very upsetting and as I said that took me a long time. </sentence><sentence id="195">I always like to know where I'm going to sleep. </sentence><sentence id="196">I don't like to go. </sentence><sentence id="197">I have to know where my bed is going to be. </sentence><sentence id="198">And we went to somebody's house who took us in for one night, that night, and again everybody whispered and it was really scary. </sentence><sentence id="199">People were being picked up on the street. </sentence><sentence id="200">And from then on, we went to several places. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="224">Q: Did you actually see people being picked up? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="226">A: Yes. </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="227">Q: And what were your thoughts as a child? </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="228">A: That I didn't know where they were going, and I didn't really get a lot of answers. </sentence><sentence id="229">I mean I was asking questions, but I guess my parents were...this was not the time for the truth. </sentence><sentence id="230">It was just time for me to be quiet and do what I was told. </sentence><sentence id="231">I remember very distinctly once taking issue with something that I had seen, and my mother gave me a very stern lecture and she said that if she says it's black and if I know that it is white, but if she said that it is black, it is black and I am never, ever to question because that's how people get killed. </sentence><sentence id="232">And this was not a time that people came up and said, "Are you Jewish," and my parents obviously were going to say no, and if I would have answered, "Oh, yes, we are Jewish. </sentence><sentence id="233">Why are you telling a lie?" </sentence><sentence id="234">That could get you into a lot of trouble. </sentence><sentence id="235">So I was really at a very young age told...was told to just do what I'm told and not to ask questions. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="244">Q: Were you still wearing your star? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="246">A: No. </sentence><sentence id="247">No. </sentence><sentence id="248">At this time we were so serious. </sentence><sentence id="249">This was not admitting to being a Jew. </sentence><sentence id="250">This was hiding...uh...and my mother did not look Jewish. </sentence><sentence id="251">My father did. </sentence><sentence id="252">And, of course, it's very easy to determine if a man is Jewish or isn't, especially in those days so that my mother always did all the talking. </sentence><sentence id="253">And...uh...she was very competent and very strong willed and...uh...was able to handle these situations. </sentence><sentence id="254">We did go to somebody's house where we stayed for two weeks. </sentence><sentence id="255">Uh...A man worked for my father and my father gave him the position as superintendent of one of the houses, apartment houses, that my father owned, and he let us stay in the basement...uh...for a couple of days, and brought us food whenever he could. </sentence><sentence id="256">And a very nice family who I think was aware that something that was going on, told the superintendent...uh...that they were going to be away for quite awhile and sort of insinuating that without their knowledge but it's okay, if we stayed in their apartment. </sentence><sentence id="257">Uh...I don't think we ever met them, but that's what the superintendent told us, that it's okay for us to be taken to this spot. </sentence><sentence id="258">He would bring us a tray. </sentence><sentence id="259">There was a radio. </sentence><sentence id="260">Uh...We listened to...uh...Radio Free Europe, and this lady happened to have had the best collection of child...of children's books, and I remember reading Little Lord Fauntleroy and a lot of the children's classics. </sentence><sentence id="261">I remember that very well. </sentence><sentence id="262">I was a avid reader, and that was the only place during the war that there were books that I read. </sentence><sentence id="263">I used to remember taking a bath. </sentence><sentence id="264">I was too hot and I almost passed out. </sentence><sentence id="265">And one of the things that happened that I recall very clearly...and it's interesting because my mother just finished her interview and she didn't mention it...my father was having a kidney stone attack or had...we thought he had a kidney stone, and he was having an attack. </sentence><sentence id="266">And he had no choice. </sentence><sentence id="267">He had to go to a doctor. </sentence><sentence id="268">So he went and he left...uh...quite late in the afternoon so as...so as to be dark and my mother and I sat there wondering if he would ever return, if he was going to be caught or what. </sentence><sentence id="269">But he had to go because he had I guess ...I'm not sure but he must have had a kidney problem  before because the choice was not to stay. </sentence><sentence id="270">It was not going to go away. </sentence><sentence id="271">Anyhow, he returned. </sentence><sentence id="272">I don't know what happened to the kidney or the stone, but he came back. </sentence><sentence id="273">And from then on, we went to a place in the country, a very beautiful house. </sentence><sentence id="274">And by this time, there was a lot of bombing going on because the Russians and Americans were bombing. </sentence><sentence id="275">The Germans were starting to lose the war, so their interest in the Jews were getting less except if they happened to see any, they shot them. </sentence><sentence id="276">But I mean, it was not as active involvement in killing the Jews as to save their necks because they were losing the war. </sentence><sentence id="277">I remember somebody being shot. </sentence><sentence id="278">I think it was a Russian or a German. </sentence><sentence id="279">I'm not sure. </sentence><sentence id="280">But I know there was a dead body, and somebody went out and stole their shoes or whatever they could off the body. </sentence><sentence id="281">But I don't really remember the details. </sentence><sentence id="282">I just know that this was a body and people went and stole things off the body because peple were now at this point didn't have shoes, didn't have clothes. </sentence><sentence id="283">The food situation was terrible. </sentence><sentence id="284">And I was an obnoxious, terrible eater. </sentence><sentence id="285">I still am. </sentence><sentence id="286">I don't eat if I don't like it. </sentence><sentence id="287">And most of the children just ate whatever there was to eat, including horsemeat off dead horses, but I was not having anything to do with that. </sentence><sentence id="288">So I had a hard time being fed because sometimes when something was found that was edible I save it up for a week and chop up little pieces of it and I would just eat it because I wouldn't eat if I didn't like it. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="332">Q: What was your contact with other children then? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="334">A: Very little. </sentence><sentence id="335">At one point, we were being hidden and there was another child there. </sentence><sentence id="336">And that's when I was told that I was not to say that we were in hiding, that we were friends of the family. </sentence><sentence id="337">And I really don't remember too much about that. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="342">Q: What were the living conditions at that point? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="344">A: Terrible. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="348">A: We slept on the floor...on beds...as groups of people, together. </sentence><sentence id="349">I don't remember the sanitary conditions as far as baths or showers. </sentence><sentence id="350">I remember my mother mending things when they were torn. </sentence><sentence id="351">Wearing the same dress, you know, over and over again. </sentence><sentence id="352">Sometimes rinsing things out in little pails if there was enough time for it to dry to wear again. </sentence><sentence id="353">And then as the bombing got worse and worse, we moved. </sentence><sentence id="354">We didn't move, we walked to the countryside. </sentence><sentence id="355">I wouldn't call it a suburb. </sentence><sentence id="356">It was really countryside, village, peasants, a lot of poor people lived there. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="366">Q: Before we go into that, is there any story about your mother making a cake? </sentence><sentence id="367"> A Oh, yes. </sentence><sentence id="368">This is as a matter of fact happened in the country. </sentence><sentence id="369">I was, as I said, a very bad eater and my mother, some way or other...out on a walk, saw some people that had some food and stole an egg. </sentence><sentence id="370">And out of this egg, she whipped up a I guess what you could call yellow cake thing and there was the one egg and I guess she had the other ingredients. </sentence><sentence id="371">So I ate that for a very, very long time. </sentence><sentence id="372">And then this...this was in the country and there was a lot of bombing going on. </sentence><sentence id="373">It was sort of getting towards the end of the war. </sentence><sentence id="374">We all slept on the floor. </sentence><sentence id="375">Usually I slept between my parents. </sentence><sentence id="376">The toilets there I remember, they were on the outside. </sentence><sentence id="377">We used to take trips to go to...to an outhouse kind of a thing. </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="378">Q: About how many people were with you? </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="500">Q: Any question of conversion for you? </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="524">Q: What was the attitude of priests and nuns during your classes and learning? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="526">A: Fine. </sentence><sentence id="527">They were happy to convert, and I guess they were hoping maybe ultimately that people would remain. </sentence><sentence id="528">And a lot did. </sentence><sentence id="529">A lot of people who came to this country when we came...families of my parents I knew had converted when they came to this country, raised their children as non-Jews. </sentence><sentence id="530">Well, we always remained Jewish and after the war was over the paper that was just a piece paper that may have saved our lives at the time, but it probably wouldn't have. </sentence><sentence id="531">So it sort of served its purpose. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="634">Q: What kind of shelters did you go to? </sentence></p></dialogue>
