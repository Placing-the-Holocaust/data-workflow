<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="46">Q: Do you remember the circumstance of when you sort of first became aware of your mother's experience during the war, when you realized she was a Holocaust survivor, although at that time you would not have thought about it in those terms, probably. </sentence></p></dialogue>
