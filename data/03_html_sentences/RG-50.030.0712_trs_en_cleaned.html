</sentence><sentence id="142">They died of malnutrition probably, and they were older so didn't see too much of them after that. </sentence><sentence id="143">You know, after the war started, we didn't see too much of them. </sentence><sentence id="144">So that's basically -- I didn't start -- when the Soviets occupied the Bukovina, when it was annexed, wasn't occupied, they would like to say it was annexed, in 1940, I started school, in Russian school. </sentence><sentence id="145">Now, I -- to roll back, when my dad used to come home for -- for his -- the midday meal, then he would lie -- lie down, I guess it was a couch. </sentence><sentence id="146">I know he was -- he lied down and I lied down right alongside of him. </sentence><sentence id="147">Had my head on the -- sort of under his arm. </sentence><sentence id="148">I learned to read. </sentence><sentence id="149">I learned to read. </sentence><sentence id="150">We spoke German at home, but I had learned to read

id="152">And when I didn't learn from -- when I was reading the paper with my dad would -- what I didn't learn, I sort of translated myself, you know, like -- I remember an example that my family had

and obers is a colonel. </sentence><sentence id="154">That's the -- so I had translated  http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection

came for the weekend and was -- was telling my parent -- my mother and the grandparents that the maids -- they were usually Ukrainian or Lithuanian, and they -- that there -- there is unrest, that there is hooliganism. </sentence><sentence id="156">But I mean it was abstract. </sentence><sentence id="157">It wasn't -- nothing had happened to us or to our house kind of thing. </sentence><sentence id="158">But there was some cloud on the horizon. </sentence><sentence id="159">And in 1940, the -- the Soviet marched in. </sentence><sentence id="160">It wasn't -- it wasn't like Army takeover. </sentence><sentence id="161">It was -- they just sort of marched in. </sentence><sentence id="162">It was by agreement, although they had bombed, apparently, the airport. </sentence><sentence id="163">So it was sort of different but much the same. </sentence><sentence id="164">The -- the Soviet -- the Auto Matoro was eviscerated. </sentence><sentence id="165">And my dad, they wanted -- some town father or whatever these people had as commanders wanted my dad to be the accountant for Meloche (ph) Trust. </sentence><sentence id="166">In -- in the Soviet Union, in communistic structures, everything is a trust. </sentence><sentence id="167">It's the milk trust and the - - the shoe trust and the -- so Meloche Trust was the dairy trust, and my dad became the accountant and chief financial officer for the dairy trust. </sentence><sentence id="168">And, you know, we basically went on the same. </sentence><sentence id="169">I started school. </sentence><sentence id="170">I don't remember whether it was kindergarten or first grade. </sentence><sentence id="171">I mean I don't know that I would have been able to tell the difference actually. </sentence><sentence id="172">But it was Russian and -- My parents entertained some -- I remember my parents entertained some -- somebody from the company, some people from the company, Russians, and the guys were amazed how people lived, you know, the beauty, what they considered luxury. </sentence><sentence id="173">I mean we were upper middle class people, but we weren't by no means rich. </sentence><sentence id="174">Just well off, I guess, comfortable off, whatever. </sentence><sentence id="175">And he -- he was just amazed at how people lived. </sentence><sentence

compelled to answer, so he said, "Yeah, this is all nice, but they call us dirty Jews." </sentence><sentence id="179">So he said, "Well, you can call me anything you want as long as you feed me honey." </sentence><sentence id="180">So that was sort of a -- an indication of -- of a perception of what they had, you know. </sentence><sentence id="181">But other than that, the year went uneventful again, and you went to school and you -- my Uncle Jupiter was not too {Coughs} excited about it because he was a businessman. </sentence><sentence id="182">He - - he did international business with -- with Austria and Germany and France, and he couldn't do that. </sentence><sentence id="183">So he was not too excited but, you know, he had to put up and shut up, basically. </sentence><sentence id="184">And when the Naz -- on July 21, 1941, the war started. </sentence><sentence id="185">I mean Nazis invaded. </sentence><sentence id="186">Actually, rolling back, in "39 I

and the physicians and the businessmen. </sentence><sentence id="192">And we were permitted to stay in town, and Uncle Jupiter was permitted to stay in town, and so were -- so was my uncle, my father's brother. </sentence><sentence id="193">And so we were home but -- and then these people that had gone to the ghetto -- so, there is -- apparently there was a list that they put people on, and these people could stay in their homes. </sentence><sentence id="194">And those that had been put in the ghetto, some were transported to Transnistria, and some were allowed to go home and they would have transports later on. </sentence><sentence id="195">Well, we never went so, you know, we were considered not at risk. </sentence><sentence id="196">And this was like in September or in the fall. </sentence><sentence id="197">And the next -- so after the winter, the next deportation -- these were deportations, by the way, they were. </sentence><sentence id="198">The next deportations -- I didn't go to school. </sentence><sentence id="199">My brother didn't go to school. </sentence><sentence id="200">I had a non-Jewish friend that I met in dancing school, and then in the year -- her name was Adele Havriluk. </sentence><sentence id="201">Her father was a prominent attorney. </sentence><sentence id="202">And then in that one year of schooling that was either kindergarten or first grade, I don't know which one, and they -- they used to come over and bring me school work. </sentence><sentence id="203">And so to keep me in touch with school work, and -- and bring stuff for my brother. </sentence><sentence id="204">So then in the -- the next deportations were ordered to take place in June of 1942, and they were to be -- to take place on three consecutive Sundays. </sentence><sentence id="205">Oh, my dad -- my dad had a job, so Uncle -- he worked in Uncle Jupiter's business of -- of food transport, had something to do with eggs and stuff. </sentence><sentence id="206">And my dad would travel with Uncle Jupiter every weekend. </sentence><sentence id="207">He would come home every weekend. </sentence><sentence id="208">He would travel every Monday, go there.

third Sunday -- and I had, in fact, said goodbye to some neighbor girl that I knew, whose name | don't even remember, but I know [ had said goodbye to somebody. </sentence><sentence id="213">But the third Sunday, Uncle Jupiter had sent a chauffeur. </sentence><sentence id="214">So Jews couldn't be out, but he -- he could send a chauffeur. </sentence><sentence id="215">And my dad had come back on Friday. </sentence><sentence id="216">He had -- he went to the bank or he picked up money, had a briefcase full of money, real money, two hundred -- the equivalent of $250,000 to pay wages, to buy material, who knows why. </sentence><sentence id="217">That's what he had. </sentence><sentence id="218">The briefcase was lying in our hallway, like the entrance hall had like a cabinet. </sentence><sentence id="219">And Uncle Jupiter sent the chauffeur Sunday evening about eight o'clock or so to suggest that we come to his house, that we stay with -- with them. </sentence><sentence id="220">And my mother said, "Nah, I don't want to go." </sentence><sentence id="221">You know, Max is going to -- back to -- I can't remember the town where this business was, and he has this money and, you know, Uncle Jupiter was going with him so he knew. </sentence><sentence id="222">And, you know, "Bathe the children, put them to bed. </sentence><sentence id="223">I don't think so." </sentence><sentence id="224">Well, that was our last chance, because in the middle of the night about midnight, the -- the doorbell rang and it was the police, and they said they wanted us to go to the police station to check the documents. </sentence><sentence id="225">Don't worry about it, nothing serious, just check the documents. </sentence><sentence id="226">So we dressed.

</sentence><sentence id="230">And we -- when we got out of our apartment, there were -- there was a lot of police and a lot of people in the building that were going, but we also -- my parents saw, I didn't have the perception to understand it, that somebody was giving some policeman a bag of jewelry and they didn't go, they didn't leave. </sentence><sentence id="231">So -- but, you know, my

then the business will open, it won't have any money, that nothing would happen to us. </sentence><sentence id="234">Well, that was obviously wrong. </sentence><sentence id="235">We -- we left the house in a -- like a bus, and we were taken to -- to cattle cars, and that was it. </sentence><sentence id="236">And my dad, we didn't have any -- we didn't pack any luggage, although some people had taken something. </sentence><sentence id="237">My dad had the briefcase of money, and that's it. </sentence><sentence id="238">And we learned later that the -- that they were short on the transport. </sentence><sentence id="239">They had to have 2,000 people in the three -- three transports, and they were short 120 people on this transport. </sentence><sentence id="240">So they just went into a place where they knew Jews lived and took them, you know. </sentence><sentence id="241">I mean who's gonna hold them accountable?So that was basically how we were on the cattle car on the way to Transnistria. </sentence><sentence id="242">That ended the childhood that I experienced. </sentence></p></dialogue>
