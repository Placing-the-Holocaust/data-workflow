course, they couldn't bring it into the house. </sentence><sentence id="197">So the maid every afternoon for the -- what is called yowzah, for the -- the tea time, would take me to a -- a place that sold ham sandwiches where I could eat a ham on hard rolls. </sentence><sentence id="198">I ate part of it anyway. </sentence><sentence id="199">That was a daily ritual, I remember that. </sentence><sentence id="200">And I had -- and my closest friend, play friend, was -- well, actually I met a little girl in the park whose father was -- two I had -- her I was just fascinated. </sentence><sentence id="201">But my closest girlfriend, the -- this girl I met in the park, little girl in the park, her father was a bus driver. </sentence><sentence id="202">And they lived in a

they said. </sentence><sentence id="211"> ontectnetonancedjusietneey for tarher biormatierabouttfisotecion Interview with Pepi Schafler 9 I don't recall. </sentence><sentence id="212">But my brother, my brother had something to say about that, and he said, "You are gonna make us poor." </sentence><sentence id="213">Because I gave my toys away, these toys that Uncle Jupiter brought me. </sentence><sentence id="214">And the other friend that I spent a lot of time with was a little girl named Anita. </sentence><sentence id="215">She was -- Anita Gelburd. </sentence><sentence id="216">She was three years older than I was, and she had four -- I mean three older sisters. </sentence><sentence id="217">There were four girls. </sentence><sentence id="218">The oldest one was

</sentence><sentence id="220">And I loved being there because there was girl talk, you know. </sentence><sentence id="221">There was a lot of commotion. </sentence><sentence id="222">Our house was quiet, you know, kind of stuff. </sentence><sentence id="223">And there it was commotion. </sentence><sentence id="224">And unfortunately, the whole -- they were deported, all the Gelburds -- the older daughter had gotten married somewhere in between and had a child, but the rest of the family was deported. </sentence><sentence id="225">And when -- when people were coming back when -- when the nightmare ended, and the oldest sister, whose name I think was Lenny, saw that her family didn't come back, she committed suicide. </sentence><sentence id="226">Whole family went out {Crying}. </sentence><sentence id="227">That was my childhood. </sentence><sentence id="228">Sort of uneventful. </sentence><sentence id="229">You know, it just -- used to go see my grandparents. </sentence><sentence id="230">My grandparents were religious. </sentence><sentence id="231">Shabbat -- Shabbat was Shabbat. </sentence><sentence id="232">You had Friday night dinner. </sentence><sentence id="233">I liked my grandparents. </sentence><sentence id="234">My grandfather was something in a wood factory. </sentence><sentence id="235">I don't know what he did. </sentence><sentence id="236">He was a supervisor or something. </sentence><sentence id="237">And on Shabbat, people would come over and -- and, you know, they'd -- my grandmother would bake stuff on Friday, make challah, and she gave me a piece of dough and I could work -- work the system. </sentence><sentence id="238">And they were -- they were kind people that I -- I loved. </sentence><sentence id="239">And didn't see that much of them. </sentence><sentence id="240">And I -- they were a different way of life than -- than we were used to, but it was a nice life. </sentence><sentence id="241">The whole  ontectnetonancedjusietneey for tarher biormatoerabouttfisentecion Interview with Pepi Schafler 10 town -- you know, there was a main street, and their house was on the main street. </sentence><sentence id="242">They were all individual houses. </sentence><sentence id="243">And she -- people would walk by and see you on the porch and that kind of stuff. </sentence><sentence id="244">It was different. </sentence><sentence id="245">They had a garden in the back. </sentence><sentence id="246">And unfortunately, they were killed in Moghilev. </sentence><sentence id="247">They -- they died. </sentence><sentence id="248">They weren't killed. </sentence><sentence id="249">They died of malnutrition probably, and they were older so didn't see too much of them after that. </sentence><sentence id="250">You know, after the war started, we didn't see too much of them. </sentence><sentence id="251">So that's basically -- I didn't start -- when the Soviets occupied the Bukovina, when it was annexed, wasn't occupied, they would like to say it was annexed, in 1940, I started school, in Russian school. </sentence><sentence id="252">Now, I -- to roll back, when my dad used to come home for -- for his -- the midday meal, then he would lie -- lie down, I guess it was a couch. </sentence><sentence id="253">I know he was -- he lied down and I lied down right alongside of him. </sentence><sentence id="254">Had my head on the -- sort of under his arm. </sentence><sentence id="255">I learned to read. </sentence><sentence id="256">I learned to read. </sentence><sentence id="257">We spoke German at home, but I had learned to read Romanian and to speak Romanian, and I also later learned some Russian, even before -- before school. </sentence><sentence id="258">But Romanian and German I had learned. </sentence><sentence id="259">And when I didn't learn from -- when I was reading the paper with my dad would -- what I didn't learn, I sort of translated myself, you know, like -- I remember an example that my family had repeated, namely that in German whipped cream is schlagsahne, meaning beating, and sahne -- or schlagobers, the Austrians used to say. </sentence><sentence id="260">Well, schlag means beating and -- and obers is a colonel. </sentence><sentence id="261">That's the -- so I had translated batoot(ph), you know, beaten colonel for -- for whipped cream. </sentence><sentence id="262">That was my accomplishment. </sentence><sentence id="263">And people teased -- my parents teased, my brother especially teased me about that. </sentence><sentence id="264">It was a quiet life, pleasant. </sentence><sentence id="265">You know, no -- no particular drama until just Interview with Pepi Schafler 11 before the Soviet occupation. </sentence><sentence id="266">I remember my parents, we -- my mother and the children had been visiting the grandparents, and my father came for the weekend and was -- was telling my parent -- my mother and the grandparents that the maids -- they were usually Ukrainian or Lithuanian, and they -- that there -- there is unrest, that there is hooliganism. </sentence><sentence id="267">But I mean it was abstract. </sentence><sentence id="268">It wasn't -- nothing had happened to us or to our house kind of thing. </sentence><sentence id="269">But there was some cloud on the horizon. </sentence><sentence id="270">And in 1940, the -- the Soviet marched in. </sentence><sentence id="271">It wasn't -- it wasn't like Army takeover. </sentence><sentence id="272">It was -- they just sort of marched in. </sentence><sentence id="273">It was by agreement, although they had bombed, apparently, the airport. </sentence><sentence id="274">So it was sort of different but much the same. </sentence><sentence id="275">The -- the Soviet -- the Auto Matoro was eviscerated. </sentence><sentence id="276">And my dad, they wanted -- some town father or whatever these people had as commanders wanted my dad to be the accountant for Meloche (ph) Trust. </sentence><sentence id="277">In -- in the Soviet Union, in communistic structures, everything is a trust. </sentence><sentence id="278">It's the milk trust and the - - the shoe trust and the -- so Meloche Trust was the dairy trust, and my dad became the accountant and chief financial officer for the dairy trust. </sentence><sentence id="279">And, you know, we basically went on the same. </sentence><sentence id="280">I started school. </sentence><sentence id="281">I don't remember whether it was kindergarten or first grade. </sentence><sentence id="282">I mean I don't know that I would have been able to tell the difference actually. </sentence><sentence id="283">But it was Russian and -- My parents entertained some -- I remember my parents entertained some -- somebody from the company, some people from the company, Russians, and the guys were amazed how people lived, you know, the beauty, what they considered luxury. </sentence><sentence id="284">I mean we were upper middle class people, but we weren't by no means rich. </sentence><sentence id="285">Just well off, I guess, comfortable off, whatever. </sentence><sentence id="286">And he -- he was just amazed at how people lived. </sentence><sentence id="287">And he said something to my parents, and my brother felt  Interview with Pepi Schafler 12 compelled to answer, so he said, "Yeah, this is all nice, but they call us dirty Jews." </sentence><sentence id="288">So he said, "Well, you can call me anything you want as long as you feed me honey." </sentence><sentence id="289">So that was sort of a -- an indication of -- of a perception of what they had, you know. </sentence><sentence id="290">But other than that, the year went uneventful again, and you went to school and you -- my Uncle Jupiter was not too {Coughs} excited about it because he was a businessman. </sentence><sentence id="291">He - - he did international business with -- with Austria and Germany and France, and he couldn't do that. </sentence><sentence id="292">So he was not too excited but, you know, he had to put up and shut up, basically. </sentence><sentence id="293">And when the Naz -- on July 21, 1941, the war started. </sentence><sentence id="294">I mean Nazis invaded. </sentence><sentence id="295">Actually, rolling back, in "39 I remember when Poland was invaded. </sentence><sentence id="296">How do I remember it is that my mother had taken me for someplace, to some -- somewhere, and we were coming back. </sentence><sentence id="297">And in front of the perfect , the police there, which was the major police entity, there were people sitting on -- on packages on the street and the sidewalk. </sentence><sentence id="298">And I had asked "Why are they there", and my mother told me that -- this was in September 1939 -- that these people are from Poland and they are refugees. </sentence><sentence id="299">And -- and just as we were standing there, a dog came by and bit my thigh, you know, chubby little thighs of little girls, and that was a big minor crisis. </sentence><sentence id="300">You know, I don't think he broke the skin, I don't remember, just that the idea of it was a major thing. </sentence><sentence id="301">So in 1941 -- and we knew that Hitler had invaded Poland and that there was -- and in 1941, the Nazis, on June 21st, 1941, the Nazis occupied Chernowitz and then everything changed. </sentence><sentence id="302">That was not benign, that was not -- it was -- first of all, it was war, number one, although you didn't feel it that much. </sentence><sentence id="303">But there were -- there were a lot of anti-Semitic outbursts. </sentence><sentence id="304">A lot of windows broke and a lot of Jewish businesses broken and -- I don't -- and lot of Jewish   ontectnetonancedjusietneey for tarher biormatoerabouttfisentecion Interview with Pepi Schafler 13 businesses just simply put out of business. </sentence><sentence id="305">And -- and the Nazis had plans, had made plans to basically make Cherowitz , to expel all the Jews. </sentence><sentence id="306">Although my Uncle Jupiter was not -- he said, "Oh, they're not gonna do it." </sentence><sentence id="307">And he was -- he was amenable. </sentence><sentence id="308">He was pleased that -- that the Soviets had gone. </sentence><sentence id="309">Oh, let me roll back. </sentence><sentence id="310">In 1939, when Europe was getting just by things not looking so well, the Ford Motor Company in Michigan had -- had offered my father and his family to come to America. </sentence><sentence id="311">And my mother said, "Who goes to America? </sentence><sentence id="312">Only people that want to get away from a bad wife." </sentence><sentence id="313">Because in Europe, divorce was very difficult. </sentence><sentence id="314">Or people that can't make it financially and stuff like that. </sentence><sentence id="315">So that was one opportunity missed. </sentence><sentence id="316">And -- and when the Soviets were retreating, they offered my dad to come to Moscow. </sentence><sentence id="317">And my parents were sort of torn, I guess, about that. </sentence><sentence id="318">But Uncle Jupiter said, "No way, don't -- don't you dare", you know, kind of stuff. </sentence><sentence id="319">So that was the other opportunity that -- that was missed. </sentence><sentence id="320">And in 1941 -- so when they occupied, Jewish children could not go to school. </sentence><sentence id="321">And they -- they started forming a ghetto. </sentence><sentence id="322">All -- all Jews had to move into a certain area where Jews -- let me roll back. </sentence><sentence id="323">Uncle Jupiter immediately went into business or -- or revived an old business, I'm really not sure. </sentence><sentence id="324">But food transport, eggs, stuff like that was a big business in Europe. </sentence><sentence id="325">I -- I didn't really know that until much later. </sentence><sentence id="326">And he was involved with shipping aid -- you know, transporting food, eggs, dairy, who knows. </sentence><sentence id="327">That business was not in Chernowitz. </sentence><sentence id="328">It was, what, 40, 50 miles away in some small town. </sentence><sentence id="329">So he was back in -- he was in business immediately. </sentence><sentence id="330">And so when they -- when they tried to make Chernowitz , they ordered people to move into ghettos, you know, certain streets where Jews had lived and where the kosher shops were and stuff. </sentence><sentence id="331">But 5,000 people or Interview with Pepi Schafler 14 whatever thousand, I don't know, maybe -- maybe more, maybe 6,000 were permitted to stay in their homes because they were needed to run the town. </sentence><sentence id="332">I mean they were the professors and the physicians and the businessmen. </sentence><sentence id="333">And we were permitted to stay in town, and Uncle Jupiter was permitted to stay in town, and so were -- so was my uncle, my father's brother. </sentence><sentence id="334">And so we were home but -- and then these people that had gone to the ghetto -- so, there is -- apparently there was a list that they put people on, and these people could stay in their homes. </sentence><sentence id="335">And those that had been put in the ghetto, some were transported to Transnistria, and some were allowed to go home and they would have transports later on. </sentence><sentence id="336">Well, we never went so, you know, we were considered not at risk. </sentence><sentence id="337">And this was like in September or in the fall. </sentence><sentence id="338">And the next -- so after the winter, the next deportation -- these were deportations, by the way, they were. </sentence><sentence id="339">The next deportations -- I didn't go to school. </sentence><sentence id="340">My brother didn't go to school. </sentence><sentence id="341">I had a non-Jewish friend that I met in dancing school, and then in the year -- her name was Adele Havriluk. </sentence><sentence id="342">Her father was a prominent attorney. </sentence><sentence id="343">And then in that one year of schooling that was either kindergarten or first grade, I don't know which one, and they -- they used to come over and bring me school work. </sentence><sentence id="344">And so to keep me in touch with school work, and -- and bring stuff for my brother. </sentence><sentence id="345">So then in the -- the next deportations were ordered to take place in June of 1942, and they were to be -- to take place on three consecutive Sundays. </sentence><sentence id="346">Oh, my dad -- my dad had a job, so Uncle -- he worked in Uncle Jupiter's business of -- of food transport, had something to do with eggs and stuff. </sentence><sentence id="347">And my dad would travel with Uncle Jupiter every weekend. </sentence><sentence id="348">He would come home every weekend. </sentence><sentence id="349">He would travel every Monday, go there. </sentence><sentence id="350">So Jews had to be home on those three consecutive Sundays, and that  Interview with Pepi Schafler 15 didn't affect us the first two Sundays. </sentence><sentence id="351">The third Sunday -- and I had, in fact, said goodbye to some neighbor girl that I knew, whose name | don't even remember, but I know [ had said goodbye to somebody. </sentence><sentence id="352">But the third Sunday, Uncle Jupiter had sent a chauffeur. </sentence><sentence id="353">So Jews couldn't be out, but he -- he could send a chauffeur. </sentence><sentence id="354">And my dad had come back on Friday. </sentence><sentence id="355">He had -- he went to the bank or he picked up money, had a briefcase full of money, real money, two hundred -- the equivalent of $250,000 to pay wages, to buy material, who knows why. </sentence><sentence id="356">That's what he had. </sentence><sentence id="357">The briefcase was lying in our hallway, like the entrance hall had like a cabinet. </sentence><sentence id="358">And Uncle Jupiter sent the chauffeur Sunday evening about eight o'clock or so to suggest that we come to his house, that we stay with -- with them. </sentence><sentence id="359">And my mother said, "Nah, I don't want to go." </sentence><sentence id="360">You know, Max is going to -- back to -- I can't remember the town where this business was, and he has this money and, you know, Uncle Jupiter was going with him so he knew. </sentence><sentence id="361">And, you know, "Bathe the children, put them to bed. </sentence><sentence id="362">I don't think so." </sentence><sentence id="363">Well, that was our last chance, because in the middle of the night about midnight, the -- the doorbell rang and it was the police, and they said they wanted us to go to the police station to check the documents. </sentence><sentence id="364">Don't worry about it, nothing serious, just check the documents. </sentence><sentence id="365">So we dressed. </sentence><sentence id="366">My -- I dressed myself. </sentence><sentence id="367">I remember wearing kneesocks. </sentence><sentence id="368">That's what every kid wore, kneesocks, little kneesocks. </sentence><sentence id="369">And we -- when we got out of our apartment, there were -- there was a lot of police and a lot of people in the building that were going, but we also -- my parents saw, I didn't have the perception to understand it, that somebody was giving some policeman a bag of jewelry and they didn't go, they didn't leave. </sentence><sentence id="370">So -- but, you know, my parents were secure that -- that once he -- they Interview with Pepi Schafler 16 know that he's needed, then the business will open, it won't have any money, that nothing would happen to us. </sentence><sentence id="371">Well, that was obviously wrong. </sentence><sentence id="372">We -- we left the house in a -- like a bus, and we were taken to -- to cattle cars, and that was it. </sentence><sentence id="373">And my dad, we didn't have any -- we didn't pack any luggage, although some people had taken something. </sentence><sentence id="374">My dad had the briefcase of money, and that's it. </sentence><sentence id="375">And we learned later that the -- that they were short on the transport. </sentence><sentence id="376">They had to have 2,000 people in the three -- three transports, and they were short 120 people on this transport. </sentence><sentence id="377">So they just went into a place where they knew Jews lived and took them, you know. </sentence><sentence id="378">I mean who's gonna hold them accountable?So that was basically how we were on the cattle car on the way to Transnistria. </sentence><sentence id="379">That ended the childhood that I

id="1055">And the -- the round guy was -- was just in charge of the farm. </sentence><sentence id="1056">So -- so it wasn't clear. </sentence><sentence id="1057">We were basically free, you know. </sentence><sentence id="1058">We could starve on our own, die on our own. </sentence><sentence id="1059">You know, we probably could have left, but you are in the -- on the corner of nowhere and

id="1078">Not true. </sentence><sentence id="1079">We weren't orphans. </sentence><sentence id="1080">So -- but my parents wanted to assure that we would always stay together, so they made us twins. </sentence><sentence id="1081">So they picked the birthdate, 1931, on November 28th, 1931, so they couldn't be traced back, and -- and signed us up. </sentence><sentence id="1082">But then they were worried about -- also my parents were worried about that I was too young, somebody would -- so they -- they register us twice. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="1083">If you -- hopefully I get the list, if not I'll chase the woman down. </sentence><sentence id="1084">They -- they registered us twice; once as twins, and other times as both separately being 11 and 12 years old. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="1085">Just to -- to, you know, sort of secure that if somebody can't take twins, they can take one. </sentence><sentence id="1086">Or if eight, they think will be too young to complain or something like that. </sentence><sentence id="1087">So they registered us. </sentence><sentence id="1088">And you couldn't -- you couldn't be sent back to Chernowitz. </sentence><sentence id="1089">You could not. </sentence><sentence id="1090">But you could be sent any other place in Romania. </sentence><sentence id="1091">Well, you know, where to send in Romania, you know, cold, but my -- only where we have friends and family. </sentence><sentence id="1092">We -- my dad had done -- he had done business with Ford, with Auto Motora(ph), the Ford agency in the

</sentence><sentence id="1094">So he figured they -- they -- if they're there, they'll take us. </sentence><sentence id="1095">And so he put them down to -- that's where we were going, to the Bacall's in Botoshan. </sentence><sentence id="1096">We left around -- before Christmas -- and then when my parents a couple of times asked Misha, "What's the shooting up there?" </sentence><sentence id="1097">He says, "I don't hear any. </sentence><sentence id="1098">Shooting? </sentence><sentence id="1099">I never heard any." </sentence><sentence id="1100">So, you know, we -- we just sort of didn't -- didn't press him. </sentence><sentence id="1101">The -- but he would come in and say to us -- "Hold on, + -- just -- just stay." </sentence><sentence id="1102">He -- he invited us -- so he said he was married to this farm woman. </sentence><sentence id="1103">He invited us to his house once for dinner or twice. </sentence><sentence id="1104">And   Interview with Pepi Schafler 27 this woman was 20 years older than he was, which that's how it goes. </sentence><sentence id="1105">And had a nice -- you know, it was good. </sentence><sentence id="1106">Anything was nice. </sentence><sentence id="1107">And so, you know, he -- but he always said "Just -- just stay and hold on." </sentence><sentence id="1108">So would the round man, the vet. </sentence><sentence id="1109">And so we -- we -- my parents said you gotta go. </sentence><sentence id="1110">So we went. </sentence><sentence id="1111">We left. </sentence><sentence id="1112">My dad rode with us to Moghilev in a cart with horse, horse and buggy. </sentence><sentence id="1113">And somebody else, which I can't remember who the somebody else was. </sentence><sentence id="1114">Not a child. </sentence><sentence id="1115">It was an adult. </sentence><sentence id="1116">And we stayed in Moghilev for -- for a couple of weeks while the transport was being organized. </sentence><sentence id="1117">And I cried a lot. </sentence><sentence id="1118">I was sick. </sentence><sentence id="1119">I was heartbroken. </sentence><sentence id="1120">My dad returned in that horse and buggy. </sentence><sentence id="1121">And of course, my parents were heartbroken. </sentence><sentence id="1122">But that -- that was the general -- you are heartbroken when you are in a concentration -- Nazi concentration camp. </sentence><sentence id="1123">We eventually made our way to Botoshan in -- in the spring. </sentence><sentence id="1124">There were about 18 children that went to Botoshan from other camps. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="1125">Jagendorf says that when -- when -- that he arrange it and the children of Botoshan have a welcoming for them. </sentence><sentence id="1126">Never happened. </sentence><sentence id="1127">So we -- we arrived by train, by a regular train. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="1128">And we were in like a large room, and the people that were supposed to pick up children came, but so did a lot of other people. </sentence><sentence id="1129">You know, just -- just to help, just to care {Crying}. </sentence><sentence id="1130">So the Bacalls weren't there. </sentence><sentence id="1131">It was circumstantial, because they were not notified and they were out of town. </sentence><sentence id="1132">But there were other people who said -- numerous other people who said, "We'll take care of them. </sentence><sentence id="1133">We will." </sentence><sentence id="1134">And there was somebody in charge who decided who may and who may not, I guess. </sentence><sentence id="1135">There was this family named Finklestein. </sentence><sentence id="1136">A woman, she was | think 29. </sentence><sentence id="1137">She had a brother that was 25. </sentence><sentence id="1138">They lived with their father. </sentence><sentence id="1139">And they said, "We want them. </sentence><sentence id="1140">We want them." </sentence><sentence id="1141">And they had neighbors, a couple, and -- and two sons, like 18 and 20, and they said, "We want them. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="1142">  Interview with Pepi Schafler 28 We want them. </sentence><sentence id="1143">All of us want them. </sentence><sentence id="1144">We'll take care of them." </sentence><sentence id="1145">So we went. </sentence><sentence id="1146">They were the most loving, wonderful people. </sentence><sentence id="1147">I mean they were so happy to have us. </sentence><sentence id="1148">You know, we were dirty, we were probably in rags, and I don't really remember. </sentence><sentence id="1149">They -- they fed us. </sentence><sentence id="1150">They caressed us. </sentence><sentence id="1151">They -- they were -- they put us to sleep in their beds. </sentence><sentence id="1152">I mean they were not people of means. </sentence><sentence id="1153">They had a small -- little bit small apartment, but -- and -- and we were so excited, that the -- the son sat up all night and the neighbor, the Marcus, the name was Marcus, he sat up -- the two of them sat up all night to watch us sleep. </sentence><sentence id="1154">They were worried that if something happens in our sleep. </sentence><sentence id="1155">And just the sweetest, kindest people. </sentence><sentence id="1156">And was fine for us, we -- we were happy to stay there. </sentence><sentence id="1157">They cleaned our shoes, such as they were. </sentence><sentence id="1158">I don't remember what kind of shoes I had and what clothes, but they -- they got us some clothes or they gave us theirs. </sentence><sentence id="1159">I don't remember nothing about that. </sentence><sentence id="1160">I was just so taken by their kindness. </sentence><sentence id="1161">That was just -- it was like -- like you're a dream, you know, you're dreaming about this. </sentence><sentence id="1162">And we stayed there for four or five days, and the Bacalls came back, and they found out that -- that we had arrived and they were not there and they were notified. </sentence><sentence id="1163">They were not too happy about it and, of course, they also powerful people and they're also rich people, so they sent a chauffeur and -- to pick us up. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="1164">And, you know, the Finklesteins and the Marcuses, they were so upset. </sentence><sentence id="1165">And they -- they called somebody and they were trying to say -- and Mr. Bacall said -- you know, Mr. and Mrs. Bacall, these gorgeous-looking people, like something you see in the movies. </sentence><sentence id="1166">And they said, "No, they -- they -- their parents said they come here. </sentence><sentence id="1167">They come here." </sentence><sentence id="1168">Mr. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="1169">Bacall, Sr. </sentence><sentence id="1170">had died in the interim. </sentence><sentence id="1171">And they had the Ford agency still. </sentence><sentence id="1172">And so, you know, money trumps a lot of things. </sentence><sentence id="1173">We stayed in touch with the Finklesteins though and   ontectnetonancedjusietneey for tarher biormatoerabouttfisentecion </sentence></p><p><sentence id="1174"> Interview with Pepi Schafler 29 the Marcuses. </sentence><sentence id="1175">So they -- we stayed with the Bacalls for -- for several months. </sentence><sentence id="1176">They were very kind and very loving, and I guess they bought us clothes. </sentence><sentence id="1177">I don't know where the clothes came from, but we -- they weren't the rags that we came with. </sentence><sentence id="1178">And it was a household where there was a maid and -- and a chauffeur and butler. </sentence><sentence id="1179">So dinner was formal and -- and, you know, you rang the bell if you wanted something, even to make the butler come from a long ways so he open the bottle. </sentence><sentence id="1180">And that -- we stayed there -- of course, when the Soviet occupied, reoccupied the Bukovina, the Bacalls lost their household help. </sentence><sentence id="1181">Apparently, the -- the maid and the butler had been communists. </sentence><sentence id="1182">I wonder why. </sentence><sentence id="1183">And so they -- they quit. </sentence><sentence id="1184">But before -- before this, the occupation, the reoccupation, was not -- was not seamless. </sentence><sentence id="1185">The Soviets bombed the town and bombed -- it was a seder, I remember the seder, and there were people and it was an elegant sort of dinner. </sentence><sentence id="1186">And we stayed -- we went on the balcony and looking over, and then the alarm had gone off for the bomb shelters, and there was a bomb shelter. </sentence><sentence id="1187">But before we could -- could process it, a bomb had hit the house across the street. </sentence><sentence id="1188">And by the time we got to the bomb shelter, the go-round, there were

</sentence><sentence id="1191">And I think he was seeing the carnage, the blood and that kind of stuff, and he was severely affected by that. </sentence><sentence id="1192">So anyway, we -- we stayed with the Bacalls. </sentence><sentence id="1193">The Soviets occupied. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="1194">And then my -- one day, my mother had notified them that they are planning to get us.

think again at the Meloche Trust, which is the -- the dairy trust. </sentence><sentence id="1260">And -- but we didn't have very much of anything. </sentence><sentence id="1261">So -- and we -- and my uncle persuaded us, persuaded my parents to come to Bucharest, to go to Bucharest. </sentence><sentence id="1262">So that was another sort of using forged papers for -- so they used the -- the different birthdays, and that's how we got to be -- we came to Bucharest. </sentence><sentence id="1263">I -- I remember I was in -- still in Chernowitz when the war ended in Europe May 8th, 1945, and there were thousands of thousands of people on the square in Chernowitz. </sentence><sentence id="1264">And was a woman officer, you know, I never seen women in the Army, and she said, "This is a special day. </sentence><sentence id="1265">Today we -- we celebrate probelov(ph), free -- freedom and peace. </sentence><sentence id="1266">So that -- that was awesome. </sentence><sentence id="1267">And we stayed in Chernowitz a few more months and then went to Bucharest. </sentence><sentence id="1268">And I don't -- we -- we got to Bucharest, I think, on a train. </sentence><sentence id="1269">But the -- the -- with the fear of the documents always. </sentence><sentence id="1270">And it became now a fear of documents. </sentence><sentence id="1271">We arrived in Bucharest in 19 -- sometime in 1945, and stayed there until 1946 when the -- when the -- or -- or later, maybe -- yeah, "46, late "46 when the Nazis -- when the Soviets were occupying -- you know, the king -- when the king was -- was being ousted, King Michael. </sentence><sentence id="1272">It was becoming communist and it was gonna be communist, and Uncle Jupiter didn't want to stay there. </sentence><sentence id="1273">And my -- my parents -- my parents -- an aunt and cousin were in Germany already, and they felt that we should leave Interview with Pepi Schafler 33 there because nothing good is gonna come. </sentence><sentence id="1274">We should leave the area. </sentence><sentence id="1275">So again, you sort of struggle and you -- you -- we lived in a one-room apartment or something in Bucharest, like a studio apartment. </sentence><sentence id="1276">And you struggled to organize documents and visas and all this kind of stuff. { </sentence><sentence id="1277">Coughs} -- and in 1946, we were leaving. </sentence><sentence id="1278">We had a visa for Germany, and a pass-through visa to the other countries in between. </sentence><sentence id="1279">My uncle couldn't get a visa, so he just contacted smugglers. </sentence><sentence id="1280">There were always these smugglers and -- Uncle Jupiter. </sentence><sentence id="1281">So he paid somebody a lot of money and they -- on the -- the Hungarian border was still the Hungarian border. </sentence><sentence id="1282">So the smuggler took him to this little town waiting for the train, for a train, for the right conductor to be able to smuggle him over. </sentence><sentence id="1283">Well, it took a couple weeks and he still hadn't gone. </sentence><sentence id="1284">So he said he would send for the women, when -- his wife and my other aunt when -- when he's on the other side. </sentence><sentence id="1285">But then it had become communist already and you couldn't leave. </sentence><sentence id="1286">So -- but the women had become anxious, so they -- they contacted the smuggler who tried to talk them out of it. </sentence><sentence id="1287">They also paid him a lot of money, and they left their -- their beautiful apartment, all their possessions, and he took them to -- to the border town. </sentence><sentence id="1288">Now, these -- these people must have had a brain freeze, because in a -- in a little border town where everybody is -- is a peasant, and you see these beautiful two women, the one with the long blonde hair, you -- you immediately conclude that there is something going on. </sentence><sentence id="1289">I mean so when -- when the smuggler -- the smuggler didn't want to take all three of them. </sentence><sentence id="1290">They talked him into it. </sentence><sentence id="1291">He put them on the -- on a locomotive or something, and of course they were all arrested, arrested and sent -- sentenced to prison for four years. </sentence><sentence id="1292">But in the meantime, our -- we had these visas and we went. </sentence><sentence id="1293">We left Romania and went, and I lived in Prague for a  Interview with Pepi Schafler 34 while. </sentence><sentence id="1294">We lived in Prague for several months. </sentence><sentence id="1295">Don't know why. </sentence><sentence id="1296">But we lived in Prague for several months in 1947. </sentence><sentence id="1297">And after that, we -- we went to Munich. </sentence><sentence id="1298">I stayed there until I came to the United States. </sentence><sentence id="1299">And I had -- so I didn't go to school in Bucharest. </sentence><sentence id="1300">I had learned -- had some tutoring, you know, volunteer tutors. </sentence><sentence id="1301">But I learned -- I taught myself. </sentence><sentence id="1302">I was reading and writing and stuff like that. </sentence><sentence id="1303">And the same was in Prague. </sentence><sentence id="1304">And then -- and when we came to Munich, where -- where did we fit in? </sentence><sentence id="1305">We didn't really fit in any particular. </sentence><sentence id="1306">There -- there was a school where, you know, we went every day and, you know, it was sort of teaching you life skills and stuff like that. </sentence><sentence id="1307">Intellectually, we -- we were self-taught. </sentence><sentence id="1308">And came to the United States at the end of 1951. </sentence><sentence id="1309">So I -- when I say I grow up in Munich, I grew up basically there. </sentence><sentence id="1310">And, you know, it was a lot of sort of empty time, a lot of -- grew up fast, dating, older people, you know, was kind of -- And my brother -- my brother went to Switzerland to study some kind of engineering, and he -- he came here two years after us. </sentence><sentence id="1311">He stayed there until he finished his course, his studies, and came to the States in 1953.

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1389">Q:By whom? </sentence><sentence id="1390">By who? </sentence><sentence id="1391">He was drafted by whom? </sentence><sentence id="1392">By the -- who -- who drafted him? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1397">A:The United States. </sentence><sentence id="1398">He came on a green card and he was arrest -- he was drafted. </sentence><sentence id="1399">He was drafted. </sentence><sentence id="1400">He was multilingual, as I was. </sentence><sentence id="1401">They didn't try at the time. </sentence><sentence id="1402">Don't have to now, I guess. </sentence><sentence id="1403">So he was drafted. </sentence><sentence id="1404">And the funny thing is my parents wanted to stay in Germany, wanted to stay in Europe. </sentence><sentence id="1405">But they were concerned that my brother would have to serve in the German Army, or in the European Army. </sentence><sentence id="1406">They didn't want   ontectnetonancedjusietneey for tarher biormatoerabouttfisentecion Interview with Pepi Schafler 35 that. </sentence><sentence id="1407">So lo and behold, we came to the United States. </sentence><sentence id="1408">But once I got here, I had gotten used to it. </sentence><sentence id="1409">And my brother, once he came on a green card, was drafted. </sentence><sentence id="1410">So the -- but he was in basic training. </sentence><sentence id="1411">The -- the colonel -- you know, my parents worried about him. </sentence><sentence id="1412">I worried about him, too. </sentence><sentence id="1413">Because, you know, in the basic training in the Army is a lot of Mickey Mouse stuff, clean your weapon, put it together, take it apart, make your bed, make -- shine your shoes. </sentence><sentence id="1414">Well, we didn't think he knew how to do that. </sentence><sentence id="1415">He's very smart and would become a very successful man, but these things are a skill unto itself. </sentence><sentence id="1416">So the colonel one day heard him -- started talking to him and said to him "Where are you from and what language do you speak?" </sentence><sentence id="1417">And he says, "Okay, you're my aide from now on. </sentence><sentence id="1418">I want to learn French." </sentence><sentence id="1419">So he eventually was sent to Europe. </sentence><sentence id="1420">And I don't know if the colonel went, I don't recall, and he became part of the forerunner of the CIA. </sentence><sentence id="1421">He was for the Army Intelligence. </sentence><sentence id="1422">He was trained and they -- the Army Intelligence, he was -- he served the Army Intelligence. </sentence><sentence id="1423">They gave him a different name. </sentence><sentence id="1424">They put him in a private house -- they -- they rented a house for him in East Berlin. </sentence><sentence id="1425">And he was a spy, basically, for -- for three years. </sentence><sentence id="1426">And he -- they wanted -- tried to persuade him that he should -- he could be this, you know, he was done with the Army, that he should do this as a -- as a job, that he should become -- take this on. </sentence><sentence id="1427">But we try to -- we talked him out of it eventually. </sentence><sentence id="1428">But tried to explain to him, "Listen, they're not gonna send you to Paris, they're gonna send you to Africa or someplace." </sentence><sentence id="1429">Well, anyway, he -- he went on to college and became a -- had a couple of degrees. </sentence><sentence id="1430">And his job, his longest job, was for 35 years at the Rand Corporation, The Think Tank. </sentence><sentence id="1431">He's very smart, and he's very good. </sentence><sentence id="1432">And he died, unfortunately, 11-99. </sentence><sentence id="1433">That's 14 years ago. </sentence><sentence id="1434">So -- and I got married in 1952. </sentence><sentence id="1435"> ontectnetonancedjusietneey for tarher biormatoerabouttfisentecion Interview with Pepi Schafler 36 I'd been here just months, here in Buffalo, and had no particular schooling, self-taught, learned -- I learned English by myself, self-taught. </sentence><sentence id="1436">And in -- in Germany, nobody learned English. </sentence><sentence id="1437">The school we attended to periodically didn't teach English. </sentence><sentence id="1438">They just sort of kept you off the street, I guess. </sentence><sentence id="1439">And I -- I taught myself English. </sentence><sentence id="1440">And I tell everybody the story that we lived in -- we had an apartment. </sentence><sentence id="1441">We lived in an apartment and we had a maid, Anna Marie. { </sentence><sentence id="1442">Coughs} -- my mother -- my mother took ill in camp and she never basically recovered. </sentence><sentence id="1443">She had arthritis. </sentence><sentence id="1444">And I think she was emotionally injured as well, but she had a severe arthritis. </sentence><sentence id="1445">And, you know, the meds that you take for arthritis sort of harm you as well. </sentence><sentence id="1446">But so in Munich, people hadn't seen African- Americans. </sentence><sentence id="1447">And Anna Marie, the maid, was in the park and met a soldier that was African-American. </sentence><sentence id="1448">So one day he came to see her. </sentence><sentence id="1449">She told him she lives there. </sentence><sentence id="1450">She didn't tell him she works there. </sentence><sentence id="1451">So people saw him in the building. </sentence><sentence id="1452">And oh, my God, what's gonna happen to us. </sentence><sentence id="1453">And he came to our door and rang the doorbell. </sentence><sentence id="1454">And I opened the door, and he said, "I would like to speak to Anna Marie." </sentence><sentence id="1455">And since I spoke English, I could tell him she doesn't live here, she just works here, and she's not here. </sentence><sentence id="1456">And spoke a few more words to him. </sentence><sentence id="1457">Very nice. </sentence><sentence id="1458">It was all very nice. </sentence><sentence id="1459">He was a nice guy. </sentence><sentence id="1460">But the -- the -- I was a star for the neighbors, because it was -- people were frightened. </sentence><sentence id="1461">They had lived through the war and -- and this was a strange sort of person, you know, and they just didn't know what to make of it. </sentence><sentence id="1462">And English was not spoken. </sentence><sentence id="1463">Nobody spoke English. </sentence><sentence id="1464">So it was -- made me a -- that was my good deed for -- for the week. </sentence><sentence id="1465">So there were a lot -- a lot of Jews from Poland. </sentence><sentence id="1466">My -- we -- my relatives that were in Munich, my cousin, a physician, well-known physician, had in the meantime gone to Interview with Pepi Schafler 37 New York, moved to New York, so we really didn't have anybody in Munich. </sentence><sentence id="1467">So I mean my dad had a job. </sentence><sentence id="1468">I don't know what -- how good a job it was. </sentence><sentence id="1469">It may have been less than he's used to. </sentence><sentence id="1470">And he provided for his family, I guess. </sentence><sentence id="1471">And he -- so we also came to the United States, not only -- but primarily because my parents worried that Armon would have to serve in a German Army. </sentence><sentence id="1472">So that's what brought me to the United

had the same attitude. </sentence><sentence id="1563">And -- and I had come to understand -- to observe that later, that -- that, you know, that's them and that's us, and somehow they deserved being deported. </sentence><sentence id="1564">It was on the merits, not just on -- on some crazed anti-Semite. </sentence><sentence id="1565">It was on some merits. </sentence><sentence id="1566">And that

like everybody else, and so that -- that accounts for -- that sort of registered with me. </sentence><sentence id="1569">That accounts for my never having wanted to talk about it, that I just didn't want -- I never -- I never did. </sentence><sentence id="1570">My -- since I spend a lot of time in California. </sentence><sentence id="1571">You know, Spielberg has a show. </sentence><sentence id="1572">No, I didn't -- and my brother was married to -- his first wife was - - her father was in the studio, a studio man, you know. </sentence><sentence id="1573">And he -- he wanted me to -- my brother I mean absolutely would not, and thought well, maybe she's not as adamant. </sentence><sentence id="1574">So I Interview with Pepi Schafler 38 -- | -- that was in part, I didn't want to. </sentence><sentence id="1575">I mean there is -- there is a population that -- that chose to, and I give them credit that chose to. </sentence><sentence id="1576">I know Gerda Klein. </sentence><sentence id="1577">Gerda Klein lived in my neighborhood in Kenmore, New York. </sentence><sentence id="1578">So it was -- it was -- I give her credit. </sentence><sentence id="1579">It was courageous. </sentence><sentence id="1580">It was -- well, I don't know about being courageous, but it was -- {Coughs} it was an affirmative thing to do. </sentence><sentence id="1581">And it -- it brought attention to it, and she was okay with that, and her family was okay with that. </sentence><sentence id="1582">In fact, my -- my former husband had a business with her husband, Mr. Klein, had a printing shop. </sentence><sentence id="1583">And my former husband was in advertising and, you know, did that. </sentence><sentence id="1584">And the Kleins had three children within the same town, so at some point somebody collides. </sentence><sentence id="1585">But I think that the Kleins, as a model, were not as accepted as you would think. </sentence><sentence id="1586">They were respected but not accepted. </sentence><sentence id="1587">That's my interpretation. </sentence><sentence id="1588">Just because -- you know, I -- some people don't see that distinction, perhaps. </sentence><sentence id="1589">I'ma shrink besides having a law degree. </sentence><sentence id="1590">So the -- I think you can be respected without being accepted. </sentence><sentence id="1591">And I think the Kleins were respected but -- accepted means you're just a regular guy, you're a regular woman. </sentence><sentence id="1592">That's acceptance. </sentence><sentence id="1593">If you are singled out for something that you had no choice about, or you had a choice about, that -- and people give you credit for that, that's not accepted. </sentence><sentence id="1594">That's respected. </sentence><sentence id="1595">But accepted is all the people. </sentence><sentence id="1596">So I -- I don't know if you see the distinction, but that's -- or you've ever noticed the distinction. </sentence><sentence id="1597">But I -- so I -- I didn't put it forth that I am -- when people say to me "Where are you from?" </sentence><sentence id="1598">Or you say more. </sentence><sentence id="1599">In fact, I was a college professor at one time, and some of the students didn't -- you know, like they don't know accents. </sentence><sentence id="1600">So they would say "Dr. Schafler, are you from New York?" { </sentence><sentence id="1601">Laughter} "Or where are you from?" </sentence><sentence id="1602">So, you know, I would say "Oh, I'm from some other place." </sentence><sentence id="1603">I didn't want to go  Interview with Pepi Schafler 39 into it. </sentence><sentence id="1604">So the -- the -- I did not want to attract attention because of that. </sentence><sentence id="1605">So, but I don't think that Jews were as forthcoming as all that. </sentence><sentence id="1606">They were not forthcoming in many ways. </sentence><sentence id="1607">And -- and the more you -- you look around, there were a lot of Jewish profiteers. </sentence><sentence id="1608">I mean like -- like Mr. Jacobs was a profiteer in the sense that he earned money and he lived better and earned himself positions. </sentence><sentence id="1609">And I was reading a book not long ago about the Wrightmans. </sentence><sentence id="1610">I don't know if the family name strikes you, but the Wrightmans are billionaire developers. </sentence><sentence id="1611">They have developed half of Toronto or three-quarters of Toronto. </sentence><sentence id="1612">And they are Hungarian Jews, and they bought their way out when -- when Hungary was going -- they bought their way out and they went to Tangier. </sentence><sentence id="1613">So they -- so that they wouldn't be considered profiteers. </sentence><sentence id="1614">Oh, and they went into money laundering. </sentence><sentence id="1615">That's profiteering. </sentence><sentence id="1616">And there was so much money. </sentence><sentence id="1617">There was no place to launder money other than in offshore. </sentence><sentence id="1618">So they became very, very wealthy. </sentence><sentence id="1619">So for -- for people that don't know, they said she -- that Mrs. Wrightman had a group of women and they were wrapping packages to send to the concentration camps. </sentence><sentence id="1620">Now, that is the stupid -- the second stupidist thing I've ever heard. </sentence><sentence id="1621">I can't think of the first. </sentence><sentence id="1622">The idea that you can send packages to the -- to the concentration camp and they have mail call, and they say "Schmul Kahn(ph), there is a package for you." </sentence><sentence id="1623">Are you kidding? </sentence><sentence id="1624">So they -- and -- or -- or that the Nazis would have allowed packages to Dachau or Auschwitz or even Cariera de Piatra. </sentence><sentence id="1625">That is too stupid. </sentence><sentence id="1626">Oh, and -- and she -- they write -- probably self-written. </sentence><sentence id="1627">I don't recall who wrote it. </sentence><sentence id="1628">But they write that they -- they had difficulty sending them to the camps. </sentence><sentence id="1629">They have to send them through Switzerland. </sentence><sentence id="1630">And the packages had chocolate, coffee. </sentence><sentence id="1631">Now, come on, give me a break. </sentence><sentence id="1632">How ridiculous can you be? </sentence><sentence id="1633">So the --   Interview with Pepi Schafler 40 the -- they had dehumanized. </sentence><sentence id="1634">They dehumanized the experience. </sentence><sentence id="1635">If you think that -- that you can launder money for Nazis but you're sending chocolate -- chocolate to some camp somewhere, how dare you. </sentence><sentence id="1636">So Jews did not -- did not do much, did not do much. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1945">A: Well, first of all, because I -- I no longer feel constraint by -- by my constraints. </sentence><sentence id="1946">As I mentioned to you, when -- when the man spoke, and you can probably look it up in the -- who he was and -- look it up in the calendars, you know, I thought I'm not doing that, you know. </sentence><sentence id="1947">I'm not looking at -- and, you know, all the people in California, I didn't want to have anything to do with it. </sentence><sentence id="1948">But -- but I -- maybe it's an empowerment. </sentence><sentence id="1949">I have empowered myself. </sentence><sentence id="1950">This happened to -- to me despite what I thought, despite me being innocent, and now I can tell you about it and you didn't help me. </sentence><sentence id="1951">You did nothing about it. </sentence><sentence id="1952">The -- the people that we thought were -- we were helped by the people that we thought were victimizing us. </sentence><sentence id="1953">The camp commander who hid, who said, "I saved as many of you as I could", and he didn't steal the money, he didn't -- he didn't bribe himself. </sentence><sentence

or something like that. </sentence><sentence id="1957">But he'd come by almost every day. </sentence><sentence id="1958">I can't remember a day that he didn't. </sentence><sentence id="1959">So these

could to survive themselves. </sentence><sentence id="1962">And in a way -- in the -- on the way of helping themselves, they helped others. </sentence><sentence id="1963">This is a huge risk for the

</sentence><sentence id="1965">And -- and to sort of minimize it, and probably he was scared stiff, but he said, "Oh, there's nothing there, just old stuff." </sentence><sentence id="1966">So this is why I -- I feel empowered now. </sentence><sentence id="1967">I got it. </sentence><sentence id="1968">What I didn't get before, I got itnow. </sentence><sentence id="1969">And I think it's a -- it's
