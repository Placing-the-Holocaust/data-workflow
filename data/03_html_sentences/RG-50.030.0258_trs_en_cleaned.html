Okay. </sentence><sentence id="34">Ijust want to do one thing. </sentence><sentence id="35">I'm afraid my alarm on my watch is going to go off, so let me try to figure out how to make it go off. </sentence><sentence id="36">I don't know. </sentence><sentence id="37">I'm going to put it outside. </sentence><sentence id="38">Why don't you cut for a second. </sentence><sentence id="39">Now I want you to tell me about Warsaw after the war broke out and where you and your family lived and about what you remember of the forming of the ghetto. </sentence><sentence id="40">Tell me a little bit about before you were deported. </sentence><sentence id="41">A. We lived all our lives on Miller Street. </sentence><sentence id="42">This is the Miller Street where the headquarters for the resistance were on Miller 18. </sentence><sentence id="43">We lived on Miller 38. </sentence><sentence id="44">We never moved, so we were lucky in that respect. </sentence><sentence id="45">Before the war, my father had a factory of wooden hand-carved objects, like carved chairs and carved boxes, decorative plates, and things like that. </sentence><sentence id="46">In the ghetto, my father applied to the Germans to have a permit for a workshop, and he received a permit to make wooden frames. </sentence><sentence id="47">He received the location just across the street from where we lived, an empty apartment. </sentence><sentence id="48">And one day, he told my sister and me to go over to that location and put the frames in to make it look occupied. </sentence><sentence id="49">The reason for this permit, as you know, was that anybody who was not employed was subject to transport and anybody that had any kind of a piece of paper could, quote, postpone the transport, and this was the reason for it. </sentence><sentence id="50">So my sister and I, loaded with this wooden frames, go across the street to put the things in. </sentence><sentence id="51">And all of a sudden, there is a blockade. </sentence><sentence id="52">This is a verbatim transcript of

whistles, there are screams, there are yelling. </sentence><sentence id="56">This means that everybody that is going to be caught is going to be transported out. </sentence><sentence id="57">My sister and I are in this empty apartment, there is screaming and yelling and whistling. </sentence><sentence id="58">So we run from this apartment, down the stairs. </sentence><sentence id="59">We want to go into a bunker. </sentence><sentence id="60">A bunker is a hiding place that each house had to try and hide and wait out and maybe be saved. </sentence><sentence id="61">We run there with all the other people, but we were strangers in this building, they didn't know us, so they wouldn't let us in. </sentence><sentence id="62">My sister and I went back upstairs to this apartment, I believe it was on the first or second story, completely empty. </sentence><sentence id="63">We sit on the floor and we wait, see what's going to happen. </sentence><sentence id="64">And there are screams and yelling on the street and people crying. </sentence><sentence id="65">There are shots, a great deal of noise, and screaming "raus, raus, raus," which means out, out, out, everybody out. </sentence><sentence id="66">And we sit on the floor and we tell each other jokes just to keep our spirits up and to give each other courage. </sentence><sentence id="67">All of a sudden, we hear heavy steps on the stairs, boom, boom, boom, "raus, raus, raus." </sentence><sentence id="68">And somebody, with the butt of a rifle, opens the door. </sentence><sentence id="69">And it so happens that we were sitting behind the door. </sentence><sentence id="70">We didn't even know that. </sentence><sentence id="71">The door is open, a soldier's head comes in, he sees the empty apartment, goes out, goes up, goes down. </sentence><sentence id="72">And we are there. </sentence><sentence id="73">And I don't know how long we sat there, until everything was quiet. </sentence><sentence id="74">And we waited, and we peeked through the windows and there was nobody there. </sentence><sentence id="75">We made it downstairs. </sentence><sentence id="76">The doors to the bunker was open. </sentence><sentence id="77">There was nobody there. </sentence><sentence id="78">We felt as the last inhabitants on earth, the two of us. </sentence><sentence id="79">We run across the street where my mother was. </sentence><sentence id="80">We had the keys, we opened the door. </sentence><sentence id="81">She was there. </sentence><sentence id="82">She survived. </sentence><sentence id="83">She didn't hear. </sentence><sentence id="84">After that, there was no point of having this workshop. </sentence><sentence id="85">This was in July "42, as you know, that the big, big transports from Warsaw were taken to Treblinka, to death. </sentence><sentence id="86">My father, again, there was no room for the workshop, but still you needed some kind of a piece of paper. </sentence><sentence id="87">My father registered as a This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="88">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence

in the time of Stalingrad. </sentence><sentence id="91">The Germans have experienced great many losses in the battle of Stalingrad. </sentence><sentence id="92">They brought the wounded to Warsaw. </sentence><sentence id="93">And those that died were buried there in the German military cemetery. </sentence><sentence id="94">My father's job was to carve the names, the ranks and the date of birth and death of the fallen soldiers. </sentence><sentence id="95">This way, he was commuting, with a piece of paper, in and out of the ghetto. </sentence><sentence id="96">It took, those were, quote, the commandos that were working outside of ghetto. </sentence><sentence id="97">It was, for us, very nice because my father was able to bring a little bit of food from outside, which was very, very nice, which we didn't have before. </sentence><sentence id="98">I need simply very quickly to tell you that my older sister Saba (ph) had a fiance who was a Polish officer. </sentence><sentence id="99">And he run away from Poland, as a Polish officer, not only as a Jew, but as a Polish officer, and she went with him. </sentence><sentence id="100">They went east at the beginning of the war. </sentence><sentence id="101">And this is how she was saved. </sentence><sentence id="102">So we were left, my father, my mother, my sister Esther and I.So going back to the story, Esther at that time joined the nursing school and she was working in the Jewish hospital. </sentence><sentence id="103">So here we have my father, who is working outside of the ghetto. </sentence><sentence id="104">My mother was keeping house. </sentence><sentence id="105">I belonged to Shomeratzayir (ph), which is a youth organization, depending on who you speak with. </sentence><sentence id="106">It's rather to the left, but it is not like some people say Communist now. </sentence><sentence id="107">It was very socialist. </sentence><sentence id="108">And in the ghetto, we were having our Hebrew names, we were singing Hebrew songs, we were dreaming of Zionism and free Palestine and emigrating to Palestine, and, of course, as you know, we were part of the Warsaw uprising. </sentence><sentence id="109">In the ghetto, you have a generation gap. </sentence><sentence id="110">The older people, who had families, were very much preoccupied with the safety of those dependent on them. </sentence><sentence id="111">As young people, we had nothing to worry about except our lives and, you know, when you are young, your life doesn't mean very much. </sentence><sentence id="112">I will never forget, at the beginning of the ghetto, in about "40, "41, two young men came from Vilna, two Jewish men. </sentence><sentence id="113">It was the first time that all the different youth organizations, Jewish youth This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="114">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="115"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection organizations, got together under the same roof in spite of the political differences of the spectrum, right to left, or those what have you. </sentence><sentence id="116">We gathered together in the big synagogue on Tomaska (ph) Street. </sentence><sentence id="117">It was one of the largest synagogues in Warsaw. </sentence><sentence id="118">And these two young men told us about the atrocities perpetrated on youth in Vilna in east of Poland, about the murders. </sentence><sentence id="119">I believed that this is when the seeds for the uprising started, right at that particular point. </sentence><sentence id="120">When we got up to sing that Hazakna (ph), that Hebrew Shomeratzayir hymn that we will be strong. </sentence><sentence id="121">And all of us stood up to sing it, the walls of the synagogue trembled, there was that strength. </sentence><sentence id="122">But when I came home and told my father, "that I don't want to hear this propaganda. </sentence><sentence id="123">The transports are going for work. </sentence><sentence id="124">I don't want to hear those kind of things. </sentence><sentence id="125">Don't worry your mother." </sentence><sentence id="126">So then we have the generation gap from the older generation to the younger generation. </sentence><sentence id="127">To go back to the story, though, my father was working on the other side, coming back every day. </sentence><sentence id="128">And I was spending my days with Shomeratzayir. </sentence><sentence id="129">One of my functions was to teach Polish to the many Jewish children who did not have Polish education. </sentence><sentence id="130">They were versed in Yiddish, but not in Polish. </sentence><sentence id="131">So this was my job, to help them, you know, improve their spelling and reading skills, one of my jobs. </sentence><sentence id="132">Another of the jobs was to put the posters on the walls at night to raise the ghetto to arms, that type of thing. </sentence><sentence id="133">Q. How dangerous was that?A. It was very dangerous. </sentence><sentence id="134">First of all, there was a curfew. </sentence><sentence id="135">You know, we couldn't do it before the curfew. </sentence><sentence id="136">And if anybody was caught after the curfew, they were shot on the spot, no questions asked. </sentence><sentence id="137">And my father was very unhappy when I used to come home after curfew. </sentence><sentence id="138">It was at night, the two -- we were going in pairs, you know, one with a, with a, big wet brush, you This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="139">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="140"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection know, put the glue on, and the other putting the poster, and running, you know, from wall to wall to wall to wall. </sentence><sentence id="141">This was very, very dangerous, no question about it. </sentence><sentence id="142">For us it was a lark. </sentence><sentence id="143">But it was not. </sentence><sentence id="144">By the way, at that point, I must have been 13. </sentence><sentence id="145">This was about that frame. </sentence><sentence id="146">I was born in "28. </sentence><sentence id="147">I was 11 when the war broke out in "39, about 13 in "41,"42. </sentence><sentence id="148">Anyway, one day we got a call from Umschlagplatz. </sentence><sentence id="149">Umschlagplatz is the place where the Jews were gathered, waiting for the cattle cars to take them to the camps. </sentence><sentence id="150">That my father was caught. </sentence><sentence id="151">As he was coming back from work, paper or no paper, he was taken, and the whole commando was taken immediately to the Umschlagplatz. </sentence><sentence id="152">My father's boss was a German Wehrmacht captain, Hauptmann (ph) in German, I believe it is a captain in English. </sentence><sentence id="153">We gave him a call and we told him, look, my father was called to Umschlagplatz. </sentence><sentence id="154">I wish I could remember his name. </sentence><sentence id="155">I don't. </sentence><sentence id="156">He took his car and came to Umschlagplatz and told the young SS man: "Look, this man is working for me, I want him out now." </sentence><sentence id="157">And this young officer told him: "Look, I am not taking orders from you." </sentence><sentence id="158">He said: "I am a captain and you are a private." </sentence><sentence id="159">He said: "I don't care, my orders have to be in writing from the SS quarters." </sentence><sentence id="160">So the Hauptmann said: "Look" -- to us -- "tomorrow morning, first thing in the morning, I'm going to be back here with the proper paper. </sentence><sentence id="161">I will take your father out." </sentence><sentence id="162">What he didn't know that tomorrow would be too late because at that time the trains were going every night. </sentence><sentence id="163">Lo and behold, my father escaped from Umschlagplatz, I don't know how. </sentence><sentence id="164">The following day, he goes back to work. </sentence><sentence id="165">And he tells the Hauptmann: "Look, I have a wife and two daughters. </sentence><sentence id="166">You are here a group of soldiers, you are here in this building, surely they need some services performed on them, cleaning, laundry, cooking, whatever, why don't you take my wife and two daughters and they will help you here and we will all be here together." " </sentence><sentence id="167">Sure." </sentence><sentence id="168">Hauptmann says "That is no problem. </sentence><sentence id="169">But you have to arrange your papers through the arbeitsdienst," which was the ghetto Jewish equivalent of work exchange, you know, they were in charge of organizing the This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="170">It is not the

collection proper papers and what have you. </sentence><sentence id="172">So when my father went there, they thought my goodness, if this Hauptmann can save a family of four, surely he can accommodate more of us. </sentence><sentence id="173">They got in touch with him. </sentence><sentence id="174">And sure enough, he took 30 people and located them in this German barracks which were located in what used to be a Polish public school. </sentence><sentence id="175">The Polish public schools in Warsaw were all the same, you know, the buildings were built by the same -- in the same type of architecture. </sentence><sentence id="176">So the soldiers were in the whole building, and they gave us the quarters in the -- not the cellular, but just the ... mezzanine, kind of. </sentence><sentence id="177">It was called partair (ph) in Poland. </sentence><sentence id="178">It was just before -- the ground floor, okay, this is where we were, 30 people. </sentence><sentence id="179">We were all there working as Jews on the Aryan side. </sentence><sentence id="180">All, that is, except my sister Esther, for whom there was no room. </sentence><sentence id="181">So she stayed in the ghetto. </sentence><sentence id="182">Because she stayed in the ghetto, I got a pass to commute between the ghetto and the Aryan side, and I was going once a week. </sentence><sentence id="183">And I was still in Shomeratzayir, so I was able to come to bring some food for them, not much, whatever, share between my sister and between them, and I was still active in Shomeratzayir. </sentence><sentence id="184">Until one day, it was one of the most painful experiences for me, it seems so insignificant now but I still think about it, I was told by the Shomeratzayir people that because of security reasons, they can't afford guests, I have to make up my mind, either I am with them or I am not. </sentence><sentence id="185">So I had to decide to stay with Shomeratzayir and to leave my deaf parents alone. </sentence><sentence id="186">I couldn't do that. </sentence><sentence id="187">So I elected, of course, to go back to my parents. </sentence><sentence id="188">It was too late anyway. </sentence><sentence id="189">At that particular time, the hell broke loose. </sentence><sentence id="190">The Warsaw uprising was in full swing. </sentence><sentence id="191">My sister was across the street and I was in this little post. </sentence><sentence id="192">There were maybe four of us. </sentence><sentence id="193">There was one rifle. </sentence><sentence id="194">And my superior in Shomeratzayir, his name Shimmon Heller (ph), was with us. </sentence><sentence id="195">There were sniper shots all over. </sentence><sentence id="196">We didn't have radios. </sentence><sentence id="197">Our communicators were runners, young boys mostly, who were running from post to post to keep contact. </sentence><sentence id="198">One of the runners was running and Shimmon saw him down the street. </sentence><sentence id="199">He was shot and he was wounded. </sentence><sentence id="200">So Shimmon run to bring him back and he was This is a verbatim transcript

one for himself, finished. </sentence><sentence id="204">I want you to know that in Shomeratzayir we got orders not to be caught alive, that no matter what happens, we are not going to go on the trains alive. </sentence><sentence id="205">Those were the orders. </sentence><sentence id="206">This was the spirit of the uprising. </sentence><sentence id="207">So this runner said to me: "Look, we're going to run and we are going to run out." </sentence><sentence id="208">I said: "Okay. </sentence><sentence id="209">Come with me, my sister is across the street in our apartment." </sentence><sentence id="210">So we run to our apartment. </sentence><sentence id="211">On the third floor of this restored building -- at that point, the Germans were methodically blowing up and putting fires to every single building in the ghetto. </sentence><sentence id="212">In our apartment -- the building two away from us was burning. </sentence><sentence id="213">Our apartment was so hot, it was so smoky that we couldn't possibly stay there. </sentence><sentence id="214">The buildings in Warsaw were built in such a way that you had front of the building facing the street and each building had a square courtyard that you reach through the gate inside. </sentence><sentence id="215">And the whole life in Warsaw really took part in the courtyard rather than on the front. </sentence><sentence id="216">At that time, in our courtyard, there were the SS men, the Latvians. </sentence><sentence id="217">In the courtyard, they were with the rifle, with their rifles, screaming "raus, raus, raus," and shooting. </sentence><sentence id="218">And the smoke was so dense that you couldn't see. </sentence><sentence id="219">And people were jumping from all the windows right into the ground. </sentence><sentence id="220">There was no other way out. </sentence><sentence id="221">But because of the smoke, they couldn't see. </sentence><sentence id="222">My sister, the runner and I jumped from the third floor down into the asphalt-covered courtyard. </sentence><sentence id="223">We scraped our knees and elbows, nothing else. </sentence><sentence id="224">We kept on running, right through them. </sentence><sentence id="225">This runner knew the bunkers ways, the other ways, the little passages. </sentence><sentence id="226">And we were running through the burning ruins of the ghetto, through the part where the buildings used to stand but weren't standing anymore, into the sewers. </sentence><sentence id="227">And we can smell the gas chasing us. </sentence><sentence id="228">And we ran out into the alley inside and to go to our parents. ... </sentence><sentence id="229">My parents -- Q. When was that exactly? </sentence><sentence id="230">This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="231">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="232"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection A. This was possible ..."43, April. </sentence><sentence id="233">April 1943, this is where the, the whole battle with the Germans was going on. </sentence><sentence id="234">We stayed with our parents until May 5th, 1943. </sentence><sentence id="235">We were surrounded by the Germans and taken to Umschlagplatz and then we walked through the ruins. </sentence><sentence id="236">There wasn't one building left erect. </sentence><sentence id="237">The smell is indescribable. </sentence><sentence id="238">It is the smell of rubber, noxious. </sentence><sentence id="239">And now, if I ever smelled the smell of burning bodies -- and it was dark when we were walking. </sentence><sentence id="240">It had to be in the evening. </sentence><sentence id="241">And the ruins of the ghetto made it in mountain-like sights, and you could see on the top, people, single people, like rats, putting their head up, disappearing, looking at us, darting from one burning hole to another, like specters. </sentence><sentence id="242">We were, the 30 of us, taken to the Umschlagplatz, a sea of humanity. </sentence><sentence id="243">Everybody sitting and everybody clutching whatever possessions they packed on the way. </sentence><sentence id="244">We knew we didn't. </sentence><sentence id="245">Everybody had whatever precious things they had with them, a change of clothing. </sentence><sentence

baskets, what have you. </sentence><sentence id="248">You walk into the room, there were people sitting all around. </sentence><sentence id="249">The same thing, the same building that used to be the public school building before the war, Umschlagplatz was the same kind of building. </sentence><sentence id="250">Floors and floors, we were in one room. </sentence><sentence id="251">The Germans used to come in, call out the pretty girls. </sentence><sentence id="252">Esther, she went. </sentence><sentence id="253">She came back, she didn't say a word. </sentence><sentence id="254">I don't know what happened. </sentence><sentence id="255">And then, came the time that we were marched out to the cattle trains. </sentence><sentence id="256">You have a cattle train in the Washington museum.

car. </sentence><sentence id="263">At first, some people wanted to prevent the panic, to tell people look, people, organize, stand up, there is no room for everybody to sit, we take turns. </sentence><sentence id="264">There are two small little windows, we'll make turns, everybody will have a little bit of air. </sentence><sentence id="265">But it didn't work. </sentence><sentence id="266">People were in a panic. </sentence><sentence id="267">The young and strong were standing at the windows, blocking whatever air there was for the rest. </sentence><sentence id="268">My sister and I bodily had to fight the people from trampling over my mother, who was sitting in the corner. </sentence><sentence id="269">And my father got gray altogether completely. </sentence><sentence id="270">I don't know how long this trip took. </sentence><sentence id="271">I have no idea. </sentence><sentence id="272">It wasn't the lack of food or the toilet facility, it was the lack of water. </sentence><sentence id="273">There are always experts in any situations. </sentence><sentence id="274">Apparently we came to the fork of the road and someone said we are not going to Treblinka, we are saved, we are going to Auschwitz. </sentence><sentence id="275">This was the better of the two alternatives. </sentence><sentence id="276">There was a sigh of relief. </sentence><sentence id="277">No, we're not going to Treblinka, we're going to Majdanek, excuse me, to Majdanek, not to Treblinka, to Majdanek, that's the better of the two alternatives. </sentence><sentence id="278">We arrived in Majdanek. </sentence><sentence id="279">And where in Warsaw they have stairs that you can get up on, in Majdanek, they didn't. </sentence><sentence id="280">And it was very high from the train from the ground, and you had to jump. </sentence><sentence id="281">A meter, three feet, it was high, maybe more, don't know. </sentence><sentence id="282">It was raining when we arrived.

the Polish workers party, the underground Polish worker party, is planning to storm Auschwitz from the outside when the Russians will be here. </sentence><sentence id="404">And there is underground in

id="407">In the summer 1944, I believe, Hungarian transport came to Auschwitz. </sentence><sentence id="408">From where we were, we saw thousands and thousands of people marching just across the barbed wire, the electrical wire. </sentence><sentence id="409">There were four crematoriums in Birkenau. </sentence><sentence id="410">They were burning day and night, smoke and fire belching out. </sentence><sentence id="411">But our soup in the camp was better. </sentence><sentence id="412">Because whatever food was gathered from the transport was thrown into the soup, so we had pieces of biscuits that we hadn't before. </sentence><sentence id="413">By periodical selections in Birkenau, whenever there were transports, they used to weed out the camp population, those that could no

</sentence><sentence id="428">This was it, we passed the selection. </sentence><sentence id="429">And this was at the same time because whatever manpower that was depleted by selection was replaced by the new people from the transport. </sentence><sentence id="430">It was a supply and demand situation. </sentence><sentence id="431">At the time, when we heard about the preparation for the revolt, we were thinking what can we do, what are we going to do. </sentence><sentence id="432">We secured the keys to the shed where the agricultural supplies were kept, hoes, rakes, things like this. </sentence><sentence id="433">We remember from history lessons that in 1862, in the resurrection in Poland, the farmers fought armed with the rakes and hoes, they made a difference. </sentence><sentence id="434">And we were going to make the difference too, we had the keys, we were prepared. </sentence><sentence id="435">And then, as we were working in the union, and my sister was working in a place which was called pulver room, where the gunpowder was kept. </sentence><sentence id="436">Okay, we have gunpowder, we can use it. </sentence><sentence id="437">My sister was

12 inches long, six inches wide, just about, and we used to put them in the boxes and periodically throw them in the garbage bins that were situated at the corners of the big halls.

into my place, take the powder out, stuff it in my dress. </sentence><sentence id="457">And our guard, we had a system of communication, you needed permission to go to the toilet. </sentence><sentence id="458">But when you say I am going to the toilet, you make sure you come there at the same time. </sentence><sentence id="459">And we used to divide this in the toilet and take it with us and pray. </sentence><sentence id="460">It was three and a half kilometers between union -- within Auschwitz and Birkenau, and union factory was just next door to Auschwitz. </sentence><sentence id="461">We used to carry it and sometimes we used to have searches. </sentence><sentence id="462">So when they were looking for contraband, if anybody had parcels, food parcels, what have you. </sentence><sentence id="463">We always made sure that we were not in the first five rows. </sentence><sentence id="464">There were, I believe, 1,000 of us in the rows of five, okay. </sentence><sentence id="465">I can't figure it out how many rows there were. </sentence><sentence id="466">But we always tried to make a row of five, the same five, and make sure we are in the middle, not the beginning, not the end, so that if something happens, we will know ahead of time. </sentence><sentence id="467">We used to take this gunpowder, take the cord off behind our backs, throw it on the ground and rub it with our feet. </sentence><sentence id="468">It would rub in with the dirt because the gun powder are granules, grayish, and they blended in. </sentence><sentence

We used to -- we were very privileged working in the union. </sentence><sentence id="481">It was considered a very good commando in terms of relative good or bad in the camp situation. </sentence><sentence id="482">It was good because working in the union, we were no longer subject to selections. </sentence><sentence id="483">This in itself was very important. </sentence><sentence id="484">We were woken in the middle of the night, when it was still dark. </sentence><sentence id="485">I couldn't tell you the hour, 4:00, 5:00. </sentence><sentence id="486">We all had to look good. </sentence><sentence id="487">We knew that we had to look good, so we used to have our dresses folded properly under the mattresses so that when we get up in the morning, they were nice and didn't look crumpled. </sentence><sentence id="488">We had wooden shoes that had to be spic and span. </sentence><sentence id="489">During the morning, we used to get what we call -- what was called chi (ph), which is a kind of a herbal tea that they used to make from the weeds that were growing around there. </sentence><sentence id="490">It was warm. </sentence><sentence id="491">It wasn't drinkable, but we drank it. </sentence><sentence id="492">But most of all, we used to wash ourselves with it, and polish our shoes. </sentence><sentence id="493">It was impossible to go to the communal washroom at that time because people were fighting at the door to get in. </sentence><sentence id="494">And every building had a responsible person, which was called the kapo. </sentence><sentence id="495">A kapo was responsible. </sentence><sentence id="496">So you had a washroom kapo, you had a commando kapo, whatever. </sentence><sentence id="497">If you were good friends with her or something, she would let you in first. </sentence><sentence id="498">If not, she will just beat you up to go back in the line. </sentence><sentence id="499">So we simply didn't even bother. </sentence><sentence id="500">We used the chi, this tea, to get washed with and to drink with. </sentence><sentence id="501">Then, we were to stand up in the lines of five outside for a roll call. </sentence><sentence id="502">It was called appell. </sentence><sentence id="503">It was terrible because Birkenau is built on a plane and, for some reason, it's always very, very windy. </sentence><sentence id="504">And you didn't want to be exposed to the wind and the cold, because your feet and your hands, your extremity in particular, used to freeze just from standing and just from the cold. </sentence><sentence id="505">We had to stand there for hours. </sentence><sentence id="506">While before the SS people came to count us, we could still huddle each other, you know, and cover each other and warm each other up. </sentence><sentence id="507">But when they used to come, then we had to stand straight. </sentence><sentence id="508">And then we were checked for proper attire and the clean shoes and what have you. </sentence><sentence id="509">So you went through different checks. </sentence><sentence id="510">The blockaltester, which was responsible for our block,

of us was not -- it was like a military kind of an operation, you know. </sentence><sentence id="513">And then the SS woman that was counting us was -- would look at us, going through the rows and look. </sentence><sentence id="514">We used to stand there for hours and hours and hours. </sentence><sentence id="515">We used to take our wooden shoes off because they would scrape our feet. </sentence><sentence id="516">And if it scraped your feet, you would get a blister. </sentence><sentence id="517">And when you got a blister, you were subject for selection. </sentence><sentence id="518">You know, it was -- you really had to take good care of yourself. </sentence><sentence id="519">I remember at one point we threw out our mattresses, and we used to sleep on the wood, because the mattresses were full of lice and lice had disease, and so -- anyway, so we used to be there on the roll call. </sentence><sentence id="520">After the roll call, we used -- I believe that we had -- each commando had a different color of kerchief. </sentence><sentence id="521">We all had kerchiefs. </sentence><sentence id="522">I believe that ours were white, but I'm not sure. </sentence><sentence id="523">So we looked, quote, smart, you know, always the same kind of dresses, with the wooden shoes, with the white kerchief, that we were marching left and right and left and right. </sentence><sentence id="524">And as you know, we had an orchestra. </sentence><sentence id="525">And the orchestra was playing near the gate where we were walking out. </sentence><sentence id="526">The SS men watching us with dogs. </sentence><sentence id="527">But those dogs were quiet for the union commando, you know, it was okay. </sentence><sentence id="528">And then we walked the three and a half kilometers from Birkenau to union, which was short distance from Auschwitz. </sentence><sentence id="529">But there's three and a half kilometers between Auschwitz and Birkenau, so I estimate, you know, maybe the most three and a half, four kilometers. </sentence><sentence id="530">It is not very long, but when you are tired and when you already stood for a few hours outside and you are cold, you had to really start working your feet and your legs to march from the -- they were falling asleep and they were cold, before you started to walk. </sentence><sentence id="531">It was a long walk for us then. </sentence><sentence id="532">Then we used to go five by five, each one, to her particular spot in the factory. </sentence><sentence id="533">There was a large corridor as you walked in, very large. </sentence><sentence id="534">I would say that it would take about -- we were in the rows of five, it would easily take another row of five, you know, we took half the width of

the term, but this is when they had the dispensary of the tools, so we used to pass that. </sentence><sentence id="538">It was separated from the corridor with chicken wire fence, kind of. </sentence><sentence id="539">On the right-hand side, you had the offices, you had the toilets, you had the showers, you had the storage rooms. </sentence><sentence id="540">And my particular post was just on the left, just across from the big, big, presses. </sentence><sentence id="541">They were gigantic, huge, what were called Kuntztof (ph) presses that manufactured the parts that went into the final product. </sentence><sentence id="542">I still don't know exactly what it is that they manufactured, something, you know, in terms of armament, but I don't know exactly what. </sentence><sentence id="543">So the presses were, as you walked on the left-hand side, our tables were on the right-hand side. </sentence><sentence id="544">Behind our bags was a glass partition from the second department. </sentence><sentence id="545">And I remember when I first came in, I thought, you know, they are so inefficient. </sentence><sentence id="546">There was a space between this glass wall and our stools and the tables. </sentence><sentence id="547">I said well, why didn't they put it all the way back? </sentence><sentence id="548">And then I realized that they didn't so that they would have room to go behind our backs and check what we are doing. </sentence><sentence id="549">I was working in some kind of a control. </sentence><sentence id="550">We had little pieces that looked like checkers. </sentence><sentence id="551">They were called einsatz schtuker (ph), whatever that means. </sentence><sentence id="552">And we were sitting in a row, there were about eight girls at our table, each one had in front of her a precision instrument that was checking for the perfection of this checkered piece. </sentence><sentence id="553">It had many indentations, and each
