<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="63">A: From -- we knew that there were Jews who were passing from Greece on their way to Palestine or other places. </sentence><sentence id="64">And I remember in 1938 a friend of my father told him that in case of need, I would like you to change your identity and you and your family go to the house of my father in a remote mountain village. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="67">Q: Did you think that was a possibility? </sentence><sentence id="68">Did your family think that was really going to happen? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="71">A: Well, at that time seeing what it was happening in Germany, and seeing that we had a fascist dictatorship in Greece, everything was possible, yes. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="73">Q: Mm-hm. </sentence><sentence id="74">Did you experience anti-Semitism as a young boy? </sentence><sentence id="75">This is before the Italians came, before the Germans came. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="79">A: No, the -- the first time I was aware that there was something different if you are a Jew, was when I was going to the Jewish school, and we went for a parade, and then, although we came to the staging point quite early, we had to wait and I didn't like that. </sentence><sentence id="80">So I told the teacher why are we waiting, and other schools have come after us and they pass. </sentence><sentence id="81">And the teacher, who happened to be a Christian, said we are the Jewish school, that's why we have to wait. </sentence><sentence id="82">So I realized that being a Jew was not a good thing. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="88">Q: Did that bother you? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="90">A: Of course. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="92">Q: Did you go home and talk to your parents about it, or -- </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="93">A: I don't remember that. </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="94">Q: And did you talk with the other kids about it, or wa -- this was -- </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="95">A: My -- I don't remember that either. </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="96">Q: When you moved to Agrinio in 1940, yes? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="98">A: Yes. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="100">Q: There were very few Jews in that town. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="102">A: That's correct, there were only 40 Jews in Agrinio, while there were almost 2000 in Ioannina, so there was a big difference. </sentence><sentence id="103">Agrinio was called also Vrahori, or Evraiohori, which means a Jewish village. </sentence><sentence id="104">Why? </sentence><sentence id="105">Because in 1821, there were 200 Jewish families in Agrinio. </sentence><sentence id="106">And what happened to these 200 Jewish families, I think has significant meaning and it explains in my opinion why there were so few Greek righteous Gentiles in the second World War. </sentence><sentence id="107">I counted in the Yad Vashem list something like 124 names plus 40 spouses. </sentence><sentence id="108">And in my experience, I know of 12 other righteous Gentiles who should be in that list, and they are not. </sentence><sentence id="109">But still the numbers are very small. </sentence><sentence id="110">And then, in addition to that, the losses of the Greek Jews were great. </sentence><sentence id="111">89 percent were transported outside of Greece and 87 percent were killed, or 67,000 Jews. </sentence><sentence id="112">So what happened in 1821 was a very little known historic event. </sentence><sentence id="113">The Turks killed in Istanbul the Greek patriarch of Constantinople. </sentence><sentence id="114">And they forced four Jewish porters to throw his body to the sea. </sentence><sentence id="115">When this became known to what was then Greece, and at that time Greece was much smaller than it is now, the 5000 Jews of Greece were massacred. </sentence><sentence id="116">A few who survived were converted to Christianity. </sentence><sentence id="117">One of the leaders of the Greek nation, Kanellos Deligiannis was a great righteous Gentile of that period, and he saved 12 Jews whom he hid in his house in Tripolitsa. </sentence><sentence id="118">The anti- Jewish feelings of the population were so strong that Deligiannis was forced to keep these 12 Jews hidden in his house for three years. </sentence><sentence id="119">And only in 1824 he was able to secretly move them to the Ionian Island of Zakinthos which it was not then under Greek control. </sentence><sentence id="120">So, going back to Agrinio and the 40 Jews, these people have come mainly from Arta. </sentence><sentence id="121">There were many small merchants and one of them was a teacher who during the war became one of the five leaders of the resistance in our area. </sentence><sentence id="122">His name was Yunas Munis. </sentence><sentence id="123">I would say about Agrinio that Agrinio has the distinct honor of being possibly the only city in German occupied Europe where all the Jews did not obey any German regulations and they all survived. </sentence><sentence id="124">And I really can't think of any other city where something like that happened, but I should say that we were very fortunate that we did not have a rabbi, and we did not have any community leaders, because in Greece the rabbis and community leaders, with one or two very rare exceptions proved to be totally incapable of facing the problems that the German occupation presented. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="149">Q: Did you -- did you move to Agrinion before the Italians attacked Greece? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="151">A: That -- that -- that's correct, the -- we moved in Agrinion sometime in March of 1940, and yeah, Italy attacked Greece on October 28", 1940. </sentence><sentence id="152">About this war I would like to say that the Jewish -- Greek Jewish participation was great. </sentence><sentence id="153">Out of 77,000 Jews, 12,800 were -- served in the army, and that included my father and many of my relatives. </sentence><sentence id="154">Over 500 were killed, including a cousin of my mother's. </sentence><sentence id="155">Over 3,700 were wounded, including at least two or three of our relatives. </sentence><sentence id="156">To these numbers I would like to add the 1,600 Jewish Palestinian volunteers who served with the British expeditionary force. </sentence><sentence id="157">And one of them was the father of the former Prime Minister of Israel, Shimon Peres, and he was not able to be evacuated with the British and he became a partisan of ELAS. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="166">Q: Mm-hm. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="168">A: I would like also to say that the greatest Greek hero of the second World War was a Greek Jewish colonel, Mordechai Frizis, who, with his troops, stopped the Italian advance, giving the allies their first victory of the second World War. </sentence><sentence id="169">Mordechai Frizis was killed. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="172">Q: I don't know when this happened, you joined a national youth organization that was actually a fascist organization -- </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="173">A: Ah, yes, that -- that's -- </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="174">Q: -- can you -- </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="175">A: -- that's quite -- </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="176">Q: -- talk about that some? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="178">A: -- yes. </sentence><sentence id="179">In Agrinion we were only two Jewish boys among 1,000 students in the -- the high school. </sentence><sentence id="180">And I'm grateful to the people who were in charge, because every able bodied boy was a member of the youth -- the fascist youth organization. </sentence><sentence id="181">And I'm grateful to them for not knowing that Jews were not allowed to join that fascist organization, or knowingly they allowed us to join them. </sentence><sentence id="182">I know that I was going around giving the fascist salute f -- until the war started. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="188">Q: And why were you glad that no one kicked you out, or -- </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="189">A: Because I never liked to be discriminated against. </sentence><sentence id="190">So being a fascist suit me fine, although I did not realize that it was so bad at that time. </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="191">Q: And what were you doing in the organization? </sentence><sentence id="192">O -- th-they obviously didn't talk about Jews or do racial things, did they? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="195">A: No, no, they -- they did not. </sentence><sentence id="196">They -- w-we would parade, we would -- we -- we had lectures about Greek nationalism. </sentence><sentence id="197">Th-There was nothing offensive as far as I know at that time, you know, about th-this organization. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="201">Q: So you were about 10 years old? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="203">A: Yes. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="205">Q: And how long were you in that group? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="207">A: Until October 1940. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="209">Q: So when the Italians attacked? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="211">A: Yes, then the school actually closed, and we were very glad that the classes ended, without realizing what the war meant. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="213">Q: So school closed in October -- </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="214">A: Yes. </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="215">Q: -- or November. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="217">A: And a -- when the war started it closed, and then it started again in -- in other buildings, some warehouses, because the school buildings were used as hospitals. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="219">Q: So did you then go back to school? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="221">A: Yes, yes. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="223">Q: And with the same teachers and the same kids? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="225">A: Yes, everything the same. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="227">Q: So the fact that there were two Jewish students in the high school, the Italians did not kick out the Jewish students? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="229">A: The Italians? </sentence><sentence id="230">F-First of all, remember that the war started on October 28", but the -- and the Germans attacked in April of 1941. </sentence><sentence id="231">Only after that time the Germans first, and the Italians second, came. </sentence><sentence id="232">The Italians were excellent in Greece. </sentence><sentence id="233">While in Italy the 50,000 Jews lost their civil rights in 1938 with Mussolini's Aryan manif -- manifesto, in Greece, thanks to the Italian commander general Carlo Geroso, we enjoyed all civil liberties. </sentence><sentence id="234">The -- we were able to -- to go to -- to the -- to school, while the Italians were not able to do that. </sentence><sentence id="235">Actually there were 94 Italian university professors who were dismissed, five Italian Jewish admirals, and five Italian Jewish generals who were dismissed. </sentence><sentence id="236">But in Greece we enjoyed all freedom and Carlo Geroso refused to cooperate with General Lohr, Alexander Lohr, the German general in the persecution of the Jews. </sentence><sentence id="237">So we were very happy with the Italians, and we -- we lived a very normal life in the Italian zone, business was as usual, we went to the movies, and my mother was making cookies which a neighbor of hers, Maria Demardi used to send to partisan hospitals, once the partisan movement became stronger. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="248">Q: So between 1940 and 1942, life does not change very much. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="250">A: Life was absolutely beautiful for us under the -- under the Italians. </sentence><sentence id="251">And there -- there was one moment that the Italians asked us to register, and none thought anything of it, and they registered, and I know of only one person from Preveza who did not trust the Italians, only one. </sentence><sentence id="252">And he took his parents and went into hiding. </sentence><sentence id="253">Th-That's how he survived later on the Germans. </sentence><sentence id="254">But we registered. </sentence><sentence id="255">And -- I'm ashamed to say that. </sentence><sentence id="256">And 30 years later I found out that Mussolini made a deal with the Germans that they were supposed to -- to arrest us, and move us to camps in the Ionian Islands and Italy. </sentence><sentence id="257">But of course, you know, Italy capitulated and this did not happen, but the Germans came. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="266">Q: You know, you wrote in your book that you, at first the family, it seemed, had hoped that the Germans would occupy rather than the Italians because you thought they would be better. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="268">Q: That's another unfortunate kind of thinking in Greece, but remember that in Greece at least 30 to 40 percent of population were pro-German. </sentence><sentence id="269">That's a significant number. </sentence><sentence id="270">And because the -- the Greeks defeated the Italians in Albania, we were afraid that the Italians might come there and be vindictive, while the -- the Germans actually did not find significant resistance because many Greek generals were pro-German. </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="271">Q: So you were surprised? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="273">A: We were surprised that the Italians behaved in such a nice way. </sentence><sentence id="274">I have to say that the Germans behaved very well too, when they entered our area. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="277">Q: And they entered your area in April of nin -- deg43? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="279">A: Yes. </sentence><sentence id="280">Sometime at the end of April, 40 -- 41. </sentence><sentence id="281">Only in Salonica they did not behave well, but in our area they passed through and they did not bother anybody. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="285">Q: But your -- your area was the Italian zone? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="287">A: [happened to be -- because my father was mobilized, we were in -- in Ioannina when the Germans came in first. </sentence><sentence id="288">And they behaved very well, they did not bother anybody, although the Jewish community of 2,000 approximately, people existed there, and they -- they ju -- simply passed. </sentence><sentence id="289">And then the Italians came, and they behaved very well. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="293">Q: So you moved back from Agrinion to -- </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="294">A: Yes, from -- from Ioannina, once my father became a civilian again, we moved to Agrini, and my father went back to his bank. </sentence><sentence id="295">In other words, the Germans passed through Ioannina -- </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="296">Q: In 741? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="298">A: In "41, and since this was the Italian zone of occupation, they did not stay. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="300">Q: Right. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="302">A: The Italians were in charge until September of 1943. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="304">Q: Right. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="306">A: Then, once Italy capitulated, the Germans came in. </sentence><sentence id="307">When they came in Agrinio and they -- they loved the fact that the Italians were so afraid of the resistance and they had their buildings fortified, and with all kinds of guns around them, and they wanted to give a good lesson to the resistance. </sentence><sentence id="308">So 120 elite German troops went on 12 trucks and they moved straight towards the headquarters of the partisans in the city of Thermi. </sentence><sentence id="309">What they did not know was that this lady I mentioned before with the cookies, Maria Demardi, who was fluent in German, had become the interpreter for the German commander of Agrini. </sentence><sentence id="310">The partisans were waiting. </sentence><sentence id="311">Out of 120 Germans, one wounded motorcyclist returned to Agrinion, and he -- even he died in -- within two days. </sentence><sentence id="312">And the Germans tried to keep it secret, and they did not even retaliate or shoot any hostages. </sentence><sentence id="313">Well, they learned their lesson and that meant that in the future they would not dare to go to the mountains unless they had a very strong force, which served us very well later on. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="322">Q: So, how did your life change once the Italians capitulated? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="324">A: Well, from one point of view, you didn't -- it did not change much. </sentence><sentence id="325">There were little things, like for example, the -- we had the neighbor, the director of the bank of agriculture, whose in -- in -- the Germans wanted to -- to buy one of -- one room in his house. </sentence><sentence id="326">His mother wanted somebody to go there while the Germans were in the house. </sentence><sentence id="327">She selected me. </sentence><sentence id="328">So here I am, a 15 year old Jewish boy, going there, you know, to protect the old mother. </sentence><sentence id="329">I find a very handsome, young German, very polite, and I thought we became friends because since he did not know Greek, and I did not know German, we played with the word good. </sentence><sentence id="330">And we figured out we knew it in Latin, ancient Greek, German, Fr-French, Italian, Spanish. </sentence><sentence id="331">I -- I knew it in Hebrew too, but I kept my mouth shut. </sentence><sentence id="332">And then all of a sudden I said, English, good. </sentence><sentence id="333">And the German became furious and he slapped me. </sentence><sentence id="334">The mistake that I made was that I was thinking in terms of the word </sentence></p><p><sentence id="335"> good, and he was thinking in terms of people good. </sentence><sentence id="336">And obviously he didn't like the English people. </sentence><sentence id="337">So I -- I understood that something was wrong. </sentence><sentence id="338">Another thing that happened was I was sitting in the balcony of my -- our apartment, and I saw a German chasing a young man who obviously was a -- a man of the resistance and he was shooting at him. </sentence><sentence id="339">The German entered the courtyard of the house following the resistance man. </sentence><sentence id="340">The -- the man of the resistance passed through the first floor apartments and jumped out of the window right under my balcony. </sentence><sentence id="341">The German entered the courtyard and he saw the stairs leading to our house, and the door was open. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="342">He ran through there, passed through a corridor, came right next to me in the balcony. </sentence><sentence id="343">He aimed at the resistance man down below, and he pressed the trigger. </sentence><sentence id="344">The gun jumped. </sentence><sentence id="345">The German looked at me to see whether I was happy, but I was petrified. </sentence><sentence id="346">So he looked at this guy in disgust, and he left. </sentence><sentence id="347">Another thing that -- that happened was the Germans would send German soldiers to search the houses for weapons. </sentence><sentence id="348">And I remember a very polite, middle aged German knocked at the door, my mother opened the door. </sentence><sentence id="349">He indicated he wanted to search, he opened one drawer, and my mother pretended that he was an honored guest and she treated him the way the -- a -- a guest is supposed to be treated in Greece by offering him some sweets, you know, in a little plate with a spoon and a glass of water. </sentence><sentence id="350">The German felt embarrassed. </sentence><sentence id="351">He did not search anything else. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="352">He bowed politely and he left. </sentence><sentence id="353">Another little -- </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="354">Q: Were you -- were you there -- </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="355">A: I was there, yes. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="357">Q: -- at the time? </sentence><sentence id="358">Were you frightened? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="361">A: No, I wouldn't -- I mean, with the exception of the slap, that wasn't a very strong, I -- I didn't have any bad experience. </sentence><sentence id="362">The next thing that happened was we bought a horse load of wheat. </sentence><sentence id="363">And the villager who brought the horse with the wheat told my father, in this bag there is a gun    and ammunition for your friend Christos Bokoros, who was one of the leaders of the resistance. </sentence><sentence id="364">Well, my father wanted to get rid of the gun as soon as possible. </sentence><sentence id="365">So within a few minutes I had a basket with the gun, the ammunition and some other unimportant items, and I was supposed to go to the house of Bokoros. </sentence><sentence id="366">My father thought I was going to go through the back streets. </sentence><sentence id="367">Not me. </sentence><sentence id="368">I went through the -- through the main street, through the main square of Agrinion. </sentence><sentence id="369">I even touched a German as I was passing. </sentence><sentence id="370">And I realized that what I was doing was dangerous only when I gave the gun to the sister of Bokoros, and I saw how -- how frightened she was. </sentence><sentence id="371">So basically that's how our life was until one day -- Yunas Munis that I mentioned before, the teacher, went to my father and told him, you know something, the -- one of the merchants, I think it was either Misann or Munis, went on business to Athens to buy merchandise. </sentence><sentence id="372">And he found out that all the Jewish shops were closed, and he was told that the Jews went into hiding. </sentence><sentence id="373">So he came back to us, and he told everybody, and we are all going to leave, and I'm leaving tomorrow morning. </sentence><sentence id="374">So we -- although we didn't know why the Jews went into hiding, we were not going to -- to wait. </sentence><sentence id="375">And we got ready to go, but we didn't know where to go. </sentence><sentence id="376">So we asked one neighbor who was a right wing man. </sentence><sentence id="377">He told us to go to Arta, and from Arta to go to the area of -- of Zerbes, General Zerbes who was the right wing partisans. </sentence><sentence id="378">The only problem is how -- how do you go from Agrinio to Arta, you know, it was a good idea, but it's not possible to -- there was no real transportation and up til that time, we were using mainly Italian cars for the movement to different cities. </sentence><sentence id="379">So we asked our other friend, Christos Bokoros, who was with the left wing resistance, and he said, well, come to our house, and I will provide transportation. </sentence><sentence id="380">In 0 - - in other words, in -- in Greece, even a f -- a f -- man like my father, who was an assimilated Jew with -- all his friends were Christians, you know, because they would not -- he didn't have that much in common with the little merchants who were there. </sentence><sentence id="381">We were friendly, but all his friends were Christians. </sentence><sentence id="382">Still, we did not know what to do, we needed help. </sentence><sentence id="383">So we went to the house of Bokoros, and he was going to provide transportation with horses, but all the horses disappeared because a battle was taking place, and both sides used all available forces. </sentence><sentence id="384">And my father, who was a good bank employee, he wanted to give his books in good order to the director of the bank, and transfer also the money. </sentence><sentence id="385">And he was wasting time. </sentence><sentence id="386">A -- a German soldier entered the house of Bokoros to just look around. </sentence><sentence id="387">The Bokoros family became scared. </sentence><sentence id="388">So one of the Bokoros boys went to the bank and he told the director, and saw Mr. Matsas working there, if anything happens to him, I will consider you responsible. </sentence><sentence id="389">The director, knowing that the Bokoros family was with resistance told him I -- I don't keep him here, I will sign everything away. </sentence><sentence id="390">Sure enough, he signed the money -- for the money and everything without even counting it, and my father went to wait with [indecipherable] in the house. </sentence><sentence id="391">Well there, since h-he couldn't find any horses, he go, how about a taxi? </sentence><sentence id="392">Sure enough, he brought the taxi there, we loaded all our food supplies, clothing and everything else, and put it -- some more people in the taxi, and we left in style. </sentence><sentence id="393">Within minutes we were at the control point, a German soldier checked the identity cards of the people. </sentence><sentence id="394">The driver gave to the German some cookies and raisins, and that was the last German I saw. </sentence><sentence id="395">Nobody had violated any rules or regulations, and nothing was punishable, there was no crime involved. </sentence><sentence id="396">We simply went out, and that was it. </sentence><sentence id="397">Within minutes we saw the first partisan of ELAS. </sentence><sentence id="398">And I have to say I took a look at his hat, and I saw the word ELAS and I thought I discovered a spelling mistake. </sentence><sentence id="399">Ellas, which means Greece, is written with two l's, and he had ELAS with one | because this was the ethnic [indecipherable] status, meaning Greek liberation army. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="441">Q: And what was the politics of that -- of that liberation army? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="443">A: We knew nothing. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="445">Q: You knew nothing. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="447">A: We knew nothing. </sentence><sentence id="448">All we knew that these people were fighting the Germans and only actually after the war we found out that many of the leaders were communists. </sentence><sentence id="449">But they were fighting the Germans, the -- they did not know any more than we did, and all I know is that they had beautiful songs which I loved and I still sing. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="453">Q: Would you sing one of those for us? </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="463">A: All right. </sentence><sentence id="464">I will give you the translation first. </sentence><sentence id="465">One of them starts like that, that there's thunder in the mount of Olympus, and there is lightening in the mouth -- th-the mount of Jonah. </sentence><sentence id="466">The mountain [indecipherable] are roaring and [indecipherable] is shaking. </sentence><sentence id="467">And then it extols him, asks all the people to take up arms and fight for freedom. </sentence><sentence id="468">So, [sings in Greek here]. </sentence><sentence id="469">That's one of them. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="477">Q: That's very nice. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="479">A: So, with a taxi we went to the end of the road, s-some 30 miles away from Agrinio. </sentence><sentence id="480">And then we rented horses, because we wanted to be as far away from roads as possible. </sentence><sentence id="481">And we pass through really unmarked paths, there were no wheels in that village of Psilovrahos. </sentence><sentence id="482">The people there, unless they went to a city, they never saw a wheel, because it was very difficult terrain on the slopes of a mountain. </sentence><sentence id="483">But very beautiful, overlooking a river, which now became a -- a lake, thanks to a dam that they made. </sentence><sentence id="484">We went there as students. </sentence><sentence id="485">We knew that nobody would bother us because the village was very well organized in terms of the resistance. </sentence><sentence id="486">Th-There -- there was - - there was active ELAS, which were the partisans, and there was reserve ELAS. </sentence><sentence id="487">So there were organizations for the men, for the women, everything was organized. </sentence><sentence id="488">So -- so it was a nice place </sentence></p><p><sentence id="489"> to be. </sentence><sentence id="490">We brought with us a lot of supplies to last us for a year. </sentence><sentence id="491">The problem was that in November, the Germans decided to go on a search and destroy mission, and the -- we were notified ahead of time -- the villagers were not afraid that anything would happen to them, but we -- and in the meantime I should say some more Jews came to -- to the village, knowing that we were there. </sentence><sentence id="492">There were two men, and another three people, a couple and a old man who did not even know Greek, he was a ship tycoon, Aaron Romano, who was speaking in French rather than Greek. </sentence><sentence id="493">And so we were -- </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="494">Q: Can I -- can I interrupt for one moment? </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="495">A: Certainly. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="497">Q: When you got to the village, how did you get a place to stay? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="499">A: We rented. </sentence><sentence id="500">We rented a room. </sentence><sentence id="501">This -- we had with us plenty of money. </sentence><sentence id="502">My father unfortunately had only cash. </sentence><sentence id="503">He did not have any gold, that was a big mistake, because thanks to inflation, the money lost all it's value within months. </sentence><sentence id="504">So we rented a place, we acted like tourists. </sentence><sentence id="505">We didn't hide the fact that we were Jews. </sentence><sentence id="506">As a matter of fact we were going to the church every Sunday because we didn't want the -- the people to think that we were different, with the exception of the fact that we would not make the sign of the cross, or eat the wafers, or the pieces of bread that y-you know, a -- a Christian is supposed to -- to have at the end of the service. </sentence><sentence id="507">So with the exception of that, we were very friendly with the priest, who used to come to my mother's place because we were the only ones who had coffee, and he liked to have coffee. </sentence><sentence id="508">And the life was beautiful, and the -- it was li-like a vacation, until the Germans came. </sentence><sentence id="509">When they came, we -- by now we were f-four of us, and two, six, we were nine -- four, seven -- we became 10 Jews in the village. </sentence><sentence id="510">And we decided, and the people of the resistance told us that we should go higher up, and they told us that there is a house very high up in the mountain of 300 feet, and you should go there and stay there. </sentence><sentence id="511">So there were only two little donkeys that could be used for -- for supplies. </sentence><sentence id="512">So we loaded a little donkey, but un-unfortunately we had to leave all our supplies in the room. </sentence><sentence id="513">And we went to the -- to the top of the -- of the mountain, to the house of [indecipherable] and we stayed there, and the Germans stayed in the village for -- I -- I should add that Mrs. [indecipherable] Levy, a socialite from Athens decided she had enough, she wasn't going to go any -- any further, and she stayed in the village. </sentence><sentence id="514">And she spoke fluently German and French. </sentence><sentence id="515">And she spoke with the German officers very, very well, and -- and n-none of them asked her how come a lady like her ends up in a village like that. </sentence><sentence id="516">And -- and it didn't take long and the Germans left, and we came back. </sentence><sentence id="517">When we came back, we found out that we lost all our supplies. </sentence><sentence id="518">Now, the owner of the house, who has a reputation as a thief claimed that it was the Germans who took it, who took everything. </sentence><sentence id="519">My mother went right into their house and searched and she found some of our items. </sentence><sentence id="520">The -- later on we found out when the villagers made the report as to how -- what things they lost, it was mainly bottles of Ouzo, bottles of wine, and they would say, with the entire bottle. </sentence><sentence id="521">Because for them the bottle was more precious than the contents of Ouzo and wine, which they could make by themselves. </sentence><sentence id="522">Therefore, I'm convinced that it was this man, [indecipherable] who was the thief, and not the Germans. </sentence><sentence id="523">But we knew that the partisans, in order to establish some sort of tranquility and -- and e-eliminate [indecipherable] and fear, they have killed even a partisan who stole a -- a chicken. </sentence><sentence id="524">And therefore, we decided to keep quiet, not to report him [indecipherable] the family. </sentence><sentence id="525">We wouldn't want to be responsible for an execution. </sentence><sentence id="526">And we thought, well, we have more supplies in Agrinion and we will bring them. </sentence><sentence id="527">Unfortunately we were not able to bring as many supplies as we needed, so we had some starvation later on. </sentence><sentence id="528">Now, the fact that Mrs. [indecipherable] Levy decided to stay and the Germans were very polite, turned against us the following month, because the Germans made three attempts at research -- at search and destroy operations. </sentence><sentence id="529">In November, in December, and in the following August. </sentence><sentence id="530">So, in December there was another alarm that the Germans were approaching. </sentence><sentence id="531">This time, Mrs.[indecipherable] Levy persuaded my mother that the Germans are not dangerous they behaved so well. </sentence><sentence id="532">My mother didn't like the idea of going up to the mountain, but also, she didn't want to abandon our supplies for fear that -- that they will be stolen again, although we had to change rooms because this man not only he resented the fact that we called him a thief, especially after we found things hidden in his house, but he asked us to leave because we insulted him. </sentence><sentence id="533">He didn't realize that we saved his life. </sentence><sentence id="534">And we moved to another room that we also rented. </sentence><sentence id="535">So my mother decided to -- to help Mrs. [indecipherable] Levy in her room, since the knew German so well, and -- and stay there. </sentence><sentence id="536">But a neighbor who saw that, told the lady -- she was a -- a [indecipherable] a former policeman and his son was a partisan and he told them, what makes you believe that there will be the same Germans, or they will became -- they will be just as polite as they were before, or they might not have orders to ar-arrest you as suspicious individuals. </sentence><sentence id="537">So she forced them to come up to the mountain lake with it, but fortunately the Germans did not come this second time in the village. </sentence><sentence id="538">Are you curious about what happened the third time, in August? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="582">Q: Well, did anything happen in between? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="584">A: In-- </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="585">Q: Between February and August? </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="586">A: -- in between, with the exception that we faced starvation because the -- the war between the Germans and the partisans intensified, and while before it was so easy to get in and out of Agrinion, it became more difficult. </sentence><sentence id="587">So the end result was that -- that it was not easy to send a villager in the bank where my father had stored his supplies and get from a -- one his friends there, who was -- he was -- it's -- it's hard to understand that, but the bank was trying to help the employees even with food supplies. </sentence><sentence id="588">So one of the rooms in the bank had food, and an employee would take care of food distribution to the employees of the bank. </sentence><sentence id="589">So this man also had our supplies with instructions when my father would send a man to get whatever we wanted, but this source was -- was lost. </sentence><sentence id="590">So we -- we really suffered from -- from starvation. </sentence><sentence id="591">I mean, but this is not -- this is the least that can happen to you. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="599">Q: But what kinds of things were you able then to eat? </sentence><sentence id="600">This was true of a lot of people in Greece at this time, right, that this was very bad -- </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="601">A: Well, not -- not -- not -- it was -- it was bad only in Athens, not in the provinces. </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="602">Q: Yeah. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="604">A: The provi -- provinces had plenty of food, and people from Athens would come to the provinces to get food. </sentence><sentence id="605">In -- in Agrinion, as long as we were not [indecipherable] there was no problem, it was like peacetime. </sentence><sentence id="606">I mean, you had as much food as you wanted. </sentence><sentence id="607">Only when we lost our supplies and we were not able to get the quantities that we needed, only then -- we had basically to eat a lot of wild vegetables. </sentence><sentence id="608">I had -- that was my job. </sentence><sentence id="609">I had to go, with a knife, and get anything that was green on the ground, all over the place, that the animals would not eat because they were -- these things were bitter. </sentence><sentence id="610">And then my mother would boil these things and mix them with a little corn flour and she would put just enough oil on the -- on the big, big pot, and cook them. </sentence><sentence id="611">I found out eventually that this cellulose can be absorbed by the body. </sentence><sentence id="612">So basically, that's what kept us alive, because we could eat enormous quantities of these because I would get, you know, bi-big quantities and we would eat that. </sentence><sentence id="613">Basically, that's what th -- that's what it was. </sentence><sentence id="614">The one thing I can say is that at -- what helped us at one point was the fact that a partisan unit came to stay in the village. </sentence><sentence id="615">And we told them that we were starving. </sentence><sentence id="616">And they </sentence></p><p><sentence id="617"> offered to de -- I mean, they -- at -- at night, when they had their meetings, all the partisans voted in favor of giving us a -- a portion. </sentence><sentence id="618">And also to the family of [indecipherable] Levy. </sentence><sentence id="619">And -- and when the -- the trumpet would -- would sound, I would go in line and get a portion -- the partisans were not fed very well either, mainly th-they had a corn soup. </sentence><sentence id="620">That's -- that was -- and a few olives. </sentence><sentence id="621">But we would divide that portion that was for one man, we would divide it into four. </sentence><sentence id="622">And in this way, w -- for the duration of their s -- their stay in Psilovrahos which was maybe 20 - 25 days, we did not touch our supplies. </sentence><sentence id="623">That proved to be very, very important because ultimately we did not have anything. </sentence><sentence id="624">And on that day, one of the men of the village -- actually he was the leader of the reserve ELAS, he -- he told me to -- to go and collect berries, and by that time there were berries, as many as you wanted. </sentence><sentence id="625">And I did. </sentence><sentence id="626">We ate berries for four days and we all became sick. </sentence><sentence id="627">At that point we didn't know what to do because the [indecipherable] production was going to come within days, but not in our village, which was on the mountain. </sentence><sentence id="628">So my mother and I took the last supply that we had, which was sugar, and we went down, we crossed the river of [indecipherable] and we went to a [indecipherable] village of a [indecipherable]. </sentence><sentence id="629">And there we exchanged sugar, which nobody had, for [indecipherable], which was some cereal that had milk. </sentence><sentence id="630">And that was the turning point in -- in our food situation. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="631">Once the time came that the villages had produced -- had -- had a lot of things, i-i-in the meantime we -- we realized what we had to do, but that's a little -- it's a little -- another story, because we had -- well, where to find parachute material, but this happened accidentally. </sentence><sentence id="632">When e -- in April, or at the beg -- at the end of March, my mother decided that she sh -- would go to Agrinion and get supplies. </sentence><sentence id="633">And my father and myself -- I-I was at that time 13 going on 14, my sister was only five to six, so my father an-and myself told her not to go, but she was very str -- opinionated and she decided to go. </sentence><sentence id="634">And she walked for practically 12 hours to go to Agrinion. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="635"> And at one point she had to cross a -- a -- a bridge, and one of the guards there was a partisan -- a Jewish partisan [indecipherable] from Arta, that my mother knew him. </sentence><sentence id="636">And he told her, don't you know that the -- the -- the Jews have been arrested, and they are in Agrinion in warehouse of Papapetrou? </sentence><sentence id="637">Of course my mother did not know anything, but she -- I have to say that before that my mother was stopped by a -- a teacher of mine who recognized her, and he told her, where are you going? </sentence><sentence id="638">Don't you know that the Jews have been arrested, and in addition, don't you know that the Germans executed some 200 Christian hostages because of the war that takes place between the Germans and the partisans. </sentence><sentence id="639">And my mother said that -- of course she felt very bad, and sick about -- hearing about the Jews, but she was determined, and she said, I have to go, I have to get food. </sentence><sentence id="640">So the -- the teacher said, why don't you go until the village that is very close to -- to Agrinion, and -- and stop there at the mailbox, and th-this is a house of a godfather of mine, and he is a teacher in the village. </sentence><sentence id="641">You tell them that I sent you, and send him to Agrinion to get the food. </sentence><sentence id="642">So my mother explained to the partisan [indecipherable] that this is my plan, and I'm not going to go beyond this little village, which was in the outskirts of Agrinion, and he let her go, and that's what happened. </sentence><sentence id="643">She met the teacher. </sentence><sentence id="644">The teacher went with his horse to the bank. </sentence><sentence id="645">He happened to be a godf -- he was a godfather of the director of the bank -- this is a tremendous coincidence considering that [indecipherable] is the director of the bank, was supposed to be a descendant of the families which were converted in 1821. </sentence><sentence id="646">Svordis was a common Jewish name in Ioannina. </sentence><sentence id="647">Svordis could have been also one of the -- the convert families. </sentence><sentence id="648">And my father claims that even the intermediary between the two of them, Zambaris, that was the nickname of the Levy family of Ioannina. </sentence><sentence id="649">So, it -- it's a -- an amazing coincidence to have all these three people being godfathers to each other, and been involved in helping my mother at this point. </sentence><sentence id="650">Now, when he went to the bank with the horse in front of it, the director </sentence></p><p><sentence id="651"> became terrified. </sentence><sentence id="652">I mean th-th-th -- under these conditions, getting food on a horse that is going to go outside of the city, the whole bank can be considered guilty of doing something wrong, as far as the Germans and their collaborators, and there were plenty by that time. </sentence><sentence id="653">There were the security -- Greek security battalions active at that time. </sentence><sentence id="654">So the only thing we were able to get thanks to that expedition was some quinine and some sugar and some tea that could be placed in the pocket of -- and when the man came back, he was not satisfied to leave my mother there, it was a-approaching nighttime when neither the partisans would allow anybody to move, nor the Germans. </sentence><sentence id="655">So he proposed to my mother that they should go to sleep in a small church that his grandfather had built of prophet Elia. </sentence><sentence id="656">Even that to me is significant. </sentence><sentence id="657">And [indecipherable] went and zamp -- Zambaris -- that's name, Zambaris and my mother spent the night in that little church on top of the mountain where it was cold, and the wind was blowing. </sentence><sentence id="658">Then the following day, my mother came back to the village. </sentence><sentence id="659">When she told us what was -- what happened, o-of course she was exhausted, you know, a-after 24 hours and -- and the trauma of knowing, a-and -- because they made a mistake and they told her that the Jews of Ioannina were also there, which means that all our relatives were there. </sentence><sentence id="660">So she was really a wreck. </sentence><sentence id="661">But in spite of that, she wanted to go on another expedition in which the British mission which was in Priansa. </sentence><sentence id="662">That time we were assured that as soon as the allies would know that the Jews were arrested, they would immediately mobilize all their know-how and all their means at their disposal and the Jews would be s-set free. </sentence><sentence id="663">So again my mother -- you see, my -- my father had some problems, he had some pain with his legs, and he couldn't walk at that time. </sentence><sentence id="664">So my mother again, and myself, we embarked on an expedition of approximately a total of 14 hours of hiking in unknown territory, crossing and re-crossing two rivers. </sentence><sentence id="665">That means four times crossing rivers to go there. </sentence><sentence id="666">And we went to the village of Priansa where we had a meeting with a British major who -- his friend, a -- </sentence></p><p><sentence id="667"> a prostitute who was there told us -- well, I-I should say this, passing on the way there, we had to stop in a -- i-in a controlled partisan point, which was manned by our banker from Agrini. </sentence><sentence id="668">And he told us [indecipherable] we -- we told him what was our mission, what we wanted to do. </sentence><sentence id="669">And he told us to go to this lady. </sentence><sentence id="670">There were other prostitutes there who were so-called working for the British mission. </sentence><sentence id="671">And he told us that this particular girl was the girlfriend of the British major, but evidently, she was also in contact with the resistance. </sentence><sentence id="672">And he told my mother to go to her and she will be able to talk to the -- to the major so the major will -- would be a little bit better to us. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="673">But when we went there and we found her, the first thing that she did when she saw how I was dressed, because I was -- I was wearing my short fascist uniform, a blue uniform that it was strong material, but because my legs were exposed, my mother had s -- had sewn or attached to them some woolen leggings. </sentence><sentence id="674">So I was dressed like that. </sentence><sentence id="675">Soon as she saw that, she gave me the leftover [indecipherable] khaki pair of wi -- winter khaki pants that she had cut them to make shorts out of them, and she gave us the leftover, you know, so my mother can make some -- a better pair of pants for me. </sentence><sentence id="676">And she said that she had an argument with the major and he was not in a good mood. </sentence><sentence id="677">But nevertheless, the -- the m-major saw us, and he was very nice, and he knew French so my mother spoke to him in French. </sentence><sentence id="678">And he promised to send a message to -- to the headquarters, and a -- a message to my father's sister who lived at that time in Alexandria, Egypt. </sentence><sentence id="679">But we know that the message in Alexandria, Egypt never went. </sentence><sentence id="680">But we were in that village, we realized that the village was filled with parachute material because the planes were coming at night and they were dropping weapons and ammunition for the resistance. </sentence><sentence id="681">And there was plen-plenty of parachute material. </sentence><sentence id="682">So my mother went from house to house and she begged these villagers, who didn't know what to do with this material, and we collected a lot of material, and cord, and everything else. </sentence><sentence id="683">And when we came back, my mother, who had an elementary </sentence></p><p><sentence id="684"> knowledge of sewing, she went into the business of -- of -- shall I stop? </sentence><sentence id="685">Yes. </sentence><sentence id="686">She went into the business of making shirts, and we used some material th-that we brought for mattresses, to make pants out of them. </sentence><sentence id="687">And eventually she changed these materials by going to different villages -- villages for years, you know, did not have any material. </sentence><sentence id="688">And we collected enough wheat and corn

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="700">Q: Mike, why were the Jews of Athens going into hiding at that time? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="702">A: We found out about it much later. </sentence><sentence id="703">Who -- what happened was this. </sentence><sentence id="704">The Germans asked the chief rabbi of Athens, Elia Barzelai to give them a list of the Jews of Athens. </sentence><sentence id="705">The rabbi of course had -- was given sa -- some time to prepare the list and during that time the Jews of Athens, or important Jews of Athens found out or they knew about it. </sentence><sentence id="706">And one of them was a -- a Greek Jewish journalist, Baruch Schibi, who was one of the leaders of resistance in Athens. </sentence><sentence id="707">He was a man from Salonica who never intended to be in a place where the Germans were, and when the Germans were entering Greece, he attempted to leave and go to Egypt, and he reached only Crete and then you know when the Germans attacked Crete with the parachutists, h -- and he was not able to go to Egypt and he returned back to Athens. </sentence><sentence id="708">He knew what happened to Salonica. </sentence><sentence id="709">What happened in Salonica was that the leadership with Rabbi Koretz proved to be very ineffective. </sentence><sentence id="710">And since the Jews did not know that the Germans were killing Jews outside of Greece, they did not have the incentive that a hunted animal has. </sentence><sentence id="711">And you know, when somebody is hunted, the instinct of survival of course, is you -- to either flee, hide or fight. </sentence><sentence id="712">The -- the situation was such that although the German intentions towards the Jews of Salonica proved to be bad from the beginning, only the wealthy Jews, some 3,400 of them took advantage of the fact that up til February 1942, they were able to freely and legally move from the Bulgarian and German zones of occupation and go to the Italian zone, where the Italians were living very well as I told you before. </sentence><sentence id="713">The remaining Jews in Bulgaria and Macedonia, and that's where the great majority of the Jews were, they did not know what to do. </sentence><sentence id="714">I feel they were like children who needed help, and nobody was ready to help them. </sentence><sentence id="715">So in Salonica the organization ELAS proposed to the community to help, but the leaders of the community refused this help. </sentence><sentence id="716">The communist party proposed to help, and they suggested that the Jewish children should go to trusted families of the party, and the rest of the population to be dispersed outside of Salonica as long as it was free and legal to do -- to do so. </sentence><sentence id="717">But this proposal was rejected by the leaders also. </sentence><sentence id="718">So basically, you have some over 50,000 Jews there not having any leaders, not knowing what was going on, and furthermore, not having Christian friends, most of them, as a result of anti-Semitism. </sentence><sentence id="719">The population in Macedonia and Salonica was either indifferent or hostile to the Jews, and the proof is that out of over 10,000 Jewish families in Salonica, only one family, that of Haim Pardo, of five people was offered a shelter in the house of Dr. George and Fedra Carracortso right in the center of Salonica where they stayed indoors for 18 months. </sentence><sentence id="720">There was some other 70 Jews who were saved in Salonica, but these were mainly husbands, or fiances of Christians. </sentence><sentence id="721">The -- the university, or the other organizations of Salonica did not protest, did not do anything, but some lawyers protested to the general governor -- the general governor Simonides, he said, we are removing the thorns from your garden, and you are protesting? </sentence><sentence id="722">The -- the one who pleaded with the Germans was the bishop of Salonica, Yanadios, who asked them to use magnanimity and clemency, especially when the time for the deportations came, and he -- he is considered as a righteous Gentile. </sentence><sentence id="723">Another protest for which Greece should be really proud was made by the archbishop of Greece, Damaskinos, and it was signed by 42 members -- leaders of Greek organizations. </sentence><sentence id="724">And in this case, what really happened was that the -- these people would meet periodically to discuss the problems of the occupation, and one day a Jewish woman from Salonica told him what was happening, and the poet [indecipherable] Yanosh wrote the appeal, it was signed immediately by all 42, and it was delivered to the Germans, and to the government of Greece. </sentence><sentence id="725">The prime minister of Greece, Logothetopoulos, instead of trying to protect the Jews of Salonica when they were deported, he confessed that he was in favor of the deportations because there would be a lot of vacant housing that was needed. </sentence><sentence id="726">So, 252 Jewish students from the University of Salonica became partisans of ELAS, over 600 Jews became partisans of ELAS.When the proposals of the communist party were rejected, the communists th -- remember that they had 150 members in their lists who were Jews. </sentence><sentence id="727">So they appealed to them to go to the mountains. </sentence><sentence id="728">Out of them, 75 decided to go, but as they were divided into three groups and they were going for the mountains, they thought, and what about our families? </sentence><sentence id="729">How are we going to let our families be by themselves in exile? </sentence><sentence id="730">And they came back and they surrendered to the Germans. </sentence><sentence id="731">Now, Baruch Schibi knew all that, and he was afraid that the same thing was going to be repeated in Athens. </sentence><sentence id="732">So he conceived the plan of abducting or killing Rabbi Barzelai of Athens. </sentence><sentence id="733">The other leaders of the resistance agreed with his plan, and they went to the rabbi and they told him. </sentence><sentence id="734">Rabbi was ready, he said I'm -- do anything you want with me. </sentence><sentence id="735">And they took him and his family and they moved them to the mountains. </sentence><sentence id="736">When the word went around, the Jews of Athens disappeared. </sentence><sentence id="737">However, there were poor Jews who at the beginning they thought they would hide too, but they needed to work. </sentence><sentence id="738">And they started going into the -- into the -- th -- to the Germans, and the Germans kindly extended their deadline and allowed all of the Jews who would come slowly [indecipherable] they would come and the -- the Germans wouldn't do anything to them more, they would come -- this was noticed by none other than an American consul general who was operating from Istanbul. </sentence><sentence id="739">And in the state department where there are 500 pages of documents sent from Consul Berry, Brigadier General Tindall, and Ambassador Makvay of [indecipherable] 500 pages. </sentence><sentence id="740">In one of them this situation is noticed by a b -- a -- Burton Berry, who s -- who tells the state department that -- that we need a little financial assistance here because the poor Jews are reporting and now they tell them that they should report within a 15 minute interval, which means that the Germans want to arrest them within that 15 minute interval. </sentence><sentence id="741">All these reports were ignored, and filed in the archives, where I found them in 1975. </sentence><sentence id="742">Eventually 1,000 Jews of Athens were registered. </sentence><sentence id="743">But things became nice again. </sentence><sentence id="744">Everything was normal up til March of -- 25" of March 1944. </sentence><sentence id="745">That was the time that the Jews of Ioannina [indecipherable] that my mother was supposed to -- t-to find in Agrinion if she went there, were all arrested. </sentence><sentence id="746">And the -- a-and -- and Burton Berry in another document says, didn't I tell you that this was going to happen? </sentence><sentence id="747">And -- and he gave other warnings. </sentence><sentence id="748">Actually, the most important warning that he gave was the following. </sentence><sentence id="749">There was a -- a -- a Greek Christian merchant, Michael [indecipherable] who, a-as I said before, business was as normal as it could be in Greece. </sentence><sentence id="750">He went on business, he was a tobacco merchant, and he was going on business to Istanbul. </sentence><sentence id="751">In his train compartment -- evidently he was traveling first class, he started a conversation with three German SS officers, who told him point blank that we are going to stop here in Larisa because we are on our way to Corfu, where we will deport all the Jews of Corfu. </sentence><sentence id="752">In other words, the Germans were so sure that nobody cared, especially a Christian merchant, that they told him a military secret. </sentence><sentence id="753">Now, this man was a good man. </sentence><sentence id="754">As soon as he went to Istanbul, he went straight to the American consul -- consulate, and he told Burton Berry what was happening. </sentence><sentence id="755">Burton Berry immediately notified the state department, and again nothing happened, although it was so easy to make a radio contact with the British military missions. </sentence><sentence id="756">British military missions had contact with the resistance, which existed in all the cities, not to mention secret American and British agents which operated in Greece. </sentence><sentence id="757">All of these people could have notified the Jews and tell them what was happening. </sentence><sentence id="758">It took -- fr -- from these reports, it took until June ninth, the Jews of Corfu were arrested. </sentence><sentence id="759">In the German archives, even the German commander of Corfu send a report to his superiors, a lengthy report in which he was trying to tell them that there is no need to do anything towards the Jews, they have never bothered us. </sentence><sentence id="760">Evidently he -- he said, we don't have any means of transportation, why don't you arrest the -- the Italian soldiers of Bertolio who are -- are dangerous? </sentence><sentence id="761">Th-The Jews never bothered us. </sentence><sentence id="762">Out of 2,000 Jews, only 187 returned from the camps. </sentence><sentence id="763">So this is the -- the -- the story with the -- the state depart -- and the American -- American government. </sentence><sentence id="764">Now, Baruch Schibi continued his activities as a -- a leader of the resistance, and he was responsible for the mili-military intelligence during certain battles in the [indecipherable] where hundreds of Germans are working. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1006">Q: And what was that like, to return to Agrinion? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1008">A: [had a -- I remember that I was expecting that I was going to be very happy, you know, to come into a free city. </sentence><sentence id="1009">It -- it was a sort of a disappointment, I -- I was not as happy as I expected to be, especially knowing -- we didn't know what was happening to our relatives, and we were afraid that maybe my grandparents were too old to survive, you know, all this transportation, and that, but we never expected to see what really happened. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1012">Q: And what did you see? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1014">A: I'm sorry? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1016">Q: What did you see? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1018">A: We -- we saw nothing, I mean, the city was the same way like it was before, and only when I went to Ioannina and saw the -- there was none of the people that we were -- w-we used to -- to have there, that were na -- there, only then I started wondering why all this happened. </sentence><sentence id="1019">I had many questions that I had in my -- my mind. </sentence><sentence id="1020">Question number one would be why such a thing would happen. </sentence><sentence id="1021">And the -- my -- my answer was in one word, anti-Semitism. </sentence><sentence id="1022">In two words would be religious anti-Semitism. </sentence><sentence id="1023">And I'm very much -- very familiar with the -- the church teachings. </sentence><sentence id="1024">I know exactly what they say, especially during the -- the holy week. </sentence><sentence id="1025">And if -- if you have in -- in the church, young children who are exposed to the beautiful picture of Jesus Christ and then you love this person, and then all of a sudden you find out that it was the Jews who -- who killed him, I mean, how would you feel? </sentence><sentence id="1026">It's [indecipherable] like I faced that when I was in the village, and on Good Friday we were in the church, and the -- and the priest did whatever he had to do. </sentence><sentence id="1027">When he came for a coffee to my parents. </sentence><sentence id="1028">he apologized. </sentence><sentence id="1029">And he said, I -- I'm sorry I had to say so many things -- because that's in Greek, we can understand, that's not in Latin. </sentence><sentence id="1030">And, I'm sorry I had to say all these things, but you understand, that's my job. </sentence><sentence id="1031">My parents, of course, they understood. </sentence><sentence id="1032">And the following day I saw a little boy, maybe no more than five, who I used to be his hero, and he used to follow me around all the time. </sentence><sentence id="1033">And he looked at me with suspicion and some sort of hate. </sentence><sentence id="1034">So I told him, why, what -- what's wrong? </sentence><sentence id="1035">And he said, "You killed Jesus Christ." </sentence><sentence id="1036">And I will never forget that. </sentence><sentence id="1037">That would be my question number one. </sentence><sentence id="1038">The -- the second question would be when did the allies know about all this? </sentence><sentence id="1039">I was under the impression that they didn't know. </sentence><sentence id="1040">That's the reason my mother and I were eating that vegetable pie. </sentence><sentence id="1041">We -- we -- we walked for 14 hours. </sentence><sentence id="1042">What I found out is that the British had broken the older police code of the Germans as early as 1939. </sentence><sentence id="1043">And this older police was the one that was in charge of the Jews. </sentence><sentence id="1044">There are documents which prove that they knew exactly when a German unit would say, arrest 100 Jews in Paris, who was the leader of the group, how many men he had under his command, where did he stop on his way to -- to Auschwitz, or there were killing grounds even in -- in Minsk. </sentence><sentence id="1045">And they -- they documented all that by simply following these radio transmissions. </sentence><sentence id="1046">So all this -- all this was known. </sentence><sentence id="1047">The -- the Americans, up til the time that Germany declared war against the United States, they had embassies and consulates all over the place. </sentence><sentence id="1048">They had secret agents every -- everywhere. </sentence><sentence id="1049">The documents -- I -- I checked only the 500 documents that were related to Greece, they knew exactly everything to the point that rather than interviewing survivors when I wanted to -- to find what was going on, I preferred to read the -- the reports of Burton Berry. </sentence><sentence id="1050">He was a far more eloquent writer than any of these survivors. </sentence><sentence id="1051">So they knew what was going on. </sentence><sentence id="1052">And then the third question is, why didn't they do anything? </sentence><sentence id="1053">And again, the answer comes in these words, religious anti-Semitism. </sentence><sentence id="1054">Even in the United States, there was discrimination against the Jews in terms of employment, and the -- the real historians know now that the state department not only blocked immigration, blocked information, they even tried to cover it up to the point that the -- that the -- that the secretary of the treasury sent a report saying acqui -- acquiescence of the United States to the murder of the Jews of [indecipherable]. </sentence><sentence id="1055">That's serious stuff, ac-acquiescence. </sentence><sentence id="1056">And then you have other people who, like Professor David Wyman, who says that I, as a Christian, he says he -- he's appalled that the churches did not do anything and they remained silent in the United States. </sentence><sentence id="1057">Let alone the Vatican, let alone all the -- the bishops of all Germany. </sentence><sentence id="1058">So this is the -- the old story. </sentence><sentence id="1059">But I have to say another thing, that like I mentioned before, the Jewish contribution, the Greek je -- military Jewish contribution with Colonel Frizis. </sentence><sentence id="1060">And this was very important and Greece has to be very proud of that because the action of the Greek army delayed the German attack against Russia by six crucial weeks. </sentence><sentence id="1061">The Germans were forced to fight a winter war in Russia, which was -- had disastrous consequences for the Germans. </sentence><sentence id="1062">So this I would say is the direct contribution of Greece, indirect contribution of -- of Colonel Frizis since he was the first one who stopped the Italians and then advanced as -- ahead of his troops, although he was killed later, but this was a great contribution. </sentence><sentence id="1063">Then you have all the Jews who fought in the British forces, including I would say the son of the first president of Israel, Haim Weitzman, who was shot down over the British channel. </sentence><sentence id="1064">And then there were 550,000 American Jews who served in the armed forces of the United States. </sentence><sentence id="1065">In other words, when we asked, why didn't the allies help? </sentence><sentence id="1066">I say, this is not a case of benevolence, or a case of -- of charity, the Jews earned and deserved the right to be assisted. </sentence><sentence id="1067">Not only that, let's not forget that if America became a nuclear power, which guaranteed American supremacy, it was because of Jewish men like Einstein, Oppenheimer, Ziller, Teller, Rabbe, while the relatives of these Jewish men were dying in the gas chambers of Auschwitz and Treblinka. </sentence><sentence id="1068">Personally, I believe that it was wrong, unfair, ungrateful and shameful for the United States and Great Britain to abandon the Jews and let them die the way they did. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1122">Q: What about the Greek population during this period of time? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1124">A: The Greek population in -- the great majority of the Jews were in Salonica, and -- in -- in northern -- northern mass -- massa -- in Macedonia and -- and [indecipherable] and northern Greece. </sentence><sentence id="1125">The population there was far more anti-Semitic than the enlightened people of Athens. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="1126">And as I said before, only one family out of 10,000 famil -- families was offered asylum. </sentence><sentence id="1127">That tells, as far as I'm concerned, plenty. </sentence><sentence id="1128">Many believed that it was not easy to -- to go to the mountains in -- in -- in Macedonia, that the resistance was very weak in 1943. </sentence><sentence id="1129">But there is a story that I sent for publication to the journal of Hellenic Diaspora, and that's the story of a friend of mine, Dr. Joseph Struncis from Veria. </sentence><sentence id="1130">And in this story you see how his father, who was the president of the Jewish community of Veria, he didn't know what to do, like everybody else. </sentence><sentence id="1131">He contacted this -- this horrible Jewish leader, Rabbi Koretz, and he -- </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1132">Q: Could you just stop for one moment? </sentence><sentence id="1133">What -- are we 0 -- are we okay? </sentence><sentence id="1134">Yeah. [ </sentence><sentence id="1135">indecipherable] okay. </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1136">A: He contacted Rabbi Koretz, and he tried to reassure him that everything would be alright, that the Jews of Poland -- I mean, accept the deportation, the Jews of Poland has -- have houses for us and jobs and everything will be alright, there's nothing to worry about. </sentence><sentence id="1137">But -- but he was not satisfied, so he went to the chief of the police of Veria, Stavridis, and that's another righteous Gentile that I would like to add into -- into my list of -- of the 12 or 13. </sentence><sentence id="1138">And -- and he told him not to listen to the rabbi, not to trust the Germans, just go to the mountains. </sentence><sentence id="1139">Now, to see how easy it was to go to the mountains, my friend had a senile 85 year old grandmother, and they were not going to leave her behind. </sentence><sentence id="1140">So, they ended up w-with her on a horse and they had to cross a river with a raft. </sentence><sentence id="1141">The raft was very small. </sentence><sentence id="1142">She was on the horse, she could not see the raft. </sentence><sentence id="1143">She moved to the other side of the river, and for the rest of her life she was talking about how -- about the miracle that took place like in the time in Moses, that the waters parted, and she passed. </sentence><sentence id="1144">And it would have been done, that's -- that's exactly the point that I want -- I -- I want to say, but you had to have some Christian friends, because the Christians knew far better as to what -- what had to be done. </sentence><sentence id="1145">In addition to that, it was the Christians and not the Jews who had friends and trusted relatives in the remote mountains of Greece, where there were hundreds of villages. </sentence><sentence id="1146">Why they were in s-such inhospitable places, where they had to -- to cultivate things from terraces, because during 400 years of horrible Turkish occupation, that's where they had their freedom. </sentence><sentence id="1147">And they would have sent -- who -- you see, when the leader of the communist party was talking about sending them, dispensing them to -- to our side, he knew what he was talking about. </sentence><sentence id="1148">But the Jewish leaders wouldn't want to have anything to do with somebody like him, and all -- all ri -- so were waiting to see what their -- what -- they were waiting for whom? </sentence><sentence id="1149">I me -- believe there was Koretz who was collaborating with the Germans. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1165">Q: You would say that Koretz collaborated? </sentence><sentence id="1166">You would use a strong word like that? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1169">A: I -- well, I would say this, he was not a bad man. </sentence><sentence id="1170">His wife, Gitta Koretz send me a 48 page letter in which she was trying to -- to -- to justify his actions, that he was an intellectual who knew t -- 12 languages, who -- who had a Ph.D. in oriental studies, who could have left Salonica and go with the mayor of Athens, who invited him to leave and go to Egypt, and he didn't want to do that. </sentence><sentence id="1171">It's possible that he thought that it was only a deportation, I -- I can't tell. </sentence><sentence id="1172">But if I were there, I -- and -- and I saw what the Germans were doing, especially when the Germans as- assembled in -- in July of 1943. </sentence><sentence id="1173">They assembled 9,000 Jewish men age 15 to 45, and they humiliated them, they tortured them, they -- and -- and then they started forming slave battalions in -- wh-which had to work under inhumane conditions. </sentence><sentence id="1174">That was the time when there was free -- I mean, it was e -- it was legal, and they were free to move, to go to the Italian zone, or go to these remote mountains, provided of course, they had the proper connections with -- with the Greek villagers. </sentence><sentence id="1175">And that's what was missing, since they did now know what was going to happen. </sentence><sentence id="1176">But wh-wh-why do -- should they accept deportation? </sentence><sentence id="1177">I mean, isn't it better to be free?And think of all the tons of gold and precious items and supplies which were looted by the Germans and their collaborators. </sentence><sentence id="1178">Can you imagine if all this gold and supplies would have come to the resistance? </sentence><sentence id="1179">And let's think of how much the -- the Jews would have contributed to that resistance, because we had thousands of men who were experienced fighters from the war against Turkey in "21 and "22, and the war, the second World War. </sentence><sentence id="1180">You have experienced fighters who would never surrender, because any Jewish partisan who would be captured by the Germans would be executed. </sentence><sentence id="1181">So you would have a -- a great contribution to the allied effort. </sentence><sentence id="1182">What a -- a -- a waste of -- of -- of manpower, and a-as a former military officer, I can say this, I remember the -- a poem by Haim Nachman Bialik, who said -- but it was related to something else, but the words are very appropriate. </sentence><sentence id="1183">Great -- great is the sorrow, and just as great is the shame. </sentence><sentence id="1184">And I ask you, oh son of man, which is greater? </sentence><sentence id="1185">The grandsons of the Maccabeans went to their death like lambs, wherever they were found. </sentence><sentence id="1186">And to see what some of these grandsons of the Maccabeans could do, I will tell you something about the -- perhaps the greatest partisan victory of the second World War, which took place on May sixth, 1944. </sentence><sentence id="1187">I said before there were thousands of Greek traitors who were not punished after the war. </sentence><sentence id="1188">There was a group of five Jewish families from Larisa, who established a camp on the slopes of Mount Olympus. </sentence><sentence id="1189">They were betrayed, and an s -- n-s -- SS battalion went one morning and captured them. </sentence><sentence id="1190">Three Jewish men attempted to escape, and they were killed. </sentence><sentence id="1191">The f -- a fourth man was able to escape and notified a nearby partisan unit of ELAS, which included Jewish fighters, like the legendary platoon leader, Marko Carasso, and even a cousin of mine who was a -- a teacher of literature, Joseph Matsas. </sentence><sentence id="1192">150 partisans ambushed the Germans. </sentence><sentence id="1193">The terrain was perfect for an ambush. </sentence><sentence id="1194">The battle lasted for around six hours. </sentence><sentence id="1195">German planes came to help the Germans but they were ineffective. </sentence><sentence id="1196">The Jews eventually were liberated. </sentence><sentence id="1197">There were 150 German dead, 78 wounded, and 14 taken prisoners, including one who was the son of the German general of the Aegean. </sentence><sentence id="1198">He sent a message that he would release 200 hostages that he had for his son, but the message arrived too late. </sentence><sentence id="1199">The partisans executed the 78 wounded, and the 14 prisoners for a total of 242 German dead. </sentence><sentence id="1200">And the Germans never again attempted to go to the mountains to capture fugitive Jews. </sentence><sentence id="1201">Partisan losses were eight dead, and 10 wounded. </sentence><sentence id="1202">I have the names of the eight dead, and I believe they should be considered as righteous Gentiles, because they could very easily have said we don't want to try to save the Jews. </sentence><sentence id="1203">So far, I mean, this can show you what the partisans could have done. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1241">Q: Do you think the Jews of Greece in 1943 knew what was happening in Europe, in eastern Europe? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1243">A: There was, until the end of the war, there was not even one Jew in Greece who knew anything about the Holocaust or about the fact that the Germans were killing Jews. </sentence><sentence id="1244">Not a single thing. </sentence><sentence id="1245">Why? </sentence><sentence id="1246">Because the Germans had t-total secrecy. </sentence><sentence id="1247">As a matter of fact, Professor Breitman mentions that the Germans attempted to -- to keep this secret from -- especially the Jews, but also from the outside world and the German people. </sentence><sentence id="1248">They were successful in deceiving the Jews, but they were unsuccessful in keeping it secret from the outside world or the German people. </sentence><sentence id="1249">In Greece not even one Jew knew anything. </sentence><sentence id="1250">The first time that we understood what was going on was in the movies when we saw Eisenhower visiting the concentration camps. </sentence><sentence id="1251">If we knew what was going on, there are survivors who say that under no circumstances would they have entered the trains or the trucks. </sentence><sentence id="1252">Who would do that, to -- to -- to take his -- his children, his wife, his parents, in an orderly fashion to the trains that led them to -- to -- to the -- to the death camps. </sentence><sentence id="1253">As a matter of    fact there have been cases like I mentioned before the -- the 75 Jewish communists who returned to follow their families and there are two cousins of my father from Ioannina who were also on business on the day of the arrest, and they returned to Ioannina to be with their families in exile, and they never came back. </sentence><sentence id="1254">Nobody knew. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1268">Q: So what was the difference between your family, who decided not to stay, not to register, to leave, and those who decided to stay? </sentence><sentence id="1269">How would you distinguish between you, since you didn't know either -- Az Is this the -- </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1270">Q: -- you didn't -- your family didn't know either, what was happening. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1272">A: This is correct, but we had connections. </sentence><sentence id="1273">In other words, we had the right wing friend who -- who told us where to go. </sentence><sentence id="1274">We had the left wing friend who told us come to our house and we will send you out. </sentence><sentence id="1275">If we didn't have these two people, we would have, if nothing else, procrastinated. </sentence><sentence id="1276">Two days after we left on October third, two Germans appeared in the bank, and they asked for my father. </sentence><sentence id="1277">Now, if we judge as to this visit from what happened in other cities, my assumption is that my father was going to be a hostage of the Germans, and if he were a hostage of the Germans, my mother would never have left him to -- a-and go to the mountains, even if we were allowed to do that. </sentence><sentence id="1278">And -- and another thing is this, we left before the order for registration came. </sentence><sentence id="1279">We did not know there was going to be any order for registration. </sentence><sentence id="1280">We left only because we heard that the Jews of Athens went into hiding, we didn't know why. </sentence><sentence id="1281">We simply -- we were simply determined not to obey any German orders, that was our only -- but we had friends. </sentence><sentence id="1282">This is the -- the -- the problem that | -- I see with all the Jews. </sentence><sentence id="1283">They did not have any friends, they didn't know what to do. </sentence><sentence id="1284">If you have people around the neighborhood who -- who are glad that these things happen to you, and they are eag -- they are eagerly waiting to see what kind of looting they are going to do, and there was extensive looting in every city where there were Jews, they are eager to see their competitors being demolished, how in the world do you expect any assistance from these people? </sentence><sentence id="1285">And considering that -- that the Jews did not know that deportation meant anything but deportation, and -- and having leaders who could not really lead them, and not having any good advice by their friends, they were waiting. </sentence><sentence id="1286">Now, once you are registered, the story changes. </sentence><sentence id="1287">Then what you do is dangerous if you try to leave. </sentence><sentence id="1288">Of course, the friend of -- of Veria, with the 85 year old mother, left while they were registered, and while they had the yellow star, and my friend said that as soon as he was in free territory, they took the star and they threw it to -- to the ground. </sentence><sentence id="1289">But it took much more bravery on their part to do it. </sentence><sentence id="1290">That's why the most important thing in Greece is that the -- the deportations started very late, in March of 1943.The Jews of Poland were already dead. </sentence><sentence id="1291">The Warsaw ghetto uprising was taking place at the exact same moment, around March, April, 1943. </sentence><sentence id="1292">Up til that time, the Jews of Greece had plenty of time to disappear and dissolve, you know, in -- into eight million Greeks in a remote -- in [indecipherable] mountains, whereas I told you, the Germans had to mount expeditions including 600 men, that -- that was not easy. </sentence><sentence id="1293">And even if they did, where could they go the -- since there were no roads, and -- and there were impenetrable forests and -- and terrib -- terrible mountains and -- and -- and unknown parts. </sentence><sentence id="1294">Plus, there were the partisans there. </sentence><sentence id="1295">So the situation in Greece was great for the Jews to -- to -- to escape. </sentence><sentence id="1296">In addition to that the -- the Jews would have gone to Turkey, because the partisan organization, the naval branch of the partisan organization called ELAN had formed a -- in -- in agreement with the Jewish defense force Haganah, they transferred some 1500 Jews from Greece to Turkey and from there to Palestine. </sentence><sentence id="1297">Even the prime minister of Greece, George Papandreo used this method of escape from Greece. </sentence><sentence id="1298">So there was this in addition. </sentence><sentence id="1299">I believe since there were so many traitors, including six Jewish traitors, and I -- I would like to -- to mention something about them, too. </sentence><sentence id="1300">I mean, we were not innocent, we had six Jewish traitors, all in collaboration with the Germans. </sentence><sentence id="1301">So the -- since there were so many traitors in the city, so I would say the approximately 6,000 Jews of Greece who were saved, were saved either by going to the free partisan controlled areas, and -- or they stayed with -- in that work of resistance sympathizers in Athens who volunteered their services, and there are no cases where the [indecipherable] for example, they w -- they were appointed to go into the house for one man, but the -- the -- well, i -- this is a case where it shows how the Italians were very helpful in Salonica, where they saved hundreds of Jews by giving them Italian citizenship, and they moved them to -- to Athens. </sentence><sentence id="1302">But in the case of the [indecipherable], what they did was they acted as if they were prisoners of the Italians who were going to be judged in an Italian court in Athens. </sentence><sentence id="1303">So they were taken to the Italian zone, and then to Athens, but the Italian soldiers knew the address where the resistance told them to go. </sentence><sentence id="1304">They di -- because these people did not know anybody in Athens. </sentence><sentence id="1305">How could you go to Athens unless you know somebody? </sentence><sentence id="1306">So the resistance provided a place for them. </sentence><sentence id="1307">So the Italian soldiers went to the house, and they said, do you know something?We went to our commander, and we told him that we brung -- brought the prisoners here, but he said where are the prisoners and we couldn't produce you, so how about if you give us some money? </sentence><sentence id="1308">So the SS were afraid of blackmail on the part of the Italian soldiers. </sentence><sentence id="1309">They gave them some money and then they notified the resistance they were to leave this house. </sentence><sentence id="1310">And sure enough the resistance says all right, you go to that house. </sentence><sentence id="1311">Went to that house, and -- and they stayed in that house until the end of the war, reading Mr. [indecipherable] all the books that he found there, teaching French the grandchildren of the -- of the men, and the man was very proud because he saved, he said, a -- a British soldier, a communist and now a -- aj -- a -- a couple of Jews. </sentence><sentence id="1312">So it's -- it's a combination. </sentence><sentence id="1313">You had to know somebody, which --what [indecipherable] the poor Jews of Salonica, there was a lot of poverty in Salonica, they did not know anybody. </sentence></p></dialogue>
