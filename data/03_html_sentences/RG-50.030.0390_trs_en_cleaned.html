<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1830">A: Well, I'll tell you, because I didn't -- I want to say that in 19 -- when they established the ghetto in 1941, in -- in October -- now, in beginning 1942, they broke into Proushinna ghetto from surrounding towns, from Ginefcare, from Narefkar, from Bielovairsh and Karminitz. </sentence><sentence id="1831">Four cities and then from Bialystok, those were little cities. </sentence><sentence id="1832">And what  3 happened, fortunately, you know, most of the little cities, you know, in 1941 or in 19, beginning "42, they liquidated them, you know? </sentence><sentence id="1833">They didn't bother even establishing a ghetto. </sentence><sentence id="1834">They liquidate them -- they -- they killed them on the spot or they took them out in the woods -- took them out in the woods and killed. </sentence><sentence id="1835">And then, after -- after that, it was of course -- it -- it was too much of a -- they didn't have the power yet, the -- the -- the manpower, it was a tall job. </sentence><sentence id="1836">And -- so they start bringing in in Proushinna ghettos, of s- some -- those that are fortunate and the ghetto swelled from about -- we had -- like is mentioned, 6000 Jews, 1000 from here, 2000 from here, so finally the ghetto swelled to 12,000. </sentence><sentence id="1837">And some -- some were brought in by trucks from Ginefcare. </sentence><sentence id="1838">And some were marched by foot for 80 -- you know, from -- especially from the Narefkar, the city and we had to take in a family from there and they marched them. </sentence><sentence id="1839">They marched them, you know, the whole -- from, it's about, I would say maybe 16 -17 kilometers, can you imagine?

</sentence><sentence id="1849">They incorporated -- fer-favored the Third Reich, we going to be treated a little better. </sentence><sentence id="1850">Wa -- the reason they incorporated Proushinna in the Third Reich, is because we were near Bielovairsh and Bielovairsh a forest, were the famous forest in Poland. </sentence><sentence id="1851">One of the biggest famous forests in Poland, that's about 60 or 70 kilometers from Proushinna. </sentence><sentence id="1852">And there were famous for certain animals. </sentence><sentence id="1853">And -- and Goering and all the groups and -- and -- and -- and Himmler, they used to hunt there. </sentence><sentence id="1854">That's the reason -- that's the reason they incorporated Proushinna and even Bialystok, the certain territory and they call it to the east, Prussia. </sentence><sentence id="1855">Not to -- you know, greater Germany is Prussia. </sentence><sentence id="1856">So comparison with other ghettos, maybe we were treated a little bit in the beginning, better, because we didn't have those -- th-they call it aktiones -- actions. </sentence><sentence id="1857">The German cou -- you know, aktiones, like in other cities, they requested, let's see, right away, 1000 inslawnie 2000 - 5000 action and they -- they took them out someplace in -- in certain, you know, ravines and certain places right away and -- even 19 -- in -- in the beginning of the war, and they killed. </sentence><sentence id="1858">So we didn't have that, we didn't have the actions, you know, like [indecipherable] hundred and except -- except it was -- you know, every once in awhile, every day there was some casualties, you know we had -- you know, the -- when outsider -- some -- they took people off the stru -- 60 years old. </sentence><sentence id="1859">So it means some -- some were mistreated and some couldn't make it, some were weak, so there was some casualties. </sentence><sentence id="1860">We had to bring them in in the ghetto. </sentence><sentence id="1861">So we were told, you know, there is two or three, every once in awhile I heard that they brought them in -- in -- in the ghetto and -- for burial. </sentence><sentence id="1862">Now -- now that -- my -- what I want to mention is this, I had an uncle the one -- the one was -- yes, you know, associated in the -- for the farm. </sentence><sentence id="1863">Now, we had a bakery in the town -- in the -- in the ghetto. </sentence><sentence id="1864">We weren't getting bread, we were getting flour. </sentence><sentence id="1865">And  4 we were the bakery in the -- in -- in the ghetto and the fire -- the fire engine, you know, the f -- the -- it was -- it's -- in the ghetto, we suppose we were in a fire, you know, the -- the -- we had to take care -- the fire station was in -- the same -- already was -- it was stationed in -- in Proushinna ghetto and with a -- with a hospital in Proushinna ghetto. </sentence><sentence id="1866">So, yeah, we had to speak in my -- my uncle, so he f -- like -- was a farmer and we had some -- a fleet of horses and wagons to -- any time the German requested, for instance, if you have to take down 50 people to the forest or 100 people to forest. </sentence><sentence id="1867">So they told us, they were -- they were the truckers, we didn't have no truck, they were -- truck had taken the people down the forest and see, my uncle was killed. </sentence><sentence id="1868">They -- they -- what do you call it?The experiments with dogs, yeah. </sentence><sentence id="1869">He was torn by dogs. </sentence></p></dialogue>
