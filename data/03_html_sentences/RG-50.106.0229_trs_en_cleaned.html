<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="726">Q: It must have been hard for you at the time, I mean. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="728">A: Oh, it was. </sentence><sentence id="729">That's why I don't really like to talk about it because it brings up, you know, it stirs everything up. </sentence><sentence id="730">Like one woman here tells me I'm like an ostrich, I like to put my head into the ground because I have -- because there are so many bad, bad things. </sentence><sentence id="731">I left some out too. </sentence><sentence id="732">We tried to get back to Katowice and how we were thrown out on the middle of the road, the Germans caught us, and all little details which would take forever to explain. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="746">Q: Right. </sentence><sentence id="747">Okay. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="750">A: Then I interrupt myself and what I was saying and spit out the new things so I better forget some of the things because really it would take three years on the phone, as long as the war was, four years. </sentence><sentence id="751">Anyhow... </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="754">Q: Okay. </sentence><sentence id="755">So you're having a hard time at this point because your mother had passed away and you're living in a farmhouse with your stepfather. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="758">A: Yeah. </sentence><sentence id="759">And my stepfather had to register to move into the ghetto, which was being raised in Krakow for all the Jews to get in. </sentence><sentence id="760">And, like I said, he -- my grandmother, in the meantime, and my aunt and my cousin, they had to leave Katowice because Katowice was made Judenfrei. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="808">A: Okay. </sentence><sentence id="809">Fine. </sentence><sentence id="810">So what my stepfather did, he spoke to my aunt over the phone, I assume, or sent me a letter that he doesn't want me to go into the ghetto and he wanted me to be with my family anyway. </sentence><sentence id="811">And so it was arranged that I am going to go live with my grandmother. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="816">Q: Okay. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1175">Q: Okay. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1177">A: And the potatoes, many times, if the winter wasn't that cold, started rotting away. </sentence><sentence id="1178">And from rotting away you had thousands and thousands of little flies. </sentence><sentence id="1179">You know those food flies? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1183">Q: Food flies. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1185">A: Yeah. </sentence><sentence id="1186">And they needed those basements cleaned out and we had to do it. </sentence><sentence id="1187">And the </sentence></p><p><sentence id="1188"> + basement and I would never forget that was the worst stench and the worst thing because whatever you did you couldn't even breathe because those flies were all over you. </sentence><sentence id="1189">And I hate, I hate little things that crawl or fly from that day on. </sentence><sentence id="1190">I would always say I'd rather have an elephant coming towards me than anything that crawls or flies little because of those damn flies. </sentence><sentence id="1191">I can still feel them and see them. </sentence><sentence id="1192">So that's what you had to do too and -- </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1193">Q: So that was -- sometimes they made you do other work besides the flax? </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1194">A: Right. </sentence><sentence id="1195">If you wanted to have a privilege of writing. </sentence><sentence id="1196">Well, with the potatoes there was no -- you had to do it. </sentence><sentence id="1197">There was no asking you if you want to or don't want to. </sentence><sentence id="1198">They never ask you if you want to or don't want to. </sentence><sentence id="1199">They didn't. </sentence><sentence id="1200">You did it. </sentence><sentence id="1201">But sometimes you got, you know, you got curb (ph) for it, like a letter to write or sometimes you got nothing. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1211">Q: Okay. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1213">A: So that was not the worst camp really, that was really because the accommodations were horrible, I mean, they were bad enough but not horrible. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1215">Q: Can you tell me a little bit about the barracks that you stayed in with the other women? </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1231">Q: Now, all of the women that you had come with from your grandmother's town on the cattle cart, were you all together in the barracks and working in the factories? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1233">A: No. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1268">Q: Okay. </sentence><sentence id="1269">Okay. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1272">A: Like everybody was assembled in that spot and then we were put into, I guess, different categories. </sentence><sentence id="1273">You know, they had other factories too, not only where I worked. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1276">Q: Uhu. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1278">A: Other factories were some people used to work in the fence and I don't know what else the Germans used you for. </sentence><sentence id="1279">But like I said, I can't think now what everybody worked and I only know what we worked in. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1300">A: No, I think I still had it. </sentence><sentence id="1301">Because I know when I came back in 1945 when I came back to Katowice, I wore my winter coat because I was so skinny. </sentence><sentence id="1302">The kids used to call me that I looked like a herring. </sentence><sentence id="1303">They used to call me herring, that was like an insult. </sentence><sentence id="1304">So I didn't want to go without a coat. </sentence><sentence id="1305">So I must have kept my clothes because I remember the winter coat. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1849">Q: Okay. </sentence><sentence id="1850">And the guards again spoke German? </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2162">Q: Okay. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2164">A: Because that was a -- that was the telltale that something was going on. </sentence><sentence id="2165">Who is coming or what is coming or why is it coming, we didn't know. </sentence><sentence id="2166">But we knew, you know, that there is something better ahead. </sentence></p></dialogue>
