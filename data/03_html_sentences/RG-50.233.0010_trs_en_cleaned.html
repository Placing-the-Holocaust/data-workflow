<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="116">Q: This territory was separated from Hungary at the end of World War I and then taken back right around the time that your father went up there. </sentence><sentence id="117">Now you're not aware of any connection between his going to Munkatch (he would have been over thirteen years of age) that would be late 1938, early 1939 which is when the Hungarians march in. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="132">Q: Yeah, but I mean he's living apart. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="134">A: Yeah, although he did tell me that the people in the area spoke many languages. </sentence><sentence id="135">My father didn't speak Czech, did not. </sentence><sentence id="136">But many of the, like for example, the typical Jew would speak Yiddish, Hungarian, because that was the dominant culture so to speak. </sentence><sentence id="137">And then either Ukrainian or Czech. </sentence><sentence id="138">And of course he would read Hebrew because that was the prayer language. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="144">Q: So your father's family, going back home now, when they were growing up, were they speaking both Yiddish and Hungarian? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="146">A: Yes but they would speak Hungarian in the house. </sentence><sentence id="147">That was their first language. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="150">Q: Hungarian speaking but they all knew Yiddish. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="152">A: They all knew Yiddish fluently, like a mother tongue. </sentence><sentence id="153">And they read Hebrew and they studied in Hebrew. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="164">A: Well later on he studied German. </sentence><sentence id="165">What happened was, I'm not sure what year but I think he was around seventeen and eighteen he came back and they thought he should learn a trade because they thought that trouble was coming and they knew that the hardware store is going to be taken away or something, not by the 5    Germans because there weren't Germans yet, but just the rise of anti-Semitism and the Kolneilash. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="169">Q: The Arrow Cross </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="171">A: The Arrow Cross, right. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="173">Q: The Hungarian fascists. </sentence><sentence id="174">Hungarian Nazis. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="177">A: So he learned to be a tailor and he also learned German because that was the lingua franca of the area. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="179">Q: So he started to study German and tailoring. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="181">A: Right, sort of like vocational school. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="183">Q: Did he actually go to a formal school? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="185">A: This is a school, a school he went to in Hungary </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="187">Q: You don't know which...? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="189">A: I don't know where. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="191">Q: This would have been when he was about eighteen you say. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="193">A: Yeah. </sentence><sentence id="194">I know that he was very excelled in German, in language and the Hungarian German teacher never gave him (one was the best grade, sort of like the A. Grades from one to five, one being the highest, five being the lowest)...and he would never get a one, he would only got a two. </sentence><sentence id="195">And one time he asked her how come I don't get a one I did the best paper in the class? </sentence><sentence id="196">She said to Jews I don't give ones. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="201">Q: Now originally did anyone plan on him becoming a Rabbi considering all the studying that he was... </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="203">A: He was sort of being groomed for some sort of professional role or maybe taking over the hardware store, I'm not sure but it was clear that he was going to be the studier of the family. </sentence><sentence id="204">But I don't think a Rabbi as such was considered. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="207">Q: Now Adolph, did he lose the hardware store? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="209">A: Well, yes, sure the Nazis took it away when they took power. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="211">Q: The Hungarian Nazis. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="213"> 6    </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="214">A: Hungarian Nazis. </sentence><sentence id="215">There were a series of laws passed. </sentence><sentence id="216">First there were quotas imposed on what Jews can and can't do in terms of university admissions or ownership of property and then there were sort of numerous closes which means they couldn't attend university at all; they couldn't have any property other than personal property. </sentence><sentence id="217">So they were taken away and there was a ghetto created in Nyireghaza and then... </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="222">Q: But not in Najhalaas. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="224">A: I don't know about Najhalaas. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="226">Q: It would be too small probably but there's a ghetto in 1944 in Nyireghaza. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="228">A: I don't know if it's 1944 but it's some time in there. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="230">Q: Your father has returned by then? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="232"> A; Oh, yeah, yeah, he was already back because when the trouble started he moved back home. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="234">Q: So he leaves Munkatch, he studies at a vocational school somewhere in Hungary and then he leaves that school to come back home. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="236">A: Well I think that school was home or near home already, the vocational school was. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="238">Q: Okay, so the family is together? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="240">A: The family is together, right. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="242">Q: Including your uncle Julah? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="244">A: Yes, yes. </sentence><sentence id="245">My grandfather was very big on the family being together in the time of crisis and you'll see that later on also. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="246"> Q; What was your uncle Julah doing there in these years before we go ahead? </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="247">A: I don't know. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="249">Q: You don't know whether he was going to school or planning on a trade? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="251">A: I don't know. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="253">Q: No, Okay, so back to the ghetto. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="255"> 7    </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="256">A: Right. </sentence><sentence id="257">The ghetto was in the area that my father lived in because my father lived in the Jewish community area where all the other Jews lived so I don't think they had to move but they did have other people moving in with them. </sentence><sentence id="258">The people from not just Nyireghaza but the whole area because Nyireghaza was sort of the local capital there. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="262">Q: Even Nadjhalaas perhaps? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="264">A: Perhaps -- from the villages were brought in and they were shoved into the ghetto including my father's house. </sentence><sentence id="265">My father's house was relatively comfortable because again they were pretty well off. </sentence><sentence id="266">And they were moved in there and it was pretty uncomfortable because there were many people per room. </sentence><sentence id="267">There were several families living in one room. </sentence><sentence id="268">And then I think the last year 1944 is when the deportation started so all the Jews began to be rounded up and they were put on the cattle cars. </sentence><sentence id="269">They weren't told where they're going. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="276">Q: By Hungarians or by Germans? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="278">A: I think it was mostly Hungarians. </sentence><sentence id="279">The Germans didn't have the manpower to do all this stuff. </sentence><sentence id="280">What they had to do was: first they had to take all their personal belongings and mail it to this address that was given to them. </sentence><sentence id="281">They were told that thats's where they're going to this camp. </sentence><sentence id="282">It's a Hungarian address. </sentence><sentence id="283">So they had to package everything and mailed everything to this camp. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="290">Q: To a Hungarian address to an assumed destination. </sentence><sentence id="291">This was their assumed destination. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="294">A: Assumed destination. </sentence><sentence id="295">My father said that the address was a phony address. </sentence><sentence id="296">They never really read the address. </sentence><sentence id="297">It was just put on a thing and it was all taken and used by the Nazis or whatever. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="302">Q: Did he know that at the time? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="304">A: No, of course not. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="306">Q: So they actually mailed -- the entire family, your father, his father, everyone sent... </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="308">A: Whatever possessions they had -- clothing or whatever had to be sent to this stuff. </sentence><sentence id="309">They also buried, illegally of course, buried some stuff. </sentence><sentence id="310">One of the things that were buried was my father's sort of tools of the trade, his sewing kit, his threads, because threads were ---apparently threads were very hard to come by because the economy, everything was geared toward the war so civilians couldn't come by thread -- you know spools of thread I'm talking about --" so my father took like a box of thread, different colors, needles and what have you and buried it under the chicken coop. </sentence><sentence id="311">8    </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="316">Q: Did he actually have a sewing machine? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="318">A: I don't think do. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="320">Q: So they had some notice. </sentence><sentence id="321">When they were told before they're actually deported they were given what? </sentence><sentence id="322">A couple of days or more? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="326">A: I don't know how long it was. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="328">Q: Did all this happen, mail and everything? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="330">A: No, it had to be more than one day. </sentence><sentence id="331">It must have been a couple of weeks, I guess. </sentence><sentence id="332">They were told they were being relocated. </sentence><sentence id="333">They weren't told they were being shipped off to north. </sentence><sentence id="334">They were just told they're going to a different area. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="340">Q: So they were burying things because they didn't want to give them up, so they couldn't carry them and they were hoping to return some day? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="342">A: Right, right, right. </sentence><sentence id="343">And of course I guess they believed the story that they were being fed but they all had doubts also. </sentence><sentence id="344">They certainly didn't trust the Hungarian Nazis. </sentence><sentence id="345">And so right, like you said they had hopes of coming back one day and digging up stuff. </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="346">A: Did your family ever tell you what his father and mother and other family members were thinking or saying during these days? </sentence><sentence id="347">Anybody doing anything that stands out in your mind besides burying things? </sentence><sentence id="348">Did anyone try to hide, anyone try to get away? </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="349">A: Actually I think that there was some sort of paper that my father acquired. </sentence><sentence id="350">I think it was my father who acquired it. </sentence><sentence id="351">Somebody in the family acquired it, some sort of forged paper that said that he was Hungarian, not Jewish which would have allowed him to leave the ghetto and move away. </sentence><sentence id="352">But my grandfather wanted the family to stick together. </sentence><sentence id="353">He felt the best chance of getting through this was just to stick together. </sentence><sentence id="354">So they gave the paper to I think a cousin. </sentence><sentence id="355">Actually it was a passport, a Hungarian passport. </sentence><sentence id="356">They gave it to my cousin. </sentence><sentence id="357">Actually this cousin is still alive today. </sentence><sentence id="358">I'll get back to him after the war. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="369">Q: Okay. </sentence><sentence id="370">That's not Frank, is it? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="373">A: No, no. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="375">Q: So your father actually had a passport which he could have used but his father Adolph persuaded him to give it to his cousin? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="377">A: Right. </sentence><sentence id="378">9    </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="381">Q: The person who survived, did he survive because of the passport? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="383">A: I guess partly. </sentence><sentence id="384">He wasn't deported so to that extent he was spared a whole -- he sort of increased his chances of survival. </sentence><sentence id="385">We know it's just a question of increasing your chances. </sentence><sentence id="386">You couldn't be really certain that you would survive one way or the other. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="391">Q: Did your father and his family realize at this point that their lives were in fact in danger? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="393">A: I don't think they understood the magnitude of the danger. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="395">Q: They were thinking of their property being stolen, being relocated and so forth but did anyone suspect that whole villages, whole communities would in fact be killed? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="397">A: I don't think so. </sentence><sentence id="398">The whole death camp was certainly nothing that was known to them. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="401">Q: Did anyone hear anything about massacres that had taken place before either in Russia or in Poland by word of mouth, did anyone hear of Hungarian soldiers in Russia returning? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="403">A: I don't think so. </sentence><sentence id="404">I think that there were some sort of prophets of doom that would come by, Jawotinski I think </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="407">Q: He had died </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="409">A: He had died but earlier had come and warned people but he didn't have first-hand information. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="411">Q: No, I'm talking about 42, deg43, deg44. </sentence><sentence id="412">You know people are being killed by the millions in Russia, in Poland. </sentence><sentence id="413">They're Hungarian soldiers in Russia. </sentence><sentence id="414">There are Hungarian Jews who were being sent to work forced labor in Russia. </sentence><sentence id="415">No one was coming back and telling stories? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="421">A: I don't think so, not that my father knew. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="423">Q: So we got your father's family getting ready for resettlement. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="425">A: Resettlement, right. </sentence><sentence id="426">So finally they were getting on the train and the one story he told me that there was this old couple who had this jar of honey with them. </sentence><sentence id="427">Honey was something valuable because it lasted, it didn't spoil and so that was something that they could take with them. </sentence><sentence id="428">On the process of getting on the train they dropped the jar and the jar spilled and all the honey was spilling on the floor 10    and so my father described how eager they were just to scoop it up, what was there to scoop it up with their hands and just put it back and put the honey back in the jar and how futile the attempt was because the honey would be taken away only a few hours later. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="434">Q: But nobody knew. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="436">A: But nobody knew that. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="438">Q: Did they have any food? </sentence><sentence id="439">First of all the whole family got on the train together still? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="442">A: I know my mother who wife was -- certainly the three of them, my father, my father's brother Jussi by his father. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="444">Q: So Adolph, Yena and Jussi. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="446">A: Right, and also my grandmother, that's Adolph's wife and also her baby, the youngest kid because she was just a baby then. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="448">Q: Did they have any food with them? </sentence><sentence id="449">Did he ever tell you what it was like getting into this train? </sentence><sentence id="450">First of all did they know it was going to be a cattle car until they actually saw it? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="454">A: I don't think they knew anything. </sentence><sentence id="455">They were just given orders. </sentence><sentence id="456">The cattle car -- there's barely enough room to stand in the cattle car. </sentence><sentence id="457">You didn't have enough room for packages. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="462">Q: You had said they mailed their belongings already </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="478">Had he ever described the inside of this? </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="479">A: I'm not sure about this particular journey but late on in cattle cars in general it was very crowded. </sentence><sentence id="480">One particular time, I'm skipping ahead a few months, but they were being shipped from one place to the other in cattle cars after they were </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="483">Q: To Auschwitz. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="485"> 11    </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="486">A: All the prisoners had a little sort of like a cup, like a metal cup and this cup was used for everything from getting the soup rations to getting any water if you could find some and also in the cattle cars on this particular journey they were on for several days at a time there was no room to go to the bathroom. </sentence><sentence id="487">So what the prisoners would do is they would -- the ones that weren't standing near the side -- they would sort of use this cup and then just get rid of it. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="490">Q: Use it as a portable toilet. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="492">A: Portable toilet, right. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="494">Q: And then throw it out of the cattle car? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="496">A: Throw it out or even in the cattle car, just get rid of it somehow. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="498">Q: The first trip from Hungary to Auschwitz comes as a shock. </sentence><sentence id="499">No one could imagine this condition. </sentence><sentence id="500">You have no toilet, no food, no belongings. </sentence><sentence id="501">How long did that trip take? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="506">A: I don't know. </sentence><sentence id="507">I don't know how long the trip was. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="510">Q: He never did tell you what it is like being in that -- tell you what people were saying? </sentence><sentence id="511">Here he is with his mother, his father, couple of brothers not knowing where they're going to end up -- any stories about what they were thinking, what they were saying? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="514">A: No, not that I can remember. </sentence><sentence id="515">The anticipation -- I don't have any information about that. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="518">Q: And with nothing to drink, nothing to eat. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="520">A: Nothing to drink. </sentence><sentence id="521">So they finally got to Auschwitz or the first camp. </sentence><sentence id="522">I think it was Auschwitz, sort of like the big camp that everyone sort of checked in through. </sentence><sentence id="523">And they got off the cattle cars and they saw these Polish Jews who were inmates or prisoners, I don't know what to call them with the uniforms, with the stripes. </sentence><sentence id="524">These guys would sort of have a few whispers as they walked by because they weren't allowed to talk to each other but the Polish prisoners who were there for years because the Poles had to go to the camps before -- would tell them about -- they would say things like, make believe you're healthy because that way you would be steered toward, what was it, the right as opposed to the left or whatever it was, whatever their options were. </sentence><sentence id="525">The other reason that if they made believe that they're sick then they wouldn't have to work hard or something. </sentence><sentence id="526">They would go to the hospital or something. </sentence><sentence id="527">That was counter-intuitive to make the.... </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="536">Q: That's right, you don't assume that because you're sick you're going to be killed. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="538">Any other suggestions they were getting? </sentence><sentence id="539">Make believe you're healthy and of </sentence></p><p><sentence id="540"> 12    course how healthy can you be after the train ride like the one you just described. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="541">Any others? </sentence><sentence id="542">How about age? </sentence><sentence id="543">Did they talk about age? </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="544">A: They didn't have a lot of time to talk obviously. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="546">Q: What about children? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="548">A: There's nothing to do about children I suppose. </sentence><sentence id="549">But the Hungarian Jews, they communicated in Yiddish, thought that the ??? </sentence><sentence id="550">was arranged, that these people in the camps because there are some mental problems because after years in the camp they were so dehumanized and the remarks were so outlandish that they thought there was something wrong here. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="554">Q: There was. </sentence><sentence id="555">That's an interesting observation. </sentence><sentence id="556">Here they're getting tips, what we would call tips, right? </sentence><sentence id="557">Helpful hints -- and yet as they hear this it's so difficult to believe that they actually suspect that the messengers are deranged, crazy. </sentence><sentence id="558">And yet what else did they see when they got there? </sentence><sentence id="559">Were these people deranged? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="566">What did your father see when he got out of that car? </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="567">A: He saw the sign that "Work Makes You Free" and he saw there was a building that you went into to strip and get rid of all the clothing. </sentence><sentence id="568">They gave you the prison clothing. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="571">Q: He didn't see any dead people? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="573">A: No, this is up front. </sentence><sentence id="574">The cattle cars come in. </sentence><sentence id="575">It looks like a factory or something. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="579">Q: Well it was. </sentence><sentence id="580">How about -- I mean those who've been there recall the smell. </sentence><sentence id="581">Was there anything about the smell? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="585">A: I think the smell started later because at this point they weren't burning the bodies yet. </sentence><sentence id="586">That only started when they were running out of time, the Germans thought they were running out of time. </sentence><sentence id="587">This point they still had time to bury the bodies after the gas chambers. </sentence><sentence id="588">Or at least there weren't as many crematoria or they weren't going at full speed. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="593">Q: So your father, is he separated from the rest of the family? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="595">A: He was separated from all but the three. </sentence><sentence id="596">That is, my father's father, my father and his brother -- next to the youngest brother -- stayed together the whole time until much later. </sentence><sentence id="597">I'll get to that later. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="601">Q: So Adolph, Yeno are separated... </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="603">A: ...are together, separated from the rest. </sentence><sentence id="604">13    </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="607">Q: Yeah, are separated, -- the rest meaning the mother and the child. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="609">A: I think the rest of the children were there, too. </sentence><sentence id="610">And of course they found out a few days later that they were all killed because the children and the mother went straight to the gas chamber. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="613">Q: They didn't know that until....? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="615">A: Until much later when they got a feel for the rhythm of the camp. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="617">Q: Okay so together they get stripped? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="619">A: They get stripped, they get showered. </sentence><sentence id="620">Believe it or not they get showered, they get their haircuts and they have to give up their shoes and they get their uniforms. </sentence><sentence id="621">They're tattooed I think. </sentence><sentence id="622">Actually I have a very interesting story about that. </sentence><sentence id="623">My father's number was A3166 and his brother's must have been A3066 were very close by but what I am saying is my birthday is April 30, 1966 so there's something very eerie about that. </sentence><sentence id="624">I know it's just coincidence to you but to me there's something -- well anyway... </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="631">Q: They're still together. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="633">A: They're still together and so they go into the camp. </sentence><sentence id="634">They were given these -- the first meal that they got was the soup that was very thick, liquidy -- very thick greenish -- it was thick greenish soup that nobody knew what it was made of or what it was. </sentence><sentence id="635">My father's father, my grandfather and my father's brother didn't want to eat it because it tasted horrible. </sentence><sentence id="636">It didn't taste like food at all, it tasted like cooked tree leaves or something. </sentence><sentence id="637">But my father said to them that we better eat them now because if we get this today we get the same thing tomorrow, it's not going to be better. </sentence><sentence id="638">If we don't survive we have to eat it. </sentence><sentence id="639">That was the theme throughout. </sentence><sentence id="640">My father was into survival. </sentence><sentence id="641">My father said take what we get and you can't be picky because you're not going to survive. </sentence><sentence id="642">And so I guess they ate it or they forced themselves to eat it. </sentence><sentence id="643">And that was it. </sentence><sentence id="644">Every day they got a bowl of soup, this thick greenish soup and not much else. </sentence><sentence id="645">Once in a while in the beginning -- things got progressively worse as it went on -- in the beginning they also got bread in the beginning, sometimes. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="659">Q: When did they arrive in Auschwitz, did he ever tell you? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="661">A: I guess it was sometime in "44. </sentence><sentence id="662">It was the fall of "44, I think. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="665">Q: Or spring. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="667">A: The spring, that could have been it. </sentence><sentence id="668">He was there for a year, all the camps. </sentence><sentence id="669">14    </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="673">Q: Altogether a year because the war ends in the spring of "45 so the spring of "44 one year. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="675">A: Right, right. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="677">Q: How long was he in Auschwitz? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="679">A: I don't know -- a couple of months, maybe several months. </sentence><sentence id="680">I don't know exactly how long. </sentence><sentence id="681">I can't name the camps that he was in. </sentence><sentence id="682">I know he was in Auschwitz; I know he was in Bergen-Belsen. </sentence><sentence id="683">I don't have all the camps off-hand or how long he was in each. </sentence><sentence id="684">Jussi, my father's youngest brother was very good at getting things. </sentence><sentence id="685">My father described that one time they would -- the truck with the bread would come by and they would load the bread into the kitchen and the way it would work is that the guy on the truck would throw the bread -- like big 3 kilo loaves of bread -- to the guy by the kitchen. </sentence><sentence id="686">He would catch it and he would just....And so my father's brother Jussi was very quick. </sentence><sentence id="687">He snuck up underneath the truck -- again this was all the beginning when there was still so much food -- he snuck up underneath the truck and between like sort of the truck and the place where the other guy stood and as the guy picked up the bread to throw it. </sentence><sentence id="688">The guy threw it; immediately turned back to pick up the next piece and the other guy was still sort of still bending up from the previous throw and so he jumped up and caught it and he went back underneath the truck and he ran like hell because if you get caught for that that's shot on sight. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="699">Q: Or hanged. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="701">A: Or hanged. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="703">Q: So he could steal bread. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="705">A: He could steal bread. </sentence><sentence id="706">This is very risky. </sentence><sentence id="707">It's the sort of thing you risk it... </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="711">Q: I know and it's very hard to hide a 3 kilo loaf of bread. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="713">A: What they do was they went to the bathroom and they ate two thirds of it right away and they saved one third of it for my grandfather. </sentence><sentence id="714">The idea was to hide the evidence and eating quickly. </sentence><sentence id="715">There are two reasons why you have to eat it quickly. </sentence><sentence id="716">Number one you have to hide the evidence. </sentence><sentence id="717">Number two things always get either stolen or lost or if you work hard it gets damaged or stolen. </sentence><sentence id="718">Prisoners would steal whatever they can get their hands on. </sentence><sentence id="719">So my father's father said always whatever you get in rations eat it right away. </sentence><sentence id="720">Don't try to save it or ration whatever for yourself. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="729">Q: It sounds like your father and your uncle found it difficult to trust other prisoners. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="731"> 15    </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="732">A: Yeah, there's another little story that bears on that point. </sentence><sentence id="733">It's a very dehumanizing experience and you got to the point where you care about your own personal survival and nothing else. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="736">Q: Not someone else's survival? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="738">A: Not someone else's survival. </sentence><sentence id="739">The three of them were together. </sentence><sentence id="740">That was an exception but other than that... </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="744">Q: So it's the three musketeers..... </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="746">A: Against the world. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="748">Q: Against the world and other prisoners are part of the world. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="750">A: Right, right. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="752">Q: Were there other people from your father's town with him? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="754">A: Occasionally they would have people from that town but as the time went by people would either drop dead or they would be dispersed so there were less and less people that he knew personally. </sentence><sentence id="755">Occasionally he would bump into people he thought he knew. </sentence><sentence id="756">One time he was walking by near the perimeter of the camp and there were these guard towers. </sentence><sentence id="757">And the guard yelled down at him in Hungarian because a Hungarian Nazi and he looked up, you know pleasantly surprised and he threw down, the guard threw down a piece of bread. </sentence><sentence id="758">So he figured wow, Hungarian, there's some people love me up there. </sentence><sentence id="759">He tore the piece of bread apart and the bread was full of little needles, little you know the kind of needles you have in your shirt when it's new. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="766">Q: Pins. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="768">A: Little pins. </sentence><sentence id="769">So if he would have bit into it he could have damaged his mouth. </sentence><sentence id="770">So much for the Hungarian Nazis. </sentence><sentence id="771">Another story was that my father, Jussi again stole beets. </sentence><sentence id="772">And that was another hot commodity. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="778">Q: He's developing a pattern here. </sentence><sentence id="779">Stole beets. </sentence><sentence id="780">Where did he find beets? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="784">A: Near the kitchen. </sentence><sentence id="785">They would sneak into the kitchen. </sentence><sentence id="786">Again these were all capital crimes. </sentence><sentence id="787">The three of them ate so many beets that for days their stool was red. </sentence><sentence id="788">That's all they ate was beets. </sentence><sentence id="789">Another story about my uncle Jussi -- this I think is later. </sentence><sentence id="790">One of the camps -- they were building something. </sentence><sentence id="791">I think it was a glass factory that was being built. </sentence><sentence id="792">This was toward the end of the thing so I'm skipping ahead a few months because the allies would bomb it. </sentence><sentence id="793">They had the three shifts -- the Americans during the day and the Russians at night. </sentence><sentence id="794">16    </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="806">Q: The British at night. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="808">A: The British at night, right. </sentence><sentence id="809">So the factory was being built; they never finished because whatever they built is knocked down by the bombers. </sentence><sentence id="810">They kept bombing this thing </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="814">Q: This was you say near Bergen-Belsen? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="816">A: I don't know. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="818">Q: Or Dora? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="820">A: Dora is one of the things, one of the camps. </sentence><sentence id="821">It may have been Dora. </sentence><sentence id="822">I know Dora was one of the camps my father was in. </sentence><sentence id="823">and so there was a little wheelbarrow that the prisoner has to push up on this little wooden plank at an angle. </sentence><sentence id="824">So they had to sort of run up to get enough momentum to get the wheelbarrow full of cement up on the plank and they would only fill the wheelbarrow half way up because you couldn't get enough momentum to push it all the way up the steep little plank. </sentence><sentence id="825">And so the Kapo who was a prisoner who turned, became one of them, especially picked out bully types, came by and he said how come you're only filling the wheelbarrow half way because you get more productive if you fill it fully so one of the prisoners explained that we can't because we can't push it up the plank that way. </sentence><sentence id="826">So he said let me try. </sentence><sentence id="827">So he had the thing filled up. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="836">Q: The Kapo? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="838">A: He personally had his own wheelbarrow filled up and he... </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="840">Q: You're talking about the Kapo? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="842">A: The Kapo, right and he tried to push it up. </sentence><sentence id="843">He couldn't because it was too heavy. </sentence><sentence id="844">And bear in mind that the Kapo was in better shape than the other prisoners because he got more rations. </sentence><sentence id="845">And so he got steaming mad. </sentence><sentence id="846">He was very upset because not only was he shown wrong but he was also... </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="852">Q: Shown weak. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="854">A: Shown weak, right. </sentence><sentence id="855">And so Jussi loaded the thing completely, the wheelbarrow completely and he went up -- just then he went up and he succeeded in going up the plank. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="858">Q: Jussi? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="860">A: Yes. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="862">Q: The same one that the Kapo couldn't push? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="864"> 17    </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="865">A: The same one that the Kapo couldn't push. </sentence><sentence id="866">So the Kapo was very pleased. </sentence><sentence id="867">He gave him extra rations that day. </sentence><sentence id="868">So these were little tricks that kept them alive. </sentence><sentence id="869">There was one particularly long journey that they had to go on. </sentence><sentence id="870">They had to keep moving east because the British were coming. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="877">Q: This was east from Buchenwald? </sentence><sentence id="878">Remember we started in Auschwitz. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="881">A: We skipped a couple. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="883">Q: From Auschwitz we go west. </sentence><sentence id="884">Now do you have any knowledge of your father's leaving Auschwitz because that's the first step? </sentence><sentence id="885">We've got to get him out of Auschwitz before we get him to the other camps. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="889">A: Right. </sentence><sentence id="890">One of them was the cattle cars. </sentence><sentence id="891">In the beginning they still had cattle cars. </sentence><sentence id="892">Later on they begin to march on foot because again the German war effort required the trains. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="897">Q: And they were falling apart? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="899">A: Falling apart. </sentence><sentence id="900">So I guess I'm sure the first time or two they still had the cattle cars and they were stuck on the train for a couple of days. </sentence><sentence id="901">They didn't have any... </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="905">Q: The three of them together still? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="907">A: I believe so, I believe so. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="909">Q: How is your Grandpa holding up? </sentence><sentence id="910">I mean he's got to be a good deal older to begin with. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="913">A: Yes. </sentence><sentence id="914">He was hanging in there at this point still. </sentence><sentence id="915">And the way they would get water they would stick those little cups I told you about and they would take-- I guess they had a string around the waist to keep their pants up -- and they tied that around the cup, one end of the cup, one string around the cup and they would hang it out the little holes in the cattle cars so they'd scoop some of the snow that was adjacent to the train as it went by so that was the refreshment. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="919">Q: So they were being moved around in the winter. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="921">A: Right. </sentence><sentence id="922">What happened to my grandfather was that they were being relocated at one point and they had to march on foot. ( </sentence><sentence id="923">End of Side One) 18    </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="928">Q: So we were talking about your family is being marched from one camp to another and you were going to tell me something about your grandfather who is too weak or feeling weak. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="930">A: His legs were giving out and he felt he couldn't take it. </sentence><sentence id="931">So the two boys, my father and Jussi gathered around him. </sentence><sentence id="932">They didn't want to leave without him so my grandfather told them to go and they still wouldn't go because they didn't want to abandon him so he commanded them, you know like invoked biblical thou shalt honor thy father and thy mother and he commanded them to go. </sentence><sentence id="933">And so they left. </sentence><sentence id="934">My father later learned that this camp -- the Germans of course were going to kill everybody, destroy the camp because they had to destroy evidence but this camp apparently was liberated by the Russians. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="940">Q: The camp that they were leaving? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="942">A: Right and my grandfather was liberated by the Russians it seemed, later my father learned because the Germans didn't have time to shoot the prisoners. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="944">Q: But you don't know the name of the camp? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="946">A: No. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="948">Q: And you don't know when this happened, this separation? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="950">A: No, I don't know. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="952">Q: Time of the year? </sentence><sentence id="953">Nothing in your father's stories that reveal the season. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="956">A: No, not that I can think of. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="958">Q: But it wasn't Auschwitz? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="960">A: I don't think it was Auschwitz, no. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="962">Q: And it certainly wouldn't be Buchenwald. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="964">A: I don't know. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="966">Q: Okay, so your grandfather was liberated by the Russians? </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1200">Q: So you'd say two or three days later. </sentence><sentence id="1201">The other thing I keep wondering about is the lard itself. </sentence><sentence id="1202">I mean of all the things to be eating... </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1206">A: Well this is surplus. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1208">Q: Yeah, I know. </sentence><sentence id="1209">I'm saying their stomachs and their bodies weren't used to very rich food. </sentence><sentence id="1210">If it hadn't been lard, if it had been something more modest like just bread or a turnip or something it might not have done as much damage. </sentence><sentence id="1211">There were thousands of people who died after liberation because they couldn't handle the food that the British gave them. </sentence></p></dialogue>
