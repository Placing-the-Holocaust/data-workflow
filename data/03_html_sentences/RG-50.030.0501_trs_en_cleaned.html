<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3950">A: I don't recall for sure, but we had not much of a choice [indecipherable] you know. </sentence><sentence id="3951">But we had tried to escape from there, the back wall had the stones -- a stone wall actually, with spaces in between, and we tried to put in cap -- a couple hooks so we could walk out there. </sentence><sentence id="3952">Luckily we didn't try, because there were soldiers out there, too. </sentence><sentence id="3953">And if we had, we'd be dead. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="4003">A: How did I know the resistance? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="4005">Q: Yeah, how did you know? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="4007">A: Because they stayed in a building just south of the village, maybe a few hundred feet south from there, which was supposed to be a camp for Chantiers de jeunesse. </sentence><sentence id="4008">This was Marshall Pittens idea of taking young people and organizing them for future Frenchmen, you know, o-of -- of his kibo and thing.

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="4365">A: It's a -- Jedburgh is a name of a castle out in Scotland. </sentence><sentence id="4366">And they were trained over there in groups of three, usually in the [indecipherable] an officer or non-com, who spoke the language of the country in which they were parachuted into, because it landed in Belgium, Holland, France, Yugoslavia, different places, so they had to have somebody who spoke the local language. </sentence><sentence id="4367">And the third one was a radio operator. </sentence><sentence id="4368">And the -- the point was for them, first of all, to recognize -- to reconnoiter, to find out where the German troops were, their strength, what were good objectives to destroy in case of an invasion to block roads and whatnot. </sentence><sentence id="4369">We were started on the </sentence></p><p><sentence id="4370"> use of a plastic explosives, which was a new thing at the time. </sentence><sentence id="4371">We were trained in using gammon hand grenades, there was a special type of hand grenades that they brought to us. </sentence><sentence id="4372">That's just training, we did not get any of the weapons right away, though, because it -- </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="4373">Q: You got no other weapons? </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="4374">A: I'm sorry? </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="4386">Q: Mmn-hm. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="4388">A: And then, after that they had time in August, to train us. </sentence><sentence id="4389">So Bank came back and trained us in the use of the plastic explosives and they gave us rifles, German, Italian and Russian rifles. </sentence><sentence id="4390">Why these rifles? </sentence><sentence id="4391">Those are the ones that -- the Italian rifles were captured in Africa, North Africa, in Libya, I believe. </sentence><sentence id="4392">The German rifles were captured over there too, possibly or in Italy, and the Russian rifles were captured in Russia. </sentence><sentence id="4393">Since the Germans used -- and other Russian troops, and the German army, I guess they were forced into the service. </sentence><sentence id="4394">They had Ru-Russian drivers there, too. </sentence><sentence id="4395">So the problem was that the ammunition was all different in each of the rifles. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="4404">Q: The ammunition was different? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="4406">A: Yeah. </sentence><sentence id="4407">You could not use one with -- in the other rifles, and that was a big problem. </sentence><sentence id="4408">The reason for giving us those weapons too, was the fact that in case of bad weather, they cannot    </sentence></p><p><sentence id="4409"> parachute or re-supply us, so they have to have a source of constant re-supply, and the best thing [indecipherable] to the Germans and take their weapons -- </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="4410">Q: Right. </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="4411">A: -- and ammunition. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="4427">Q: Right, right. </sentence><sentence id="4428">Now why would he parachute into that area? </sentence><sentence id="4429">Was it known that there were a lot of maquis in the area? </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="4452">Q: Uh-huh. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="4454">A: So we should be able to block them. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="4456">Q: Right. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="4458">A: Block them how? </sentence><sentence id="4459">Mainly by putting [indecipherable] down and blowing them up. </sentence><sentence id="4460">See, it would not block the Germans, but it would slow them down. </sentence><sentence id="4461">They have to remove the trees and whatnot. </sentence></p></dialogue>
