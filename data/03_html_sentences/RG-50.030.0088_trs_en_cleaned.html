id="192">Drive the horse, and then we were already in Latvia, and then we stopped and they are still with us two days, and then this man stopped some other people and, of course, speak fluent Russian and they made us stop for a day, like a half a day and they said we should go closer to the water. </sentence><sentence id="193">And they took him out of the wagon and they said to us, they thanked us for the ride and giving them the ride and we left them right by the water. </sentence><sentence id="194">And I said, how can you leave them by the water? </sentence><sentence id="195">And he said, I made arrangements to the other side because the other side of the river, the Russian Army was a little bit more organized. </sentence><sentence id="196">It could start to fight back. </sentence><sentence id="197">It made like a zone to fight back, and we left them there. </sentence><sentence id="198">My father didn't want to leave the man. </sentence><sentence id="199">After all, he didn't know him and now the man is wounded, and they kept on saying -- I was a boy and I could see that it was his part and there was a bullet, and the other man was going to take it out and my father said, don't do it. </sentence><sentence id="200">You'll kill him. </sentence><sentence id="201">And anyway we left him by the edge of the water and we started going farther. </sentence><sentence id="202">We are already -- my father and my brother and my mother alone, and my father kept the tallis, you know, the tallis what you 9 wear, and he keep it on the wagon with him, and this he took with him. </sentence><sentence id="203">We are going there and then nobody to talk, but luckily my father was fluent in Latvian, is different, similar but different. </sentence><sentence id="204">My mother didn't speak Latvia, and I, of course, didn't and my brother didn't. </sentence><sentence id="205">Then he hear some from -- somebody told us that we are Jewish. </sentence><sentence id="206">You are one of them. </sentence><sentence id="207">The Germans were not even there yet. </sentence><sentence id="208">We didn't know what was going on. </sentence><sentence id="209">And go there, make a left and a right there. </sentence><sentence id="210">And there was a farm and there was a Jew. </sentence><sentence id="211">Maybe he can give you directions. </sentence><sentence id="212">Anyway, we came over there. </sentence><sentence id="213">He had a farm and two sons and all kinds of animals there, chickens and cows and pigs, and all this. </sentence><sentence id="214">And there was a little town and the whole people looked like they like them over there because he was a very nice man. </sentence><sentence id="215">And my father said to him, what should we do? </sentence><sentence id="216">And he said, I am in the same boat like you are. </sentence><sentence id="217">The war was going on. </sentence><sentence id="218">We didn't know how long it was going to go. </sentence><sentence id="219">So stay with us for a while. </sentence><sentence id="220">And we stay for two or three days, and then on the other side of the farm was close to the water, maybe a quarter of a mile. </sentence><sentence id="221">And my father said to him, maybe we could go over to the other side. </sentence><sentence id="222">But we couldn't. </sentence><sentence id="223">He wanted to go over. </sentence><sentence id="224">The reason -- I skipped a little bit. </sentence><sentence id="225">The reason we came to this 10 place, he wanted to go to Latvia. </sentence><sentence id="226">The Russian go over to Latvia. </sentence><sentence id="227">There was bridge and the Russian Army exploded the bridge because -- then the tanks and the army. </sentence><sentence id="228">Their own people. </sentence><sentence id="229">There was a lot of Jewish, and on the bridge, we were lucky not to make the time on the bridge. </sentence><sentence id="230">If we were on the bridge we would be exploded too. </sentence><sentence id="231">Right before our eyes we saw the bridge collapsing and there was a lot of Russian people running around in their underpants, really. </sentence><sentence id="232">With their rifles and they couldn't even walk. </sentence><sentence id="233">They got on the other side. </sentence><sentence id="234">We remained on our side and the people on the other side, there was still the army holding the gun. </sentence><sentence id="235">But a couple days on the farm with this man I said to my father, let me see what was going on. </sentence><sentence id="236">And we took the little boat. </sentence><sentence id="237">We really wanted to go over. </sentence><sentence id="238">He said, I can't take anyone right now. </sentence><sentence id="239">I was going in the nighttime. </sentence><sentence id="240">I was not there and my father, said oh, my God, what is going on there? </sentence><sentence id="241">They are fighting with the Germans and and the Jewish and he found out. </sentence><sentence id="242">And they couldn't make it back on the other side, but he came back with this man from the farm. </sentence><sentence id="243">And he came back and said, look, he said, it is bad. </sentence><sentence id="244">I am taking my horse and wagon and I am going. </sentence><sentence id="245">He had some people that came to him and said, ride it out from the 11 people. </sentence><sentence id="246">And we are left completely alone, and this was like in evening and I said to my father -- and my father's name was Heim(ph) -- and he shake hands with him. </sentence><sentence id="247">I got my family and you have yours. </sentence><sentence id="248">I have to go my way. </sentence><sentence id="249">I can't take you where I'm going. </sentence><sentence id="250">We go where we can and then, of course, we made the journey to go back because we couldn't go to the other side. </sentence><sentence id="251">We were trying to go back from where we came. </sentence><sentence id="252">That's why I said the little horse was like a dog. </sentence><sentence id="253">We didn't know where to go and my father said to him, go horse. </sentence><sentence id="254">He didn't know where to go and he was afraid to ask for directions, things like this. </sentence><sentence id="255">And luckily like I said in the beginning, my father speaks Latvia, and we starting to move back in one little town and , the small towns. </sentence><sentence id="256">And all of a sudden we hear from the people, the Gentile people, the Germans are moving slowly. </sentence><sentence id="257">And then all of a sudden we see a German truck with soldiers and oh, my father said, we are already under the Germans. </sentence><sentence id="258">We caught from the Germans. </sentence><sentence id="259">We are going. </sentence><sentence id="260">My father was smart and took that horse and took some mud and smeared up the horse and made the wagon look like farmers and look not like Jewish people, because he hide the tallis that he had. </sentence><sentence id="261">We are going there and people are greeting us. </sentence><sentence id="262">People thought we are going from one , from one little 12 town to another little town. </sentence><sentence id="263">We are going back to where we go back to from there we went to . </sentence><sentence id="264">We saw where we came to before we go with the Russians and we saw the bombs. </sentence><sentence id="265">We didn't see the city. </sentence><sentence id="266">It was really wiped out. </sentence><sentence id="267">It was bombed. </sentence><sentence id="268">We didn't want to go but still some buildings were still remaining there, and then all of a sudden we come in on the highways where the German Army with this music with this big truck of ____ and tanks. </sentence><sentence id="269">And we are five going farther than them. </sentence><sentence id="270">We are going farther and they are going backwards. </sentence><sentence id="271">And they kept on saying in German , things like this. </sentence><sentence id="272">We knew how to speak German too and, of course, my father knew we are all right. </sentence><sentence id="273">But of course, my father knew more, but the Jewish and German is very similar. </sentence><sentence id="274">But in this experience we are going down to a house, a bag to grab it and saw it on the ground and it exploded. </sentence><sentence id="275">It was like a bomb. </sentence><sentence id="276">They didn't know if we are Jewish or not, but they didn't care. </sentence><sentence id="277">They were soldiers but when we came in to this town -- and we are still in and someone from the windows up from the top, what are you doing? </sentence><sentence id="278">Someone will recognize us. </sentence><sentence id="279">We are not Latvia. </sentence><sentence id="280">There was a Russian man that said to my father, this Russian. </sentence><sentence id="281">It is now six o'clock. </sentence><sentence id="282">Nobody is allowed to be

</sentence><sentence id="427">It was about three, four days. </sentence><sentence id="428">All of a sudden the Germans were the army against the Jews. </sentence><sentence id="429">They pull everybody from all the towns and all over and and they come in with trucks and big machines. </sentence><sentence id="430">And they bringing the wires and, you know, they came up with loudspeakers, everything,

Jews too. </sentence><sentence id="438">They made wires between two streets and they made the bricks over to go where we shouldn't be. </sentence><sentence id="439">We have to build the ghetto ourself and then, of course, they get so organized. </sentence><sentence id="440">They came in with, like I say, the Germans. </sentence><sentence id="441">The Germans alone didn't have a part in the brutality because the and the Poles and the Latvia and have -- everybody was helping the Germans to kill the Jews. </sentence><sentence id="442">Like I saying, they were killing already but somehow we made it through the things. </sentence><sentence id="443">And of course, they putting everybody on the wires in this area and then they say five kilometers or ten kilometers and couldn't see on the map. </sentence><sentence id="444">I couldn't decipher it. </sentence><sentence id="445">Then they put in all the people from the sides and put the gates, they told us it was going to be a couple weeks before the ghetto was created. </sentence><sentence id="446">But I already had experience in Poland. </sentence><sentence id="447">Look like it. </sentence><sentence id="448">They, right away, they took the young people for work and my uncle, rest in peace, he was one, the first one. </sentence><sentence id="449">And he was taken right away from the ghetto, and the second they came in with trucks and wagons and made a liquidation. </sentence><sentence id="450">Young children and old people. </sentence><sentence id="451">They have a special area where they are 21 going to leave and, of course, they came in to my grandfather and grandmother and they put them right away on the truck, and some other people. </sentence><sentence id="452">And in fact, I was running to see my grandfather and when I get there, the Germans coming in and open up the wires in this area. </sentence><sentence id="453">They didn't go around. </sentence><sentence id="454">They came in and closed up again. </sentence><sentence id="455">When I see this area closing up with the rifle and the soldiers and the knives, then I turn back. </sentence><sentence id="456">I was afraid because I knew not to go there because I was born there. </sentence><sentence id="457">There was a Slobodka the Jewish people they were going to be . </sentence><sentence id="458">This was still in the ghetto this time but I knew not to go away, to go through there. </sentence><sentence id="459">It was like a little corridor between the two buildings. </sentence><sentence id="460">But when I say they closing the up the area with my grandmother and grandfather, I didn't go back there luckily. </sentence><sentence id="461">If not, I would be catched by them and not even here. </sentence><sentence id="462">Then they started taking out people. </sentence><sentence id="463">We didn't know where and then, of course, they took them right away to Nitenfort(ph) and they killed them. </sentence><sentence id="464">I'm talking this was tons of people. </sentence><sentence id="465">I couldn't give a number, and this was going on for a little while. </sentence><sentence id="466">And right away the Germans came in with and the Jewish people to make you going to there and you going to this, and they are started getting organized. </sentence><sentence id="467">I 22 would say three or four weeks this got already a , you know, Jews come and they got people. </sentence><sentence id="468">They are putting the star of and they making people in charge. </sentence><sentence id="469">You do this and you do this.

</sentence><sentence id="471">The people going to work on the airport or the they call this. </sentence><sentence id="472">It was before the Russian, but the Germans took it over and they took people for labor. </sentence><sentence id="473">And I myself was supposed to go too, but somehow I had a chance to stay back. </sentence><sentence id="474">More and more we get tougher and tougher. </sentence><sentence id="475">Every day was they put the people in our house and what we have? </sentence><sentence id="476">Kitchen and dining room and living room, a bedroom, everything was in a long straight. </sentence><sentence id="477">If you go to the kitchen, you go to the dining room -- it was a long house. </sentence><sentence id="478">I couldn't compare the house like they have here. </sentence><sentence id="479">It was a nice but in this house we are living four people, but they put in 15 people. </sentence><sentence id="480">They put in people if my whatever we had. </sentence><sentence id="481">This was already in the ghetto. </sentence><sentence id="482">Then they started taking out. </sentence><sentence id="483">By    this time the make the Auschwitz.

</sentence><sentence id="486">It was going on like this for a little, a house we have plenty of room for them. </sentence><sentence id="487">It was going for a little while like this and then we are going to work. </sentence><sentence id="488">And I point out this thing that happened to me in the ghetto. </sentence><sentence id="489">In the beginning we had a cow and horse and when the ghetto start, there was a sign right away. </sentence><sentence id="490">Everything you possess you have to give it away. </sentence><sentence id="491">Of course, we had a horse andI had __ I have the .

a couple weeks these loudspeakers come and everything you possess and everything you have from the living thing, even a chicken, even a fork, everything that alive you were not allowed to have. </sentence><sentence id="503">My father had to give the horse to the Germans. </sentence><sentence id="504">We get shot if they catch us with it. </sentence><sentence id="505">One night I go with my

</sentence><sentence id="511">He used to eat from the your hand. </sentence><sentence id="512">He was like a dog really, not a horse. </sentence><sentence id="513">The horse was so frightened that he start kick and had kicked up the German he almost kill him. </sentence><sentence id="514">He almost knocked down the German. </sentence><sentence id="515">He grabbed the gun against the horse, you know, and he grabbed the gun against my father and, did you tell him to do this? </sentence><sentence id="516">And my father said, I can talk to the horse. </sentence><sentence id="517">He touched the horse and looked him in the mouth and he said, this is a good horse. </sentence><sentence id="518">We ask to use it. </sentence><sentence id="519">Of course, they took it away and kick my father as a

looked at the cow and saw the milk is getting bigger, and he looked underneath the cow and maybe thought I was going to drink or something, and it was a little angry, the Partisan. </sentence><sentence id="527">The was not too far away and he shoot at me. </sentence><sentence id="528">The cow got scared and the cow jumped away, kicked me. </sentence><sentence id="529">| started running into the ghetto and I was chasing the cow, and the cow run until I grabbed the cow and pulled her and back put it back where the cow belonged. </sentence><sentence id="530">It was the the first few days. </sentence><sentence id="531">It was then, when the ghetto was going. </sentence><sentence id="532">On I went a few times to work. </sentence><sentence id="533">You also go to work and then they block the ghetto altogether, and they -- and they made a big action. </sentence><sentence id="534">And this is the thing, that thing make this was a small ghetto from a big ghetto, and they -- I think they, before they got liquidated we had experience with what they are doing. </sentence><sentence id="535">I will tell you about this too, then I will tell you about the action. </sentence><sentence id="536">When they liquidated they took most of the people from the small ghetto and taking them to the Nitenfort(ph) taking them to the Nitenfort(ph), but before they did it 26 there was a hospital in this small ghetto. </sentence><sentence id="537">It was run by Jewish doctor and all kind of people that were capable to run a hospital. </sentence><sentence id="538">It was a regular hospital before. </sentence><sentence id="539">When our house was not too far away from the gates where they make, and then across the street there was a another ghetto and you can see in the back of our house a few blocks away, not in blocks. </sentence><sentence id="540">There was a then. </sentence><sentence id="541">Over there was you can see they built a study for Jewish learning and farther away from the hospital I -- like I say, our house was not so tall but the house in front was four or five stories. </sentence><sentence id="542">They closed up the small ghetto altogether. </sentence><sentence id="543">The military and the soldiers and the Germans and the Partisans were there. </sentence><sentence id="544">When I went up in the roof -- I was young when we were living -- there was a little window to look out. </sentence><sentence id="545">I saw what was going on. </sentence><sentence id="546">They were kicking people and punching them around and putting them in the sections. </sentence><sentence id="547">And when I say from far away, I saw them coming around the fire, and two or five wagons around the building, and then the Germans. </sentence><sentence id="548">And they put a store on the building. </sentence><sentence id="549">They take the kerosene and gasoline and they put this building on fire, and they are jumping, live people. </sentence><sentence id="550">I'm sure four, five hundred people in the building, maybe more. </sentence><sentence id="551">When they bring down the hospital, they were laughing. </sentence><sentence id="552">27 I could see. </sentence><sentence id="553">I was not far away. </sentence><sentence id="554">When people try to run to the window, they were shooting them. </sentence><sentence id="555">They were falling like a bag, like nothing. </sentence><sentence id="556">We saw this was going on and this was the small hospital. </sentence><sentence id="557">That's the way they liquidated the hospital. </sentence><sentence id="558">Then the big action came from the big ghetto and then, of course, they run around with the loudspeakers. </sentence><sentence id="559">And this time was already the ghetto organized. </sentence><sentence id="560">It was the Jew Police. </sentence><sentence id="561">In fact, my uncle -- he was not a plain person but he looked like a bit, looked German. </sentence><sentence id="562">Here a room for you, going to watch this street. </sentence><sentence id="563">You can watch the street. </sentence><sentence id="564">It should be quiet.

id="567">But the way it looked like because of him we went on the good side and my aunt went to the other side. </sentence><sentence id="568">And when they make the big action, they came out with loudspeakers and start saying everybody have to meet in this certain place. </sentence><sentence id="569">It was an empty place in the ghetto. </sentence><sentence id="570">They stage things like this. </sentence><sentence id="571">It was empty, where people used to play football. </sentence><sentence id="572">This was thought nothing but there was no . </sentence><sentence id="573">There was

selection and they make people -- panicking people. </sentence><sentence id="576">Can't take nothing with you. </sentence><sentence id="577">When people get lost from each other, you can hear them saying mama, papa , you know, the Jewish name. </sentence><sentence id="578">There was a panic and this was early in the morning. </sentence><sentence id="579">It was maybe five o'clock in the morning the day before. </sentence><sentence id="580">It was not light outside. </sentence><sentence id="581">You have to go to this truck. </sentence><sentence id="582">We came to this place where it was

</sentence><sentence id="587">They are treating them more awful then they are 29 treating us. </sentence><sentence id="588">On the right side we saw -- it was looser, the ghetto, more and the left was closer the other side. </sentence><sentence id="589">And he separate into thousand and thousand of people, and they open up the gates and put the people back in the clean ghetto, back where they burned the hospital. </sentence><sentence id="590">It was still there and they moved them in there. </sentence><sentence id="591">And it was deep in the night and everything starts falling to quiet, and they came to the right side and they said you can go if you have the houses where you live. </sentence><sentence id="592">Go back to your homes and we are still in the ghetto and they was pulling on the people in the left side, and stopping the soldiers, the Partisans. </sentence><sentence id="593">And like I say, the Lithuanians were maybe with the Germans and they put them in the other side,

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2685">Q: You were describing this bunker, this mountain? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2687">A: Right. </sentence><sentence id="2688">They are building up, of course, coming in with big train and filling it up and soften up and build. </sentence><sentence id="2689">You go up the mountain and then when this was done, they put like a little layer of grass and put in sticks, metal sticks. </sentence><sentence id="2690">All that was maybe a mile was metal that was maybe two or three foot long, all over. </sentence><sentence id="2691">You couldn't pass by and then in the machinery on each side of the mountain of the and start putting in cement and there was machinery coming in with for other camp. </sentence><sentence id="2692">And we had to stay with and build all this, like stages, like steps and push away the gate then run down. </sentence><sentence id="2693">They started from the and they made the gates from wood and, of course, they doing this and filled up the hill and made the other up and build up and they build up maybe four or five foot ditch, and they cover up the whole mountain with cement. </sentence><sentence id="2694">And then they came with the machinery and start digging up and move away the farther away and start digging in two or three foot. </sentence><sentence id="2695">It was very deep. </sentence><sentence id="2696">You could see down. </sentence><sentence id="2697">It was 74 like the 15-floor deep in the floor and they started filling up with cement again. </sentence><sentence id="2698">They made it I would say, the size of this room. </sentence><sentence id="2699">I would say about 40 foot thick, thick cement all around, fully up to the hill of the mountain. </sentence><sentence id="2700">And when they are doing it they made a downstair and made like corridors, and you could walk in the cement and they came with bulldozer. </sentence><sentence id="2701">Later on they come bury the whole thing in the ground and from the outside stick out just the mountain and all this cement was built up so heavy. </sentence><sentence id="2702">They put layers of grass and then when you looked at this, it look like a mountain, like a normal hill. </sentence><sentence id="2703">Only sometimes we are were doing this type of work and we had the Jewish -- this was really like we have the Jewish system -- it was really the time people used to fall in the cement and never came out. </sentence><sentence id="2704">And I think hundreds of people buried. </sentence><sentence id="2705">Almost I fall in there but I was lucky this time again and wasn't working there. </sentence><sentence id="2706">And my father was falling a lot because the work was so hard and stinking in the night time, and from the cement and the powder and the water, and I can't even explain, and it was going on. </sentence><sentence id="2707">I can't even explain the way it was working. </sentence><sentence id="2708">It is like you see a factory with machines and not stopping, and it was going on and people dying. </sentence><sentence id="2709">The guards would say, give an 75 example, a hundred people from my group. </sentence><sentence id="2710">Two is missing all the time. </sentence><sentence id="2711">Every day was dead people there. </sentence><sentence id="2712">And there was the work we are doing there and when we had the mountain down. </sentence><sentence id="2713">And this and they came to start from the beginning and came with machinery and dig out the inside and made another empty stadium answer inside, like you see the dome where they play the football. </sentence><sentence id="2714">That's the way it looked inside from the ground. </sentence><sentence id="2715">But before this was going on there was work I had to do. </sentence><sentence id="2716">It was work we have to going on constant until the end of liberation. </sentence><sentence id="2717">It was not completely finished. </sentence><sentence id="2718">I am giving the picture of the way this is building it, and I was working with my father there at this time. </sentence><sentence id="2719">And there was a German that was in charge of our group, but somehow I was away, say I was lucky. </sentence><sentence id="2720">I was never lazy. </sentence><sentence id="2721">It just like the way I was, work. </sentence><sentence id="2722">But I was watching him. </sentence><sentence id="2723">He wasn't watching me. </sentence><sentence id="2724">It was survival and my brother not so watchful, always get a little and all this. </sentence><sentence id="2725">But in the time we were working there, we been through a lot of experiences. </sentence><sentence id="2726">But to start with the experience that I will begin with is we were working there one day. </sentence><sentence id="2727">I was going out to work and there was a I men, already a Jewish man. </sentence><sentence id="2728">He was putting together the groups. </sentence><sentence id="2729">There was a man, a 76 German, came out and said, who speaks good German? </sentence><sentence id="2730">I didn't speak so well German but I figure I raise my hand. </sentence><sentence id="2731">You speak German? </sentence><sentence id="2732">I got a job for you. </sentence><sentence id="2733">He said I should take this briefcase and come in there, and you going to have a job. </sentence><sentence id="2734">You going to be the fire. </sentence><sentence id="2735">You going to put fire in the ovens for the soldiers. </sentence><sentence id="2736">They had maybe 15 little boxes and had three or four soldiers which can go inside and warm up the hands. </sentence><sentence id="2737">We work also in the wintertime there. </sentence><sentence id="2738">But doing this I felt a little bit free. </sentence><sentence id="2739">1 could go and after bringing coals for the -- when I left my father and brother working on this bunker that they were working. </sentence><sentence id="2740">And one day my father came and they almost killed me. </sentence><sentence id="2741">The same German that was nice, my father told -- he told my father, he told me to leave the job. </sentence><sentence id="2742">Nothing like this. </sentence><sentence id="2743">Anyway, there was my father he was beaten up because I have left the place. </sentence><sentence id="2744">It was not his fault. </sentence><sentence id="2745">It was not my fault. </sentence><sentence id="2746">I lucky to get a better job. </sentence><sentence id="2747">In this job I was doing I was constantly going out and getting fire for the soldiers, putting in fire for the ovens for the soldiers are and just by doing this I had a little bit there was soldiers all around the area, and nobody was in back of -- he says I use today. </sentence><sentence id="2748">Go and take a bag and fill up the bag with coal and go back 77 with the coal. </sentence><sentence id="2749">And meanwhile, I pass by the place they were building the bunker and without a guard, and by doing this I was putting the fire in the ovens. </sentence><sentence id="2750">There was a lot of Germans used to peeling potatos, of apple or something, and used to go into my pocket. </sentence><sentence id="2751">But I didn't have the heart to eat it, and I used to always feel like I have a duty to give the food to my father and my
