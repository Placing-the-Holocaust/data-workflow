<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2777">Q: You were describing this bunker, this mountain? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2779">A: Right. </sentence><sentence id="2780">They are building up, of course, coming in with big train and filling it up and soften up and build. </sentence><sentence id="2781">You go up the mountain and then when this was done, they put like a little layer of grass and put in sticks, metal sticks. </sentence><sentence id="2782">All that was maybe a mile was metal that was maybe two or three foot long, all over. </sentence><sentence id="2783">You couldn't pass by and then in the machinery on each side of the mountain of the and start putting in cement and there was machinery coming in with for other camp. </sentence><sentence id="2784">And we had to stay with and build all this, like stages, like steps and push away the gate then run down. </sentence><sentence id="2785">They started from the and they made the gates from wood and, of course, they doing this and filled up the hill and made the other up and build up and they build up maybe four or five foot ditch, and they cover up the whole mountain with cement. </sentence><sentence id="2786">And then they came with the machinery and start digging up and move away the farther away and start digging in two or three foot. </sentence><sentence id="2787">It was very deep. </sentence><sentence id="2788">You could see down. </sentence><sentence id="2789">It was 74 like the 15-floor deep in the floor and they started filling up with cement again. </sentence><sentence id="2790">They made it I would say, the size of this room. </sentence><sentence id="2791">I would say about 40 foot thick, thick cement all around, fully up to the hill of the mountain. </sentence><sentence id="2792">And when they are doing it they made a downstair and made like corridors, and you could walk in the cement and they came with bulldozer. </sentence><sentence id="2793">Later on they come bury the whole thing in the ground and from the outside stick out just the mountain and all this cement was built up so heavy. </sentence><sentence id="2794">They put layers of grass and then when you looked at this, it look like a mountain, like a normal hill. </sentence><sentence id="2795">Only sometimes we are were doing this type of work and we had the Jewish -- this was really like we have the Jewish system -- it was really the time people used to fall in the cement and never came out. </sentence><sentence id="2796">And I think hundreds of people buried. </sentence><sentence id="2797">Almost I fall in there but I was lucky this time again and wasn't working there. </sentence><sentence id="2798">And my father was falling a lot because the work was so hard and stinking in the night time, and from the cement and the powder and the water, and I can't even explain, and it was going on. </sentence><sentence id="2799">I can't even explain the way it was working. </sentence><sentence id="2800">It is like you see a factory with machines and not stopping, and it was going on and people dying. </sentence><sentence id="2801">The guards would say, give an 75 example, a hundred people from my group. </sentence><sentence id="2802">Two is missing all the time. </sentence><sentence id="2803">Every day was dead people there. </sentence><sentence id="2804">And there was the work we are doing there and when we had the mountain down. </sentence><sentence id="2805">And this and they came to start from the beginning and came with machinery and dig out the inside and made another empty stadium answer inside, like you see the dome where they play the football. </sentence><sentence id="2806">That's the way it looked inside from the ground. </sentence><sentence id="2807">But before this was going on there was work I had to do. </sentence><sentence id="2808">It was work we have to going on constant until the end of liberation. </sentence><sentence id="2809">It was not completely finished. </sentence><sentence id="2810">I am giving the picture of the way this is building it, and I was working with my father there at this time. </sentence><sentence id="2811">And there was a German that was in charge of our group, but somehow I was away, say I was lucky. </sentence><sentence id="2812">I was never lazy. </sentence><sentence id="2813">It just like the way I was, work. </sentence><sentence id="2814">But I was watching him. </sentence><sentence
