<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="79">A: If you're referring to the situation of the Italian Jews, nothing was happening in Italy except for those racial laws, which limited the professional in their trade activities, and therefore, they preferred to immigrate. </sentence><sentence id="80">However, everyone was free and you could go to restaurants and bars any time. </sentence><sentence id="81">However, we did have information and news that the situation is Germany as far as the persecution of Jews was concerned was very bad starting in 1939, and with the invasion of Poland the persecution escalated and it also escalated in Czechoslovakia. </sentence><sentence id="82">These, of course, things that we all heard, but I saw it with my own eyes in Poland and in Croatia, and Bulgaria. </sentence><sentence id="83">Of course, in Bulgaria, King Boris...until King Boris was alive he tried to limit the persecution against Jews. </sentence><sentence id="84">And in Rumania, of course, the persecution became extremely cruel in 1940...uh...and it was worse in Rumania than in Germany where in Rumania, the Rumanians can be very ferocious when they nurture political hate. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="143">Q: Tell us. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="145">A: Uh... That day Admiral Hortee who was a region of the Prime Region of Hungary...in other words he was head of State, traveled to Germany to meet with Hitler. </sentence><sentence id="146">However, he was arrested and detained for a few days. </sentence><sentence id="147">During those days, the Hungarian Democratic government was struck down. </sentence><sentence id="148">At the time even though Hungary was in war, the government was a democratic government. </sentence><sentence id="149">It had a parliament, a senate, a constitution. </sentence><sentence id="150">Uh...So during Admiral Hortee's imprisonment...uh...they took advantage of this fact to install a Nazi government. </sentence><sentence id="151">He...the Admiral then returned but the government had...was already in place. </sentence><sentence id="152">And the first measures that were taken were anti-Jewish laws that were passed and the first...including the imposing... imposition of wearing the star, the David Star, on the front and on the back. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="161">Q: What was life like for you? </sentence><sentence id="162">Did life change for you as well? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="165">A: Uh... Yes, life did change for me because after the Italian Armistice on September 8th, 1943, I remained loyal to the Queen's government and so therefore I was among those...uh...who were to be arrested, who were supposed to be arrested by the Germans. </sentence><sentence id="166">Uh...But that morning I left my home and I never returned. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="169">Q: Excuse me. </sentence><sentence id="170">We're going to have to stop. </sentence><sentence id="171">Excuse me. </sentence><sentence id="172">You tell him that an entire contract hinges on that man's stopping. </sentence><sentence id="173">Now! </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="179">A: Ready now? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="181">Q: Almost. </sentence><sentence id="182">Just keep on going. </sentence><sentence id="183">Okay. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="187">A: Okay. </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="188">A: Uh...After the Armistice on September 8th, 1943, I had remained loyal to the Italian government, and so I did not adhere to Mussolini's Social Republic. </sentence><sentence id="189">So therefore because of this and because I had had some trade disagreements with Germans in Hungary, I...uh...decided to hide when the Germans invaded Hungary...uh...on that morning, early morning of March 19th. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="192">Q: What did you do? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="194">A: Uh... Yes. </sentence><sentence id="195">Yes. </sentence><sentence id="196">I needed to find a situation...a solution to..uh...my situation and I found one when I asked the Spanish Legation for asylum. </sentence><sentence id="197">Uh...Because I had fought in the Spanish Civil War, I could take advantage of the fact that the Spanish government had said that anyone who had fought...any foreigner who fought in this war who should ever find himself in difficulties could turn to the Spanish Diplomatic authorities for help. </sentence><sentence id="198">And...uh...] ask therefore the Spanish government to give me a passport if...if I thought that I needed and temporary citizenship. </sentence><sentence id="199">I didn't actually get it right away. </sentence><sentence id="200">I didn't go and pick up my passport right away. </sentence><sentence id="201">Uh...in...in March 1944, and I hid for one week in the Spanish extraterritorial buildings. </sentence><sentence id="202">Then the Hungarian government notified me that I was to be interned and so I presented myself and I was interned from the beginning of April to October 13th, 1944. </sentence><sentence id="203">During that time I could not follow the situation closely because I wasn't in Budapest. </sentence><sentence id="204">We did hear...uh...about unpleasant...we did hear about unpleasant news. </sentence><sentence id="205">Uh...We...we could read papers, but there was censorship. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="218">Q: What happened next? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="220">A: Uh... The internment wasn't bad at all. </sentence><sentence id="221">We had three meals a day. </sentence><sentence id="222">We had tea...uh...with small cakes and cigarettes and soap and toothpaste, even some pocket money. </sentence><sentence id="223">And all of this was according to the Geneva Convention. </sentence><sentence id="224">Uh...And there was treatment afforded to Italian diplomatic members, and I fell within that category. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="230">Q: Why was he then considered an Italian diplomat? </sentence><sentence id="231">At that point? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="234">A: And because I was with the Italian Trade Commission. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="236">Q: When did the internment stop? </sentence><sentence id="237">What happened to you? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="240">A: It didn't stop. </sentence><sentence id="241">I escaped. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="244">Q: Please tell us about it. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="246">A: You want to know how he escaped? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="248">Q: Yes. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="250">A: Uh...On October 13th, 1943, I was very lucky. </sentence><sentence id="251">I had these fake papers which authorized me to go to Budapest for health reasons. </sentence><sentence id="252">They weren't...it wasn't really true but anyway I had the papers. </sentence><sentence id="253">Luckily, that morning a Swiss diplomatic car arrived with a Swiss diplomatic and an Hungarian diplomatic who came to visit the internees where we were and check on me. </sentence><sentence id="254">And that day I asked them to take me to Budapest. </sentence><sentence id="255">Of course, they inquired about my documents and they realized they were fake, but they took me to Budapest anyway and that was on the 13th. </sentence><sentence id="256">On the 15th, Admiral Hortee proclaimed Armistice and....uh...but...uh...he specified in August of 44...it specified in August 44, Admiral Hortee had fired. </sentence><sentence id="257">I must specific...I'm sorry, in August 1944, Admiral Hortee had fired the Nazi government, had eliminated the Nazi government and set up in its place a military government which is headed by General Lackatosh. </sentence><sentence id="258">Uh...This government first abolished the Star of David, the wearing the Star of David, and struck down the racial laws. </sentence><sentence id="259">So for about a month the Jewish community lived in relative peace. </sentence><sentence id="260">For example on October 14th, I lunched with a Jewish Hungarian in a big restaurant in Budapest. </sentence><sentence id="261">On the next day on the 15th, I lunched with Mrs. De Franco, who is also Jewish Hungarian married to a Italian diplomatic in a public restaurant. </sentence><sentence id="262">And during this lunch we heard that Admiral Hortee had proclaimed armistice to the Soviet Union and Anglo-Americans. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="276">Q: </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="277">Q: He had said he left internment in 1943. </sentence><sentence id="278">Did he mean 1944? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="281">A: 44. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="283">Q: Thank you. </sentence><sentence id="284">Okay. </sentence><sentence id="285">After you...what happened to you after this luncheon in October of 44 with Senora DeFranco. </sentence><sentence id="286">Where did you go and what did you do? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="291">A: Uh...This lady was very fearful when she heard this news which was being repeated on the radio, broadcast over and over again. </sentence><sentence id="292">Anyhow, I...I didn't know what to do and so I decided to seek refuge in my Hungarian friend's house for a few days. </sentence><sentence id="293">But after a few days they asked me to leave because they said it was dangerous for them...uh...because the Germans and the Hungarians...the Nazi Hungarians had bombarded the Royal Palace, and Admiral Hortee was taken prisoner and...and taken to Germany. </sentence><sentence id="294">And immediately following these events, the real anti-Jewish terror began. </sentence><sentence id="295">At least that's what I saw. </sentence><sentence id="296">And the wearing of the star was imposed once again. </sentence><sentence id="297">But anyhow, I left my friend's house and went to a private hospital but even there after a few days the Director asked me to leave for...uh...same reasons. </sentence><sentence id="298">The next morning, therefore, I decided to ask...to go to the Spanish Legation to ask for the passport that the Spanish government had promised me in September 43 but which I didn't pick up because I didn't want to change nationality at the time. </sentence><sentence id="299">Uh...So...uh...we went...I went to the Legation and they had to write up a letter saying they had searched for me a few years and that they finally found me and so that we could proceed with the change of citizenship. </sentence><sentence id="300">So together with a...an attorney from the Spanish Legation, we went to the Hungarian Ministry of Interior where my Italian citizenship was abolished and I became a Spanish citizen. </sentence><sentence id="301">And I was asked to leave the country within 15 days. </sentence><sentence id="302">Naturally, I couldn't leave. </sentence><sentence id="303">Where...where could I go? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="317">Q: Please. </sentence><sentence id="318">Continue. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="321"> BREAK IN TAPE </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="322">A: Un...When I returned from the Ministry to the Legation, there was a lot of confusion. </sentence><sentence id="323">There were a lot of people outside the Legation. </sentence><sentence id="324">Some of them were wearing the star. </sentence><sentence id="325">Some were not. </sentence><sentence id="326">There were about a hundred people. </sentence><sentence id="327">I asked the attorney what was happening and he responded that the Jews were seeking protection, but the Legation had a problem because the only one Christian who could handle all the workload because the...the attorney told me he was also Jewish, and that he was a war hero. </sentence><sentence id="328">He had been a war hero during World War I. And so anyway they had this problem because they had...didn't have enough people and they even had at one point 300 people who had been protected and who were taken away and they did not know anything about their whereabouts. </sentence><sentence id="329">So at that point I went to the and I told that what I had just learned myself and offered my help. </sentence><sentence id="330">He replied that...uh...he would be willing and happy to work...to have me work with him, but he couldn't pay me. </sentence><sentence id="331">And I said that I didn't need any money, that I had enough to live on in those days. </sentence><sentence id="332">So we had one more letter written up to the Ministry...to the Foreign Affairs Ministry of Hungary which we took over with...uh...Sanspritz which...uh... was an official statement that I was a member of the Spanish Legation and we had it...a stamp put on it, and I also got my diplomatic identify card...uh... Since Sanspritz therefore was dealing exclusively with the Foreign Affairs Ministry. </sentence><sentence id="333">That was his responsibility. </sentence><sentence id="334">Myk responsibility was to deal with the Jewish protection organization. </sentence><sentence id="335">I had the authorization, official authorization to do that. </sentence><sentence id="336">However, I didn't know how to start. </sentence><sentence id="337">Uh...And so I asked around and I asked Attorney Farkosh who unfortunately died the first day that the Russians arrived and that this tragedy and a new tragedy started. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="354">Q: We are going to pause and change tapes. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="356"> End of Tape #1 </sentence></p><p><sentence id="357"> TAPE #2 </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="358">A: At the beginning...uh...my work consisted in trying to find the 300 people who were...who had been protected by the Spaniards and who were arrested...who had been arrested by the Nazis...uh...at the very...the very first few days of the new government. </sentence><sentence id="359">So a couple of times I went, I traveled to the Hungarian German border and eventually we found a few of these people who had better protection from the Spanish Legation. </sentence><sentence id="360">And we took them back to Budapest. </sentence><sentence id="361">Uh...Then we went to this train station where goods and merchandise are unloaded on the docks...on the platforms. </sentence><sentence id="362">I'm sorry. </sentence><sentence id="363">And...uh...these are the platforms where the Germans took away thousands of Jews to Germany. </sentence><sentence id="364">And there we found there more people. </sentence><sentence id="365">And out of the 300, we found about 150. </sentence><sentence id="366">We don't know what happened to rest. </sentence><sentence id="367">At the time...uh...that reminds me, I had a small...a little episode happened to me. </sentence><sentence id="368">I saw that there was a column of people who were being deported and...uh...among these people, there were two twins who were very attractive kids and very friendly looking kids who were about 11 years old. </sentence><sentence id="369">And...uh...so I thought to myself, what would happen to them and...uh...decided to tell them, "Look, kids. </sentence><sentence id="370">You see that car over there with the Spanish flag. </sentence><sentence id="371">Run to the car and the chauffeur will close the doors and you'll be safe." </sentence><sentence id="372">But at that moment a major of the Gestapo ran to the car because he wanted those kids back. </sentence><sentence id="373">I told them that the kids were in an extraterritorial car protected by the Spanish Legation. </sentence><sentence id="374">So he took out a gun and threatened me. </sentence><sentence id="375">But next to me was Mr.Wallenberg, who told the German that I was a representative of the Spanish Government and that the kids were in an extraterritorial car. </sentence><sentence id="376">And...uh...so the German responded, "Leave me alone. </sentence><sentence id="377">You're...you're impeding...you're disturbing my work." </sentence><sentence id="378">And so I responded, "You call this work?" </sentence><sentence id="379">So, of course, he got madder and madder and everyone was speaking very loudly at the same time and that includes Wallenberg; that includes a Vatican representative; the Swiss and the Portuguese representatives; all the neutrals. </sentence><sentence id="380">And at that point a Colonel approached and asked what was happening and he was told and he finally said, "Well, let it be. </sentence><sentence id="381">Their time will come too", meaning that the two kids would be taken away. </sentence><sentence id="382">So the kids...uh...stayed in the car and the two Germans left. </sentence><sentence id="383">And I asked Wallenberg who that man was, and he responded, "That was Eichmann." </sentence><sentence id="384">The...uh...two kids didn't have a letter, obviously, of protection....uh...so when we got back to the Legation...oh..and...and when we got to the Legation, I realized they were not two boys as I had thought, but it was a boy and a girl who looked identical but they were of a different sex and so I had to find a house for them but I don't remember the details. </sentence><sentence id="385">At the time if I remember, we only had one house. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="415">Q: Keep going please. </sentence><sentence id="416">Please continue. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="419">A: So the...uh...the org...the organization to protect...the Spanish organization to protect...uh...Jews started and this was an initiative...was not an initiative of the Legation. </sentence><sentence id="420">Uh...The Spanish government was trying...was not an initiative of the Legation. </sentence><sentence id="421">It was the Spanish Government was trying to save as many Jews as possible and I saw that this was happening in Croatia. </sentence><sentence id="422">Uh...and according to Spanish...uh...norms and regulations, they were trying to save as many Jews as possible. </sentence><sentence id="423">Uh...We had one house at the beginning and we slowly built up to six houses. </sentence><sentence id="424">But the protection consisted of much more than just writing the letters and of putting up a flag and a banner. </sentence><sentence id="425">That was not enough. </sentence><sentence id="426">The...uh...much more attention had to be given to the aftermath and...and to the fact that the Nazis could take them away. </sentence><sentence id="427">And so we had to provide protect...that kind of protection too, not only to our Legation but to the others too, to Switzerland, Sweden...uh...to the Vatican and to the Portuguese. </sentence><sentence id="428">At the end of November, we had about 3,000 people who were being protected. </sentence><sentence id="429">Now on the...other...the last day of November or the first of December, Sanspritz left Hungary. </sentence><sentence id="430">Now, in a document that I have written previously...memorial that I have written previously, I wrote down the date as being December 7. </sentence><sentence id="431">I did that to cover Sanspritz. </sentence><sentence id="432">I did that because I wanted to protect him and he needed 10 days, about 10 days more than necessary so that I could protect him. </sentence><sentence id="433">But now I have chosen to tell the truth. </sentence><sentence id="434">However, I can't give you any more details now, because I first have to speak with the Spanish Ambassador. </sentence><sentence id="435">I will speak with him tomorrow evening because something happened which disturbed me very much. </sentence><sentence id="436">Something very sad happened. </sentence><sentence id="437">And it was sad because it revealed to me that this human soul has...uh...evil elements in it. </sentence><sentence id="438">But first before getting into this, I must speak to the Spanish Ambassador for reasons of loyalty. </sentence><sentence id="439">Anyway, that day...uh...either the last day of November or the first day of December and I don't remember exactly which one, Sanspritz, who is a diplomat, a career diplomat left. </sentence><sentence id="440">And so I was trying to decide what to do. </sentence><sentence id="441">I'd heard by the way that he'd left at about 6:00 AM...uh...through a phone call and I don't remember if it was him...if he personally who called me or someone else, a legal attache or what. </sentence><sentence id="442">But anyway, I learned that he was...that he'd left. </sentence><sentence id="443">And so I took a walk around the international ghetto wondering what I could do and I found myself in Lagradi Corroli Street, and I saw that this building was being occupied by the police, so I entered the building and asked what was happening and saw that there were people with suitcases, a few suitcases and...uh...the people, the Jews in the house told me that the police want...wanted to take them away. </sentence><sentence id="444">So I decided to lock the door and...uh...L...I went to see the lieutenant and I asked him what was happening and I told him that he couldn't do this because the house is being protected...uh...by the Spaniards and he needed my permission, and I was surprised at his behavior since he was part of the regular police forces. </sentence><sentence id="445">He was not a parliamentary police force. </sentence><sentence id="446">So we came to an agreement. </sentence><sentence id="447">The police agreed to postpone everything for a few days and we went to a park where we met with these members who belonged to a committee which have representatives from police force, Ministry of Interior, Foreign Affairs, and I protested what was happening and someone told me that the...that they had heard that the Spanish representative had fled the city and so there was no more relations with the Spanish Government. </sentence><sentence id="448">I told

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="719">A: I escaped on October 13th, 1944. </sentence><sentence id="720">It wasn't an internment camp. </sentence><sentence id="721">I had my own room. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="722">Each person had his own room. </sentence><sentence id="723">We ate three times a day and then we had tea in the afternoon and they even gave us cigarettes, soap and toothpaste and even money. </sentence><sentence id="724">And this was according to the Geneva Convention because I was aggregated to the Italian commercial delegation and therefore I had uh I was uh I could uh have diplomatic uh treatment. </sentence><sentence id="725">Uh the 13th I left. </sentence><sentence id="726">The 13th of October and I arrived in Budapest that evening and the next day I don't know what I did but on the 15th the armistice was proclaimed between Hungary, Russia, Great Britain and America. </sentence><sentence id="727">This was an announcement, a terrible announcement because no one was prepared for it except a few people who who knew questions of state and government. </sentence><sentence id="728">I was surprised. </sentence><sentence id="729">I was having lunch with an Italian lady who was of the Jewish faith and she was married to an Italian diplomat and we...she was speechless and I was surprised, and I didn't know what to do. </sentence><sentence id="730">So II hid because the TV was controlled by the Admiral government and everything else fell in the hands of the Nazis and of the Germans, Hungarian Nazis and the German army and their...and then I went to hide in a house which belonged to a friend of mine, uh family friends in the and from this house I went to a hospital to hide because I didn't know where to go because from the first evening I slept in a friend's house in </sentence></p><p><sentence id="731"> who gave me the keys to his apartment. </sentence><sentence id="732">The next day I discovered that the maid was a German, a , and she was pro-Nazi and therefore I didn't go back to that house because it seemed dangerous to me. </sentence><sentence id="733">After a couple of days in the hospital, I spent two more days in hiding. </sentence><sentence id="734">I was hidden by the land...by the landlady in the house where I used to live once upon a time, but then I realized that the Ugandian (ph) Hotel that I knew very well was being emptied because many German officers were leaving with their suitcases    </sentence></p><p><sentence id="735"> and I went to the keeper of the building and I asked him if he could give me a room and he said give me a passport and I said I don't have any passport anymore. </sentence><sentence id="736">I don't have any more documents and he said OK, for two days I'll give you a room and then I...so I didn't know what to do. </sentence><sentence id="737">And so therefore the next morning I decided to go to the Spanish Legation. </sentence><sentence id="738">It was probably eight in the morning. </sentence><sentence id="739">I went there and on the way, on the road, and Iwas on foot,on__ Street which is a big street, I saw that some Hungarian Nazis were chasing a child who was probably seven or eight years old. </sentence><sentence id="740">They reached him and one of them shot the child in the back of the head. </sentence><sentence id="741">I was quite struck by this naturally and I asked a passerby why, what did that child do? </sentence><sentence id="742">Who is he? </sentence><sentence id="743">And he said he's Jewish. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="744">From the roofs of the houses, however, there were some Jews who were shooting against the Nazis from the rooftop houses. </sentence><sentence id="745">But anyway I went to the Legation andI found --__ who gave me a passport and I...he said come tomorrow with two photos, and I had two in my pocket which I pulled out, and I gave them to him and then he gave me the passport. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="746">And he also gave me a letter from the Minister of Interior which said that the Spanish government two years earlier had granted me their citizenship because I had fought in the civil war and also, the letter also said...and that I had asked for a citizenship and the letter said that they were not able to locate me and that they now found me and I had to assume citizenship, Spanish citizenship. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="747"> TECHNICAL CONVERSATION - PAUSE So we were...with this letter 1 went together with the legal attache...we went to the Minister of Interior where I changed citizenship. </sentence><sentence id="748">I canceled the Italian one and I assumed Spanish citizenship. </sentence><sentence id="749">When I returned to the Legation that early morning, it was probably eight or nine a.m., and it's strange that that morning Sanspritz (ph) got up at eight a.m., but these were very difficult times and people didn't always go to sleep. </sentence><sentence id="750">I saw...thank you...that there was a lot of confusion around, surrounding the Legation at the entrance and in the courtyard, and that many of these people who were there had were wearing the David Star, Star of David, and I asked the legal attache what was happening and he said that these were people who are asking for our protection, protection from the Spanish government but right now we're in difficulty because the only Christian legation is Sanspritz. </sentence><sentence id="751">And therefore it's impossible to organize an external protection and it's it doesn't make any sense to give them protection letters but I said if I can be of help, then I...maybe I can do something, so we went to Sanspritz and I told him I'm available if you need me, and he said yes. </sentence><sentence id="752">Sanspritz said yes but I can't pay you because we don't have any funds to pay you with and I said I'm not interested because I have enough money to survive on my own. </sentence><sentence id="753">And so I started immediately. </sentence><sentence id="754">I started working immediately. </sentence><sentence id="755">The first few hours I must tell the truth....I didn't know what to do and I didn't know where to start, but then after speaking with uh the attorney Fakash (ph) who was the attorney and also with the Chancellor and with other people who were there who were all Jews, Fakash, the Chancellor, her son and all of the refugees and so I realized what could be done. </sentence><sentence id="756">The first thing was to try to get back about three hundred people who had been protected by Spain. </sentence><sentence id="757">They had about three hundred, only three hundred at that time because the Hungarian government had said three hundred, and Sanspritz accepted this decision on behalf of the Spanish government and this is something that I didn't, didn't accept immediately at first so those first two or three days my job was to try to find those </sentence></p><p><sentence id="758"> who had been protected, of the three hundred protected. </sentence><sentence id="759">Of the three hundred I was able to get a hundred and fifty back and I found them at the uh Merchandise Depot, at the train station and also by going to the border between Hungary and say Austria and Germany, and those who had a Spanish ID we were able to bring them back. </sentence><sentence id="760">It seems to me we had rented two trucks but I don't remember now how many, or we brought them back with the train or we reserved a special car...I, I don't really remember how that happened. </sentence><sentence id="761">I was with the car. </sentence><sentence id="762">I had a car. </sentence><sentence id="763">So I started working. </sentence><sentence id="764">I saved uh...after...oh he wants to know if you're going to edit it, edit this tape... ..So the episode at the train station...you can take it from the other tape and put it together, piece it together. ( </sentence><sentence id="765">Pause- Technical Conversation) The first episode that struck me very much and which opened my eyes to what was happening and to how things were actually really were, at the train station they were loading train cars with Jews who were being deported because the Hungarian government said that it had an agreement publicly with the German government to give thirty million uh Jews who would go to work and then we understood that that wasn't true, that they were going to work. </sentence><sentence id="766">They were people who were being deported and then we didn't know what would happen to them in the end, so much so that Eva Long's (ph) husband had volunteered to be a laborer. </sentence><sentence id="767">He went on the train but on the trip between Budapest and the border he understood...I don't know how...but he understood that it was a trick and so he jumped from the train and he came back to Budapest. </sentence><sentence id="768">And he came back to Budapest to . </sentence><sentence id="769">I don't think that that building existed yet but anyway he came to one of the Spanish houses, so...this episode of the two twins...at a certain point there was a column which was going and we were looking to see if anybody was there with Spanish letters, and I saw two twins, two kids of eleven or twelve years old. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="770">They were very handsome kids, nice kids and they were identical and the more I saw the more | told myself how is it possible that I, I let them go, and so I told these kids, you see that car over there. </sentence><sentence id="771">Get in the car. </sentence><sentence id="772">Run to the car. </sentence><sentence id="773">Get into the car. </sentence><sentence id="774">Close the door and then the chauffeur will know what he has to do. </sentence><sentence id="775">Maybe you would like to hear from me how I could communicate with these people. </sentence><sentence id="776">At the time I spoke German, French, Spanish, but I could explain myself, I could express myself in Hungarian for a little bit and perhaps I spoke Hungarian with these children, but anyhow these kids went. </sentence><sentence id="777">One Gestapo major came to and he wanted the kids back, and I said no. </sentence><sentence id="778">They were in the car. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="779">It's a Spanish car and it had a Spanish uh flag and a license plate, diplomatic license plates and therefore the car was extra-territorial property. </sentence><sentence id="780">He insisted. </sentence><sentence id="781">He took out his gun and then so forth, and next, Wallenberg was next to me and Wallenberg said...told the major, the German major, look...this man represents Spain. </sentence><sentence id="782">You can't...you can't commit any violent acts. </sentence><sentence id="783">He said look. </sentence><sentence id="784">He's getting in the way of my work, and instinctively I replied that you call this work. </sentence><sentence id="785">That's what I asked him. </sentence><sentence id="786">And so he got even more angry. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="787">He wanted the kids back. </sentence><sentence id="788">And L...at that point I saw the situation getting really bad. </sentence><sentence id="789">I thought my God, this man is crazy. </sentence><sentence id="790">He could shoot us. </sentence><sentence id="791">He had a big gun, a Mauthauser (ph), a big big gun, but at that point...we were all yelling. </sentence><sentence id="792">I was screaming. </sentence><sentence id="793">Wallenberg, the Spaniard...sorry...the Portuguese, the Swiss, the Vatican...everyone intervened in the discussion. </sentence><sentence id="794">There were many loud voices at the same time and so this colonel, a colonel came, an SS colonel came...of the Gestapo...sorry...came to see what was happening and he asked the major what was happening and the major explained it to him, and so he said now let it be...their time will come too for the kids. </sentence><sentence id="795">And so they left. </sentence><sentence id="796">And then I brought these kids home. </sentence><sentence id="797">I brought them to the Legation and I was surprised to see that they were </sentence></p><p><sentence id="798"> really a boy and a girl who when they were fully dressed you couldn't tell and they...it was a boy and a girl and they were perfectly identical. </sentence><sentence id="799">The same height, the same face...everything, everything was identical. </sentence><sentence id="800">This is an episode that struck me which, which along with the other episode of the child who was killed on the street, these two episodes made me reflect very much. </sentence><sentence id="801">It's not that...at the time I really wasn't fully aware of the situation. </sentence><sentence id="802">From the end of March to October 13th, I was not... had been interned away from Budapest in the countryside...I continued my work. </sentence><sentence id="803">I stopped looking for the three hundred people because I got one hundred and fifty back and it seemed have understood that there was nothing more that could be done and so I started to organize the protection network. </sentence><sentence id="804">We had a house. </sentence><sentence id="805">I don't remember where it was. ( </sentence><sentence id="806">Technical conversation) I don't remember which one it was but we did have one house. </sentence><sentence id="807">Maybe two houses we had already. </sentence><sentence id="808">Maybe they were ___ wherever Long was...yes, it's perhaps...but anyway that's not important. </sentence><sentence id="809">I started organizing by issuing hundreds of letters immediately. </sentence><sentence id="810">Letters of protection and I would...I would let these people come in. </sentence><sentence id="811">We would go to the office and type up these letters. </sentence><sentence id="812">Sanspritz didn't know anything because we used his signature pad. </sentence><sentence id="813">He didn't know how many. </sentence><sentence id="814">His job was to keep relations with the Foreign Affairs Minister. </sentence><sentence id="815">So we issued I think more than two thousand five hundred protection...letters of protection in the month of...at the end of October and November. </sentence><sentence id="816">To be more specific...I couldn't be more specific than that. </sentence><sentence id="817">I think we maybe reached three thousand, more or less. </sentence><sentence id="818">It wasn't very easy. </sentence><sentence id="819">Not only...it wasn't sufficient to issue a letter of protection and to escort these people to their house because they had to be escorted to a building after all. </sentence><sentence id="820">I had some people who were willing to accompany these people with their cars uh as the letters of protection were issued. </sentence><sentence id="821">There were cars who were available and who shuttled back and forth between the Legation and the houses where they were going to live and they would go back and forth continuously and therefore and so we had to uh provide for everything. </sentence><sentence id="822">We had to get them settled. </sentence><sentence id="823">Normally these apartments that we would take, we had to pay the rent, but these are details that are of no importance and perhaps we didn't even pay the rent. </sentence><sentence id="824">We also had to feed these people and we had to be careful that the Nazis wouldn't go to take them because they did do that. </sentence><sentence id="825">They did especially they would try to attack those Swedish houses and Swiss houses because they had a a system of protection which was not correct. </sentence><sentence id="826">In other words, they had given, both of those countries had a mixed committee, Jewish and Christian committee which was responsible for issuing letters of protection. </sentence><sentence id="827">To sum it up these letters were being sold. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="828">The authorities and particularly the Nazis found out about this and so therefore every day they, they would come and take uh raid the Swiss and the Swedish houses. </sentence><sentence id="829">I think that as far as I know Sweden issued forty million letters of protection and in its houses it had maybe three or four thousand people because they would come in the afternoon and the next day there would be raids, and this is not something that I just heard. </sentence><sentence id="830">They weren't rumors. </sentence><sentence id="831">I saw them with my very own eyes and with Wallenberg I asked him why did you, why do you do that kind of stuff. </sentence><sentence id="832">That's not correct. </sentence><sentence id="833">These letters are being sold and everyone knows about it. </sentence><sentence id="834">The authorities know about it. </sentence><sentence id="835">Anyway, we had to protect to prevent that these people be taken. </sentence><sentence id="836">We had to protect them. </sentence><sentence id="837">With one excuse or the other the Nazi police...not the regular police...the regular police would intervene when they had orders but there was also various police forces, Nazi police forces in various neighborhoods of representing various factions which were ferocious. </sentence><sentence id="838">They killed. </sentence><sentence id="839">They uh they robbed and that was their goal, and we had to protect the those who were being </sentence></p><p><sentence id="840"> protected from themselves because these, these people sometimes lacked common sense. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="841">Sometimes it was useless. </sentence><sentence id="842">It wasn't enough to tell them don't go out of the houses because if you go out of the house they'll take, they take you away. </sentence><sentence id="843">They put you in the prisons and the Nazis may even kill you, and to...that will give us more work to do because we'll have to come and get you and find you and this happened many times. </sentence><sentence id="844">They would go and take a walk to go find their girlfriend, to go find their boyfriend...all these things. </sentence><sentence id="845">Or for whatever reasons, their own reasons. </sentence><sentence id="846">I even created the committees in each house with three members and their job was to be concerned about hygiene, discipline, order, and to prevent people from leaving the houses and going on the streets. </sentence><sentence id="847">They had to remain inside the houses because there they were safe. </sentence><sentence id="848">If they left the houses, they were no longer safe. </sentence><sentence id="849">They would take their stars off and they would go outside and there would be Nazis there who would ask them for their papers and what papers could they show. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="850">They didn't have any. </sentence><sentence id="851">If they did, it would be clear that they were Jews and therefore...yeah...you can understand what happened then. </sentence><sentence id="852">And so we had to find uh food for them and security besides watching. </sentence><sentence id="853">We were pretty lucky. </sentence><sentence id="854">It was a continuous job because we had to travel throughout the neighborhoods continuously to show the flag, to show that we were present and continuously...I went at least twice a day and daringly, I went daringly on the streets and little by little with the with the car...I would go with the car and so the people could see the, the uh flag, so the people could see that the car was guarding them, and therefore and so with time, with the passage of weeks, new houses were organized. </sentence><sentence id="855">We tried with a hospital too but it was but it failed. </sentence><sentence id="856">The...it was my idea but it was a bad idea. </sentence><sentence id="857">It didn't go well. </sentence><sentence id="858">So weeks went on. </sentence><sentence id="859">Months went by...sorry...weeks went on and at the end of November we were working continuously and the work with...the contacts with the authorities...I didn't, I didn't think that you didn't need to have contacts with the authorities. </sentence><sentence id="860">Quite the contrary. </sentence><sentence id="861">I made as many contacts as possible. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="862">I...one day for example I took ...I don't know what that is...I took twenty-five thousand _ to the secretary of the minister who was very... ..oh, money. </sentence><sentence id="863">OK. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="864">This is money that he brought to the Hungarian uh refugees in Transylvania and Russia and Carpetia and the refugees...and this is money for the children and he was very thankful and every time, every time I was in the neighborhood where he...I went up to see him to say hello to him and this gave me the possibility to ask him information all the time, how it was going at the Foreign Affairs Ministry, for example. </sentence><sentence id="865">For example, since Fritz didn't want to go to the Ministry, since Fritz (ph) never left the Legation to visit a house...he never visited any of the houses. </sentence><sentence id="866">He didn't know anything. </sentence><sentence id="867">He wasn't interested even in how many signatures were used with his signature pad because he was a diplomat and he had uh limited vision. </sentence><sentence id="868">He was an old-timer diplomat. </sentence><sentence id="869">This is a very...what he did was very serious and uh correct but it would have been a good thing in times of peace and in normal times when the war was not ideological as it had become, when there was no persecution of the Jews. </sentence><sentence id="870">Not only of Jews but also the uh in Hungary there were many uh...uh they had orchestras. </sentence><sentence id="871">They played the violins and they had restaurants and they played the orchestras and with the violins and their famous people...in Hungary and in Serbia (ph)... . </sentence><sentence id="872">I'm sorry...] can't find the word...you know...these traveling homeless kind of people...oh...uh... they, they dress in flashy costumes...(gypsies)...gypsies, gypsies....thank you. </sentence><sentence id="873">Gypsies. </sentence><sentence id="874">Gypsies. </sentence><sentence id="875">Gypsies. </sentence><sentence id="876">I couldn't find the word...sorry...OK. ( </sentence><sentence id="877">Pause) In Belgrade on...day and night I went to restaurants and I had meals and in the evenings they had orchestras. </sentence><sentence id="878">They were played by the gypsies. </sentence><sentence id="879">And </sentence></p><p><sentence id="880"> there was a beautiful restaurant in in Square, where there was a good orchestra and there were a couple of good violinists. </sentence><sentence id="881">One day they disappeared, in January of "42 I think it was. </sentence><sentence id="882">Yes. </sentence><sentence id="883">January of 1942 they disappeared. </sentence><sentence id="884">I asked the owner of the restaurant, what happened to the orchestra, the band. </sentence><sentence id="885">And he said well...at first he didn't really want to answer. </sentence><sentence id="886">He was reticent, and then he said the Germans took them off, because they are of an inferior race. </sentence><sentence id="887">So they persecuted uh Jews, gypsies, and in that area were many of them, and the Poles. </sentence><sentence id="888">Not only uh Jewish Poles but the citizens too, and this is something that I saw. </sentence><sentence id="889">This is not something that I just heard. </sentence><sentence id="890">I saw it. </sentence><sentence id="891">So, so we...this is how we worked, issuing these letters of protection and then Sanspritz left. </sentence><sentence id="892">I don't remember if he left the 30th of November or December Ist. </sentence><sentence id="893">Uh it seems...I think that the ambassador, Spanish ambassador told me November 30th. </sentence><sentence id="894">He told me November 30th, but I don't know if he's sure about this or not. </sentence><sentence id="895">Anyhow, he...Sanspritz left and that morning there was a reaction on behalf of the Nazis. </sentence><sentence id="896">I found myself that morning, early in the morning I was called...six in the morning...and I don't remember who called me but they called me from the Legation to tell me that Sanspritz had left and so I got up and II visited the international ghetto thinking what do I do now? </sentence><sentence id="897">What is the situation? </sentence><sentence id="898">And in a certain sense the Nazis helped because by...when I went in front of the house of Street, Number 25, where the child was in this house...he reminded me of some details the other day when I saw him for the first time. </sentence><sentence id="899">He recalled some details that I didn't remember. </sentence><sentence id="900">I saw besides...speaking of he exaggerates when I say that I uh yelled to the Nazis and said get out of here. </sentence><sentence id="901">He exaggerates. </sentence><sentence id="902">As a child, he thought that that's what I did but it wasn't quite like that, but anyhow that's how he saw it. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="903">That's his mentality. </sentence><sentence id="904">More or less that's how it was, but I wasn't screaming. </sentence><sentence id="905">I wasn't yelling. </sentence><sentence id="906">So I saw...I entered this house and I said, what is happening here. </sentence><sentence id="907">They were...they told us oh they want to take us away. </sentence><sentence id="908">The police want to deport us. </sentence><sentence id="909">And sure enough the regular police was there. </sentence><sentence id="910">Not the Nazis, the regular police was there which was commanded by a lieutenant, and I asked this lieutenant, what do you want. </sentence><sentence id="911">I've got to take everyone away. </sentence><sentence id="912">And I closed the door in front of him. </sentence><sentence id="913">I locked it, and I said look, no one is leaving. </sentence><sentence id="914">The Spanish flag is here. </sentence><sentence id="915">The Spanish emblem is here. </sentence><sentence id="916">This...we consider this house extra-territorial property. </sentence><sentence id="917">It wasn't legal. </sentence><sentence id="918">It wasn't right, but what governs such governments, you could just say...you could make up things like that. </sentence><sentence id="919">It couldn't have been an extra-territorial house. </sentence><sentence id="920">You needed special permission from the government. </sentence><sentence id="921">The government had not given any special permission to do that, and so we discussed and we reached an agreement that he would postpone the...and together we would go to the park, in the center of the park, where there was a committee composed of various police forces, the Nazi party, the Foreign Affairs Ministry, the Interior Minister and I don't know who else...seven or eight people. </sentence><sentence id="922">And I went there to speak with these people and I spoke with energy and with boldness because if I went there with my hat in hand and I said hey, they would say hey, this guy doesn't know what he's doing. </sentence><sentence id="923">You had to assert yourself, especially with the Hungarians because these people are, are tough people and you had to be just as tough, and he said...I asked him what's happening, why do you want to take these uh people away. </sentence><sentence id="924">He said because Sanspritz fled. </sentence><sentence id="925">Who said that he fled? </sentence><sentence id="926">Sanspritz took a trip. </sentence><sentence id="927">He went to Bern where he is going to meet Spanish, Italian, French, German and Swiss diplomats to discuss the situation, but then he is coming back. </sentence><sentence id="928">But in the meantime | am his...the legal representative of the Spanish government and charge d'affaires and I showed him my passport and my diplomatic pass and so the Foreign    </sentence></p><p><sentence id="929"> Affairs Minister representative said yes, this man is uh right what he said, so that's the way it was. </sentence><sentence id="930">The only thing is that uh Sanspritz really did leave. </sentence><sentence id="931">He did flee, and he didn't have any intentions of coming back. </sentence><sentence id="932">So much so that he didn't even tell me that he was leaving. </sentence><sentence id="933">He didn't tell me anything. </sentence><sentence id="934">Nothing at all. </sentence><sentence id="935">He left. </sentence><sentence id="936">And I learned about it when he was already at the border. </sentence><sentence id="937">He left at four or five in the morning. </sentence><sentence id="938">Anyway, but that's not important. </sentence><sentence id="939">Perhaps it was a good thing. </sentence><sentence id="940">It was a good thing, because the Nazis uh had invaded that house and it gave me the opportunity to present myself as the successor to the man who they thought had escaped, so the representative of the Foreign Affairs Ministry said OK. </sentence><sentence id="941">You're right. </sentence><sentence id="942">The situation is legal. </sentence><sentence id="943">Uh and I said look, there's a flag at the Legation. </sentence><sentence id="944">There's a flag at all the houses too, and he said...we had an agreement that after two or three days I would go to the Foreign Affairs Minister Ministry to clarify the Spanish position and in fact this is what happened, but when I went back to the Legation, I found that the Swedish Danielson (ph) Minister who was Wallenberg's boss had been to the Legation. </sentence><sentence id="945">Danielson wanted to get some money...some Swiss francs. </sentence><sentence id="946">They're about seventeen thousand Swiss francs which were in a Swiss uh Spanish Legation and I protested at...this is who is the Chancellor, and I said what do we do now. </sentence><sentence id="947">We still had some _, some money left and not very much. </sentence><sentence id="948">She didn't know what to do and she said that he said that he would send a secretary every morning, a Swedish secretary to see that everything was uh alright, and I said no, please, don't do that. </sentence><sentence id="949">I called Minister Danielson. </sentence><sentence id="950">I begged him not to send anyone and that and that I would go and see him later on to explain the situation and I'm I went probably the next day or so, because if Sweden uh protected the interest of the Spanish Legation, that meant that the interest of the Spanish Legation would no longer exist. </sentence><sentence id="951">So we continued to work. . </sentence><sentence id="952">The situation in the houses came back to normal and while I was there in the park I saw that there was a column of Jews that were being deported and I saw that someone was waving and so I went to see and I saw that these were some of the people protected from another houses of the same street, the Street, of Number 33 which was very close, and so I made them give me back. </sentence><sentence id="953">The situation in the houses was probably, was pretty normal and peaceful. </sentence><sentence id="954">I don't know what those questions refer to. ( </sentence><sentence id="955">He hasn't understood the question.) </sentence><sentence id="956">There were...you mean...are you referring to the quantity of people who were there, the sleeping conditions, the eating conditions...what are you referring to? </sentence></p><p><sentence id="957"> . </sentence><sentence id="958">In during December, the first ten days of December, we took some other houses...the last two houses, it seems to me. </sentence><sentence id="959">But the...from a point of view of the living conditions it was a very difficult situation and the house, there were five hundred people. _ </sentence><sentence id="960">told me that they slept on the steps. </sentence><sentence id="961">I don't remember exactly even though there was a committee that held the list of all the people who arrived every day, but I don't remember how many there were exactly, because...I must step forward here. </sentence><sentence id="962">The morning that the Russians arrived, I burnt everything, even the lists of those who were protected because you never know. </sentence><sentence id="963">If they fall in the hands of the Russians or the GPU...you don't know how they could have interpreted this fact, so we destroyed everything. </sentence><sentence id="964">The Chancellor didn't want to. </sentence><sentence id="965">She wanted to save a few things, and I said no. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="966">Everything will be destroyed because nothing shall be left in the hands of the Russians because the Russians, the same day entered the Legation as I expected, had predicted. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="967">And then they uh then they burnt it...they damaged it but I left. </sentence><sentence id="968">The situation was difficult. </sentence><sentence id="969">As far as living conditions it was also difficult for the food. </sentence><sentence id="970">It was difficult for the hygienic conditions. </sentence><sentence id="971">It was difficult to find medicines. </sentence><sentence id="972">There was a difficult time, for </sentence></p><p><sentence id="973"> example, because they had tried to close the water supply in some of the houses. </sentence><sentence id="974">The Nazis had tried to do this and so I protested with vigor. </sentence><sentence id="975">I went to the police commander and I demanded that the water be returned. </sentence><sentence id="976">These things cannot be done because if there is a protection, then these people must have the necessary elements to survive. </sentence><sentence id="977">If there is no water, I don't know what would have happened. </sentence><sentence id="978">With five hundred people and and if it were sixty or seventy...I don't know how, what would have happened. </sentence><sentence id="979">And then there was the problem of food. </sentence><sentence id="980">We had to feed these people. </sentence><sentence id="981">At a certain point there was no more money left from the Legation...this was Hungarian money in the Legation. </sentence><sentence id="982">I spent some of my money that I had in my pockets but I didn't have that much and you had to buy on the black market, and so I went to the Jewish Council, , and they gave me some money and then they didn't have any left either. </sentence><sentence id="983">They, they were just in terrible conditions. </sentence><sentence id="984">They had nothing left to eat themselves. </sentence><sentence id="985">I must uh say that in the month of August, had fired the Nazi government and one of the first measures that was taken was that the star be no longer worn and all the racial laws were being dismantled and brought down, and so many people went back to the villages where they had lived. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="986">Not everyone lived in Budapest. </sentence><sentence id="987">Some of them lived in villages. </sentence><sentence id="988">In Carpetia (ph) for example, in Buchovina (ph). </sentence><sentence id="989">They were farmers. </sentence><sentence id="990">The, the Jewish, the Jews of that area were farmers, and so what did the Germans and the Nazis do. </sentence><sentence id="991">They forced uh these Jews from the countryside to come back to Budapest and...those who had left Budapest...and they concentrated them in the old ghetto, which could support maybe two, three million people...not fifty or sixty...two or three thousand people, not fifty or sixty thousand people, and so there was this black, terrible hunger. </sentence><sentence id="992">There was...there were infections. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="993">There were diseases. </sentence><sentence id="994">They was cold. </sentence><sentence id="995">There was no electricity. </sentence><sentence id="996">There, there was nothing. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="997">They had nothing to eat. </sentence><sentence id="998">And so this uh Jewish Council also ran out of money and once it ran...once they ran out, I ran out too, and with what I had I could buy something from the black market and specifically I had to be careful with...watch the children because we had two orphanages which were really not ours but one belonged to the International Red Cross I think and one belonged to the Swedish Red Cross and the Spanish Legation had been begged to protect, protect and to take care of these two houses, and here I must open a parenthesis because the truth is the truth after all. </sentence><sentence id="999">On the black market I bought condensed milk with the symbol of the International Red Cross. </sentence><sentence id="1000">And we had uh...it was very expensive. </sentence><sentence id="1001">We had to pay for it dearly on the black market, but there were many children. </sentence><sentence id="1002">There were children in the two orphanages and there were children in the houses, the protected houses. </sentence><sentence id="1003">And since the Jewish Council which whose name was ; , which means Jewish Council, since this uh Council didn't have any money left, wasn't giving any money any more, since I had nominated a committee for each house to maintain the discipline and hygiene and order and so forth, I gave...I charged these committees to spy uh financially, economically. </sentence><sentence id="1004">They said...they would tell me which people could give money. </sentence><sentence id="1005">And so I went to these people...not every day...and I said give meathousand _. </sentence><sentence id="1006">You can give me five thousand, near five...according to their capabilities. </sentence><sentence id="1007">And these people gave me money. </sentence><sentence id="1008">But somebody would say, why. </sentence><sentence id="1009">Why should I give you money? </sentence><sentence id="1010">And I would say because you have the money. </sentence><sentence id="1011">We need the money. </sentence><sentence id="1012">I don't have any. </sentence><sentence id="1013">The Legation doesn't have any. </sentence><sentence id="1014">What...what will we use to buy food with. </sentence><sentence id="1015">And then we discovered thanks to the spying activities that the committee undertook that there were some families that had reserves of food that were bountiful and there was a time when we just couldn't find anything on the black market anymore, and    </sentence></p><p><sentence id="1016"> so I had these reserves, food stocks, taken that these families had. </sentence><sentence id="1017">And this food was distributed because I don't know what would have happened. </sentence><sentence id="1018">There would have been fights because hunger is hunger. </sentence><sentence id="1019">A mother who doesn't have milk or food for her child...uh she sees the child get weaker and weaker every day...she's capable of killing and she's right, don't you think? </sentence><sentence id="1020">And so therefore with these stories...uh these stories occurred day after day, week after week, and we finally come to the day of Christmas Eve, which was a terrible day...because the Russians, Russia and Spain considered themselves in a state of war. </sentence><sentence id="1021">Anyhow, I always kept quiet. </sentence><sentence id="1022">Yes...yes... it's started. </sentence><sentence id="1023">Uh Christmas Day I remember that I left. </sentence><sentence id="1024">On Christmas Eve, on Christmas Eve I left. </sentence><sentence id="1025">I spent uh...that evening and I went to the villa in Budapest. </sentence><sentence id="1026">It was in late afternoon and I thought that I would eat there but when I arrived in the neighborhood I found that there were elements of the Hungarian army with machine guns and other arms and so forth, and they told me that it's not possible to pass through because the Russians are very close, three hundred, four hundred meters away, and I told them that I have to go. </sentence><sentence id="1027">I'm, I'm a diplomat and I have to go to the, all the people of the Spanish Legation, which was very close, a hundred meters from here, and they said OK, we'll give you fifteen minutes and then you have to come back. </sentence><sentence id="1028">Otherwise it's uh your business. </sentence><sentence id="1029">I said OK. </sentence><sentence id="1030">So I went and I found that everything was topsy-turvy. </sentence><sentence id="1031">We had sixty refugees in the villa of the Legation and, and I understood that I didn't have time to have lunch there, that I had to go back to Budapest. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="1032">They, they had made a big Christmas tree for me. </sentence><sentence id="1033">It was big because they had...they cut it down from the park and it was six or seven meters high and you would enter the first floor and you would go down to the second...the living room and it was all...it was a Christmas tree that was, that took up two floors and was full of presents and I looked at the Christmas tree and I didn't even take my presents, because I said if I take my stuff, I am letting them know that the Russians are here, that there's going to be some fighting here and that we don't know what the Germans would have done and so forth and so I just said goodbye to everyone and I left. </sentence><sentence id="1034">And I went back to Budapest. </sentence><sentence id="1035">I was...didn't go back to the villa because the next day it was burnt by a German grenade. </sentence><sentence id="1036">That evening, which was Christmas Eve, which is a holiday in Spain too...it's...there's a big supper on Christmas Eve and I had been invited to lunch at the ___ Hotel by the Secretary of the Nazi Party, the Hungarian Nazi Party, and I feared that with this invitation he wanted to ask me to pay for the Spanish passports. </sentence><sentence id="1037">They say...the Hungarian newspapers said that I gave the Spanish passports to them. </sentence><sentence id="1038">That's now true. </sentence><sentence id="1039">It's not true. </sentence><sentence id="1040">If they had asked it from me, I don't know what I would have done. </sentence><sentence id="1041">I would have judged...assessed the situation at the time and I would have uh dealt and I would have...uh practically I would have sold the passports in exchange for guarantees for security for the protected people. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="1042">So we lunched together and we spoke about everything except politics. </sentence><sentence id="1043">We joked around, and at a certain point we had finished our lunch and a courier arrived which gave him, gave the minister something...just like in the movies. </sentence><sentence id="1044">And I think that this...on this piece of paper there was written that he had to leave and in fact he told me...look, I'm sorry but I have to leave and so forth. </sentence><sentence id="1045">So we left. </sentence><sentence id="1046">And I was happy because he didn't ask me anything. </sentence><sentence id="1047">He didn't...he didn't ask anything about the passport, which was a delicate question to hand over a passport. </sentence><sentence id="1048">Yes, I did have passports to give, but if if the question became known and the Spanish government found out that that the passport had been given to a Nazi minister, the Spanish government undoubtedly would have reacted, and they undoubtedly would have said no, we uh do not authorize this. </sentence><sentence id="1049">He's not authorized to </sentence></p><p><sentence id="1050"> give out passports, so I was glad that he didn't ask me anything. </sentence><sentence id="1051">Even though there are Hungarian newspapers that say that I gave uh passports to Nazi ministers, that's not true. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="1052">In fact, during the trials they didn't bring this up, so I was alone because I didn't even want an escort that evening. </sentence><sentence id="1053">I said I was going to go to dinner that evening and he would...and I just need someone to take me to some...to the Legation or to my apartment and that's all, because I had many places where I could go and sleep. </sentence><sentence id="1054">At a certain point, I was stopped by a group of Hungarian Nazis, Nazis, who asked me to see my passport and they said that this passport and diplomatic pass are no longer valid. </sentence><sentence id="1055">And during this conversation I saw on the other side of the street a uh army elements, a pa...army patrol, and so I called them and the patrol came and it was commanded by a lieutenant who commanded thirty men or so, and I said look, these people want to arrest me and this is my name. </sentence><sentence id="1056">These are my documents and papers and so they said no, no, no, no. </sentence><sentence id="1057">You can't touch this man. </sentence><sentence id="1058">He's a diplomat. </sentence><sentence id="1059">He represents Spain and so he sent them away, and so they escorted me home. </sentence><sentence id="1060">And I decided that I would go spend the night in an apartment in uh , in Street, Street. </sentence><sentence id="1061">I invited this lieutenant to come and have a drink with me and he told me, declared to me that they were about to close...they were about to close the neighborhood and there was only one street open left, and that's why I understood that the minister who had been in such a hurry to leave. </sentence><sentence id="1062">And so the next morning I tried to get in touch with the villa, because I had left two cars there and I needed those cars. </sentence><sentence id="1063">One belonged to Sanspritz and another had been lent to me that morning by an Italian citizen because the only two cars that I had in the Legation were not working, and so he lent me this car and the next day the car was burnt in the village. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="1064">The whole villa was destroyed. </sentence><sentence id="1065">Nothing was left. </sentence><sentence id="1066">Of my stuff, one girl saved five handkerchiefs that she had wanted to save me, but she didn't want to hang them on the tree. </sentence><sentence id="1067">She didn't want to hang the handkerchiefs on the tree with everything else and this girl came to the house at the last minute before the house burnt and she uh got the box with the handkerchiefs and after three months, she came to Budapest to give me the handkerchiefs. </sentence><sentence id="1068">That morning...that Christmas morning was a terrible morning. </sentence><sentence id="1069">Spain...I don't know for what reasons...wanted uh cared for the Slovak minister. </sentence><sentence id="1070">Bohemia had been annexed by Germany but Slovakia was independent and so they had a diplomatic representative in Budapest. </sentence><sentence id="1071">This diplomatic representative who had contacts with the Spaniards...I don't know how... don't remember...but anyhow with, together with the attorney Fakash went to look for him to bring him to the Legation. </sentence><sentence id="1072">We found him. </sentence><sentence id="1073">He was dead, in the garden before the gate of the Legation. </sentence><sentence id="1074">The Nazis had killed him because they had discovered that he was anti-Nazi. </sentence><sentence id="1075">When I returned they wanted to take attorney Fakash away from me. </sentence><sentence id="1076">They wanted him to leave the car and if he left the car, that was the end. </sentence><sentence id="1077">I was able to bring him back to the Legation and I told him you're not to leave this Legation again. </sentence><sentence id="1078">I will go alone. </sentence><sentence id="1079">I will be escorted by the police forces. </sentence><sentence id="1080">I will go alone and you remain here because your life is in danger. </sentence><sentence id="1081">So I...the days...that's how the days passed after Christmas. </sentence><sentence id="1082">By New Year's Eve it was calm, especially in the evening. </sentence><sentence id="1083">We even danced...sure...we danced in the basement of the Legation. </sentence><sentence id="1084">We even brought out some bottles of Spanish wine. </sentence><sentence id="1085">There were hundreds and hundreds of Spanish, precious Spanish wine from , bottles of wine from these areas in Spain which is precious wine. </sentence><sentence id="1086">I liked it anyhow and I used to drink it all the time in Spain. </sentence><sentence id="1087">And they danced. </sentence><sentence id="1088">They even danced. </sentence><sentence id="1089">I was happy because these people who were in hiding...and they were all Jews except for one who said he was a priest, but I don't think he was a </sentence></p><p><sentence id="1090"> priest. </sentence><sentence id="1091">I think that he was a priest who was pretending...uh a Jew who was pretending to be a priest I think, but I never saw him again these are not details that really interested me since they did not come into the offices. </sentence><sentence id="1092">They came only for...in the last moment when we were asleep in the basement together and that's when we had this party and that's when I saw them. </sentence><sentence id="1093">I, I always thought...I'm actually glad that I didn't have any contact with them. </sentence><sentence id="1094">You know, we'd just say hello and good evening and that's it. </sentence><sentence id="1095">There was a Hungarian diplomat, , who had a wife and daughter...uh many people. </sentence><sentence id="1096">There was sixty or so people, and they even danced. </sentence><sentence id="1097">And then the situation began to get worse. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="1098">So we still continued to issue those letters of protection because the Nazis, Hungarian Nazis...not Germans, Hungarian Nazis...when I speak of Nazis I always refer to the Hungarian Nazis, the Milash (ph)...so...what did I want to say...where was I...where was I...OK. </sentence><sentence id="1099">The first few days of January we heard some rumors according to which it seemed that they wanted to take away all of the Jews from the international ghetto and take them to the old grand ghetto and deport them. </sentence><sentence id="1100">I didn't believe in such a thing because they were saying that Minister who was in charge of the civilians and military for the seized (ph) capital, they were saying that he was going to burn the ghetto and and kill all the Jews. </sentence><sentence id="1101">This would have been the final Hungarian solution and I didn't believe in such a thing. </sentence><sentence id="1102">In the meantime new letters were being issued, not very many but there was always someone who felt threatened because they had inspected the house next door or the apartment above...you know how it is. </sentence><sentence id="1103">So one day uh fourth...on the fourth or fifth or the sixth of January...I don't remember exactly...probably the fifth or the sixth of January, I was crossing Mussolini Square to go to the orphanages which were very nearby and I saw a column of Jews passing by and so I asked, who are these Jews? </sentence><sentence id="1104">And they say, these are Jews, uh Portuguese Jews. </sentence><sentence id="1105">That night, during that during the night the Portuguese minister had sent an employee of his to ask me orally to assume the responsibility for the Portuguese Legation and I told him no, that if there is something, if there is something...if he can come and explain to me, then we can come to an agreement, but as it stands I I didn't...1 couldn't assume any more responsibilities. </sentence><sentence id="1106">I'd had enough of my own, and so I saw that they took away all those Portuguese Jews and so I understood that that had already, man had already abandoned everything or he was about to abandon everything because he was the Portuguese minister but he was a Hungarian citizen. </sentence><sentence id="1107">He was the : was his name, but he was a Hungarian citizen, but he was acting as Portuguese minister and therefore that man said he had abandoned everything, that he was stepping back and that he considered uh that he couldn't do anything more. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="1108">So I wrote a letter to this minister and I...where I wrote that I had heard these rumors, that I didn't believe in them, that please to deny these rumors but he didn't respond and after two days I wrote him....actually no...I telephoned and I said that I was about to come to see him...that I would come see him the next day and I think that was January 8 or the 7th or the 8th of January. </sentence><sentence id="1109">Probably the 8th. </sentence><sentence id="1110">Perhaps even in the night. </sentence><sentence id="1111">Who knows. </sentence><sentence id="1112">Anyway, it's not that important. </sentence><sentence id="1113">So he went there that day. </sentence><sentence id="1114">I went because I had heard these rumors which were more and more prevalent and then I saw, when I saw the column of the Portuguese Jews I was struck and I went and I found in uh the chamber of the city hall Budapest, in the basement, I found Wallenberg, the Swede, and who was Swiss. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="1115">And I told them I'm going to go inside first because I have an appointment. </sentence><sentence id="1116">My appointment...it hadn't really been conferred to me that I had an appointment but uh and when I return from the appointment then we can all talk together. </sentence><sentence id="1117">The colonel uh who is    </sentence></p><p><sentence id="1118"> head of the gendarmerie, accompanied me to the minister's office. </sentence><sentence id="1119">It was a little office in the basement and this colonel three days later killed himself by the way. </sentence><sentence id="1120">He saw that everything was lost. </sentence><sentence id="1121">He'd been compromised because of the Jewish question and so he killed himself. </sentence><sentence id="1122">Sada (ph) was his name. </sentence><sentence id="1123">Colonel Sada and he was the head of the whole gendarmerie of Hungary at that time, so I went to this minister that I had seen, not known, but I had seen him in the past and very calmly he said yes. </sentence><sentence id="1124">He wanted to solve the Jewish question by killing everyone. </sentence><sentence id="1125">And so I started to say do you realize what's happening and do you realize what's going to happen, that the Hungarian people will have to suffer because you killed a hundred thousand people, and so finally I even...you know...I even talked about the Myian (ph) civilization and everything that came to mind, ___ people...anything to move him. </sentence><sentence id="1126">I even cried. </sentence><sentence id="1127">Uh but he was tough so I didn't know what to do anymore. </sentence><sentence id="1128">I, I can't just leave the situation like this, I thought to myself, so I told him, look...if within forty-five hours the Spanish government does not receive from me a guarantee that all is calm and that the agreements between...the agreements with the Hungarian government have been respected because during the period between October, November and December we had come to an agreement with the Foreign Affairs Minister and the Hungarian government...we had reached an agreement and received guarantees. </sentence><sentence id="1129">Not only that but the Hungarian government wanted to send a diplomatic representative to Madrid in order to, to tie diplomatic relations with the Anglo-Americans to see in, in, in view of the peace treaty, and logically the Spanish government who didn't wish to recognize the Nazi government, didn't want to hear anything about it. </sentence><sentence id="1130">The, the uh credentials, the request for credentials...he's explaining uh this...what credentials are...logically I didn't transmit these letters of...this request for credentials to Madrid. </sentence><sentence id="1131">It was for a certain Colonel . </sentence><sentence id="1132">I didn't transmit them because if I did the Spanish government would probably say that that they that they didn't accept it because they didn't recognize the government while until then the government, the Spanish government kept quiet. </sentence><sentence id="1133">They kept quiet. </sentence><sentence id="1134">Also the Spanish uh Spanish ambassador last night told me that he saw in the archives many telegrams from the Hungarian government which asked the Spanish government if I was really the charge d'affaires. </sentence><sentence id="1135">The Spanish government never answered. </sentence><sentence id="1136">The Spanish ambassador told me that last night. </sentence><sentence id="1137">They never...the Spanish government never responded to these telegrams. </sentence><sentence id="1138">I understood naturally, slowly...I slowly understood why we had a preferential treatment with the Hungarian government and this was because they wanted to have diplomatic relations with Spain to contact the Anglo-Americans. </sentence><sentence id="1139">We understood it late, but we understood it. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="1140">If we understood it immediately, maybe two months earlier because we're already talking about the beginning of November...had we understood it earlier, two months ago, we would have behaved differently and perhaps something more could have been done I think but uh we're not...we weren't that intelligent after all. </sentence><sentence id="1141">The Spanish ambassador told me not that...not everyone is intelligent. </sentence><sentence id="1142">I wasn't intelligent. </sentence><sentence id="1143">The other the other guy also wasn't intelligent so uh what do you want. </sentence><sentence id="1144">So I told him that if within forty-five hours the Spanish government doesn't get any guarantees that everything is proceeding with order the three thousand Hungarian citizens which are, who are in, in Spain will be interned...actually there were really a hundred including the diplomats...and their goods will be seized and this, the Spanish government will...or ask the Brazilian government and the Paraguayan government to do the same with those Hungarian citizens who were in Brazil and Paraguay. </sentence><sentence id="1145">So this minister said a friendly government like the Spanish </sentence></p><p><sentence id="1146"> government would do such a thing? </sentence><sentence id="1147">What friendly government? </sentence><sentence id="1148">If you are against us, you're the ones who are against us. </sentence><sentence id="1149">This is what we want. </sentence><sentence id="1150">We want to protect these Jews. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="1151">You don't want to do it, so you are coming against our interests and against our policy and against our interests and our wishes, so how can you say that we are friends. </sentence><sentence id="1152">We're friends if you say, if you do what we want. </sentence><sentence id="1153">To sum it up he said, OK. </sentence><sentence id="1154">The Spaniards are, are excluded from the liquidation, will be excluded from the liquidation and so I said no, and I became uh demanding in that moment. </sentence><sentence id="1155">I said no. </sentence><sentence id="1156">AIl...everyone or nobody. </sentence><sentence id="1157">All of those in the international ghetto must remain where they are or all those in the common ghetto must be, must have electricity and water, so forth again, because those people have to survive too because what would what would happen of the Hungarian people, so I repeated to him again and all the stories about vendettas, terrible vendettas and uh the Anglo-Americans uh who would come to bombard the city and so forth and so on. </sentence><sentence id="1158">And so we agreed that everything would have uh occurred in that way. </sentence><sentence id="1159">When I left the office I found Wallenberg and were still there, and I explained the situation to them and I said I was able to obtain this and that. </sentence><sentence id="1160">When you do inside I don't know what you can ask of this minister, but please don't uh do anything to undermine this agreement that we've just come to. </sentence><sentence id="1161">Otherwise nothing more...so Wallenberg asked me for political asylum in the Spanish Legation and I said fine, I'll wait for you. </sentence><sentence id="1162">You go to the Legation. </sentence><sentence id="1163">I'll wait for you and I'm going to have to go find something in the neighborhood and then I'll I'll meet you there at the Legation. </sentence><sentence id="1164">He said no. </sentence><sentence id="1165">I will come with my car in the afternoon. </sentence><sentence id="1166">I'll give you the car because I know you need a car, and I'll come. </sentence><sentence id="1167">I never saw him again. </sentence><sentence id="1168">Never saw him again. </sentence><sentence id="1169">I know that on the 18th he...on the morning of the 18th he wason | Street. </sentence><sentence id="1170">I know this for sure, and he had left the house at ten in the morning to go I don't know where. </sentence><sentence id="1171">From then on he disappeared. </sentence><sentence id="1172">Now since the since historians say that on the 16th he went to at the Russian command and that he was taken prisoner there. </sentence><sentence id="1173">I say that's not true because on the morning of the 18th he was in Budapest in the on the ___ Street. </sentence><sentence id="1174">means king. </sentence><sentence id="1175">I don't know really...1 saw him maybe a dozen times. </sentence><sentence id="1176">I spoke to him specifically during the meetings with diplomats. </sentence><sentence id="1177">I never saw him otherwise. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="1178">From the beginning of December, all the diplomats, mutual diplomats, had disappeared. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="1179">He couldn't find any of them. </sentence><sentence id="1180">Wallenberg... when I saw Wallenberg at city hall in Budapest on the meeting, the day that I met , uh I'd seen him, besides that time, I'd seen him on December 22nd at the uh Papal Nuncio (ph) where he had signed a document uh to protest uh and this was in favor of women and I remember that he did not sign that document because he couldn't sign it because he was a secretary and Minister Danielson, his boss, was there. </sentence><sentence id="1181">The ambassador. </sentence><sentence id="1182">His, his boss wasn't there at that time. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="1183">Uh that morning during the meeting I told the Archbishop Angelo I would like to speak privately with you and so we went into another office and so I told him look...I started speaking to him in Italian. </sentence><sentence id="1184">In the meetings we always spoke in French. </sentence><sentence id="1185">Uh I started speaking in Italian. </sentence><sentence id="1186">I said look, I'm not a Spaniard. </sentence><sentence id="1187">I'm Italian and I'm close to you because I'm, I was born in Komo (ph) and he had also been born close to Komo. </sentence><sentence id="1188">He said oh, you're...you're kidding. </sentence><sentence id="1189">You're joking. </sentence><sentence id="1190">I said no, no. </sentence><sentence id="1191">I'm not kidding. </sentence><sentence id="1192">This is the truth. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="1193">I tell you this because if something would ever happen to me, you...I want you to know this so that you can uh tell my relatives. </sentence><sentence id="1194">He told me, I remember, don't tell " was his secretary because that guy is very picky. </sentence><sentence id="1195">He can...he might become very angry, might cause trouble. </sentence><sentence id="1196">I said no no. </sentence><sentence id="1197">I won't tell . </sentence><sentence id="1198">And this...practically this is where the story ends because after a few days...no, actually the next morning, Mr. Mr. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="1199"> ____ sent an employee to ask for telegrams to send to Madrid because we didn't have a radio. </sentence><sentence id="1200">The capital was under siege and it wasn't...we couldn't communicate with Vienna. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="1201">Normally you could telephone Vienna, Vienna telephoned Berlin, and Berlin via radio communicated to Madrid. </sentence><sentence id="1202">But this...it was no longer possible to use the phone. </sentence><sentence id="1203">And so I sent this employee to ask for a telegram which uh I asked him to send via radio radio because he had a radio. </sentence><sentence id="1204">Uh Mr. Fakash, Attorney Fakash who was an attorney who was very picky, an old-timer, uh told me that I shouldn't send the telegram and I told him look, if I don't send the telegram as soon as this employee goes back to Minister jy everything will fall apart. </sentence><sentence id="1205">If we send the telegram we'll save four or five days. </sentence><sentence id="1206">We'll gain four or five days because the Spanish government will of course have to reflect on this before responding. </sentence><sentence id="1207">They're not going to respond immediately obviously. </sentence><sentence id="1208">The telegram will be send today. </sentence><sentence id="1209">I don't know if it'll arrive immediately in Madrid and who will receive it in Madrid. </sentence><sentence id="1210">It has to be sent to Bern and this takes time. </sentence><sentence id="1211">I wrote to Bern. </sentence><sentence id="1212">I wrote to the embassy in Bern. </sentence><sentence id="1213">After two or three or four days the...Madrid sent its response thanking uh thanks and it said that it was sure that the Hungarian government would have respected the agreements and so forth and so on. </sentence><sentence id="1214">The employee came to deliver the telegram himself and he said that the minister was very satisfied with the telegram and so forth. </sentence><sentence id="1215">And then one time something happened which is a little bit funny but at the same time it uh it's...I don't want to say fear but it gave me, made me a little bit anxious. </sentence><sentence id="1216">I went to the Foreign Affairs Ministry. </sentence><sentence id="1217">This was at the end of December. </sentence><sentence id="1218">I think before Christmas I went to the Foreign Affairs Ministry and I entered the antechamber where the secre...permanent secretary had his office. </sentence><sentence id="1219">He was like a Vice Minister with whom I'd had contact. </sentence><sentence id="1220">His name was , and I saw that there were two men seated on a couch who were waiting and one of them I I recognized. </sentence><sentence id="1221">He was the Chancellor of the Italian Legation, the Royal Italian Legation, and the other gentleman I didn't know who he was, so I very boldly...I had to very boldly salute them like this and instead of going to the secretary who sort of looked at me with surprise, I went to to the door. </sentence><sentence id="1222">I pretended to knock. </sentence><sentence id="1223">I went inside and to see this Vice Minister. </sentence><sentence id="1224">I did what I had to do and after four...after fifteen minutes or so I left. </sentence><sentence id="1225">I said goodbye to the young lady and I made aa vague signal with my hand like this and I left. </sentence><sentence id="1226">But once I arrived in the in the hallway I really came back and I started to eaves...eavesdrop and I heard that these two people entered the office and entered the Vice Minister's office so I entered the area too, and I asked Mrs...the young lady...and I said, oh I think I recognize these two men and she said the big man is Minister Gratanzi (ph) of the Social Republic of Italy and the other is his secretary. </sentence><sentence id="1227">He was the he was a fascist minister, the Social Republic...the Fascist Social Republic. </sentence><sentence id="1228">On the 16th...in the meantime between the...on the 13th it wasn't possible to leave the Legation anymore. </sentence><sentence id="1229">We still had telephone communications with which I could control or check on the various houses, not directly because there were no phones in the houses but there were Christians who lived uh in front of the houses or next to them, the houses, and they had agreed to telephone to us if there was danger and for example with Eva Long (ph) on the evening of January 3rd or 4th or 5th or whatever it was. </sentence><sentence id="1230">I think she told me even...I think she even told me...anyway they, they remember more than I do. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="1231">She called me and I went over there at three in the morning. </sentence><sentence id="1232">Anyhow, ; </sentence></p><p><sentence id="1233"> . </sentence><sentence id="1234">There wasn't...no...it wasn't just that time. </sentence><sentence id="1235">That happened many times, ten or fifteen times. </sentence><sentence id="1236">Almost every evening I had to get up and go because the Nazis wanted to come and take them away, to take the Jews away from the houses. .. </sentence><sentence id="1237">Speaking. </sentence><sentence id="1238">I </sentence></p><p><sentence id="1239"> told them that we had agreements with the Hungarian government and so forth and so on and in the meantime somebody well from my entourage...I always had an entourage. </sentence><sentence id="1240">I always had four police officers and two employees of the security office and in reality I always traveled with two people but...two policemen and two public security people, and they never wanted to leave my side and when I left there were two policemen who left and the Legation too...I...I felt like I was a medieval cavalier with the flag and the banner whenever I traveled with them. </sentence><sentence id="1241">But anyway this normally happened at night and I would go on foot because it was dangerous to go by car at night. </sentence><sentence id="1242">There weren't very many lights. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="1243">But anyhow that night, that last night that I went to Eva Long in let's say Eva Long's house...I didn't know Eva Long at the time. </sentence><sentence id="1244">I met her only three years ago. </sentence><sentence id="1245">I...] arrived five minutes after a man had thrown himself out of the window from the fifth floor and you asked me how I, how could I prevent them from taking them away and I would tell them that we had agreements and then at the same time one of my escorts would go to a telephone and telephone the police commando and the Colonel would intervene. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="1246">This is someone who had helped me, because I had contacts with everyone, with Nazis, non-Nazis. </sentence><sentence id="1247">It doesn't matter that he was a Nazi who...he was a Nazi but he was useful so I had contacts with him and there was a Hungarian Nazi, a young guy with a beard. </sentence><sentence id="1248">If I asked him for something, he would do it for me. </sentence><sentence id="1249">You understand. </sentence><sentence id="1250">Now I had contacts with him. </sentence><sentence id="1251">I had contacts with everyone. </sentence><sentence id="1252">Whoever happened to be there, I had contacts with because that's how you had to operate. </sentence><sentence id="1253">Experience taught me that everyone can be useful. </sentence><sentence id="1254">There's some who do big favors and some who do smaller favors. </sentence><sentence id="1255">Some could intervene for this and some could intervene for that reason. </sentence><sentence id="1256">The Foreign Affairs Minister could intervene for that and the Interior Minister could intervene for this and the Nazi Party for another reason and so the last three days I couldn't leave because on the street where the Legation was...at the very end of the street...the street was three hundred meters long, there was a Russian tank with the mouth of the cannon facing the street which would shoot any time it saw a person and so who dared to leave and go on the street. </sentence><sentence id="1257">In order to cross the street from the Legation to the __-- Paraguayan Legation which was...you had to open the door and dash, make a dash to get to the other side. </sentence><sentence id="1258">And as soon as you did the, the tank would shoot and so you couldn't leave, but I was in telephone contact with the houses because as I said there were always Christian friends who had telephones in nearing the houses who were called. </sentence><sentence id="1259">They saw something abnormal. </sentence><sentence id="1260">For example, that night they called...I don't know who they called. </sentence><sentence id="1261">After half an hour I arrived and I saw that they were about to take them away. </sentence><sentence id="1262">I stopped everything but unfortunately I arrived five minutes after a man threw himself out of a window on the fifth floor. </sentence><sentence id="1263">I thought it was a woman, but Eva Long told me that it was a man. </sentence><sentence id="1264">When I arrived they had already covered the body. </sentence><sentence id="1265">The police had covered the body. </sentence><sentence id="1266">And I thought it was a woman but in...it was a man. </sentence><sentence id="1267">And so on the 16th uh you arrived in my area, on my street and until the afternoon, in the afternoon, up until the afternoon they had respected extra-territory . </sentence><sentence id="1268">We took the flag down. </sentence><sentence id="1269">We put the Swedish flag up. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="1270">We took the emblem, the Spanish emblem down and put the Swedish emblem because Sweden was supposed to protect Spain's interests. </sentence><sentence id="1271">No...because that's the way it's done. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="1272">When one nation cannot have relations with another nation, another nation which can have relations, it can intervene to protect the interests and in fact I think that Sweden was able to...after ten or twelve days of the Russian's arrival, to...was able to empty the building, the Spanish building. </sentence><sentence id="1273">Of that I'm not really sure because I was in hiding. </sentence><sentence id="1274">I </sentence></p><p><sentence id="1275"> couldn't do anything more. </sentence><sentence id="1276">As I was telling you about Wallenberg, on the morning of the 18th, the Russians took me and they put me to sweep the streets. </sentence><sentence id="1277">Street...I had to sweep Street. </sentence><sentence id="1278">At a certain point I saw in front of a building a man whose name was who, who, had been my chauffeur and who had been wounded driving my car. </sentence><sentence id="1279">I wasn't there at the time. </sentence><sentence id="1280">Uh my...in my position where I was seated uh there was a policeman who was killed. </sentence><sentence id="1281">He...and then the car was taken away and then the car was found again a few hours later but it was destroyed. </sentence><sentence id="1282">This man has been my chauffeur to do me a favor and at the same time had, he had also, he had had ties with the International Red Cross because the delegate of the International Red Cross never showed his face. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="1283">The human miseries. </sentence><sentence id="1284">So I asked him, did you see Wallenberg. </sentence><sentence id="1285">He said yes. </sentence><sentence id="1286">He's here. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="1287">Please, go, go fetch him. </sentence><sentence id="1288">I can't move because there's this guy here with a machine gun, the GBU guy who, who is forcing me to sweep the street. </sentence><sentence id="1289">After fifteen minutes or ten minutes though he came back. </sentence><sentence id="1290">He say no, he's gone. </sentence><sentence id="1291">He left a few minutes ago, and this is about eleven in the morning, but from then on nothing more was heard about Wallenberg, so I, therefore I think that he died or because he was hit by a sniper or because he was hit by a German grenade. </sentence><sentence id="1292">Uh they resisted until the mid-February in the castle of Buda (ph), in the hills of Buda, I think, or perhaps he met a group of Nazis, Hungarian Nazis, who recognized him and who killed him on the spot. </sentence><sentence id="1293">There

nothing left. </sentence><sentence id="1306">I didn't have anything. </sentence><sentence id="1307">I had only... everything...I had only what I was wearing the day that the Russians arrived.

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1384">Q: Can you tell us what happened to you when you were released from released from internment and you came back to Budapest in 1944? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1386">A: I escaped on October 13th, 1944. </sentence><sentence id="1387">It wasn't an internment camp. </sentence><sentence id="1388">I had my own room. </sentence><sentence id="1389">Each person had his own room. </sentence><sentence id="1390">We ate three times a day and then we had tea in the afternoon and they even gave us cigarettes, soap and toothpaste and even money. </sentence><sentence id="1391">And this was according to the Geneva Convention because I was aggregated to the Italian commercial delegation and therefore I had uh I was uh I could uh have diplomatic uh treatment. </sentence><sentence id="1392">Uh the 13th I left. </sentence><sentence id="1393">The 13th of October and I arrived in Budapest that evening and the next day I don't know what I did but on the 15th the armistice was proclaimed between Hungary, Russia, Great Britain and America. </sentence><sentence id="1394">This was an announcement, a terrible announcement because no one was prepared for it except a few people who, who knew questions of state and government. </sentence><sentence id="1395">I was surprised. </sentence><sentence id="1396">I was having lunch with an Italian lady who was of the Jewish faith and she was married to an Italian diplomat and we...she was speechless and I was surprised, and I didn't know what to do. </sentence><sentence id="1397">So I, [hid because the TV was controlled by the Admiral government and everything else fell in the hands of the Nazis and of the Germans, Hungarian Nazis and the German army and their...and then I went to hide in a house which belonged to a friend of mine, uh family friends in the and from this house I went to a hospital to hide because I didn't know where to go because from the first evening I slept in a friend's house in who gave me the keys to his apartment. </sentence><sentence id="1398">The next day I discovered that the maid was a German, a , and she was pro- Nazi and therefore I didn't go back to that house because it seemed dangerous to me. </sentence><sentence id="1399">After a couple of days in the hospital, I spent two more days in hiding. </sentence><sentence id="1400">I was hidden by the land...by the landlady in the house where I used to live once upon a time, but then I realized that the Ugandan Hotel that I knew very well was being emptied because many German officers were leaving with their suitcases and I went to the keeper of the building and I asked him if he could give me a room and he said give me a passport and I said I don't have any passport anymore. </sentence><sentence id="1401">I don't have any more documents and he said OK, for two days I'll give you a room and then I...so I didn't know what to do. </sentence><sentence id="1402">And so therefore the next morning I decided to go to the Spanish Legation. </sentence><sentence id="1403">It was probably eight in the morning. </sentence><sentence id="1404">I went there and on the way, on the road, and I was on foot, on__ Street which is a big street, I saw that some Hungarian Nazis were chasing a child who was probably seven or eight years old. </sentence><sentence id="1405">They reached him and one of them shot the child in the back of the head. </sentence><sentence id="1406">I was quite struck by this naturally and I asked a passerby why, what did that child do? </sentence><sentence id="1407">Who is he? </sentence><sentence id="1408">And he said he's Jewish. </sentence><sentence id="1409">From the roofs of the houses, however, there were some Jews who were shooting against the Nazis from the rooftop houses. </sentence><sentence id="1410">But anyway I went to the Legation andI found ___ who gave me a passport and I...he said come tomorrow with two photos, and I had two in my pocket which I pulled out, and I gave them to him and then he gave me the passport. </sentence><sentence id="1411">And he also gave me a letter from the Minister of Interior which said that the Spanish government two years earlier had granted me their citizenship because I had fought in the civil war and also, the letter also said...and that I had asked for a citizenship and the letter said that they were not able to locate me and that they now found me and I had to assume citizenship, Spanish citizenship. </sentence><sentence id="1412">TECHNICAL CONVERSATION So we were...with this letter 1 went together with the legal attache..we went to the Minister of Interior where I changed citizenship. </sentence><sentence id="1413">I canceled the Italian one and I assumed Spanish citizenship. </sentence><sentence id="1414">When I returned to the Legation that early morning, it was probably eight or nine a.m., and it's strange that that morning Sanspritz (ph) got up at eight a.m., but these were very difficult times and people didn't always go to sleep. </sentence><sentence id="1415">I saw...thank you...that there was a lot of confusion around, surrounding the Legation at the entrance and in the courtyard, and that many of these people who were there had were wearing the David Star, Star of David, and I asked the legal attache what was happening and he said that these were people who are asking for our protection, protection from the Spanish government but right now we're in difficulty because the only Christian legation is Sanspritz. </sentence><sentence id="1416">And therefore it's impossible to organize an external protection and it's it doesn't make any sense to give them protection letters but I said if I can be of help, then I...maybe I can do something, so we went to Sanspritz and I told him I'm available if you need me, and he said yes. </sentence><sentence id="1417">Sanspritz said yes but I can't pay you because we don't have any funds to pay you with and I said I'm not interested because I have enough money to survive on my own. </sentence><sentence id="1418">And so I started immediately. </sentence><sentence id="1419">I started working immediately. </sentence><sentence id="1420">The first few hours I must tell the truth....I didn't know what to do and I didn't know where to start, but then after speaking with uh the attorney Fakash (ph) who was the attorney and also with the Chancellor and with other people who were there who were all Jews, Fakash, the Chancellor, her son and all of the refugees and so | realized what could be done. </sentence><sentence id="1421">The first thing was to try to get back about three hundred people who had been protected by Spain. </sentence><sentence id="1422">They had about three hundred, only three hundred at that time because the Hungarian government had said three hundred, and Sanspritz accepted this decision on behalf of the Spanish government and this is something that I didn't, didn't accept immediately at first so those first two or three days my job was to try to find those who had been protected, of the three hundred protected. </sentence><sentence id="1423">Of the three hundred I was able to get a hundred and fifty back and I found them at the uh Merchandise Depot, at the train station and also by going to the border between Hungary and say Austria and Germany, and those who had a Spanish ID we were able to bring them back. </sentence><sentence id="1424">It seems to me we had rented two trucks but I don't remember now how many, or we brought them back with the train or we reserved a special car... I don't really remember how that happened. </sentence><sentence id="1425">I was with the car. [ </sentence><sentence id="1426">hada car. </sentence><sentence id="1427">So I started working. </sentence><sentence id="1428">I saved uh...after...oh he wants to know if you're going to edit it, edit this tape... ...So the episode at the train station...you can take it from the other tape and put it together, piece it together... The first episode that struck me very much and which opened my eyes to what was happening and to how things were actually really were, at the train station they were loading train cars with Jews who were being deported because the Hungarian government said that it had an agreement publicly with the German government to give thirty million uh Jews who would go to work and then we understood that that wasn't true, that they were going to work. </sentence><sentence id="1429">They were people who were being deported and then we didn't know what would happen to them in the end, so much so that Eva Long's (ph) husband had volunteered to be a laborer. </sentence><sentence id="1430">He went on the train but on the trip between Budapest and the border he understood...I don't know how...but he understood that it was a trick and so he jumped from the train and he came back to Budapest. </sentence><sentence id="1431">And he came back to Budapest to . </sentence><sentence id="1432">I don't think that that building existed yet but anyway he came to one of the Spanish houses, so...this episode of the two twins...at a certain point there was a column which was going and we were looking to see if anybody was there with Spanish letters, and I saw two twins, two kids of eleven or twelve years old. </sentence><sentence id="1433">They were very handsome kids, nice kids and they were identical and the more I saw the more | told myself how is it possible that I, I let them go, and so I told these kids, you see that car over there. </sentence><sentence id="1434">Get in the car. </sentence><sentence id="1435">Run to the car. </sentence><sentence id="1436">Get into the car. </sentence><sentence id="1437">Close the door and then the chauffeur will know what he has to do. </sentence><sentence id="1438">Maybe you would like to hear from me how I could communicate with these people. </sentence><sentence id="1439">At the time I spoke German, French, Spanish, but I could explain myself, I could express myself in Hungarian for a little bit and perhaps I spoke Hungarian with these children, but anyhow these kids went. </sentence><sentence id="1440">One Gestapo major came to and he wanted the kids back, and I said no. </sentence><sentence id="1441">They were in the car. </sentence><sentence id="1442">It's a Spanish car and it had a Spanish uh flag and a license plate, diplomatic license plates and therefore the car was extra(c)territorial property. </sentence><sentence id="1443">He insisted. </sentence><sentence id="1444">He took out his gun and then so forth, and next, Wallenberg was next to me and Wallenberg said...told the major, the German major, look...this man represents Spain. </sentence><sentence id="1445">You can't...you can't commit any violent acts. </sentence><sentence id="1446">He said look. </sentence><sentence id="1447">He's getting in the way of my work, and instinctively I replied that you call this work. </sentence><sentence id="1448">That's what I asked him. </sentence><sentence id="1449">And so he got even more angry. </sentence><sentence id="1450">He wanted the kids back. </sentence><sentence id="1451">And L...at that point I saw the situation getting really bad. </sentence><sentence id="1452">I thought my God, this man is crazy. </sentence><sentence id="1453">He could shoot us. </sentence><sentence id="1454">He had a big gun, a Mauthauser (ph), a big, big gun, but at that point...we were all yelling. </sentence><sentence id="1455">I was screaming. </sentence><sentence id="1456">Wallenberg, the Spaniard...sorry...the Portuguese, the Swiss, the Vatican...everyone intervened in the discussion. </sentence><sentence id="1457">There were many loud voices at the same time and so this colonel, a colonel came, an SS colonel came...of the Gestapo...sorry...came to see what was happening and he asked the major what was happening and the major explained it to him, and so he said now let it be...their time will come too for the kids. </sentence><sentence id="1458">And so they left. </sentence><sentence id="1459">And then I brought these kids home. </sentence><sentence id="1460">I brought them to the Legation and I was surprised to see that they were really a boy and a girl who when they were fully dressed you couldn't tell and they...it was a boy and a girl and they were perfectly identical. </sentence><sentence id="1461">The same height, the same face...everything, everything was identical. </sentence><sentence id="1462">This is an episode that struck me which, which along with the other episode of the child who was killed on the street, these two episodes made me reflect very much. </sentence><sentence id="1463">It's not that...at the time I really wasn't fully aware of the situation. </sentence><sentence id="1464">From the end of March to October 13th, I was not...I had been interned away from Budapest in the countryside...I continued my work. </sentence><sentence id="1465">I stopped looking for the three hundred people because I got one hundred and fifty back and it seemed have understood that there was nothing more that could be done and so I started to organize the protection network. </sentence><sentence id="1466">We had a house. </sentence><sentence id="1467">I don't remember where it was. ( </sentence><sentence id="1468">Technical conversation) I don't remember which one it was but we did have one house. </sentence><sentence id="1469">Maybe two houses we had already. </sentence><sentence id="1470">Maybe they were _ wherever Long was...yes, it's perhaps...but anyway that's not important. </sentence><sentence id="1471">I started organizing by issuing hundreds of letters immediately. </sentence><sentence id="1472">Letters of protection and I would...I would let these people come in. </sentence><sentence id="1473">We would go to the office and type up these letters. </sentence><sentence id="1474">Sanspritz didn't know anything because we used his signature pad. </sentence><sentence id="1475">He didn't know how many. </sentence><sentence id="1476">His job was to keep relations with the Foreign Affairs Minister. </sentence><sentence id="1477">So we issued I think more than two thousand five hundred protection...letters of protection in the month of...at the end of October and November. </sentence><sentence id="1478">To be more specific...1 couldn't be more specific than that. </sentence><sentence id="1479">I think we maybe reached three thousand, more or less. </sentence><sentence id="1480">It wasn't very easy. </sentence><sentence id="1481">Not only...it wasn't sufficient to issue a letter of protection and to escort these people to their house because they had to be escorted to a building after all. </sentence><sentence id="1482">I had some people who were willing to accompany these people with their cars uh as the letters of protection were issued. </sentence><sentence id="1483">There were cars who were available and who shuttled back and forth between the Legation and the houses where they were going to live and they would go back and forth continuously and therefore and so we had to uh provide for everything. </sentence><sentence id="1484">We had to get them settled. </sentence><sentence id="1485">Normally these apartments that we would take, we had to pay the rent, but these are details that are of no importance and perhaps we didn't even pay the rent. </sentence><sentence id="1486">We also had to feed these people and we had to be careful that the Nazis wouldn't go to take them because they did do that. </sentence><sentence id="1487">They did especially they would try to attack those Swedish houses and Swiss houses because they had a, a system of protection which was not correct. </sentence><sentence id="1488">In other words, they had given, both of those countries had a mixed committee, Jewish and Christian committee which was responsible for issuing letters of protection. </sentence><sentence id="1489">To sum it up these letters were being sold. </sentence><sentence id="1490">The authorities and particularly the Nazis found out about this and so therefore every day they, they would come and take uh raid the Swiss and the Swedish houses. </sentence><sentence id="1491">I think that as far as I know Sweden issued forty million letters of protection and in its houses it had maybe three or four thousand people because they would come in the afternoon and the next day there would be raids, and this is not something that I just heard. </sentence><sentence id="1492">They weren't rumors. </sentence><sentence id="1493">I saw them with my very own eyes and with Wallenberg I asked him why did you, why do you do that kind of stuff. </sentence><sentence id="1494">That's not correct. </sentence><sentence id="1495">These letters are being sold and everyone knows about it. </sentence><sentence id="1496">The authorities know about it. </sentence><sentence id="1497">Anyway, we had to protect to prevent that these people be taken. </sentence><sentence id="1498">We had to protect them. </sentence><sentence id="1499">With one excuse or the other the Nazi police...not the regular police...the regular police would intervene when they had orders but there was also various police forces, Nazi police forces in various neighborhoods of representing various factions which were ferocious. </sentence><sentence id="1500">They killed. </sentence><sentence id="1501">They uh they robbed and that was their goal, and we had to protect the those who were being protected from themselves because these, these people sometimes lacked common sense. </sentence><sentence id="1502">Sometimes it was useless. </sentence><sentence id="1503">It wasn't enough to tell them don't go out of the houses because if you go out of the house they'll take, they take you away. </sentence><sentence id="1504">They put you in the prisons and the Nazis may even kill you, and to...that will give us more work to do because we'll have to come and get you and find you and this happened many times. </sentence><sentence id="1505">They would go and take a walk to go find their girlfriend, to go find their boyfriend...all these things. </sentence><sentence id="1506">Or for whatever reasons, their own reasons. </sentence><sentence id="1507">I even created the committees in each house with three members and their job was to be concerned about hygiene, discipline, order, and to prevent people from leaving the houses and going on the streets. </sentence><sentence id="1508">They had to remain inside the houses because there they were safe. </sentence><sentence id="1509">If they left the houses, they were no longer safe. </sentence><sentence id="1510">They would take their stars off and they would go outside and there would be Nazis there who would ask them for their papers and what papers could they show. </sentence><sentence id="1511">They didn't have any. </sentence><sentence id="1512">If they did, it would be clear that they were Jews and therefore...yeah...you can understand what happened then. </sentence><sentence id="1513">And so we had to find uh food for them and security besides watching. </sentence><sentence id="1514">We were pretty lucky. </sentence><sentence id="1515">It was a continuous job because we had to travel throughout the neighborhoods continuously to show the flag, to show that we were present and continuously...I went at least twice a day and daringly, I went daringly on the streets and little by little with the with the car...I would go with the car and so the people could see the, the uh flag, so the people could see that the car was guarding them, and therefore and so with time, with the passage of weeks, new houses were organized. </sentence><sentence id="1516">We tried with a hospital too but it was but it failed. </sentence><sentence id="1517">The...it was my idea but it was a bad idea. </sentence><sentence id="1518">It didn't go well. </sentence><sentence id="1519">So weeks went on. </sentence><sentence id="1520">Months went by...sorry...weeks went on and at the end of November we were working continuously and the work with...the contacts with the authorities...I didn't, I didn't think that you didn't need to have contacts with the authorities. </sentence><sentence id="1521">Quite the contrary. </sentence><sentence id="1522">I made as many contacts as possible. </sentence><sentence id="1523">I...one day for example I took ...1 don't know what that is...I took twenty-five thousand _ to the secretary of the minister who was very... ..oh, money. </sentence><sentence id="1524">OK. </sentence><sentence id="1525">This is money that he brought to the Hungarian uh refugees in Transylvania and Russia and Carpetia and the refugees...and this is money for the children and he was very thankful and every time, every time I was in the neighborhood where he...I went up to see him to say hello to him and this gave me the possibility to ask him information all the time, how it was going at the Foreign Affairs Ministry, for example. </sentence><sentence id="1526">For example, since Fritz didn't want to go to the Ministry, since Fritz (ph) never left the Legation to visit a house...he never visited any of the houses. </sentence><sentence id="1527">He didn't know anything. </sentence><sentence id="1528">He wasn't interested even in how many signatures were used with his signature pad because he was a diplomat and he had uh limited vision. </sentence><sentence id="1529">He was an old- timer diplomat. </sentence><sentence id="1530">This is a very...what he did was very serious and uh correct but it would have been a good thing in times of peace and in normal times when the war was not ideological as it had become, when there was no persecution of the Jews. </sentence><sentence id="1531">Not only of Jews but also the uh in Hungary there were many uh...uh they had orchestras. </sentence><sentence id="1532">They played the violins and they had restaurants and they played the orchestras and with the violins and their famous people...in Hungary and in Serbia (ph)... . </sentence><sentence id="1533">I'm sorry...I can't find the word...you know...these traveling homeless kind of people...oh...uh... they, they dress in flashy costumes...(gypsies)...gypsies, gypsies....thank you. </sentence><sentence id="1534">Gypsies. </sentence><sentence id="1535">Gypsies. </sentence><sentence id="1536">Gypsies. </sentence><sentence id="1537">I couldn't find the word...sorry...OK. ( </sentence><sentence id="1538">Pause) In Belgrade on...day and night I went to restaurants and I had meals and in the evenings they had orchestras. </sentence><sentence id="1539">They were played by the gypsies. </sentence><sentence id="1540">And there was a beautiful restaurant in in Square, where there was a good orchestra and there were a couple of good violinists. </sentence><sentence id="1541">One day they disappeared, in January of "42 I think it was. </sentence><sentence id="1542">Yes. </sentence><sentence id="1543">January of 1942 they disappeared. </sentence><sentence id="1544">I asked the owner of the restaurant, what happened to the orchestra, the band. </sentence><sentence id="1545">And he said well...at first he didn't really want to answer. </sentence><sentence id="1546">He was reticent, and then he said the Germans took them off, because they are of an inferior race. </sentence><sentence id="1547">So they persecuted uh Jews, gypsies, and in that area were many of them, and the Poles. </sentence><sentence id="1548">Not only uh Jewish Poles but the citizens too, and this is something that I saw. </sentence><sentence id="1549">This is not something that I just heard. </sentence><sentence id="1550">I saw it. </sentence><sentence id="1551">So, so we...this is how we worked, issuing these letters of protection and then Sanspritz left. </sentence><sentence id="1552">I don't remember if he left the 30th of November or December Ist. </sentence><sentence id="1553">Uh it seems...I think that the ambassador, Spanish ambassador told me November 30th. </sentence><sentence id="1554">He told me November 30th, but I don't know if he's sure about this or not. </sentence><sentence id="1555">Anyhow, he...Sanspritz left and that morning there was a reaction on behalf of the Nazis. </sentence><sentence id="1556">I found myself that morning, early in the morning I was called...six in the morning...and I don't remember who called me but they called me from the Legation to tell me that Sanspritz had left and so I got up and I, I visited the international ghetto thinking what do I do now? </sentence><sentence id="1557">What is the situation? </sentence><sentence id="1558">And in a certain sense the Nazis helped because by...when I went in front of the house of Street, Number 25, where the child was in this house...he reminded me of some details the other day when I saw him for the first time. </sentence><sentence id="1559">He recalled some details that I didn't remember. </sentence><sentence id="1560">I saw besides...speaking of he exaggerates when I say that I uh yelled to the Nazis and said get out of here. </sentence><sentence id="1561">He exaggerates. </sentence><sentence id="1562">As a child, he thought that that's what I did but it wasn't quite like that, but anyhow that's how he saw it. </sentence><sentence id="1563">That's his mentality. </sentence><sentence id="1564">More or less that's how it was, but I wasn't screaming. </sentence><sentence id="1565">I wasn't yelling. </sentence><sentence id="1566">So I saw...I entered this house and I said, what is happening here. </sentence><sentence id="1567">They were...they told us oh they want to take us away. </sentence><sentence id="1568">The police want to deport us. </sentence><sentence id="1569">And sure enough the regular police was there. </sentence><sentence id="1570">Not the Nazis, the regular police was there which was commanded by a lieutenant, and I asked this lieutenant, what do you want. </sentence><sentence id="1571">I've got to take everyone away. </sentence><sentence id="1572">And I closed the door in front of him. </sentence><sentence id="1573">I locked it, and I said look, no one is leaving. </sentence><sentence id="1574">The Spanish flag is here. </sentence><sentence id="1575">The Spanish emblem is here. </sentence><sentence id="1576">This...we consider this house extra-territorial property. </sentence><sentence id="1577">It wasn't legal. </sentence><sentence id="1578">It wasn't right, but what governs such governments, you could just say...you could make up things like that. </sentence><sentence id="1579">It couldn't have been an extra-territorial house. </sentence><sentence id="1580">You needed special permission from the government. </sentence><sentence id="1581">The government had not given any special permission to do that, and so we discussed and we reached an agreement that he would postpone the...and together we would go to the park, in the center of the park, where there was a committee composed of various police forces, the Nazi party, the Foreign Affairs Ministry, the Interior Minister and I don't know who else...seven or eight people. </sentence><sentence id="1582">And I went there to speak with these people and I spoke with energy and with boldness because if I went there with my hat in hand and I said hey, they would say hey, this guy doesn't know what he's doing. </sentence><sentence id="1583">You had to assert yourself, especially with the Hungarians because these people are, are tough people and you had to be just as tough, and he said...I asked him what's happening, why do you want to take these uh people away. </sentence><sentence id="1584">He said because Sanspritz fled. </sentence><sentence id="1585">Who said that he fled? </sentence><sentence id="1586">Sanspritz took a trip. </sentence><sentence id="1587">He went to Bern where he is going to meet Spanish, Italian, French, German and Swiss diplomats to discuss the situation, but then he is coming back. </sentence><sentence id="1588">But in the meantime I am his...the legal representative of the Spanish government and charge d'affaires and I showed him my passport and my diplomatic pass and so the Foreign Affairs Minister representative said yes, this man is uh right what he said, so that's the way it was. </sentence><sentence id="1589">The only thing is that uh Sanspritz really did leave. </sentence><sentence id="1590">He did flee, and he didn't have any intentions of coming back. </sentence><sentence id="1591">So much so that he didn't even tell me that he was leaving. </sentence><sentence id="1592">He didn't tell me anything. </sentence><sentence id="1593">Nothing at all. </sentence><sentence id="1594">He left. </sentence><sentence id="1595">And I learned about it when he was already at the border. </sentence><sentence id="1596">He left at four or five in the morning. </sentence><sentence id="1597">Anyway, but that's not important. </sentence><sentence id="1598">Perhaps it was a good thing. </sentence><sentence id="1599">It was a good thing, because the Nazis uh had invaded that house and it gave me the opportunity to present myself as the successor to the man who they thought had escaped, so the representative of the Foreign Affairs Ministry said OK. </sentence><sentence id="1600">You're right. </sentence><sentence id="1601">The situation is legal. </sentence><sentence id="1602">Uh and I said look, there's a flag at the Legation. </sentence><sentence id="1603">There's a flag at all the houses too, and he said...we had an agreement that after two or three days I would go to the Foreign Affairs Minister Ministry to clarify the Spanish position and in fact this is what happened, but when I went back to the Legation, I found that the Swedish Danielson (ph) Minister who was Wallenberg's boss had been to the Legation. </sentence><sentence id="1604">Danielson wanted to get some money...some Swiss francs. </sentence><sentence id="1605">They're about seventeen thousand Swiss francs which were in a Swiss uh Spanish Legation and I protested at...this is___ who is the Chancellor, and I said what do we do now. </sentence><sentence id="1606">We still hadsome__, some money left and not very much. </sentence><sentence id="1607">She didn't know what to do and she said that he said that he would send a secretary every morning, a Swedish secretary to see that everything was uh alright, and I said no, please, don't do that. </sentence><sentence id="1608">I called Minister Danielson. </sentence><sentence id="1609">I begged him not to send anyone and that and that I would go and see him later on to explain the situation and I'm I went probably the next day or so, because if Sweden uh protected the interest of the Spanish Legation, that meant that the interest of the Spanish Legation would no longer exist. </sentence><sentence id="1610">So we continued to work. . </sentence><sentence id="1611">The situation in the houses came back to normal and while I was there in the park I saw that there was a column of Jews that were being deported and I saw that someone was waving and so I went to see and I saw that these were some of the people protected from another houses of the same street, the___ Street, of Number 33 which was very close, and so I made them give me back. </sentence><sentence id="1612">The situation in the houses was probably, was pretty normal and peaceful. </sentence><sentence id="1613">I don't know what those questions refer to. ( </sentence><sentence id="1614">He hasn't understood the question.) </sentence><sentence id="1615">There were...you mean...are you referring to the quantity of people who were there, the sleeping conditions, the eating conditions...what are you referring to? . </sentence><sentence id="1616">In during December, the first ten days of December, we took some other houses...the last two houses, it seems to me. </sentence><sentence id="1617">But the...from a point of view of the living conditions it was a very difficult situation and the house, there were five hundred people. ____ </sentence><sentence id="1618">told me that they slept on the steps. </sentence><sentence id="1619">I don't remember exactly even though there was a committee that held the list of all the people who arrived every day, but I don't remember how many there were exactly, because...1 must step forward here. </sentence><sentence id="1620">The morning that the Russians arrived, I burnt everything, even the lists of those who were protected because you never know. </sentence><sentence id="1621">If they fall in the hands of the Russians or the GPU...you don't know how they could have interpreted this fact, so we destroyed everything. </sentence><sentence id="1622">The Chancellor didn't want to. </sentence><sentence id="1623">She wanted to save a few things, and I said no. </sentence><sentence id="1624">Everything will be destroyed because nothing shall be left in the hands of the Russians because the Russians, the same day entered the Legation as I expected, had predicted. </sentence><sentence id="1625">And then they uh then they burnt it...they damaged it but I left. </sentence><sentence id="1626">The situation was difficult. </sentence><sentence id="1627">As far as living conditions it was also difficult for the food. </sentence><sentence id="1628">It was difficult for the hygienic conditions. </sentence><sentence id="1629">It was difficult to find medicines. </sentence><sentence id="1630">There was a difficult time, for example, because they had tried to close the water supply in some of the houses. </sentence><sentence id="1631">The Nazis had tried to do this and so I protested with vigor. </sentence><sentence id="1632">I went to the police commander and I demanded that the water be returned. </sentence><sentence id="1633">These things cannot be done because if there is a protection, then these people must have the necessary elements to survive. </sentence><sentence id="1634">If there is no water, I don't know what would have happened. </sentence><sentence id="1635">With five hundred people and, and if it were sixty or seventy...I don't know how, what would have happened. </sentence><sentence id="1636">And then there was the problem of food. </sentence><sentence id="1637">We had to feed these people. </sentence><sentence id="1638">At a certain point there was no more money left from the Legation...this was Hungarian money in the Legation. </sentence><sentence id="1639">I spent some of my money that I had in my pockets but I didn't have that much and you had to buy on the black market, and so I went to the Jewish Council, , and they gave me some money and then they didn't have any left either. </sentence><sentence id="1640">They, they were just in terrible conditions. </sentence><sentence id="1641">They had nothing left to eat themselves. </sentence><sentence id="1642">I must uh say that in the month of August, had fired the Nazi government and one of the first measures that was taken was that the star be no longer worn and all the racial laws were being dismantled and brought down, and so many people went back to the villages where they had lived. </sentence><sentence id="1643">Not everyone lived in Budapest. </sentence><sentence id="1644">Some of them lived in villages. </sentence><sentence id="1645">In Carpetia (ph) for example, in Buchovina (ph). </sentence><sentence id="1646">They were farmers. </sentence><sentence id="1647">The, the Jewish, the Jews of that area were farmers, and so what did the Germans and the Nazis do. </sentence><sentence id="1648">They forced uh these Jews from the countryside to come back to Budapest and...those who had left Budapest...and they concentrated them in the old ghetto, which could support maybe two, three million people...not fifty or sixty...two or three thousand people, not fifty or sixty thousand people, and so there was this black, terrible hunger. </sentence><sentence id="1649">There was...there were infections. </sentence><sentence id="1650">There were diseases. </sentence><sentence id="1651">They was cold. </sentence><sentence id="1652">There was no electricity. </sentence><sentence id="1653">There, there was nothing. </sentence><sentence id="1654">They had nothing to eat. </sentence><sentence id="1655">And so this uh Jewish Council also ran out of money and once it ran...once they ran out, I ran out too, and with what I had I could buy something from the black market and specifically I had to be careful with...watch the children because we had two orphanages which were really not ours but one belonged to the International Red Cross I think and one belonged to the Swedish Red Cross and the Spanish Legation had been begged to protect, protect and to take care of these two houses, and here I must open a parenthesis because the truth is the truth after all. </sentence><sentence id="1656">On the black market I bought condensed milk with the symbol of the International Red Cross. </sentence><sentence id="1657">And we had uh...it was very expensive. </sentence><sentence id="1658">We had to pay for it dearly on the black market, but there were many children. </sentence><sentence id="1659">There were children in the two orphanages and there were children in the houses, the protected houses. </sentence><sentence id="1660">And since the Jewish Council which whose name was &gt; , which means Jewish Council, since this uh Council didn't have any money left, wasn't giving any money any more, since I had nominated a committee for each house to maintain the discipline and hygiene and order and so forth, I gave...I charged these committees to spy uh financially, economically. </sentence><sentence id="1661">They said...they would tell me which people could give money. </sentence><sentence id="1662">And so I went to these people...not every day...and I said give me a thousand ___. _ </sentence><sentence id="1663">You can give me five thousand, near five...according to their capabilities. </sentence><sentence id="1664">And these people gave me money. </sentence><sentence id="1665">But somebody would say, why. </sentence><sentence id="1666">Why should I give you money? </sentence><sentence id="1667">And I would say because you have the money. </sentence><sentence id="1668">We need the money. </sentence><sentence id="1669">I don't have any. </sentence><sentence id="1670">The Legation doesn't have any. </sentence><sentence id="1671">What...what will we use to buy food with. </sentence><sentence id="1672">And then we discovered thanks to the spying activities that the committee undertook that there were some families that had reserves of food that were bountiful and there was a time when we just couldn't find anything on the black market anymore, and so I had these reserves, food stocks, taken that these families had. </sentence><sentence id="1673">And this food was distributed because I don't know what would have happened. </sentence><sentence id="1674">There would have been fights because hunger is hunger. </sentence><sentence id="1675">A mother who doesn't have milk or food for her child...uh she sees the child get weaker and weaker every day...she's capable of killing and she's right, don't you think? </sentence><sentence id="1676">And so therefore with these stories...uh these stories occurred day after day, week after week, and we finally come to the day of Christmas Eve, which was a terrible day. </sentence><sentence id="1677">End of Tape #1 Tape #2 ...because the Russians, Russia and Spain considered themselves in a state of war. </sentence><sentence id="1678">Anyhow, I always kept quiet. </sentence><sentence id="1679">Yes...yes...it's started. </sentence><sentence id="1680">Uh Christmas Day I remember that I left. </sentence><sentence id="1681">On Christmas Eve, on Christmas Eve I left. </sentence><sentence id="1682">I spent uh...that evening and I went to the villa in Budapest. </sentence><sentence id="1683">It was in late afternoon and I thought that I would eat there but when I arrived in the neighborhood I found that there were elements of the Hungarian army with machine guns and other arms and so forth, and they told me that it's not possible to pass through because the Russians are very close, three hundred, four hundred meters away, and I told them that I have to go. </sentence><sentence id="1684">I'm, I'ma diplomat and I have to go to the, all the people of the Spanish Legation, which was very close, a hundred meters from here, and they said OK, we'll give you fifteen minutes and then you have to come back. </sentence><sentence id="1685">Otherwise it's uh your business. </sentence><sentence id="1686">I said OK. </sentence><sentence id="1687">So I went and I found that everything was topsy-turvy. </sentence><sentence id="1688">We had sixty refugees in the villa of the Legation and, and I understood that I didn't have time to have lunch there, that I had to go back to Budapest. </sentence><sentence id="1689">They, they had made a big Christmas tree for me. </sentence><sentence id="1690">It was big because they had...they cut it down from the park and it was six or seven meters high and you would enter the first floor and you would go down to the second...the living room and it was all...it was a Christmas tree that was, that took up two floors and was full of presents and I looked at the Christmas tree and I didn't even take my presents, because I said if I take my stuff, I am letting them know that the Russians are here, that there's going to be some fighting here and that we don't know what the Germans would have done and so forth and so I just said goodbye to everyone and I left. </sentence><sentence id="1691">And I went back to Budapest. </sentence><sentence id="1692">I was...didn't go back to the villa because the next day it was burnt by a German grenade. </sentence><sentence id="1693">That evening, which was Christmas Eve, which is a holiday in Spain too...it's...there's a big supper on Christmas Eve and I had been invited to lunch at the __ Hotel by the Secretary of the Nazi Party, the Hungarian Nazi Party, and I feared that with this invitation he wanted to ask me to pay for the Spanish passports. </sentence><sentence id="1694">They say...the Hungarian newspapers said that I gave the Spanish passports to them. </sentence><sentence id="1695">That's now true. </sentence><sentence id="1696">It's not true. </sentence><sentence id="1697">If they had asked it from me, I don't know what I would have done. </sentence><sentence id="1698">I would have judged...assessed the situation at the time and I would have uh dealt and I would have...uh practically I would have sold the passports in exchange for guarantees for security for the protected people. </sentence><sentence id="1699">So we lunched together and we spoke about everything except politics. </sentence><sentence id="1700">We joked around, and at a certain point we had finished our lunch and a courier arrived which gave him, gave the minister something...just like in the movies. </sentence><sentence id="1701">And I think that this...on this piece of paper there was written that he had to leave and in fact he told me...look, I'm sorry but I have to leave and so forth. </sentence><sentence id="1702">So we left. </sentence><sentence id="1703">And I was happy because he didn't ask me anything. </sentence><sentence id="1704">He didn't...he didn't ask anything about the passport, which was a delicate question to hand over a passport. </sentence><sentence id="1705">Yes, I did have passports to give, but if, if the question became known and the Spanish government found out that that the passport had been given to a Nazi minister, the Spanish government undoubtedly would have reacted, and they undoubtedly would have said no, we uh do not authorize this. </sentence><sentence id="1706">He's not authorized to give out passports, so I was glad that he didn't ask me anything. </sentence><sentence id="1707">Even though there are Hungarian newspapers that say that I gave uh passports to Nazi ministers, that's not true. </sentence><sentence id="1708">In fact, during the trials they didn't bring this up, so I was alone because I didn't even want an escort that evening. </sentence><sentence id="1709">I said I was going to go to dinner that evening and he would...and I just need someone to take me to some...to the Legation or to my apartment and that's all, because I had many places where I could go and sleep. </sentence><sentence id="1710">Ata certain point, I was stopped by a group of Hungarian Nazis, Nazis, who asked me to see my passport and they said that this passport and diplomatic pass are no longer valid. </sentence><sentence id="1711">And during this conversation I saw on the other side of the street a uh army elements, a pa...army patrol, and so I called them and the patrol came and it was commanded by a lieutenant who commanded thirty men or so, and I said look, these people want to arrest me and this is my name. </sentence><sentence id="1712">These are my documents and papers and so they said no, no, no, no. </sentence><sentence id="1713">You can't touch this man. </sentence><sentence id="1714">He's a diplomat. </sentence><sentence id="1715">He represents Spain and so he sent them away, and so they escorted me home. </sentence><sentence id="1716">And I decided that I would go spend the night in an apartment in uh ,in Street, Street. </sentence><sentence id="1717">I invited this lieutenant to come and have a drink with me and he told me, declared to me that they were about to close...they were about to close the neighborhood and there was only one street open left, and that's why I understood that the minister who had been in such a hurry to leave. </sentence><sentence id="1718">And so the next morning I tried to get in touch with the villa, because I had left two cars there and I needed those cars. </sentence><sentence id="1719">One belonged to Sanspritz and another had been lent to me that morning by an Italian citizen because the only two cars that I had in the Legation were not working, and so he lent me this car and the next day the car was burnt in the village. </sentence><sentence id="1720">The whole villa was destroyed. </sentence><sentence id="1721">Nothing was left. </sentence><sentence id="1722">Of my stuff, one girl saved five handkerchiefs that she had wanted to save me, but she didn't want to hang them on the tree. </sentence><sentence id="1723">She didn't want to hang the handkerchiefs on the tree with everything else and this girl came to the house at the last minute before the house burnt and she uh got the box with the handkerchiefs and after three months, she came to Budapest to give me the handkerchiefs. </sentence><sentence id="1724">That morning...that Christmas morning was a terrible morning. </sentence><sentence id="1725">Spain...I don't know for what reasons...wanted uh cared for the Slovak minister. </sentence><sentence id="1726">Bohemia had been annexed by Germany but Slovakia was independent and so they had a diplomatic representative in Budapest. </sentence><sentence id="1727">This diplomatic representative who had contacts with the Spaniards... don't know how...I don't remember...but anyhow with, together with the attorney Fakash went to look for him to bring him to the Legation. </sentence><sentence id="1728">We found him. </sentence><sentence id="1729">He was dead, in the garden before the gate of the Legation. </sentence><sentence id="1730">The Nazis had killed him because they had discovered that he was anti-Nazi. </sentence><sentence id="1731">When I returned they wanted to take attorney Fakash away from me. </sentence><sentence id="1732">They wanted him to leave the car and if he left the car, that was the end. </sentence><sentence id="1733">I was able to bring him back to the Legation and I told him you're not to leave this Legation again. </sentence><sentence id="1734">I will go alone. </sentence><sentence id="1735">I will be escorted by the police forces. </sentence><sentence id="1736">I will go alone and you remain here because your life is in danger. </sentence><sentence id="1737">So I...the days...that's how the days passed after Christmas. </sentence><sentence id="1738">By New Year's Eve it was calm, especially in the evening. </sentence><sentence id="1739">We even danced...sure...we danced in the basement of the Legation. </sentence><sentence id="1740">We even brought out some bottles of Spanish wine. </sentence><sentence id="1741">There were hundreds and hundreds of Spanish, precious Spanish wine from , bottles of wine from these areas in Spain which is precious wine. </sentence><sentence id="1742">I liked it anyhow and I used to drink it all the time in Spain. </sentence><sentence id="1743">And they danced. </sentence><sentence id="1744">They even danced. </sentence><sentence id="1745">I was happy because these people who were in hiding...and they were all Jews except for one who said he was a priest, but I don't think he was a priest. </sentence><sentence id="1746">I think that he was a priest who was pretending...uh a Jew who was pretending to be a priest I think, but I never saw him again these are not details that really interested me since they did not come into the offices. </sentence><sentence id="1747">They came only for...in the last moment when we were asleep in the basement together and that's when we had this party and that's when I saw them. </sentence><sentence id="1748">II always thought...I'm actually glad that I didn't have any contact with them. </sentence><sentence id="1749">You know, we'd just say hello and good evening and that's it. </sentence><sentence id="1750">There was a Hungarian diplomat, , who had a wife and daughter...uh many people. </sentence><sentence id="1751">There was sixty or so people, and they even danced. </sentence><sentence id="1752">And then the situation began to get worse. </sentence><sentence id="1753">So we still continued to issue those letters of protection because the Nazis, Hungarian Nazis...not Germans, Hungarian Nazis...when I speak of Nazis I always refer to the Hungarian Nazis, the Milash (ph)...so...what did I want to say...where was I...where was I...OK. </sentence><sentence id="1754">The first few days of January we heard some rumors according to which it seemed that they wanted to take away all of the Jews from the international ghetto and take them to the old grand ghetto and deport them. </sentence><sentence id="1755">I didn't believe in such a thing because they were saying that Minister who was in charge of the civilians and military for the seized (ph) capital, they were saying that he was going to burn the ghetto and ,and kill all the Jews. </sentence><sentence id="1756">This would have been the final Hungarian solution and I didn't believe in such a thing. </sentence><sentence id="1757">In the meantime new letters were being issued, not very many but there was always someone who felt threatened because they had inspected the house next door or the apartment above...you know how it is. </sentence><sentence id="1758">So one day uh fourth...on the fourth or fifth or the sixth of January...I don't remember exactly...probably the fifth or the sixth of January, I was crossing Mussolini Square to go to the orphanages which were very nearby and I saw a column of Jews passing by and so I asked, who are these Jews? </sentence><sentence id="1759">And they say, these are Jews, uh Portuguese Jews. </sentence><sentence id="1760">That night, during that during the night the Portuguese minister had sent an employee of his to ask me orally to assume the responsibility for the Portuguese Legation and I told him no, that if there is something, if there is something...if he can come and explain to me, then we can come to an agreement, but as it stands I, I didn't... couldn't assume any more responsibilities. </sentence><sentence id="1761">I'd had enough of my own, and so I saw that they took away all those Portuguese Jews and so I understood that that had already, man had already abandoned everything or he was about to abandon everything because he was the Portuguese minister but he was a Hungarian citizen. </sentence><sentence id="1762">He was the deg was his name, but he was a Hungarian citizen, but he was acting as Portuguese minister and therefore that man said he had abandoned everything, that he was stepping back and that he considered uh that he couldn't do anything more. </sentence><sentence id="1763">So I wrote a letter to this minister and I...where I wrote that I had heard these rumors, that I didn't believe in them, that please to deny these rumors but he didn't respond and after two days I wrote him....actually no...I telephoned and I said that I was about to come to see him...that I would come see him the next day and I think that was January 8 or the 7th or the 8th of January. </sentence><sentence id="1764">Probably the 8th. </sentence><sentence id="1765">Perhaps even in the night. </sentence><sentence id="1766">Who knows. </sentence><sentence id="1767">Anyway, it's not that important. </sentence><sentence id="1768">So he went there that day. </sentence><sentence id="1769">I went because I had heard these rumors which were more and more prevalent and then I saw, when I saw the column of the Portuguese Jews I was struck and I went and I found in uh the chamber of the city hall Budapest, in the basement, I found Wallenberg, the Swede, and who was Swiss. </sentence><sentence id="1770">And I told them I'm going to go inside first because I have an appointment. </sentence><sentence id="1771">My appointment...it hadn't really been conferred to me that I had an appointment but uh and when I return from the appointment then we can all talk together. </sentence><sentence id="1772">The colonel uh who is head of the gendarmerie, accompanied me to the minister's office. </sentence><sentence id="1773">It was a little office in the basement and this colonel three days later killed himself by the way. </sentence><sentence id="1774">He saw that everything was lost. </sentence><sentence id="1775">He'd been compromised because of the Jewish question and so he killed himself. </sentence><sentence id="1776">Sada (ph) was his name. </sentence><sentence id="1777">Colonel Sada and he was the head of the whole gendarmerie of Hungary at that time, so I went to this minister that I had seen, not known, but I had seen him in the past and very calmly he said yes. </sentence><sentence id="1778">He wanted to solve the Jewish question by killing everyone. </sentence><sentence id="1779">And so I started to say do you realize what's happening and do you realize what's going to happen, that the Hungarian people will have to suffer because you killed a hundred thousand people, and so finally I even...you know... even talked about the Myian (ph) civilization and everything that came to mind, people...anything to move him. </sentence><sentence id="1780">I even cried. </sentence><sentence id="1781">Uh but he was tough so I didn't know what to do anymore. </sentence><sentence id="1782">I I can't just leave the situation like this, I thought to myself, so I told him, look...if within forty-five hours the Spanish government does not receive from me a guarantee that all is calm and that the agreements between...the agreements with the Hungarian government have been respected because during the period between October, November and December we had come to an agreement with the Foreign Affairs Minister and the Hungarian government...we had reached an agreement and received guarantees. </sentence><sentence id="1783">Not only that but the Hungarian government wanted to send a diplomatic representative to Madrid in order to, to tie diplomatic relations with the Anglo-Americans to see in, in, in view of the peace treaty, and logically the Spanish government who didn't wish to recognize the Nazi government, didn't want to hear anything about it. </sentence><sentence id="1784">The, the uh credentials, the request for credentials...he's explaining uh this...what credentials are...logically I didn't transmit these letters of...this request for credentials to Madrid. </sentence><sentence id="1785">It was for a certain Colonel . </sentence><sentence id="1786">I didn't transmit them because if I did the Spanish government would probably say that that they that they didn't accept it because they didn't recognize the government while until then the government, the Spanish government kept quiet. </sentence><sentence id="1787">They kept quiet. </sentence><sentence id="1788">Also the Spanish uh Spanish ambassador last night told me that he saw in the archives many telegrams from the Hungarian government which asked the Spanish government if I was really the charge d'affaires. </sentence><sentence id="1789">The Spanish government never answered. </sentence><sentence id="1790">The Spanish ambassador told me that last night. </sentence><sentence id="1791">They never...the Spanish government never responded to these telegrams. </sentence><sentence id="1792">I understood naturally, slowly...I slowly understood why we had a preferential treatment with the Hungarian government and this was because they wanted to have diplomatic relations with Spain to contact the Anglo-Americans. </sentence><sentence id="1793">We understood it late, but we understood it. </sentence><sentence id="1794">If we understood it immediately, maybe two months earlier because we're already talking about the beginning of November...had we understood it earlier, two months ago, we would have behaved differently and perhaps something more could have been done I think but uh we're not...we weren't that intelligent after all. </sentence><sentence id="1795">The Spanish ambassador told me not that...not everyone is intelligent. </sentence><sentence id="1796">I wasn't intelligent. </sentence><sentence id="1797">The other the other guy also wasn't intelligent so uh what do you want. </sentence><sentence id="1798">So I told him that if within forty-five hours the Spanish government doesn't get any guarantees that everything is proceeding with order the three thousand Hungarian citizens which are, who are in, in Spain will be interned...actually there were really a hundred including the diplomats...and their goods will be seized and this, the Spanish government will...or ask the Brazilian government and the Paraguayan government to do the same with those Hungarian citizens who were in Brazil and Paraguay. </sentence><sentence id="1799">So this minister said a friendly government like the Spanish government would do such a thing? </sentence><sentence id="1800">What friendly government? </sentence><sentence id="1801">If you are against us, you're the ones who are against us. </sentence><sentence id="1802">This is what we want. </sentence><sentence id="1803">We want to protect these Jews. </sentence><sentence id="1804">You don't want to do it, so you are coming against our interests and against our policy and against our interests and our wishes, so how can you say that we are friends. </sentence><sentence id="1805">We're friends if you say, if you do what we want. </sentence><sentence id="1806">To sum it up he said, OK. </sentence><sentence id="1807">The Spaniards are, are excluded from the liquidation, will be excluded from the liquidation and so I said no, and I became uh demanding in that moment. </sentence><sentence id="1808">I said no. </sentence><sentence id="1809">All...everyone or nobody. </sentence><sentence id="1810">All of those in the international ghetto must remain where they are or all those in the common ghetto must be, must have electricity and water, so forth again, because those people have to survive too because what would what would happen of the Hungarian people, so I repeated to him again and all the stories about vendettas, terrible vendettas and uh the Anglo(c)Americans uh who would come to bombard the city and so forth and so on. </sentence><sentence id="1811">And so we agreed that everything would have uh occurred in that way. </sentence><sentence id="1812">When I left the office I found Wallenberg and were still there, and I explained the situation to them and I said I was able to obtain this and that. </sentence><sentence id="1813">When you do inside I don't know what you can ask of this minister, but please don't uh do anything to undermine this agreement that we've just come to. </sentence><sentence id="1814">Otherwise nothing more...so Wallenberg asked me for political asylum in the Spanish Legation and I said fine, I'll wait for you. </sentence><sentence id="1815">You go to the Legation. </sentence><sentence id="1816">I'll wait for you and I'm going to have to go find something in the neighborhood and then I'll, I'll meet you there at the Legation. </sentence><sentence id="1817">He said no. </sentence><sentence id="1818">I will come with my car in the afternoon. </sentence><sentence id="1819">I'll give you the car because I know you need a car, and I'll come. </sentence><sentence id="1820">I never saw him again. </sentence><sentence id="1821">Never saw him again. </sentence><sentence id="1822">I know that on the 18th he...on the morning of the 18th he wason__ Street. </sentence><sentence id="1823">I know this for sure, and he had left the house at ten in the morning to go I don't know where. </sentence><sentence id="1824">From then on he disappeared. </sentence><sentence id="1825">Now since the since historians say that on the 16th he went to at the Russian command and that he was taken prisoner there. </sentence><sentence id="1826">I say that's not true because on the morning of the 18th he was in Budapest in the on the _Sttreet. </sentence><sentence id="1827">means king. </sentence><sentence id="1828">I don't know really... saw him maybe a dozen times. </sentence><sentence id="1829">I spoke to him specifically during the meetings with diplomats. </sentence><sentence id="1830">I never saw him otherwise. </sentence><sentence id="1831">From the beginning of December, all the diplomats, mutual diplomats, had disappeared. </sentence><sentence id="1832">He couldn't find any of them. </sentence><sentence id="1833">Wallenberg...when I saw Wallenberg at city hall in Budapest on the meeting, the day that I met ,uhI'd seen him, besides that time, I'd seen him on December 22nd at the uh Papal Nuncio (ph) where he had signed a document uh to protest uh and this was in favor of women and I remember that he did not sign that document because he couldn't sign it because he was a secretary and Minister Danielson, his boss, was there. </sentence><sentence id="1834">The ambassador. </sentence><sentence id="1835">His, his boss wasn't there at that time. </sentence><sentence id="1836">Uh that morning during the meeting I told the Archbishop Angelo I would like to speak privately with you and so we went into another office and so I told him look...I started speaking to him in Italian. </sentence><sentence id="1837">In the meetings we always spoke in French. </sentence><sentence id="1838">Uh I started speaking in Italian. </sentence><sentence id="1839">I said look, I'm not a Spaniard. </sentence><sentence id="1840">I'm Italian and I'm close to you because I'm, I was born in Komo (ph) and he had also been born close to Komo. </sentence><sentence id="1841">He said oh, you're...you're kidding. </sentence><sentence id="1842">You're joking. </sentence><sentence id="1843">I said no, no. </sentence><sentence id="1844">I'm not kidding. </sentence><sentence id="1845">This is the truth. </sentence><sentence id="1846">I tell you this because if something would ever happen to me, you...I want you to know this so that you can uh tell my relatives. </sentence><sentence id="1847">He told me, I remember, don't tell : was his secretary because that guy is very picky. </sentence><sentence id="1848">He can...he might become very angry, might cause trouble. </sentence><sentence id="1849">I said no, no. </sentence><sentence id="1850">I won't tell . </sentence><sentence id="1851">And his...practically this is where the story ends because after a few days...no, actually the next morning, Mr. , Mr.__ sent an employee to ask for telegrams to send to Madrid because we didn't have a radio. </sentence><sentence id="1852">The capital was under siege and it wasn't...we couldn't communicate with Vienna. </sentence><sentence id="1853">Normally you could telephone Vienna, Vienna telephoned Berlin, and Berlin via radio communicated to Madrid. </sentence><sentence id="1854">But this...it was no longer possible to use the phone. </sentence><sentence id="1855">And so I sent this employee to ask for a telegram which uh I asked him to send via radio radio because he had aradio. </sentence><sentence id="1856">Uh Mr. Fakash, Attorney Fakash who was an attorney who was very picky, an old- timer, uh told me that I shouldn't send the telegram and I told him look, if I don't send the telegram as soon as this employee goes back to Minister , everything will fall apart. </sentence><sentence id="1857">If we send the telegram we'll save four or five days. </sentence><sentence id="1858">We'll gain four or five days because the Spanish government will of course have to reflect on this before responding. </sentence><sentence id="1859">They're not going to respond immediately obviously. </sentence><sentence id="1860">The telegram will be send today. </sentence><sentence id="1861">I don't know if it'll arrive immediately in Madrid and who will receive it in Madrid. </sentence><sentence id="1862">It has to be sent to Bern and this takes time. </sentence><sentence id="1863">I wrote to Bern. </sentence><sentence id="1864">I wrote to the embassy in Bern. </sentence><sentence id="1865">After two or three or four days the...Madrid sent its response thanking uh thanks and it said that it was sure that the Hungarian government would have respected the agreements and so forth and so on. </sentence><sentence id="1866">The employee came to deliver the telegram himself and he said that the minister was very satisfied with the telegram and so forth. </sentence><sentence id="1867">And then one time something happened which is a little bit funny but at the same time it uh it's...I don't want to say fear but it gave me, made me a little bit anxious. </sentence><sentence id="1868">I went to the Foreign Affairs Ministry. </sentence><sentence id="1869">This was at the end of December. </sentence><sentence id="1870">I think before Christmas I went to the Foreign Affairs Ministry and I entered the antechamber where the secre...permanent secretary had his office. </sentence><sentence id="1871">He was like a Vice Minister with whom I'd had contact. </sentence><sentence id="1872">His name was F and I saw that there were two men seated on a couch who were waiting and one of them I, I recognized. </sentence><sentence id="1873">He was the Chancellor of the Italian Legation, the Royal Italian Legation, and the other gentleman I didn't know who he was, so I very boldly...I had to very boldly salute them like this and instead of going to the secretary who sort of looked at me with surprise, I went to to the door. </sentence><sentence id="1874">I pretended to knock. </sentence><sentence id="1875">I went inside and to see this Vice Minister. </sentence><sentence id="1876">I did what I had to do and after four...after fifteen minutes or so I left. </sentence><sentence id="1877">I said goodbye to the young lady and I made a, a vague signal with my hand like this and I left. </sentence><sentence id="1878">But once I arrived in the in the hallway I really came back and I started to eaves...eavesdrop and I heard that these two people entered the office and entered the Vice Minister's office so I entered the area too, and I asked Mrs...the young lady...and I said, oh I think I recognize these two men and she said the big man is Minister Gratanzi (ph) of the Social Republic of Italy and the other is his secretary. </sentence><sentence id="1879">He was the he was a fascist minister, the Social Republic...the Fascist Social Republic. </sentence><sentence id="1880">On the 16th...in the meantime between the...on the 13th it wasn't possible to leave the Legation anymore. </sentence><sentence id="1881">We still had telephone communications with which I could control or check on the various houses, not directly because there were no phones in the houses but there were Christians who lived uh in front of the houses or next to them, the houses, and they had agreed to telephone to us if there was danger and for example with Eva Long (ph) on the evening of January 3rd or 4th or Sth or whatever it was. </sentence><sentence id="1882">I think she told me even...I think she even told me...anyway they, they remember more than I do. </sentence><sentence id="1883">She called me and I went over there at three in the morning. </sentence><sentence id="1884">Anyhow... There wasn't...no...it wasn't just that time. </sentence><sentence id="1885">That happened many times, ten or fifteen times. </sentence><sentence id="1886">Almost every evening I had to get up and go because the Nazis wanted to come and take them away, to take the Jews away from the houses. ... </sentence><sentence id="1887">speaking. </sentence><sentence id="1888">I told them that we had agreements with the Hungarian government and so forth and so on and in the meantime somebody well from my entourage...I always had an entourage. </sentence><sentence id="1889">I always had four police officers and two employees of the security office and in reality I always traveled with two people but...two policemen and two public security people, and they never wanted to leave my side and when I left there were two policemen who left and the Legation too...I...I felt like I was a medieval cavalier with the flag and the banner whenever I traveled with them. </sentence><sentence id="1890">But anyway this normally happened at night and I would go on foot because it was dangerous to go by car at night. </sentence><sentence id="1891">There weren't very many lights. </sentence><sentence id="1892">But anyhow that night, that last night that I went to Eva Long in let's say Eva Long's house...I didn't know Eva Long at the time. </sentence><sentence id="1893">I met her only three years ago. </sentence><sentence id="1894">I...I arrived five minutes after a man had thrown himself out of the window from the fifth floor and you asked me how I, how could I prevent them from taking them away and I would tell them that we had agreements and then at the same time one of my escorts would go to a telephone and telephone the police commando and the Colonel would intervene. </sentence><sentence id="1895">This is someone who had helped me, because I had contacts with everyone, with Nazis, non-Nazis. </sentence><sentence id="1896">It doesn't matter that he was a Nazi who...he was a Nazi but he was useful so I had contacts with him and there was a Hungarian Nazi, a young guy with a beard. </sentence><sentence id="1897">If] asked him for something, he would do it for me. </sentence><sentence id="1898">You understand. </sentence><sentence id="1899">Now I had contacts with him. </sentence><sentence id="1900">I had contacts with everyone. </sentence><sentence id="1901">Whoever happened to be there, I had contacts with because that's how you had to operate. </sentence><sentence id="1902">Experience taught me that everyone can be useful. </sentence><sentence id="1903">There's some who do big favors and some who do smaller favors. </sentence><sentence id="1904">Some could intervene for this and some could intervene for that reason. </sentence><sentence id="1905">The Foreign Affairs Minister could intervene for that and the Interior Minister could intervene for this and the Nazi Party for another reason and so the last three days I couldn't leave because on the street where the Legation was...at the very end of the street...the street was three hundred meters long, there was a Russian tank with the mouth of the cannon facing the street which would shoot any time it saw a person and so who dared to leave and go on the street. </sentence><sentence id="1906">In order to cross the street from the Legation to the ___ Paraguayan Legation which was...you had to open the door and dash, make a dash to get to the other side. </sentence><sentence id="1907">And as soon as you did the, the tank would shoot and so you couldn't leave, but I was in telephone contact with the houses because as I said there were always Christian friends who had telephones in nearing the houses who were called. </sentence><sentence id="1908">They saw something abnormal. </sentence><sentence id="1909">For example, that night they called...1 don't know who they called. </sentence><sentence id="1910">After half an hour I arrived and I saw that they were about to take them away. </sentence><sentence id="1911">I stopped everything but unfortunately I arrived five minutes after a man threw himself out of a window on the fifth floor. </sentence><sentence id="1912">I thought it was a woman, but Eva Long told me that it was a man. </sentence><sentence id="1913">When I arrived they had already covered the body. </sentence><sentence id="1914">The police had covered the body. </sentence><sentence id="1915">And I thought it was a woman but in...it was aman. </sentence><sentence id="1916">And so on the 16th uh you arrived in my area, on my street and until the afternoon, in the afternoon, up until the afternoon they had respected extra-territory . </sentence><sentence id="1917">We took the flag down. </sentence><sentence id="1918">We put the Swedish flag up. </sentence><sentence id="1919">We took the emblem, the Spanish emblem down and put the Swedish emblem because Sweden was supposed to protect Spain's interests. </sentence><sentence id="1920">No...because that's the way it's done. </sentence><sentence id="1921">When one nation cannot have relations with another nation, another nation which can have relations, it can intervene to protect the interests and in fact I think that Sweden was able to...after ten or twelve days of the Russian's arrival, to...was able to empty the building, the Spanish building. </sentence><sentence id="1922">Of that I'm not really sure because I was in hiding. </sentence><sentence id="1923">I couldn't do anything more. </sentence><sentence id="1924">As I was telling you about Wallenberg, on the morning of the 18th, the Russians took me and they put me to sweep the streets. </sentence><sentence id="1925">Street...I had to sweep Street. </sentence><sentence id="1926">At a certain point I saw in front of a building a man whose name was who, who had been my chauffeur and who had been wounded driving my car. </sentence><sentence id="1927">I wasn't there at the time. </sentence><sentence id="1928">Uh my...in my position where I was seated uh there was a policeman who was killed. </sentence><sentence id="1929">He...and then the car was taken away and then the car was found again a few hours later but it was destroyed. </sentence><sentence id="1930">This man has been my chauffeur to do me a favor and at the same time had, he had also, he had had ties with the International Red Cross because the delegate of the International Red Cross never showed his face. </sentence><sentence id="1931">The human miseries. </sentence><sentence id="1932">So I asked him, did you see Wallenberg. </sentence><sentence id="1933">He said yes. </sentence><sentence id="1934">He's here. </sentence><sentence id="1935">Please, go, go fetch him. </sentence><sentence id="1936">I can't move because there's this guy here with a machine gun, the GBU guy who, who is forcing me to sweep the street. </sentence><sentence id="1937">After fifteen minutes or ten minutes though he came back. </sentence><sentence id="1938">He say no, he's gone. </sentence><sentence id="1939">He left a few minutes ago, and this is about eleven in the morning, but from then on nothing more was heard about Wallenberg, so I, therefore I think that he died or because he was hit by a sniper or because he was hit by a German grenade. </sentence><sentence id="1940">Uh they resisted until the mid(c)February in the castle of Buda (ph), in the hills of Buda, I think, or perhaps he met a group of Nazis, Hungarians, Nazis, who recognized him and who killed him on the spot. </sentence><sentence id="1941">There were hundreds and hundreds of bodies buried in the snow in the area of the Spanish Legation, Mussolini Square. </sentence><sentence id="1942">I think that he wanted to cross Street to go to the international ghetto, I think. </sentence><sentence id="1943">Or anyhow such...this...a similar declaration was...I made a similar declaration in 1962 I think after a request that was made to me by the Swedish Consulate in Milan. </sentence><sentence id="1944">Last year Danielson's widow invited me to her house in the province of Trento (ph). </sentence><sentence id="1945">I was at and when we talked about this issue, she told me that her husband and the Foreign Affairs Minister never believed that Wallenberg was taken to the Soviet Union, Russia. </sentence><sentence id="1946">Anyhow, some people were interested in blowing up the issue in good faith but then others kept saying things that were not true. </sentence><sentence id="1947">As far as I was concerned that's what happened. </sentence><sentence id="1948">I may be wrong but that's how it was for me. </sentence><sentence id="1949">That's what I believe. </sentence><sentence id="1950">I remained three or four months until April, May...five months in Budapest and then the Russians uh kicked every...all the foreign citizens out. </sentence><sentence id="1951">I was trying to get back home but they could have sent us Italians home with the trains and in ten or twelve hours we would have been to Capezio (ph) or to or to the other place, what's it called... . </sentence><sentence id="1952">Instead they sent us via Bucha , Istanbul and it took ten days of travel in latched up cars and with a hunger that I don't want to speak about because we didn't even have any money. </sentence><sentence id="1953">There was nothing left. </sentence><sentence id="1954">I didn't have anything. </sentence><sentence id="1955">I had only... everything...I had only what I was wearing the day that the Russians arrived. </sentence><sentence id="1956">Everything had been burnt at the Legation. </sentence><sentence id="1957">No...yes...at the villa of the Spanish Legation in Budapest, at Buda, and everything else was stolen by the Russians. </sentence><sentence id="1958">I didn't even have a shaver to shave. </sentence><sentence id="1959">In those days they had...I had a Gillette shaver. </sentence><sentence id="1960">Uh we...when we arrived...when I arrived in Istanbul, I found the...someone who had the suitcase that once...a suitcase that once had belonged to me and which had also my shaving kit and I said to him I need my shaving kit. </sentence><sentence id="1961">Luckily this person had an extra shaving kit. </sentence><sentence id="1962">TECHNICAL CONVERSATION End of Tape #2    Tape #3 TECHNICAL CONVERSATION ...When I returned to Italy I found that my company had fired me and, and it was an ugly period and I had to even pay for the car that I had borrowed from an Italian and the car was then burnt and I had to pay for that car with my money, but anyway it was a bad period, but anyway I managed. </sentence><sentence id="1963">It's difficult when you're forty to change jobs and in a bad situation as it was in Italy at the time, the War of the Mosques (ph) and so forth. </sentence><sentence id="1964">It's hard to adapt and I once again went to start afresh and to find work. </sentence><sentence id="1965">I, I adapted. </sentence><sentence id="1966">Uh I had to...in order to put bread on the table, and sometimes I wasn't able to do that perfectly but after ten years I was successful. </sentence><sentence id="1967">My son was born and we'll _ for all the sacrifices. </sentence><sentence id="1968">I was able to raise him and to settle, settle him and now I consider that I'm uh I'm all settled. </sentence><sentence id="1969">I can't say that I am uh I'm rich, but I live, live. </sentence><sentence id="1970">I live and I'm happy this way. </sentence><sentence id="1971">Especially because all of those people who had been helped by me uh looked for me and they celebrated me. </sentence><sentence id="1972">They made me come to Washington. </sentence><sentence id="1973">You're welcomed. </sentence><sentence id="1974">If in the future, if you need any explanations on anything, we can correspond, but you must write in Italian. . </sentence><sentence id="1975">Idon't know what happened. </sentence><sentence id="1976">There's a lady here, Magadelena (ph), who knew him well. </sentence><sentence id="1977">She asked me the same thing. </sentence><sentence id="1978">What happened? </sentence><sentence id="1979">And I say at the end of November, I believe, before Sanspritz left, he disappeared. </sentence><sentence id="1980">Since he was trying to get to home in Spain, perhaps he was able with the passport that he had, perhaps he was able to go to Spain. </sentence><sentence id="1981">It was difficult because he was a deserter of the Blue Division of Spain which was fighting with the Germans. </sentence><sentence id="1982">He had fought in these Divisions next to, with the Germans. </sentence><sentence id="1983">I don't...I can't...I've tried to find out because he was a very nice guy. </sentence><sentence id="1984">He was young. </sentence><sentence id="1985">He was probably twenty-two, maybe twenty-three. </sentence><sentence id="1986">He was a very nice guy. </sentence><sentence id="1987">He was very helpful. </sentence><sentence id="1988">He, he gave me a hand in...several times for something. </sentence><sentence id="1989">I remember that he came with, he accompanied me. </sentence><sentence id="1990">But at the end of November he disappeared and that day we didn't see him
