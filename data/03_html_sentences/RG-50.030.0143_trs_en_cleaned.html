<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="96">A: Well, I'll tell you very quickly what it is. </sentence><sentence id="97">From 1933, September 1933 when I landed here, from practically 1939 I was a student at Columbia University where I earned my masters and ph.d degrees, while also working as a research associate at the Institute of Social Research with all the principals of the so called Frankfort School of Sociology, Social Science, including Max , Herbert F , Henry Grossman, Franz Nuemen, and a number of other people, but the principals were actually, the principal figures were and Fran. </sentence><sentence id="98">Fran not so much among the principals but the first three were. </sentence><sentence id="99">I was a research assistant there, very happy there because this was an intellectual hothouse . </sentence><sentence id="100">It was at the time when the luminaries of the American Academy were still at Columbia. </sentence><sentence id="101">I still knew and learned a great deal and admired a great deal John Dewy. </sentence><sentence id="102">For my money still America's philosopher. </sentence><sentence id="103">The American philosopher, most represented American philosopher. </sentence><sentence id="104">And the other luminaries would be very much true of this generation of Americans any more, perhaps they do, but I don't think I need mention them here.

learned subjects. </sentence><sentence id="112">From 1944 to 1943 I was propaganda analyst for the United States Office of War Information in New York. </sentence><sentence id="113">From D-Day until after VJ Day I was propaganda analyst for the Office of War Information, American Embassy in London, England, but more especially attached with a small group of American officers to the hush-hush BBC monitoring service located at near Reading with a special duty of writing the so-called report about what the German people were allowed to read and hear by the government of what was going on in Germany and in the theaters of war for the commanders in the field, that is the report had to be written for the commanders in the field and the policy makers in New York and Washington. </sentence><sentence id="114">Let me say for one thing before I come to VJ day. </sentence><sentence id="115">For all that we won, and we too, that is the secret weapons that the Nazis unleased onto the British Isles, the heightened sense and enhanced sense of living I have never experienced before or after. </sentence><sentence id="116">As I think about it as I try to recollect the war time days, my war time days in Britain were among the happiest of my life. </sentence><sentence id="117">I made also on my days off, good friendships in Oxford in Cambridge and found very much to be at home in the cloistered world of the academy. </sentence><sentence id="118">I never considered any other institution as free and so much a home as the academy itself. </sentence><sentence id="119">That's why I spent my life eventually as an academic at the University after the war and after the trials in Nuremberg. </sentence><sentence id="120">I was determined though all along and I so wrote to my wife in the hundreds of letters which she all saved, hundreds of letters which she all saved from England during the war, even before it was sure, that is in the middle-- let's see D-Day was in "44. </sentence><sentence id="121">In "44 I wrote I'm thinking about what we have to do the day the war ends. </sentence><sentence id="122">I'm determined in having a hand in the rebuilding of Germany and in the punishing of the war criminals but in salvaging the best of Germany and in building of the foundations of a just and lasting peace. </sentence><sentence id="123">I'm interested in spite of what I've learned about Maidonek and the extermination camps, in spite of it and because of it I'm determined to see that the criminals are punished, that justice is meeted out not at the price of sacrificing millions of innocent women and children. </sentence><sentence id="124">Precisely because I remember what was done and what feelings dominate those who have suffered under Nazi terror. </sentence><sentence id="125">I wanted to save then and I want to save the world from any boomerang effects of a wrong policy of treating wrongly the defeated enemy. </sentence><sentence id="126">But I said to my wife, we have to remember that for our own sake, if not for Germany's sake we must lay the foundation for just and proper forms of democratic life so that the Germans become an essential constituent of a sound economy and a sound Europe at least in the west. </sentence><sentence id="127">Now, I hope you'll share my opinion, I said to my wife. </sentence><sentence id="128">My wife wrote me even more than several hundred letters. </sentence><sentence id="129">She wrote me every day. </sentence><sentence id="130">I couldn't write every day, so she probably wrote a hundred more letters than I did myself. </sentence><sentence id="131">I wanted to know all about our baby. </sentence><sentence id="132">I wanted to know all about herself, and I wanted to reassure her that I would do nothing without her approval, because it's a joint life that we have to live for whatever life will be granted to us. </sentence></p></dialogue>
