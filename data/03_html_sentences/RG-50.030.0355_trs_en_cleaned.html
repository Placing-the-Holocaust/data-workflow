she suffered also. </sentence><sentence id="736">He was only one month and she suffered and when I was so long time, but maybe we should go with my story further. </sentence><sentence id="737">I was brought to this round prison. </sentence><sentence id="738">I was put in the cell with six or seven crime prisoners usually. </sentence><sentence id="739">When they heard because each prisoner had

I cried. </sentence><sentence id="762">But later I had to go -- I was sent to Koronovo. </sentence><sentence id="763">was not far from maybe 50 or 60 kilometers. </sentence><sentence id="764">It was the worst prison in Poland before the war and during the war. </sentence><sentence id="765">Only for Polish and Jewish prisoners. </sentence><sentence id="766">I will never forget they cut my hair because in Torran I still had my own hair. </sentence><sentence id="767">They gave me with some maybe yellow -- I don't know, it was here on the arm, and I was sent to the cellar with about 40 prisoners. </sentence><sentence id="768">There were maybe about five or six Jews together with me and it was terrible. </sentence><sentence id="769">My memories, especially in this cellar because the oldest of this cell it was a prisoner for a long life, murder and there was a clan. </sentence><sentence id="770">Around him he had a few prisoners. </sentence><sentence id="771">They made everything for him what he liked. </sentence><sentence id="772">We had nothing to say. </sentence><sentence id="773">We had to be polite what he -- even with the toilet. </sentence><sentence id="774">The toilet was only morning and then the food, when they delivered the food it was very small, but even if we received one spoon of marmalade, he took from us. </sentence><sentence id="775">We were given a little margarine, once or twice per week, he took also. </sentence><sentence id="776">So, that this time this is my worst time in my life. </sentence><sentence id="777">And then my leg began to be I have received a kind of I  http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection cannot explain in English. </sentence><sentence id="778">Due to the reason I had no vitamins. </sentence><sentence id="779">It was like it was spoiled this leg. </sentence><sentence id="780">It started from a small wound. </sentence><sentence id="781">This was this leg. </sentence><sentence id="782">From this to this here, this place. </sentence><sentence id="783">Nothing, in those terrible times but of course everywhere is bad times and after bad will come a little better. </sentence><sentence id="784">Even there, there was so that because our work we were living, we were working in the same cell. </sentence><sentence id="785">There was very stupid work but very dangerous, very dusty. </sentence><sentence id="786">We had to the ropes, we could resolve the ropes then we had to make the leather for the new shoes for the front they were sent. </sentence><sentence id="787">This was the job and once they looked they wanted one . </sentence><sentence id="788">Oh, I have to explain also here that here we could write the letters once every two or three months home in German language. </sentence><sentence id="789">Everybody doesn't write German. </sentence><sentence id="790">Me and especially my good friend, it was the Applebaum, exactly I remember, he wrote also German. </sentence><sentence id="791">Some of them gave us one potato or two potatoes for the writing. </sentence><sentence id="792">At the first moment I didn't want to take but Applebaum said yes take it. </sentence><sentence id="793">It is for them also very helpful when they have the contact with the parents or with family your letters. </sentence><sentence id="794">And so we cooperated very good in this way and once happen that block meister came to our cell and asked the oldest men for somebody who can write and speak German. </sentence><sentence id="795">First he send someone from his clan but after a few minutes he came back and he said no. </sentence><sentence id="796">Exactly he said . </sentence><sentence id="797">Then when he came one more, "You have nobody here? </sentence><sentence id="798">Among 40 men you have nobody. </sentence><sentence id="799">I need a writer. </sentence><sentence id="800">I was standing and I said -- usually I couldn't do that and I think maybe I will be able for him. </sentence><sentence id="801">I said "Her block meister, I can speak German and I write German too." </sentence><sentence id="802">He was wondering I was so slim and young, where I could speak English. </sentence><sentence id="803">And he took me to his room. </sentence><sentence id="804">He gave me paper pencil and dictated. </sentence><sentence id="805">He dictated in German. </sentence><sentence id="806">I remember it was an office, exactly as you like I can do this in German, . </sentence><sentence id="807">He looked at this, yes, good. </sentence><sentence id="808">Go there. </sentence><sentence id="809">Take your clothes and    you'll come here. </sentence><sentence id="810">I went to the cell and I remember everybody especially those of the clan but my friends, they said, really, he agree. </sentence><sentence id="811">You are able to take -- he takes you? </sentence><sentence id="812">Oh that's very good. </sentence><sentence id="813">Go boy, with his hand and with this you are also good that God helps you. </sentence><sentence id="814">When I went there it was a three men cell, much better, near the kitchen. </sentence><sentence id="815">Sometimes when I had a little more -- I received sometimes cigarettes. </sentence><sentence id="816">Cigarettes were very good like money for exchange. </sentence><sentence id="817">Because I didn't smoke -- I never smoked, I could make the exchange for the prisoners in the kitchen for cigarette I received some bread. </sentence><sentence id="818">Then I had the permit to go to other places. </sentence><sentence id="819">I belonged to the high society of this prison. </sentence><sentence id="820">I received better uniform, prison uniform, better warmer. </sentence><sentence id="821">Even the hair was a little longer than usual. </sentence><sentence id="822">As the flour sometime one had no water and me I was -- but I never forget about my friend Applebaum. </sentence><sentence id="823">I went and took with me some bread some food and I went to the cell and I wanted to give him this. </sentence><sentence id="824">Then I remember, I don't know exactly the name of him, he said since few days there's no more Applebaum. </sentence><sentence id="825">He patted -- he was in so high depression. </sentence><sentence id="826">He was ill. </sentence><sentence id="827">He had diarrhea and it was very, very dangerous. </sentence><sentence id="828">You know if somebody had this they couldn't stop and suffered. </sentence><sentence id="829">I suppose he thought that this is the end and he made this. </sentence><sentence id="830">Of course I left his bread there. </sentence><sentence id="831">I came -- and that was not all because every week from Koronovo where the transport station to Sauxenhausen. </sentence><sentence id="832">So always thinking about it was one day I will also be sent there.
