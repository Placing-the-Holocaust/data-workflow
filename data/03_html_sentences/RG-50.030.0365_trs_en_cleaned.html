<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="6">A: Good morning, Joan. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="8">Q: Can you tell us your name and the name that you were born with, because I know it is different than your name now, and when you were born and where? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="10">A: I was born September 17, 1916, in Hannover, Germany. </sentence><sentence id="11">My name at that time was Bernard Fuchs, and I was born and raised in Hannover; and until 1936, I went through the schools and read the Nuremberg law, and it became too hard for us. </sentence><sentence id="12">I had to leave the university because no Jews could study further. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="16">Q: Let's go back a little bit. </sentence><sentence id="17">Tell me about your family -- about your mother and your father and sister. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="20">A: My father and mother both came from Ledz. </sentence><sentence id="21">They had left Poland around when the war broke out, 1914 -- no before that -- 1913, they went to Elsass-Lothringen, which is part of France now and was at that time also. </sentence><sentence id="22">And there they lived until 1915 when they went to live in Germany. </sentence><sentence id="23">Father was a custom tailor, and he built up his own studio and built up a wonderful clientele. </sentence><sentence id="24">He was really the number-one custom tailor in Hannover. </sentence><sentence id="25">And my mother, may she rest in peace, died very young. </sentence><sentence id="26">She died already 1928, when I was 12 years old and is buried in Hannover. </sentence><sentence id="27">My father remarried in 1932 and had another son in 1933 and -- when I had to leave the university, I went on hash'alah" to be processed to go at that time Palestine. </sentence><sentence id="28">But my father got sick. </sentence><sentence id="29">He had a very serious operation, and he asked me to stay back and take care of his wife and son. </sentence><sentence id="30">So, this way, that is why I did not go to Palestine at that time. </sentence><sentence id="31">Then in 1938, there was a big Aktion" by the Germans where they took all foreigners, that means stateless or not, of German nationality -- Jews -- and collected them all in a concert hall in Hannover, and -- where we stayed for a day and a night. </sentence><sentence id="32">And then they took us in cattle trains to the Polish border. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="46">Q: I'd like to go back. </sentence><sentence id="47">It must have been very difficult when your mother passed away at such a young age for you? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="50">A: Yes. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="52">Q: And when your father remarried, I gather you didn't stay at home after that happened? </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="53">A: No, I left home. </sentence><sentence id="54">And -- I could not stay at that time. </sentence><sentence id="55">I just couldn't live with her. </sentence><sentence id="56">It became impossible. </sentence><sentence id="57">So, I had left when I was 14. </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="58">Q: And you lived alone? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="60">A: I lived alone, yes. </sentence><sentence id="61">I lived with friends, with their parents. </sentence><sentence id="62">I rented a room there. </sentence><sentence id="63">And I earned money, and at that time I paid the rent there and lived until the Aktion started. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="68">Q: But you remained close with your father and sister? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="70">A: Well, I had to, yes. </sentence><sentence id="71">My sister got engaged to be married with a -- not a Jewish man -- but we liked him. </sentence><sentence id="72">He was a very nice man. </sentence><sentence id="73">He was a dress manufacturer, special designed dresses. </sentence><sentence id="74">And so how far back do you want me to go now? </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="75">A: You can certainly talk about this, sure. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="77">Q: And when the Aktion started, as I mentioned, we were sent to Poland, and when we came to the Polish border, on one side we had the SS with the bayonets pointed at us, and on the other side we had the Polish with bayonets pointed at us, and we were in no-man's land for 48 hours before some intervention the Poles opened the border and let us into a very small village. </sentence><sentence id="78">The name is Zbaszyn. </sentence><sentence id="79">There -- I was always an organizer -- so when we went there, there was no housing because it was a small village and here we were about 2,000 people. </sentence><sentence id="80">So we organized. </sentence><sentence id="81">I took a few young people and we put handkerchiefs around our arms, our sleeves, and then we went and cleaned out pig sties where the cattle was and also some housing which were empty. </sentence><sentence id="82">So, there we took care of the old people and the sick people and the children; some children were born right there. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="89">And we were in Zbaszyn until six weeks before the war broke out. </sentence><sentence id="90">In the meantime, a lot of people who had family in Poland were released and they went to their people, and so my father also went back to Lodz because he had two brothers living there with their families and I stayed until the last 100 were liquidated in Zbaszyn because it was just about six weeks before the war started. </sentence><sentence id="91">Then I went to Krakow with -- myself with some people that I had befriended and then later to Czestochowa. </sentence><sentence id="92">In Czestochowa, I stayed until I think it was September 1940. </sentence><sentence id="93">The ghetto in Lodz had already been closed the first of May. </sentence><sentence id="94">So, one evening a car came with a man named David Gertler, and he came in where I lived in Czestochowa, because I had corresponded with my sister in Lodz, so she knows where I was. </sentence><sentence id="95">And she had sent this man with an SS man in a private car to pick me up in Czestochowa and took me into the ghetto to be reunited with my sister and father. </sentence><sentence id="96"> I was not too long in the ghetto, just a few days, when I got a call from Rumkowski," an Elder of the Jews, for a long interview. </sentence><sentence id="97">And there he said, "I want you to take over the labor department because we have to register every Jew, every child in the ghetto because we have to give them work." </sentence><sentence id="98">For work we will get bread and we can live. </sentence><sentence id="99">So we registered -- </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="111">Q: Let me ask you something. </sentence><sentence id="112">You're how old at this time? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="115">A: At that time I was 24 years old. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="117">Q: What was your sister -- your sister's name is? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="119">A: Dora. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="121">Q: What was she doing? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="123">A: She was the executive secretary of the Rumkowski. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="125">Q: Did you know this when you were writing to her? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="127">A: No. </sentence><sentence id="128">I knew it only when I came to the ghetto. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="131">Q: Was it surprising to you that she sent an SS man to get you? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="133">A: Yes, only then I realized why she could have done it because of her position. </sentence><sentence id="134">She was able to do that. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="137">Q: Did it worry you when these people came to the door? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="139">A: At first, yes, at first. </sentence><sentence id="140">But immediately when he told me who he is and what he came for, naturally I was relieved, and naturally I went with them to be reunited with my family. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="143">Q: When you saw your family at first, did your sister explain to you about Rumkowski and tell you things about him so that when you met him you had some idea? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="145">A: No, she just told me of what is going on and what has to be done because Rumkowski was in a position to deal with the Ghettoverwaltung,* to tell them you give us material. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="146">We will manufacture it and in turn you give us food and whatever we need. </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="147">Q: Let me ask you something in terms of reflecting back a little bit. </sentence><sentence id="148">When you were in Hannover and the Nazis took over, you were in some sense fighting the Nazis, right? </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="149">A: Yes. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="151">Q: You remember the Maccabees? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="153">A: Correct. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="155">Q: Can you explain what that organization was? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="157">A: It was an underground organization of students who, like me, had to leave the universities, and we decided to make sabotage. </sentence><sentence id="158">We became, like in other words, terrorists and we got hold of explosives and we broke up -- we bombed their trains, any transport of the SS people and stuff like this. </sentence><sentence id="159">So, we really gave them a hard time. </sentence><sentence id="160">And in 1936, I was arrested for the first time by the Gestapo for three weeks, interrogated every day, the same questions asked, but they could not have any proof or couldn't tell anything of what I had done, so they had to let me go. </sentence><sentence id="161">That was in 1936. </sentence><sentence id="162">Then in "38, I mentioned to you already, I was sent to Zbaszyn in Poland. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="169">Q: So, when you got to Lodz, what did you think the Germans were doing in the course of the war to these Jews, since you had already experienced the Nuremberg laws and kicked out of the university, and at least some violence against the Jews? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="171">A: Absolutely, yes. </sentence><sentence id="172">When I came to the ghetto, and I was told and I saw with my own eyes, of how the people have to live in the ghetto, and naturally I was right up in arms. </sentence><sentence id="173">I could not digest it that easily. </sentence><sentence id="174">And when the Elders of the Jews called on me to head the department, and naturally I was pleased that I got to do something productive for the ghetto, even though people today have said I worked with the Germans and helped them, which is naturally it's nonsense because if we would not have done what we did in the ghetto, in 1942, that ghetto would have been liquidated completely and no one would have survived. </sentence><sentence id="175">And thanks to Rumkowski, and thanks to his negotiation power he was able to convince the Germans, and actually the Lodz ghetto became a model for all the ghettos in the other areas. </sentence><sentence id="176">So, three days and three nights we registered all the people. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="183">Q: How did you do that? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="185">A: Well, I got a staff and I got an office and people came day and night. </sentence><sentence id="186">There were hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of people, and we were able to do it in three days and three nights and everybody who registered also got where to go, to what factory. </sentence><sentence id="187">So we delegated people directly into the various factories. </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="188">Q: So, Rumkowski sees you and tells you to head -- did you head this department by yourself at that point? </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="189">A: At that point, yes, I organized it myself. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="191">Q: So, how long did it take you to figure out this organization after he had spoken to you? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="193">A: Well, I was given people to interview and I interviewed the people and whomever felt they could do the job I would tell them, yes, they were hired. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="195">Q: So how many people were on your staff at that point? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="197">A: At that time I couldn't tell you exactly. </sentence><sentence id="198">It was over 20. </sentence><sentence id="199">Between 20 and 30 people. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="203">Q: Now, when you registered, did you have cards printed out so you could register people? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="205">A: Yes, we had books and later on we made big index cards. </sentence><sentence id="206">But people themselves, they got a piece of paper with where to go, where to report to, to what factory, and with this they were given i.d. </sentence><sentence id="207">cards and cards to be able to get food, like food stamps, coupons for food. </sentence><sentence id="208">And this entitled them to a soup. </sentence><sentence id="209">There were various soups around the ghetto where the people who worked the factories were able to get a soup. </sentence><sentence id="210">Some a little bit heavier, some a little bit lighter soups, as you can imagine. </sentence><sentence id="211">And as the time passed, I had, for instance, I took a very sick-looking person out of a factory and delegated him to a kitchen while I took a healthy- looking guy from the kitchen and put him into the factory. </sentence><sentence id="212">So, with one signature of mine I made a friend and an enemy, which you can understand. </sentence><sentence id="213">The ones who worked in the kitchen, they were sitting. </sentence><sentence id="214">They got a little bit more to eat than the others. </sentence><sentence id="215">So, this went on, then, until 1944 -- </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="227">Q: Now you're moving too fast. </sentence><sentence id="228">When you're registering people, there are clearly some elderly people and there are kids who probably can't work. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="231">A: They still got cards. </sentence><sentence id="232">They still were registered. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="235">Q: And did they go with family members to certain factories or would they stay in an apartment? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="237">A: They would register but they would not actually work because they couldn't work. </sentence><sentence id="238">They were unable to work, but if we would have left them without registration, without i.d.cards, they would die for hunger because they wouldn't get any rations. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="242">Q: So, everybody is registered whether they are really working or not. </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="243">A: Yes, everybody had to be registered. </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="244">Q: And when you came into the ghetto and you're registering there are almost 200,000 people, right? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="246">A: Yes. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="248">Q: What is happening with housing at this point? </sentence><sentence id="249">When you came in was everybody living where they're supposed to be living or are they moving around? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="252">A: Well, they had since the ghetto was closed the first of May. </sentence><sentence id="253">Naturally, all these people coming from the other side of the town into the ghetto had to be housed. </sentence><sentence id="254">So, naturally, there wasn't enough housing available for every family. </sentence><sentence id="255">So you found in most cases that in one room lived four families. </sentence><sentence id="256">In every corner a different family, OK, and the conditions naturally were unbearable to live, really, because there was no running water. </sentence><sentence id="257">There were no toilets in the room. </sentence><sentence id="258">People didn't have bathrooms. </sentence><sentence id="259">They would have to go to outhouses. </sentence><sentence id="260">And they would have to go and pump the water from a pump and bring it up into the room. </sentence><sentence id="261">So, the conditions naturally as you can imagine was anything but human. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="272">Q: And were there a number of pumps in different parts of the ghetto? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="274">A: No, mostly in every house they had some water supply, but it was like I said: no bathroom and not every house had running water. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="276">Q: Were you living with your father and your sister? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="278">A: Yes, in the beginning. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="280">Q: I gather that your father's second wife and child had left? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="282">A: No, she had left in 1939 to England. </sentence><sentence id="283">She was a nurse by profession and she got a job in England as a nurse, so she took off with her son and went to England. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="286">Q: And had your father wanted to go and they didn't allow him to, or you don't know? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="288">A: She didn't get any papers for him. </sentence><sentence id="289">She got papers just for herself and her son, and father was very active in the ghetto also being a custom tailor. </sentence><sentence id="290">He was always working and had also quite a few tailors working together and they made for these people, even for the people in the ghetto. </sentence><sentence id="291">He had to make their suits for them, right. </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="292">Q: Once this big registration happened, with all these people, and all of the people are going to their particular factories or work places, what is then your job? </sentence><sentence id="293">What are your responsibilities once that happened? </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="294">A: Well -- </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="296">Q: What would be a day? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="298">A: They were always going movements on. </sentence><sentence id="299">People had died from hunger. </sentence><sentence id="300">They had to be replaced. </sentence><sentence id="301">OK, so, there was always a lot of switching of personnel because you can imagine so many people and so many various factories, so there was always something going on where the department of labor had to act accordingly, right. </sentence><sentence id="302">So, there was always something going on that kept us busy. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="308">Q: Were you meeting with Rumkowski regularly? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="310">A: Not regularly but often. </sentence><sentence id="311">He came to my office or I was called upon for meetings. </sentence><sentence id="312">And -- oh, yes, frequently I saw Rumkowski, yes. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="316">Q: What was your relationship like? </sentence><sentence id="317">What kinds of things would you discuss? </sentence><sentence id="318">Would it only be business or were you also discussing the situation? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="322">A: Well, if we were socially somewhere together, then yes, I would talk with him a little bit about various subjects and incidents which occurred which I wanted to know more details about. </sentence><sentence id="323">And also, about my background, what he wanted to know. </sentence><sentence id="324">But otherwise, he was very busy and there wasn't much time for socializing, except when we had concerts. </sentence><sentence id="325">We had our own orchestra, and so it was really a city by itself in itself. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="330">Q: Was this a hard job for you? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="332">A: It was not an easy job, and especially when the Aktion took place when they asked for 800 people or 1,000 people or 2,000 people to be sent out allegedly to other working camps. </sentence><sentence id="333">I had no dealings with this because I left this to my partner, to Czenszenski. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="336">Q: When did he come in? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="338">A: He came in about a year after I had the office organized, and then later on when we got a transport from Czechoslovakia there was also a gentleman who was told by the Eldest of the Jews, by Rumkowski, to work with me in the department of labor, especially for the Czech people. </sentence><sentence id="339">So, we had actually three at that time heading the department. </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="340">Q: And who was the third? </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="341">A: Anders was his name. </sentence><sentence id="342">He came from Prague. </sentence><sentence id="343">Terrific elements in that transport. </sentence><sentence id="344">Professionals, very intelligent people but unfortunately they died like flies. </sentence><sentence id="345">They could not adjust themselves to the conditions of the ghetto. </sentence><sentence id="346">When they came into the station in Marysin, where we had our railroad station, they asked, "Where we can get a taxi? </sentence><sentence id="347">Is there a hotel?" </sentence><sentence id="348">As funny as it seems, but at that time, the tears came into my eyes when I saw these people and unfortunately we lost so many of them at that time very fast. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="357">Q: Now, you said that when -- the department of labor was somehow involved in the deportations? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="359">A: Well, naturally they were asked by Rumkowski to select certain people at random to be sent. </sentence><sentence id="360">The first transport for instance were the three Fsdeg in German: Fleisher," Fuhrmann"...what was the third F? </sentence><sentence id="361">I don't even remember the third. </sentence><sentence id="362">Well, in any case these three groups, from three groups the transports, the first transports went to a labor camp and a lot of them survived, thank heaven, because they really went to working camps because Auschwitz came later on and naturally we didn't know that. </sentence><sentence id="363">We had no dealings with the outside world and there was no communication with the outside world...and the Ledz ghetto. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="369">Q: There was no underground radio? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="371">A: Yes, underground radio, I myself with a friend of mine, Dr. Smulovitez, we had a radio. </sentence><sentence id="372">We listened to the radio at nighttime and we lost a very important person because of that -- Doctor...Irene, she would remember the name. </sentence><sentence id="373">He was shot because he listened to the radio. </sentence><sentence id="374">He was caught listening to the radio. </sentence><sentence id="375">That was a very dangerous thing to do but we did it. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="381">Q: What did you learn when you were listening to the radio? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="383">A: We learned about the war what was going on but naturally of what happened with us we did not being informed through the radio, we didn't know. </sentence><sentence id="384">Only much, much later we found some little paper in one of the cattle carts that came back, that they went to Auschwitz -- "Oswiecim" it's called in Polish, and -- but it was a rumor but nobody really  had facts because nobody returned from there. </sentence><sentence id="385">But they, a lot of people survived even Auschwitz and Birkenau. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="389">Q: But the 1942 transports went to Chelmno. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="391">A: Which we did not know, I did not. </sentence><sentence id="392">As a matter of fact, some of the first transports could write into the ghetto. </sentence><sentence id="393">We received mail into the ghetto from these various camps. </sentence><sentence id="394">So, how we were supposed to know that they are going to their death? </sentence><sentence id="395">Nobody actually knew, nobody knew. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="401">Q: And you think Rumkowski didn't know? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="403">A: I don't think he did because he heard the same rumors that we heard. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="405">Q: What was daily life like? </sentence><sentence id="406">What time did you get up in the morning and where did you eat? </sentence><sentence id="407">Did you eat at home? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="411">A: Well, I finally got myself an apartment and I found Irene in 1942. </sentence><sentence id="412">I engaged with her in 1942. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="415">Q: Tell us about your meeting. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="421">A: That evening. </sentence><sentence id="422">And, well, I saw Irene when she walked on the street, and I fell in love with her, just by seeing her the way she walked. </sentence><sentence id="423">And then when I saw her face, so it went with it. </sentence><sentence id="424">So, I said to one of my O.D.8 men, who was always my lifeguard if you want to call it, I said to him, "I want to meet this girl. </sentence><sentence id="425">I want to meet this girl. </sentence><sentence id="426">You have to make a date for me." </sentence><sentence id="427">And it happened to be that I was at that time I had a slight cold or something. </sentence><sentence id="428">I was home and -- no that was afterwards. </sentence><sentence id="429">So, finally we made a date and he made a date with her not telling her that she had a date with me. </sentence><sentence id="430">So, he made the date with her and it was late at night and she was an hour late and he still was there but he was just about going away when she came. </sentence><sentence id="431">And she came and the whole night she was sitting and talking and I was serenading her, playing on my violin and finally she fell in love with me, too. </sentence><sentence id="432">So, then one evening in November, the 11th of November to be exact, we had -- in a friend's house, she was ready and I went to her parents and I asked for her  0 hand. </sentence><sentence id="433">I want to marry their daughter and they allowed this. </sentence><sentence id="434">They said, "OK, you can marry our daughter." </sentence><sentence id="435">Then I went to the party where we met for the evening and I said, "Congratulations we are engaged to be married." </sentence><sentence id="436">And that was then the way I met Irene and then we married in June of 1943, by the Elders of the Jews, together with 18 or 19 other couples. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="453">Q: Did you life change? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="455">A: Since then? </sentence><sentence id="456">Well, to me in my eyes, yes, because she's a wonderful woman, very bright, very intelligent, and down to earth with a lot of common sense and a tremendous intuition. </sentence><sentence id="457">She knows things which happen later on, she knows beforehand. </sentence><sentence id="458">And so then I got an apartment with a room and a kitchen and I lived there with Irene then. </sentence><sentence id="459">And...so, I got up in the morning like seven o'clock, was at my office at eight, and Irene was also working in one of the factories and we lived there with the various happenings during this time in the ghetto which is already known today by everybody who is interested in it because it's a matter of documentation already of what had happened in between "42 and "44. </sentence><sentence id="460">We have lost a lot of people by transporting them out of the ghetto, by attrition, and as the time passed by more and more and more starved. </sentence><sentence id="461">Of course sickness, hunger and in 1944 the last transport to Auschwitz was the next to the last transport, there was also was the Elders of the Jews, Rumkowski, and all his staff and his wife and his brother, and they went to Auschwitz and unfortunately, as we learned later on, he was immediately killed when he got to Auschwitz. </sentence><sentence id="462">And then we were the last transport out of the ghetto in "44 and we did not go to Auschwitz. </sentence><sentence id="463">We went to Sachsenhausen. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="473">Q: Let me go back and try to ask you some details. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="483">A: Yes. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="485">Q: So you must have been put in situations where people asked you to do things. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="495">Q: Can you talk about some of those kinds of difficulties? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="497">A: I will not remember the details, but one thing was certain, that I did not take any bribes. </sentence><sentence id="498">Nobody could buy me, and I did it to the best of my ability and to my conscience. </sentence><sentence id="499">So, if somebody asked me a favor and I could do it I gladly did it, and if I couldn't, I couldn't. </sentence><sentence id="500">I had to say no. </sentence><sentence id="501">But that I did really select someone to do a favor, no, I did not. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="511">Q: Did you have sympathy with these strikers or did you find them disruptive? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="513">A: Well, these people did not know the background of why the happenings what happened so they tried, they thought by striking or by demonstrating they could better their lives by getting maybe more bread or more to eat, but it didn't do any good because Rumkowski did the only thing he could do was what he did. </sentence><sentence id="514">All right, he was a little bit rough, but if you put yourself into his position, what could he have done? </sentence><sentence id="515">Like for instance, the transport when they asked for children, his heart was breaking, but what could he have done, because if he wouldn't have done it, it would have been worse. </sentence><sentence id="516">Because, for instance, a transport was supposed to go out of the ghetto and they could not fulfill the quota, they came in and blocked off, you know, two or three or four houses and took everybody that was found in there and sent them away. </sentence><sentence id="517">So, what was the lesser evil?Nothing could have been done. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="524">Q: Do you remember that day when he gave that talk about "give me your children"? </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="530">Q: Did you hear him speak? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="532">A: No, no, I learned it when I saw the film. </sentence><sentence id="533">I knew that a transport had to go out, but I did not hear the speech. </sentence><sentence id="534">I wasn't present when he spoke. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="538">Q: Did you decide not to go or were you just doing something else? </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="552">Q: Two guards with you? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="554">A: Yes, well, they stayed in the office to keep order because when there is a line of people outside everybody wants to be the first. </sentence><sentence id="555">Everybody tries to be -- so they kept order. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="558">Q: So, it wasn't to protect you, or was it as well? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="560">A: The main reason was to keep order and then also to protect me. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="562">Q: Were you in danger, do you think? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="564">A: Listen, in a position like I had, well, naturally people, as I mentioned to you before, with one signature I made a friend and an enemy at the same time. </sentence><sentence id="565">So, naturally, not that I was scared or something like this but everybody had to be careful because you never know what people do when they're desperate. </sentence><sentence id="566">So they kept order. </sentence><sentence id="567">Now, then, as I mentioned we were the last transport. </sentence><sentence id="568">Only 800 people were left in the ghetto officially to liquidate the ghetto. </sentence><sentence id="569">We were sent to Sachsenhausen. </sentence><sentence id="570">In Sachsenhausen, we were there for two weeks and then we were bought as slaves by a firm and we went to Koenigswusterhausen, where there were new barracks put for us and naturally also straw mattresses. </sentence><sentence id="571">We worked and made to cut certain wood and plywoods which we sent away to be assembled -- we didn't do the assembly -- and we understand they were boxes sent to the eastern front against Russia. </sentence><sentence id="572">They would put certain ice-melting stuff in there, like some flame throwers or something like this, and thank heaven the war did not last two weeks longer because I probably would have been shot for sabotage because what I cut on the circular saw was a quarter of inch too long, a quarter of an inch too short. </sentence><sentence id="573">We dealt with centimeters. </sentence><sentence id="574">It was a half a centimeter less or half a centimeter larger, so, but it wouldn't fit together. </sentence><sentence id="575">So, thank heaven it ended when it ended because otherwise I probably would have been killed for sabotage. </sentence><sentence id="576">What else can I say, what else can I tell you? </sentence><sentence id="577">In the mean time I had other experiences, like my back was broken -- not broken but fractured, because one day I had to go into the forest to build some tank traps and next to me was a man, an elderly man, who could not work. </sentence><sentence id="578">So I did something for him so one of the SS men who watched us came over and told him to work, and he was just leaning over his shovel and said, "I can't, I can't." </sentence><sentence id="579">So, he hit him, and when he hit him I said I will work for him. </sentence><sentence id="580">I will do his part. </sentence><sentence id="581">So, he gave me over the back with his rifle and I had a slight fracture of L-2, as they call it in that  3 language. </sentence><sentence id="582">And I was hiding for a while because I could not stand, but thank heaven it healed. </sentence><sentence id="583">And I needed an operation which was performed in 1966 and thank heaven everything is all right. </sentence><sentence id="584">So any further details you would like to know? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="606">Q: Yes, I want to go back to the ghetto. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="630">Q: But by the organization of the ghetto as opposed to -- </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="652">Q: And what was the money used for? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="654">A: Inside, people bought themselves cigarettes, hand made cigarettes, various things. </sentence><sentence id="655">It didn't have any value outside the ghetto, it was only within the ghetto. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="658">Q: Did this money have Rumkowski's picture on it or some of the money? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="660">A: Yes, oh, yes. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="662">Q: What did you think of that? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="664">A: At that time it was absolutely natural for me. </sentence><sentence id="665">It was an organization. </sentence><sentence id="666">It was a city. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="670">Q: Was anybody else's picture on the money? </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="680">Q: What kind of a hierarchy between people who came in richer and people who came in poorer and people who came in from outside, the Czech transports, the German transports? </sentence><sentence id="681">Do you remember gypsy transport coming in? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="684">A: I don't recall. </sentence><sentence id="685">We got a lot of transports coming from little villages and towns around the vicinity of Ledz, but I don't remember. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="688">Q: Do you recall whether there was a difference in treatment with the people who were already in Lodz from the people who were coming in from transports who might not, then had to get apartments or parts of apartments? </sentence><sentence id="689">Do you think there was a distinction between those people? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="692">A: Well, I would say that some of them who were affected by the newcomers, as you want to call them, because they had to share a room with them or whatever, so naturally they might take objection to it. </sentence><sentence id="693">But in general, everybody tried to help, actually, the other. </sentence><sentence id="694"> 5 </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="698">Q: Was there sufficient -- I don't mean a lot of food -- but could every one get something to eat or was there a lot of starvation among certain groups, do you think? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="700">A: There was starvation, absolutely. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="702">Q: That must have been very difficult? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="704">A: It was difficult. </sentence><sentence id="705">It was difficult because the bread ration which varied from time to time was too much to die but not enough to live. </sentence><sentence id="706">But eventually and slowly people starved, starved, and no resistance to sicknesses and a lot of people got tuberculosis and just died away. </sentence><sentence id="707">So, it was very much decimated by people going on transport, being sent out of the ghetto and by attrition, and died by starvation. </sentence><sentence id="708">So, from the 200,000 people coming to the ghetto, there were in 1944 maybe, maybe by estimation, I estimate maybe 30,000 or 40,000 people left. </sentence><sentence id="709">They either died away or were sent on transports. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="716">Q: Was there a different kind of work for men than there was for women in terms of the division of labor you have there? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="718">A: Well, naturally, it is as you have today, too. </sentence><sentence id="719">There are certain jobs women can not just do and men have to do it, but I don't think there was any distinction made and women had to do the same work as the men, at least they were delegated to do the job. </sentence><sentence id="720">Whether they could do it with the help or without the help it's a different story, but we could not make any distinction between the various genders. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="724">Q: Who took care of children if both parents or every adult -- </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="726">A: There were Kindergartens. </sentence><sentence id="727">Children had to go and stay over the day and were taken care of, which was one of the fortes of Rumkowski because children was his life. </sentence><sentence id="728">Before the war, he was heading an orphanage and they were taken care of but naturally the same thing. </sentence><sentence id="729">They didn't have enough food and a lot of children died. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="734">Q: Did the children get a ration or did the children share the parents ration? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="736">A: No, they got their own. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="738">Q: They got their own? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="740">A: Yes. </sentence><sentence id="741">Every head had to get a certain ration. </sentence><sentence id="742">That's why they had to be registered. </sentence><sentence id="743">Whether a child or the elderly, it doesn't matter. </sentence><sentence id="744">They had to be registered to get the i.d. </sentence><sentence id="745">and to get the ration card. </sentence><sentence id="746"> 6 </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="766">Q: So, you were depressed, too? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="768">A: Absolutely, absolutely. </sentence><sentence id="769">Because I saw with my eyes of what had happened to these various people. </sentence><sentence id="770">I saw them. </sentence><sentence id="771">They hardly could walk and they had to go to the factory. </sentence><sentence id="772">So when you see the people walking hardly being able to put one foot in front of the other and knowing that they have to go to do some job otherwise they wouldn't eat, you couldn't help it. </sentence><sentence id="773">You had to be depressed. </sentence><sentence id="774">You couldn't put a wall around you because you lived with it. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="782">Q: Do you know people who committed suicide? </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="798">A: I had made two rings, one for myself and one for Irene. </sentence><sentence id="799">We were able to get Zyankali" and put it in the ring for when the time would come where we suffered to such a degree that we couldn't stand it anymore we could take it. </sentence><sentence id="800">But then my mother-in-law, may she rest in peace, without us knowing it, she removed it. </sentence><sentence id="801">We didn't know it because we never used it. </sentence><sentence id="802">We never took it off, but the ring survived in my violin and my daughter has it now. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="808">Q: Were you thinking about the ring in terms of the transport or just that the situation would get so bad? </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="936">Q: Bert, can we go back to your earlier years for a few minutes? </sentence><sentence id="937">Tell me a little bit about your boxing career? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="940">A: Well, it wasn't much of a career, but I started boxing when I was about 12 years old, and I started to get into the ring with my name on the poster. </sentence><sentence id="941">I must have been 14 years old and I was a junior welter featherweight. </sentence><sentence id="942">I started boxing when I was about 12 years old, started training. </sentence><sentence id="943">The Jewish sport club Bar-Kochba had no boxing in Hannover. </sentence><sentence id="944">We had no boxing, so I joined the Heros-Eintracht boxing club in Hannover. </sentence><sentence id="945">And when I was about 14 I was ready to go into the ring. </sentence><sentence id="946">My name was on the poster and I started boxing as a junior featherweight and I did fairly well, and I was just about ready to go into the championship fights when I was paired against one who was not very friendly towards me because we went to the same school and he was one of the first Nazis. </sentence><sentence id="947">When it came to a championship fight -- no, I'm sorry. </sentence><sentence id="948">I have to go back now. </sentence><sentence id="949">I got him into the ring and I fought him and I won. </sentence><sentence id="950">I won that fight. </sentence><sentence id="951">Then about a year later, at that time the Nazis started already but I was still allowed to box in that club. </sentence><sentence id="952">I fought him the second time and he lost again. </sentence><sentence id="953">Then I saw him for the first time in a SS uniform and when it came to that last fight I just could not hold back but, and I hit him with everything I had and I knocked him out, and he was the one who arrested me in 1938 to bring me in the concert hall where we were sent away into no-man's land. </sentence><sentence id="954">So, that was my boxing career. </sentence><sentence id="955">Then, naturally, I could not go any further because at that time the Nazis were in full swing and full force and a Jew could not any more be in any public place for that reason. </sentence><sentence id="956">So, this was the boxing career to answer your question. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="974">Q: Do you think having boxed was in any way a help to you? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="976">A: Well, I lived in sports. </sentence><sentence id="977">I played soccer for 15 years from when I was a youngster until -- sometimes as a goalkeeper. </sentence><sentence id="978">I played two games, at 10 o'clock in the youth and at one o'clock in the second league. </sentence><sentence id="979">So, I was pretty good at it, too. </sentence><sentence id="980">I was a pretty good goalkeeper. </sentence><sentence id="981">And I was an oarsman in high school, and field and track I wasn't too fast in running, but I was in very good physical condition and I think this has helped me in going through the other bad environments I was forced into. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="988">Q: Now at the same time you were involved in music. </sentence><sentence id="989">You were a violinist? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="992">A: Yes. </sentence><sentence id="993">I did not play officially anywhere. </sentence><sentence id="994">I just played for myself and as Irene told you, I serenaded her our first night meeting. </sentence><sentence id="995">And I played with my daughter. </sentence><sentence id="996">The violin has a very, very sentimental value because it survived the holocaust, and we had as when I  0 walked away from the ghetto that was the only thing I took with me and I kept it until I came to Sachsenhausen where they took it away from me. </sentence><sentence id="997">And they took a accordion away from another colleague, but when we came to Koenigswusterhausen, to the factory where we were slaves, they gave me the violin and they gave him the accordion under the condition that he play for them. </sentence><sentence id="998">So, every so often in the evening we had to play for them and entertain them while they were drinking and laughing and so on. </sentence><sentence id="999">And it helped me also a little bit in the assignment, because as I said, I was on the circular saw, but at one time we had to go to an outside commando to a tank trap, and I had that incident with that elderly man of ours and where I could not see him beaten because he could not do his job so I had to take it for him. </sentence><sentence id="1000">I mentioned that to you before, and so this is the violin, and I played until not too many years ago, but my fingers are a little bit arthritic now. </sentence><sentence id="1001">They are getting stiff so it wasn't for me anymore, so I gave it as a Bar Mitzvah gift to my grandson. </sentence><sentence id="1002">He has not played it as yet. </sentence><sentence id="1003">He is very good on the piano and he's a tremendous flutist, but maybe one day he will take up the violin, too. </sentence><sentence id="1004">He's a very ambitious guy. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1054">Q: Can you talk about your barber and what he did for and what you ended up doing for him? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1056">A: In the ghetto, I had a barber coming every day to shave me and when I needed to give me a haircut. </sentence><sentence id="1057">Naturally when you see him every day you talk about everything, also intimate things in their lives and we were very friendly and he was a nice guy. </sentence><sentence id="1058">And when it came to the curfew into the -- I should take you to the time when nobody was allowed to go out of the house because the Gestapo planned an Aktion where they wanted to have everybody in the house where they could easily get them and transport them away. </sentence><sentence id="1059">I took this barber, his wife and two daughters, and locked them in my apartment for the three days where the Sperre"* was in effect, and in doing so I probably saved their lives. </sentence><sentence id="1060">Even after the war we saw each other regularly and they never forgot what I did for them and thanks to me I think they are alive. </sentence><sentence id="1061">Unfortunately, the barber and his wife passed away last year, but the two daughters are living, one in Boston and the other one in Pittsburgh. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1088">Q: And there was one circumstance where someone actually came in? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1090">A: Yes, he wanted a favor from me and he offered me -- I don't even remember what it was, but he offered me something and I took him by his collar and threw him out of my office. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1092">Q: I bet he was surprised at this. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1094">A: Well, I don't know if he was surprised or not but he was not very friendly towards me afterwards, and I couldn't care less. </sentence><sentence id="1095">But I did everything what I did with a good  2 conscience so I could sleep in peace because I didn't do any harm to anybody knowingly. </sentence><sentence id="1096">So, whatever was in my power I did for what I wanted to do not what I could get out of it. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1104">A: Not that I know of. </sentence><sentence id="1105">He was asked to do it and he did it because somebody had to do it and since I disqualified myself any old way I could, then he had to go and had to do what was asked of him. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1128">Q: Do you have any memories of the ghetto that you think would be important to try to talk about that we haven't talked about? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1130">A: Not really, not really. </sentence><sentence id="1131">But as I said, I did my duties as good as I could and I could not think of any details right now which are outstanding of the normal everyday routine. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1134">Q: Did you ever think of resigning that position? </sentence><sentence id="1135">Did it sometimes get to be too much? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1138">A: Well, many times I thought, but I had no choice, because even if I wanted to resign, Rumkowski would have never allowed it. </sentence><sentence id="1139">Because I mentioned a few times that I feel it's too much for me and he said, "You are doing a job, so do it, and stick with it." </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1142">Q: Do you think he needed you? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1144">A: I tried to think, yes... because if I would not have satisfied in what I had to do, I think he would have let me know and he would have set me aside, whether my sister was his right  3 hand or not, but I think it doesn't have anything to do with it because by that time I showed my own abilities, I would say, in doing what I had to do, what I was asked to do. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1146">Q: Do you think he would have punished you if you would have said, "I'm sorry, I really can't"? </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1154">A: I think that my sister had many sleepless nights because she saw and knew more than anybody else what was going on inside and outside the ghetto. </sentence><sentence id="1155">And one time I remember they took Rumkowski outside the ghetto and he didn't come back until the next day, so we had feared for the worst. </sentence><sentence id="1156">But he came back and nobody every spoke of what had happened. </sentence><sentence id="1157">Nobody even tried to guess of why he was taken away and why he was brought back. </sentence><sentence id="1158">In my eyes, he was not the despot, the demigod, as people made him or said he was, because as I mention to anybody I talk if not Rumkowski, no matter what he did, the ghetto would have liquidated in 1942, completely, without any resistance, without anybody I believe, without me being alive today. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1164">Q: Do you think Dora knew what had happened when he left and didn't come back overnight, your sister? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1166">A: She might have. </sentence><sentence id="1167">She never answered the question because that's another thing that people wanted to know, of what transpired. </sentence><sentence id="1168">She would completely ignore the question, so I don't know if she knew or she didn't know. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1172">Q: Do you think she ever wanted to resign? </sentence><sentence id="1173">Did she ever talk to you because she was so close to all of this? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1176">A: No, no. </sentence><sentence id="1177">She was so much involved that she never spoke with me about whether to resign or not to resign. </sentence><sentence id="1178">She had three girls working with her in the executive office and she worked there very, very hard, I know, long hours, and I'm sure it was nerve-racking for her, but she was quite a character. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1182">Q: Can you describe her? </sentence><sentence id="1183"> 4 </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1186">A: How shall I describe her? </sentence><sentence id="1187">Very bright, extremely intelligent, quick to the draw, down to earth, and a tremendous inside view of what is happening -- all the surroundings of her. </sentence><sentence id="1188">She was quite a woman. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1192">Q: So you were close to each other? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1194">A: Yes. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1202">A: No, they married after the ghetto. </sentence><sentence id="1203">She married the brother of the second in command of Eric Yakobovitch. </sentence><sentence id="1204">He was the vice president, if I can say so, and he was in charge of all the factories and he was a second in command. </sentence><sentence id="1205">So, when Rumkowski was unable to do something, he was the one to enforce everything. </sentence><sentence id="1206">He was the one to do it, and his brother married my sister after the war. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1212">Q: Did she ever say what it was like to work with Rumkowski? </sentence><sentence id="1213">Was he easy to work with or difficult to work with? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1216">A: We knew it was difficult to work for him. </sentence><sentence id="1217">She didn't have to answer that because everybody knew it was a horrible job for anybody because as I said, he really took everything out of you especially when you were that close like she was to him. </sentence><sentence id="1218">He was demanding. </sentence><sentence id="1219">He was demanding, and he wanted you to do something you better do it. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1224">Q: Was he like this before? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1226">A: I didn't know him before, but I know that he was a very charitable man and was always going around fundraising for his orphanage which was very close to him. </sentence><sentence id="1227">I was told, because I did not know him, naturally, from before. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1230">Q: It seems to me that the picture of any human being is very complicated, so someone damning a person or completely praising someone may not be quite appropriate. </sentence><sentence id="1231">Do you think there was anything negative -- I mean you've said very powerful things about him in terms of what you think he was able to do that wouldn't have happened without him. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="1234">Do you think anything negatively about him? </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1235">A: Well, one thing is he lost his temper very easily... and then watch out. </sentence><sentence id="1236">That's what I can say about him, and you had to do what he wanted. </sentence><sentence id="1237">And very, very seldom did I do against  5 what he said. </sentence><sentence id="1238">If he said A and I wanted B, I went B. I was a hothead too, you know, but it never came really to a fight or something with him. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1243">Q: So, you controlled yourself in spite of your rage? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1245">A: I did, I did. </sentence><sentence id="1246">Today I can say, yes, I controlled myself, but he was redheaded -- a hot guy. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1249">Q: But he also had power, so that -- </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1251">A: Tremendous power. </sentence><sentence id="1252">He had absolute control of the ghetto. </sentence><sentence id="1253">He was the man. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1257">Q: So, that if he, if you went against him, he could get you deported? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1259">A: Oh, absolutely, absolutely. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1261">Q: That's a bit frightening to be around. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1263">A: Well, you lived with either or. </sentence><sentence id="1264">You could have had the same thing from the Germans because if they didn't like something they could have done the same thing. </sentence><sentence id="1265">So it was not an easy situation all around. </sentence><sentence id="1266">All right? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1271">Q: Do you think that these workers who had demonstrated these early mass demonstrations, many of them were sent in the early deportations? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1273">A: Yes. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1275">Q: Possibly because they had gone on strike? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1277">A: Probably. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1279">Q: Had -- and probably Rumkowski wanted them out because they were trouble in terms of what he was trying to do. </sentence><sentence id="1280">Do you think they might have been the core of resistance or is that just a stupid idea? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1283">A: Well, as I said, they tried to better themselves. </sentence><sentence id="1284">They tried to get more food and they did not realize by the same token you have today's strikes which absolutely nonsense because what do they achieve? </sentence><sentence id="1285">At that time it was even more ridiculous but they didn't realize that. </sentence><sentence id="1286">They just tried and mobilize themselves and tried to better their condition. </sentence><sentence id="1287">But naturally it was in vain because what could they do? </sentence><sentence id="1288">What could Rumkowski have done? </sentence><sentence id="1289">Just because they demonstrated, he could not go to the Germans and say I want more food for my people, all right, and whatever we had we had to work for. </sentence><sentence id="1290">So even  6 when I was interviewed by Ross (ph), at his interview with me, he said how do I feel today that I cooperated with the Germans. </sentence><sentence id="1291">I didn't cooperate with the Germans. </sentence><sentence id="1292">Just because we manufactured something the Germans could use, well, that was our livelihood. </sentence><sentence id="1293">That was our bread. </sentence><sentence id="1294">And a lot of people don't understand that. </sentence><sentence id="1295">Okay, we made munitions parts. </sentence><sentence id="1296">Okay we made something the German army could use, but did we have another choice? </sentence><sentence id="1297">It was our work and our labor which saved us from complete starvation. </sentence><sentence id="1298">What little we got but we got it because we worked for it, so there was no cooperation, you know, with the Germans. </sentence><sentence id="1299">So that is a misunderstanding which still goes around in a lot of people. </sentence><sentence id="1300">But they don't think. </sentence><sentence id="1301">They just go with the masses. </sentence><sentence id="1302">Why? </sentence><sentence id="1303">Can you imagine that after the all documentation you see in public television and whatever, the Holocaust - - the American army when they went into these camps and made all these films of what they found and still people today can say denying that there was such a thing, that it is all propaganda. </sentence><sentence id="1304">For what propaganda? </sentence><sentence id="1305">Who won the war? </sentence><sentence id="1306">The Germans and the Japanese. </sentence><sentence id="1307">They didn't lose the war, they won it. </sentence><sentence id="1308">The Marshall Plan lift them up until they are one of the biggest nations of the world. </sentence><sentence id="1309">Am I right or wrong? </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1341">Q: Can you talk about the last few months when you think about 30,000 or 40,000 people left in the ghetto before the last deportations or are there more than that? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1343">A: Well, it all depends on what timeframe are we talking. </sentence><sentence id="1344">We're talking 1944. </sentence><sentence id="1345">We're talking about the timeframe between January or February "44 to September, October. </sentence><sentence id="1346">There might have been about 60,000 or 70,000 people left, and all the transports took place at that timeframe. </sentence><sentence id="1347">We were taking into the hospital and we stayed there to be transported out of the ghetto. </sentence><sentence id="1348">A few days before Rumkowski and Rosenblat (ph), you know, the police chief and his brother and a lot of other dignitaries went with the transport to Auschwitz. </sentence><sentence id="1349">We however, went, as I mentioned, to Sachsenhausen and then wound up in Koenigswusterhausen in that factory. </sentence><sentence id="1350">And only about 800 people were left to liquidate the ghetto and they came out smelling like a rose because they found all these treasures which were left behind in the ghetto. </sentence><sentence id="1351">So, they came out fairly well-off and today they are all set. </sentence><sentence id="1352">More power to them because better them than the Germans. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1427">A: David, he was taken -- oh, yeah, one day towards the end I was sent to the outside commando and when we came back that late afternoon, 70 men had been taken away from the camp, amongst them my father-in-law, may he rest in peace and my brother-in- law, may he rest in peace. </sentence><sentence id="1428">They were taken together with the others. </sentence><sentence id="1429">They were sent on a march by foot. </sentence><sentence id="1430">They were supposed to go up to the North Sea, put on a boat and as a final solution being bombed out and drowned. </sentence><sentence id="1431">And my father-in-law, he was shot, after the war had ended already, the third of May. </sentence><sentence id="1432">He couldn't walk anymore and they shot him. </sentence><sentence id="1433">My brother-in-law was able to escape at that time. </sentence><sentence id="1434">So, that was the last few days. </sentence><sentence id="1435">And I had my violin. </sentence><sentence id="1436">That's all I took. </sentence><sentence id="1437">Of course I had a few hidden items there. </sentence><sentence id="1438">And I went with my father after the fourth or the fifth day after we were liberated because I said "Let's not go out because they're still shooting." </sentence><sentence id="1439">And I went with the Russian commando to organize bread and meat and wurst and whatever. </sentence><sentence id="1440">I warned people, "Don't overeat, take it easy," and sure enough a few people overate and got sick and blew themselves up. </sentence><sentence id="1441">And I went with father and we went across a field and there was a trunk and it was covered with blood and I could open it and I opened it up and there were money, German money, the Reichsmark, it must have been at least a million or more and I said to my father, "Papa, if this is here full of blood it's not worth anything because I feel that the Reichsmark will be nothing worth after the war and there will be new money." </sentence><sentence id="1442">If I would have known that until 1948 these Reichsmarks were good and valid, I would have been a millionaire at that time. </sentence><sentence id="1443">I could have bought whole blocks of houses. </sentence><sentence id="1444">I didn't even touch it. </sentence><sentence id="1445">I didn't even touch one piece of paper money and I walked off with my fiddle. </sentence><sentence id="1446">I went over to the Elbe River and there was a Russian commander and I wanted to go across the river because the Americans were on the other side. </sentence><sentence id="1447">That's where I wanted to be. </sentence><sentence id="1448">I didn't want to be with the Russians. </sentence><sentence id="1449">So, I went to the commandant and asked him if I could go with the first transport. </sentence><sentence id="1450">They were French, French prisoners of war. </sentence><sentence id="1451">They were allowed to cross the Elbe River the next morning and I went to the commandant and asked I would like to go with them. </sentence><sentence id="1452">So, I go back to my hometown. </sentence><sentence id="1453">So he said, "You are a German, so you have to wait until the Germans can go." </sentence><sentence id="1454">So we smuggled, my father and I smuggled ourselves into the group of French people and we made it to the ferry boat and made it across the river. </sentence><sentence id="1455">We went to the Americans. </sentence><sentence id="1456">I went to the commander there and I introduced ourselves -- what we are and where we are coming from -- and so he asked me a few questions, how is "father" in Hebrew, how is "mother" in Hebrew and, "What kind of brakhah"* do you say over this?" </sentence><sentence id="1457">And so I answered him so he knew that, yes, and since then the big love affair between them and us and they wanted to give us everything. </sentence><sentence id="1458">I had to help him. </sentence><sentence id="1459">I was as, as a, an interpreter for a few days until we could freely travel until everything was clear and before we would get the first papers to travel. </sentence><sentence id="1460">So, once I was very eager to go home to my hometown. </sentence><sentence id="1461">So the commander gave me a jeep, papers I could go everywhere to get gas. </sentence><sentence id="1462">They called it petrol at that time, and papers that I could travel and that I have  9 legitimately this jeep. </sentence><sentence id="1463">And so, I started driving and everywhere I asked for my wife, whether somebody has seen my wife. </sentence><sentence id="1464">And nobody knew. </sentence><sentence id="1465">Nobody said anything. </sentence><sentence id="1466">Then I finally came to Hannover, to my hometown, and I started working right away in the town hall and registered all the people who were coming from the various camps and I repatriated people like Poles to Poland and Czechs to Czech and I took them all with various passes to the various border towns and I left them there and I took the buses back home because they were all from the post office. </sentence><sentence id="1467">In Germany all the buses are run by the post office. </sentence><sentence id="1468">Everywhere I was I asked people, survivors whether they know or have heard of my wife. </sentence><sentence id="1469">Then one girl, showed it to her, which she saw the picture of the dolly said Irene was bombed out. </sentence><sentence id="1470">She's not alive anymore. </sentence><sentence id="1471">And later on Irene told me that she was told that I was bombed out. </sentence><sentence id="1472">So, it took us ten months after the liberation that she found me back in my hometown. </sentence></p></dialogue>
