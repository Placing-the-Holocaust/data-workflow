<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="290">A: Uh... Those days are pretty much in haze. </sentence><sentence id="291">Uh...I have no other recollections of my days in Boreslawiece except progressive economic difficulties and fear what's going to happen to us and desire to get out of there and go back where the roots were, where the...my mother's family lived. </sentence><sentence id="292">So on a crowded train at night, I traveled from Boreslawiece back to Kielce some...some time before Christmas, probably in 41. </sentence><sentence id="293">Eventually, my mother and my sister joined us, joined me in Kielce, and the rest of the war was spent in Kielce, living first with one and...and then with another, having a room in their crowded house. </sentence><sentence id="294">In those days, it was very lucky if you could have one room to one family. </sentence><sentence id="295">And the following years until about 1944 was spent primarily Mother working in...uh...in...uh...in a factory and then eventually working her way to a food store that was next to the German controlled factory where she...everybody had rations and everybody was allowed to get only so much bread, so much butter, so much other things. </sentence><sentence id="296">I learned what ersatz (ph) coffee is. </sentence><sentence id="297">I learned many other things that I had not learned before in my life. </sentence><sentence id="298">Uh...Among us youngsters, there were roughly my temporaries among the children of the two aunts, we organized secret teaching. </sentence><sentence id="299">That is the older kids were teaching the younger kids to continue our education because the Germans, of course, closed all the schools and prohibited in the entire country any normal education except the first few grades of elementary school. </sentence><sentence id="300">Uh... The population of those areas was destined only to be able to read and write so they would obey Germany orders in the future....uh..future world run by the German...by the Nazis. </sentence><sentence id="301">We knew that we had to move because in the part of the city where my aunt lived, the Nazis were organizing the Jewish ghetto. </sentence><sentence id="302">We had to leave the house and move to another part of town and that part of town was fenced in and all the Jewish population of Kielce were...was ordered to live in... in...uh...in that area. </sentence><sentence id="303">They were guarded by some sort of a uniformed police. </sentence><sentence id="304">They were not allowed to leave the quarters. </sentence><sentence id="305">They were required to wear either a Star of David or a arm band with a Star of David. </sentence><sentence id="306">Uh...The next few years...uh...were characterized by increasing terror, increasing executions, deportations of all the leading citizens of the town to concentration camps. </sentence><sentence id="307">Not only Mayor and the...and the prominent citizens, doctors, lawyers, teachers,...uh...but even anybody who would be a member of what was called in these days intelligencia, you know, people with higher education were being systematically exterminated by the Nazis, taken to concentration camps. </sentence><sentence id="308">At the same time, there was a gradual growth of underground, of resistance, of organizing, not only the adults into groups that would be  preparing for eventual struggle because that no one had any doubt that Nazi terror has to end one day. </sentence><sentence id="309">Not only to prepare for armed struggle but in the meantime to collect information about troop movements, about the...uh...the activities of the Nazis,...uh..documenting their atrocities against the population. </sentence><sentence id="310">Uh...Learning how to move around the city, including us youngsters who were organized in units of clandestine scouts. </sentence><sentence id="311">Before the war, Poland had a very active scouting movement and after the occupation many teenagers were organized into units to...to prepare for the eventual struggle against the Nazis, but in the meantime learning, reconnoitring...uh..moving from one part of the city...uh...avoiding main arteries, being able to cross...uh...through court yards and jump over fences and things like this. </sentence><sentence id="312">And...uh...eventually learning the Morse alphabet and things like this and eventually we were...a few of us were designated as a unit to provide...serve as...uh... curious when I talk about these times, I'm forgetting some of the English words. </sentence><sentence id="313">I only remember Polish words. </sentence><sentence id="314">Word, warshanetza, where the...uh...the people who were runners from one partisan unit to another. </sentence><sentence id="315">Young boys were chosen for this purpose because they were not adults and they had a bicycle and they could avoid Germans in the country. </sentence><sentence id="316">But if...in those days, the partisan units had no way of communicating with each other, very few radios, so they were using youngsters to carry a message from one end to another. </sentence><sentence id="317">And a group of us, about a dozen or so, were sent into the partisan unit that was active in...in the area of Kielce. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="346">Q: How was that like for you? </sentence></p></dialogue>

Yes, the school started. </sentence><sentence id="475">The school started within a month or two because I remember even before the war was officially declared over on May 9, 1945, our gymnasium was already functioning and we were going back and enrolling in classes and...and...uh...around that time, April or...or May, us youngsters who only lived this heroic, teenage involvement in..in...in patriotism and fight against the Nazis started resurrecting our pre-War...uh..boy scout units in...in gymnasium and I was one of the...uh...leaders of the...the troop I guess you would call it in English that was organized, being re...reorganized in gymnasium. </sentence><sentence id="476">And we were, by the summer...by early summer of 45, we were planning our first camp even though we had nothing, but the enthusiasm of the young boys were such that we were just ready to even live without tents as long as we could get out of town and...and go somewhere and do our scouting thing. </sentence><sentence id="477">So we were planning a week's excursion into the...the mountains in Kielce region...uh..which were called Gory Swietokrzyskie, St.  Cross, Holy Cross Mountains. </sentence><sentence id="478">And my boys were...if you pardon me the expression, this is how I ever referred to them being their leader. </sentence><sentence id="479">You know, this just like in the old song...I'll take care of you. </sentence><sentence id="480">I'm 17, you're 16. </sentence><sentence id="481">But I was their...one of their leaders, so my boys were already in uniforms and were getting ready to leave the next day. </sentence><sentence id="482">And I think it was in July, but I'm not sure of the dates again. </sentence><sentence id="483">When we heard rumors that the...uh...that there is something funny going on, some kind of emotion, riot or civil commotion in..uh...along Shenetza (ph) which is a little stream that ran through...through Kielce and...uh...but I went there. </sentence><sentence id="484">And I started asking people what's going on...and people told me, "Oh, this is a house that is occupied by the Jews." </sentence><sentence id="485">And...uh and...uh...something funny is going on there because ...uh...a Polish, Christian Catholic boy was missing for a couple of days and...uh...and..uh...he was found and...uh.. he said that...that's where he was kept. </sentence><sentence id="486">And of course one of the most pernicious...uh...stories about the Jews...uh.. for centuries in Europe was that they had to use Christian blood for religious rituals. </sentence><sentence id="487">And so, of course, this population of this...of this town, I'm not going psycho-analyze them, but here we are for the first time not really afraid of..of terror of the Nazis. </sentence><sentence id="488">This population restless, unhappy because communists are taking over and most of the people were anti- communist. </sentence><sentence id="489">Uh...These...I...I'm trying to understand what happened, but I'm not going to try to understand. </sentence><sentence id="490">I'm going to try to tell you what I saw. </sentence><sentence id="491">And the only thing I saw was a large crowd of people surrounding this house and rumors flying back that the...that the military were entering upstairs where the quarters of the Jewish survivors were and the shots were fired and nobody knew who shoot...fired first, but there were casualties and there were arrests. </sentence><sentence id="492">And I saw one or two of my boys in scouting uniforms in the crowd, gawking. </sentence><sentence id="493">And I said, "What are you doing here in the scouting uniform?
