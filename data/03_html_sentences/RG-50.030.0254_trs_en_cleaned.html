( </sentence><sentence id="23">Chuckle) (Pause) I had a younger sister, Helena. </sentence><sentence id="24">No. </sentence><sentence id="25">Marga. </sentence><sentence id="26">Uh... The strongest memories are of holidays. </sentence><sentence id="27">Christmas tree. </sentence><sentence id="28">My father pretending to talk to the angel because in Polish Catholic tradition, it was the angel that brought the gifts at Christmas time. </sentence><sentence id="29">St. Nicholas came on December 6 and put things under the pillows of good children. </sentence><sentence id="30">Bad children got little twigs. </sentence><sentence id="31">We got both. </sentence><sentence id="32">So it was...uh...a rather confusing message that we were getting. </sentence><sentence id="33">I guess we were getting a message that we were alright, but we were not perfect. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="54">Q: What happened as the war grew closer? </sentence><sentence id="55">You became older. </sentence><sentence id="56">Uh...As you became a young teenager, where did you go to school? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="60">A: Well, I went to school in the village until 1937 and in 1937, after a long struggle, my parents managed to obtain a permission from the Polish...pre-War Polish authorities that my mother could be transferred and could teach in the same town in which my father was working. </sentence><sentence id="61">Uh...A rather unbelievable situation for us today in America, but it was common place in Poland. </sentence><sentence id="62">So in 1937, we moved from Vilena, the village near Kielce and we moved to Boleslawiece, which was a sort of a equivalent of Houston, Texas, of...of the United States. </sentence><sentence id="63">And we...there I lived with my father for the remaining 2 years before the war broke out. </sentence><sentence id="64">And there I went to a private elementary school which was called </sentence></p><p><sentence id="65"> (nh). </sentence><sentence id="66">And._uh.. finished the last srade which I believe was 6th and took mv entrance  going on and we children were becoming slowly aware of the gathering clouds. </sentence><sentence id="67">And my father was a reserve...uh...uh...officer. </sentence><sentence id="68">He was a first lieutenant...I guess lieutenant in the Polish army, and in August...uh...the reserve company in that he was part of went on maneuvers. </sentence><sentence id="69">I was Il and a half, and that was the last time I saw him until I saw him in the United States in January 1949. </sentence><sentence id="70">He never came back. </sentence><sentence id="71">The war broke out. </sentence><sentence id="72">He was fighting. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="73">Uh...Of course, we didn't know what was going to happen and about the tenor of the pre- war Polish press was...uh...we will fight the Nazis. </sentence><sentence id="74">We will not let them take over the country. </sentence><sentence id="75">So little did we know how powerful Nazis armies were. </sentence><sentence id="76">And the war broke out and..uh...(sigh) within a few days, first waves of refugees started coming.,... </sentence><sentence id="77">telling hair raising stories about atrocities committed on the population by the Germany army, by the indiscriminate bombing, by the German air force of crowded roads filled with refugees, with..with men, women, children, possessions, animals. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="78"> Uh...It was extremely scary. </sentence><sentence id="79">It...Many times I said to my friends who are questioning me about this period that my childhood ended on September 1, 39. </sentence><sentence id="80">Uh...Within couple weeks, the threat of the advancing German armies were so great that all the able bodied men who otherwise were not in the armies started drifting east to escape the advancing German armies. </sentence><sentence id="81">To escape...to possibly join the Polish army somewhere. </sentence><sentence id="82">And that's where...I forget the date, but obviously it's known to history...uh...suddenly as...as.. as we realized we were stabbed in the back by the Soviet armies marching into Poland from the east and completely...uh.. destroying whatever little resistance there was to...to the advancing German forces. </sentence><sentence id="83">Only then we learned about the Molitov/Ribbontrop (ph) pact, dividing Poland and within a couple days after this event, the Germans marched into Boleslawiece and...uh..for some reason I remember the...the day very vividly because that was the day that I had to an optometrist to pick up my first pair of glasses. </sentence><sentence id="84">And they were little beady little things...uh..but I had to wear them and I walked out of the optometrist's shop and the sidewalk kind of looked crooked, but people were pointing out to...to the advancing...marching German. </sentence><sentence id="85">Actually men...Germans didn't march. </sentence><sentence id="86">They were riding trucks, and their green uniforms. </sentence><sentence id="87">People were reaching out to them, and the Germans were throwing cigarettes. </sentence><sentence id="88">That was my first impression of the German army. </sentence><sentence id="89">Uh...Within time that I cannot determine and now in retrospect I know that it was pursuant to some agreement between the Russians and the Germans. </sentence><sentence id="90">The Germans withdrew and the Soviet troops moved in. </sentence><sentence id="91">They were...uh...they were shabby looking, and they were...they were terribly looking...uh...neglected by our standards, un...unused to western facilities. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="92">Uh...Immediately in ...in private homes, Russian authorities quartered some officers or some other people. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="93"> They had to be explained about toilet bowls and things like this. </sentence><sentence id="94">They didn't know what they were for. </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="95">Q: What about you? </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="96">A: I guess the overwhelming feeling was of fear for my father, fear for what's going to happen to us. </sentence><sentence id="97">I had forgotten until a few days before our interview, as I started thinking about those years and those times, how terribly fear dominated our lives were. </sentence><sentence id="98">How easy it was to control whole populations by terror in those days. </sentence><sentence id="99">And I as a 12 year old kid was simply scared of what's going to happen to us. </sentence><sentence id="100">But as soon as the Soviets walked in, they ostenaciously opened the schools again. </sentence><sentence id="101">And we were...the same teachers were permitted to continue to teach and we were allowed to return to school, encouraged to return to school. </sentence><sentence id="102">New subjects were introduced. </sentence><sentence id="103">Russian. </sentence><sentence id="104">Ukrainian since this part of Poland was...uh...a majority of population was Ukrainian. </sentence><sentence id="105">And we were...back in school. </sentence><sentence id="106">Now in retrospect I see how terribly...uh...disturbed I was by the events because my grades plummeted. </sentence><sentence id="107">I was bring nothing but Ds and Cs from school, and I was an A student before. </sentence><sentence id="108">Uh...Psychologists will tell you this is the first sign that something is wrong with a kid when he doesn't get good grades in school. </sentence><sentence id="109">Uh...But obviously we were in..in...in great fear for what's going to happen. </sentence><sentence id="110">In the meantime, we received a post card from our father saying that he is interned in a little town in Hungary called Yur (ph) where Polish armies that after they could no longer fight the Germans and Soviets, they crossed to Hungary and were interned there under rather benign conditions because Hungarians, even though the government was collaborating, with the Nazis, the...the population...Hungarians were friends. </sentence><sentence id="111">We were permitted by the authorities to send a wire to my father...in German, and to this day I remember the text of the wire. </sentence><sentence id="112">Gesei Gesunt (ph). </sentence><sentence id="113">We are healthy. </sentence><sentence id="114">We are well. </sentence><sentence id="115">That's all we were permitted to say in that wire. </sentence><sentence id="116">And...uh...that's all we heard from my father for...for a very, very long time. </sentence><sentence id="117">Uh...In the meantime, the Russian school continued. </sentence><sentence id="118">My mother was teaching....uh...sometimes some of our teachers had to be one lesson ahead of what they were teaching us. </sentence><sentence id="119">But we heard rumors that this is not going to last, this peace between the Germans and the Russians, although the Russians dismissed this propaganda and didn't...didn't allow it to...to...to be officially stated. </sentence><sentence id="120">And...uh...I may not recall anything from that period, except that I, of course, had many Jewish friends in school. </sentence><sentence id="121">And uh, we were so involved in our own little world. </sentence><sentence id="122">Uh...The boys were talking about sex serupticiously. </sentence><sentence id="123">We were organizing poetry circles. </sentence><sentence id="124">Uh...We were exchanging letters. </sentence><sentence id="125">We had school mail where we would write letters to each other and..uh.. And then (pause) in June of 41, Hitler attacked Russia. </sentence><sentence id="126">And within a day or 2, Soviets withdrew from the city, but first blowing up and devastating most of the important facilities in the city, such as a power house and a lot of other installations. </sentence><sentence id="127">And the German, Nazis returned. </sentence><sentence id="128">And that is really when the terror started in earnest. </sentence><sentence id="129">The rumors started circulated that the Nazis are going to declare a...a day of liberty quote unquote for the Ukrainian population to settle the score with the Jewish population. </sentence><sentence id="130">And to our horror one day came and suddenly there were pogroms everywhere with the Ukrainian peasants coming into town and beating and murdering Jewish families and...and...uh..and we, of course, stayed home petrified and  just didn't get out. </sentence><sentence id="131">Uh...At that time, the economic situation also changed. </sentence><sentence id="132">We started feeling a dearth of food and supplies. </sentence><sentence id="133">We started getting hungry. </sentence><sentence id="134">Everything was disrupted. </sentence><sentence id="135">The...the normal functioning of the society was reduced to the minimum and everything was being...uh..collected, confiscated by the Nazi authorities to help their war machine drive into Russia. ( </sentence><sentence id="136">Sigh) I heard numerous stories of what happened to my colleagues. </sentence><sentence id="137">Uh...I do not recall the details. </sentence><sentence id="138">It was too scary to even listen to, but I heard about my...one of my friends, Romack (ph), whose parents and...and sister were killed by the...and I'm not even sure by whom. </sentence><sentence id="139">And then he pleaded with them, "Kill me too. </sentence><sentence id="140">You killed the rest of my family." </sentence><sentence id="141">That's the only detail that I remember. </sentence><sentence id="142">We were getting...uh...progressively more and more...uh..desperate. </sentence><sentence id="143">The only way to survive was to take our possessions, whatever we had and whatever a Ukrainian farmer wanted and trade it for food. </sentence><sentence id="144">I remember through a friend we traded a bicycle that my father had for 20 kilograms of Swani (ph), the pork fat or whatever it was. </sentence><sentence id="145">People were trading furniture, taking them to the village and getting some grain. </sentence><sentence id="146">I remember a grinding, ordinary grain in a coffee grinder, mixing it with water and salting it a little bit and baking it on top of the..the gas burning stove and that would be our food. </sentence><sentence id="147">So it was really hard. </sentence><sentence id="148">So then we decided that we have to get back to central Poland where my mother's sisters lived and where it would be easier to survive and have help from the two...two sisters and their families. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="203">Q: Before you move, you have talked about the pogroms in Kielce. </sentence><sentence id="204">Can you tell me, when you came out from your house, what was it like? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="207">A: Pogroms in... in Boreslawiece? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="209">Q: I'm sorry. </sentence><sentence id="210">In Boreslawiece. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="213">A: Yal. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="215">Q: Uh...What were the...what was it like? </sentence><sentence id="216">Did you have any Jewish friends at that time, any Jewish acquaintances. </sentence><sentence id="217">Can you tell us? </sentence><sentence id="218">What happened? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="223">A: Yes. </sentence><sentence id="224">I had many friends. </sentence><sentence id="225">I had many friends. </sentence><sentence id="226">I visited one friend's house after that. </sentence><sentence id="227">Uh...And....uh...I came into the house and I remember talking to his mother who was in tears and saying to me...uh...,Look, Panjawatko (ph), Mr. Witkowski (ph),in Polish you would Mr., but you would use the first name as sort of a half way familiar term between first name and using the last name. </sentence><sentence id="228">They just ran into the house and ransacked it. </sentence><sentence id="229">Look at this beautiful Trammel (ph). </sentence><sentence id="230"> Trammel (ph) was a long, tall mirror that would have some sort of a pedestal on the bottom, and a little shelf in front of it like a mantel. </sentence><sentence id="231">They just came in and threw a stone in it and just shattered the whole thing. </sentence><sentence id="232">Fortunately, in this friend's family nobody was hurt or killed, but I have heard about numerous situations in which people were...were beaten up or killed by the...by the Ukrainian peasants. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="243">Q: Please go on. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="245">A: Uh... Those days are pretty much in haze. </sentence><sentence id="246">Uh...I have no other recollections of my days in Boreslawiece except progressive economic difficulties and fear what's going to happen to us and desire to get out of there and go back where the roots were, where the...my mother's family lived. </sentence><sentence id="247">So on a crowded train at night, I traveled from Boreslawiece back to Kielce some...some time before Christmas, probably in 41. </sentence><sentence id="248">Eventually, my mother and my sister joined us, joined me in Kielce, and the rest of the war was spent in Kielce, living first with one and...and then with another, having a room in their crowded house. </sentence><sentence id="249">In those days, it was very lucky if you could have one room to one family. </sentence><sentence id="250">And the following years until about 1944 was spent primarily Mother working in...uh...in...uh...in a factory and then eventually working her way to a food store that was next to the German controlled factory where she...everybody had rations and everybody was allowed to get only so much bread, so much butter, so much other things. </sentence><sentence id="251">I learned what ersatz (ph) coffee is. </sentence><sentence id="252">I learned many other things that I had not learned before in my life. </sentence><sentence id="253">Uh...Among us youngsters, there were roughly my temporaries among the children of the two aunts, we organized secret teaching. </sentence><sentence id="254">That is the older kids were teaching the younger kids to continue our education because the Germans, of course, closed all the schools and prohibited in the entire country any normal education except the first few grades of elementary school. </sentence><sentence id="255">Uh... The population of those areas was destined only to be able to read and write so they would obey Germany orders in the future....uh..future world run by the German...by the Nazis. </sentence><sentence id="256">We knew that we had to move because in the part of the city where my aunt lived, the Nazis were organizing the Jewish ghetto. </sentence><sentence id="257">We had to leave the house and move to another part of town and that part of town was fenced in and all the Jewish population of Kielce were...was ordered to live in... in...uh...in that area. </sentence><sentence id="258">They were guarded by some sort of a uniformed police. </sentence><sentence id="259">They were not allowed to leave the quarters. </sentence><sentence id="260">They were required to wear either a Star of David or a arm band with a Star of David. </sentence><sentence id="261">Uh...The next few years...uh...were characterized by increasing terror, increasing executions, deportations of all the leading citizens of the town to concentration camps. </sentence><sentence id="262">Not only Mayor and the...and the prominent citizens, doctors, lawyers, teachers,...uh...but even anybody who would be a member of what was called in these days intelligencia, you know, people with higher education were being systematically exterminated by the Nazis, taken to concentration camps. </sentence><sentence id="263">At the same time, there was a gradual growth of underground, of resistance, of organizing, not only the adults into groups that would be  preparing for eventual struggle because that no one had any doubt that Nazi terror has to end one day. </sentence><sentence id="264">Not only to prepare for armed struggle but in the meantime to collect information about troop movements, about the...uh...the activities of the Nazis,...uh..documenting their atrocities against the population. </sentence><sentence id="265">Uh...Learning how to move around the city, including us youngsters who were organized in units of clandestine scouts. </sentence><sentence id="266">Before the war, Poland had a very active scouting movement and after the occupation many teenagers were organized into units to...to prepare for the eventual struggle against the Nazis, but in the meantime learning, reconnoitring...uh..moving from one part of the city...uh...avoiding main arteries, being able to cross...uh...through court yards and jump over fences and things like this. </sentence><sentence id="267">And...uh...eventually learning the Morse alphabet and things like this and eventually we were...a few of us were designated as a unit to provide...serve as...uh... curious when I talk about these times, I'm forgetting some of the English words. </sentence><sentence id="268">I only remember Polish words. </sentence><sentence id="269">Word, warshanetza, where the...uh...the people who were runners from one partisan unit to another. </sentence><sentence id="270">Young boys were chosen for this purpose because they were not adults and they had a bicycle and they could avoid Germans in the country. </sentence><sentence id="271">But if...in those days, the partisan units had no way of communicating with each other, very few radios, so they were using youngsters to carry a message from one end to another. </sentence><sentence id="272">And a group of us, about a dozen or so, were sent into the partisan unit that was active in...in the area of Kielce. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="301">Q: How was that like for you? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="303">A: Uh, that was a most curious experience. </sentence><sentence id="304">We slept during the day. </sentence><sentence id="305">We marched at night. </sentence><sentence id="306">I had a bicycle. </sentence><sentence id="307">Each one of us had a bicycle. </sentence><sentence id="308">We had no arms, of course. </sentence><sentence id="309">We were dressed in civilian clothing to look inconspicuous. </sentence><sentence id="310">I learned how to walk and sleep at the same time. </sentence><sentence id="311">Walking with a friend, locked in arms, and just marching in a column at night and sleeping at the same time, or leaning on your bicycle and...uh...uh...somehow managing to...to sleep and walk at the same time. </sentence><sentence id="312">During the day we would lie low because the Germans, of course, controlled the countryside. </sentence><sentence id="313">Uh...I encountered some Jewish survivors of the ghettos that were in the meantime being liquidated by the Nazis. </sentence><sentence id="314">I did not know which town they were from but I remember two of the men that were...uh...employed quote unquote by the headquarters...uh...uh...unit of this regiment, that was called regiment. </sentence><sentence id="315">Uh,...I don't know what they were doing, but they were...they were there. </sentence><sentence id="316">I remember seeing them. </sentence><sentence id="317">They looked terribly neglected, terribly impoverished, terribly...uh...they looked like...like driven animals because presumably of the experiences they went through. </sentence><sentence id="318">I don't know what happened to them. </sentence><sentence id="319">When most of the group was disband in the fall of  44, presumably they stayed with the group because we, in the summer of 44 were concentrating all of the underground forces to go to help the uprising in Warsaw which broke out among this time, but, of course, that was a unsuccessful attempt because the..the crossings of major rivers were guarded and these partisan units did not have heavy armor or artillery or anything. </sentence><sentence id="320">So after about 3 or 4 months I returned home to my mother and my sister, covered with lice, dirty, very, very...uh...skinny. </sentence><sentence id="321">Had some infection in my fingers. </sentence><sentence id="322">The skin would simply balloon around the fingers and fill with some sort of pus or some sort of fluid. </sentence><sentence id="323">The nail would come off with the skin when the thing started healing. </sentence><sentence id="324">I...I couldn't sleep in the bed. </sentence><sentence id="325">For weeks, I would sleep on...on the runner on the floor next to the bed. </sentence><sentence id="326">I was just used to sleeping on the ground uh...Just curling up and covering myself with the blanket when I was in..in the forests of Poland. </sentence><sentence id="327">But we remained in...in town, which was by that time totally terrorized by the...uh..by the Nazis. </sentence><sentence id="328">From early war...uh...from early days of occupation, the Nazis employed the...the infamous method of collective responsibility. </sentence><sentence id="329">One single act of hostility against the Nazis or destruction of German property or interference with the war effort would result in the roundup of 10, 20, 40 hostages. </sentence><sentence id="330">People who simply happened to live nearby where the event occurred, and they would be put against the nearest wall and summary executed. </sentence><sentence id="331">So the terror of those days and fear that drove us and concern for survival are something that...that only in the last days I brought back to..to my memory having tried to put it out of my mind all these years in the United States. </sentence><sentence id="332">The war ended for us...the occupation by the Nazis ended for us about January 9 or 10, 1945 seemingly significant date for me because my birthday is January 12th. </sentence><sentence id="333">The Nazis withdrew. </sentence><sentence id="334">The Soviet offense had started after Christmas of 44 and within days, Kielce were under Russian artillery fire. </sentence><sentence id="335">A very curious thing happened to me then. </sentence><sentence id="336">I was...uh..living with my mother and my sister with one of my aunts who lived in a brick house, much sturdier than surrounding frame houses on the street. </sentence><sentence id="337">On the Yasna (ph) 27.Am I getting off the subject? </sentence><sentence id="338">Your fine, perfect. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="389">A: The Russian artillery is bombarding the city. </sentence><sentence id="390">We are hiding in...in wherever we can against the brick walls of the house that only has crawl...crawl space in part of the house. </sentence><sentence id="391">There are fires everything. </sentence><sentence id="392">Uh...My mother is not with us because a few days earlier she struck out for the cousins that lived in the country and had a flour mill to get some flour for us because, as always, we were short of food. </sentence><sentence id="393">So she is somewhere, and my sister and I with the rest of my aunt's family are hiding there, plus a number of neighbors that came into hide in the brick house. </sentence><sentence id="394">Uh...The...the barrage stops. </sentence><sentence id="395">It's...uh...it's a beautiful, sunny,  but very cold January day. </sentence><sentence id="396">The...the snow is crunching under your feet, but the sun is bright, blinding. </sentence><sentence id="397">We briefly...two men walk out in front of the house, and I followed them and I stand between them. </sentence><sentence id="398">And they are looking around and saying, "Oh, look there's a fire near Kinga (ph) gymnasium building. </sentence><sentence id="399">Maybe it's the building burning. </sentence><sentence id="400">And there's a fire over there." </sentence><sentence id="401">And I just stand between them, a kid. </sentence><sentence id="402">You know 17 year old or...or whatever it is. </sentence><sentence id="403">1945. </sentence><sentence id="404">Yes. </sentence><sentence id="405">And then suddenly I have this feeling. </sentence><sentence id="406">I do not hear a voice. </sentence><sentence id="407">I sense a voice in me saying, "What are you doing here? </sentence><sentence id="408">Get out of here?" </sentence><sentence id="409">So I obeyed it. </sentence><sentence id="410">I get scared. </sentence><sentence id="411">I turn around, walk into the very heavy wooden oak gate that is in the center of the very old fashioned, one-story house, take about 3 or 4 steps and suddenly bells are ringing in my ears. </sentence><sentence id="412">I smell sulphur...uh..plaster from...the ceiling falls on me and it's all over me. </sentence><sentence id="413">I'm white. </sentence><sentence id="414">And I cannot hear anything. </sentence><sentence id="415">I hear ringing in my ears. </sentence><sentence id="416">And people were rushing by me. </sentence><sentence id="417">My cousin, Andrew, and others are running out there and dragging in two bodies of the men that stood on both sides of me. </sentence><sentence id="418">And...uh...one of them is...is dead. </sentence><sentence id="419">Totally mutilated legs dangle like rag dolls, and the other one just expires. </sentence><sentence id="420">Uh... That shook me. </sentence><sentence id="421">And when my mother returned...uh...a day or two later and my family told her what happened, she simply said, "You are not meant to die then. </sentence><sentence id="422">You are meant to go on until the time for you to die came," because these two men obviously were not meant to live any longer. </sentence><sentence id="423">She...she has great faith. </sentence><sentence id="424">But, for us, the war ended that January. </sentence><sentence id="425">Russian troops moved in. </sentence><sentence id="426">Some of the uh, Russian organized and controlled first army Polish troops moved in, recruit...recruited or drafted from eastern provinces of pre-war Poland, and trickling into town started coming back first Jewish refugees who were with escaped or got somehow saved by going to the Soviet Union. </sentence><sentence id="427">Uh...Most of them, of course, were either in the military units or in the first administrative apparatus of the communist regime that came in and took over Kielce. </sentence><sentence id="428">And...uh...my memories is very dim whether school started or not. </sentence><sentence id="429">I don't think the school... Yes, the school started. </sentence><sentence id="430">The school started within a month or two because I remember even before the war was officially declared over on May 9, 1945, our gymnasium was already functioning and we were going back and enrolling in classes and...and...uh...around that time, April or...or May, us youngsters who only lived this heroic, teenage involvement in..in...in patriotism and fight against the Nazis started resurrecting our pre-War...uh..boy scout units in...in gymnasium and I was one of the...uh...leaders of the...the troop I guess you would call it in English that was organized, being re...reorganized in gymnasium. </sentence><sentence id="431">And we were, by the summer...by early summer of 45, we were planning our first camp even though we had nothing, but the enthusiasm of the young boys were such that we were just ready to even live without tents as long as we could get out of town and...and go somewhere and do our scouting thing. </sentence><sentence id="432">So we were planning a week's excursion into the...the mountains in Kielce region...uh..which were called Gory Swietokrzyskie, St.  0 Cross, Holy Cross Mountains. </sentence><sentence id="433">And my boys were...if you pardon me the expression, this is how I ever referred to them being their leader. </sentence><sentence id="434">You know, this just like in the old song...I'll take care of you. </sentence><sentence id="435">I'm 17, you're 16. </sentence><sentence id="436">But I was their...one of their leaders, so my boys were already in uniforms and were getting ready to leave the next day. </sentence><sentence id="437">And I think it was in July, but I'm not sure of the dates again. </sentence><sentence id="438">When we heard rumors that the...uh...that there is something funny going on, some kind of emotion, riot or civil commotion in..uh...along Shenetza (ph) which is a little stream that ran through...through Kielce and...uh...but I went there. </sentence><sentence id="439">And I started asking people what's going on...and people told me, "Oh, this is a house that is occupied by the Jews." </sentence><sentence id="440">And...uh and...uh...something funny is going on there because ...uh...a Polish, Christian Catholic boy was missing for a couple of days and...uh...and..uh...he was found and...uh.. he said that...that's where he was kept. </sentence><sentence id="441">And of course one of the most pernicious...uh...stories about the Jews...uh.. for centuries in Europe was that they had to use Christian blood for religious rituals. </sentence><sentence id="442">And so, of course, this population of this...of this town, I'm not going psycho-analyze them, but here we are for the first time not really afraid of..of terror of the Nazis. </sentence><sentence id="443">This population restless, unhappy because communists are taking over and most of the people were anti- communist. </sentence><sentence id="444">Uh...These...I...I'm trying to understand what happened, but I'm not going to try to understand. </sentence><sentence id="445">I'm going to try to tell you what I saw. </sentence><sentence id="446">And the only thing I saw was a large crowd of people surrounding this house and rumors flying back that the...that the military were entering upstairs where the quarters of the Jewish survivors were and the shots were fired and nobody knew who shoot...fired first, but there were casualties and there were arrests. </sentence><sentence id="447">And I saw one or two of my boys in scouting uniforms in the crowd, gawking. </sentence><sentence id="448">And I said, "What are you doing here in the scouting uniform?

( </sentence><sentence id="464">Pause) I read in the papers later that there were trials and they were not only trials of perpetrators of the killings, but all...also trials or at least retribution by various factions in the communist government, within the communist authority that controlled the city. </sentence><sentence id="465">And I am sure there are others who followed the events better and have more insight or more contact with the people who participated in these things, but they were some other...some people were trying to use this event for...for other purposes. </sentence><sentence id="466">Maybe some international party...uh..politics. </sentence><sentence id="467">But what was curious to me is the fact that I remember what my scout told me. </sentence><sentence id="468">Distinctly that it was the militzia (ph) that came and planted in a child's mind...the kid was probably scared. </sentence><sentence id="469">Undoubtedly the militzia (ph) just questioning him, "Were you...that's...Is that where you were kept?" </sentence><sentence id="470">And the child said, "Yes." </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="560">A: I was 17. ( </sentence><sentence id="561">Pause) To...to be honest, I didn't know what to do with this. </sentence><sentence id="562">I felt that there was some skullduggery going on in the way the child was being manipulated. </sentence><sentence id="563">Uh...But my main concern at that time was for the safety of my boys and that they do not in any way...uh...get in trouble. </sentence><sentence id="564">That's what motivated me to shoo them away from the...the crowd that surrounded the Jewish quarter. </sentence><sentence id="565">And I sensed the tragedy. </sentence><sentence id="566">But to a 17 year old, you cannot expect too much and I'm sorry to say that looking at myself from the vantage point of being 62...uh...even if we wanted to have done something with it, who were we to turn to? </sentence><sentence id="567">Perhaps that is why I am telling it to you today. </sentence><sentence id="568">Because that may just help unravel the roots of those events.

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="588">A: There was a tremendous reaction from the emerging....uh... civic organizations and church authorities. </sentence><sentence id="589">Uh...uh...Appeal to citizens to...to point out the guilty parties who participated in these events. </sentence><sentence id="590">And I don't even know how long the...the pogroms lasted, whether it was a day, whether it was 2 days. </sentence><sentence id="591">I have no recollection. </sentence><sentence id="592">I remember Bishop Katchmarick (ph) issuing a very strong appeal to people to uphold the law to protect the innocent, to...to report on...uh... commission of crimes to the authorities. </sentence><sentence id="593">Uh...Kielce to begin was...with was devastated by the war. </sentence><sentence id="594">There were ruins everywhere. </sentence><sentence id="595">There were  2 buildings that were lying in ruins. </sentence><sentence id="596">There wasn't a family that was not mourning a death of a son or a father or a brother that was either killed or executed or deported to the concentration camp. </sentence><sentence id="597">Uh...Every family practically was under such enormous, physical and...uh..uh...hardship and...uh...emotional pressure that we were literally survivors in every sense of the word. </sentence><sentence id="598">All of us! </sentence><sentence id="599">And it was awfully tragic that victims started turning on...on other victims. </sentence><sentence id="600">And...uh...for some reason...uh...which I don't understand at all, it happened in my native town. ( </sentence><sentence id="601">Pause) Kielce was trying to revive the pre-war community life. </sentence><sentence id="602">We were trying to catch up with our education. </sentence><sentence id="603">Some of us lost 2, 3, 4 years. </sentence><sentence id="604">We had kids graduating from high school who were 22 and 23 because during the war they had no opportunity to...to learn, to keep up with their education. </sentence><sentence id="605">We were, of course, survivors of a period in which every able bodied person, age 14 and up, had to work 10 hours a day, 6 days a week. </sentence><sentence id="606">Otherwise, we would be shipped to Germany to forced labor camps or to work in factories of the German war machine. </sentence><sentence id="607">We were given rations of food so...uh...most of us went often hungry. </sentence><sentence id="608">We were decimated by disease. </sentence><sentence id="609">Typhus, typhoid fever was prevalent. </sentence><sentence id="610">My mother...uh...survived typhoid fever. </sentence><sentence id="611">Us kids did not get sick. </sentence><sentence id="612">Uh...We were...uh...terrorized by continuous...uh...dragnets. </sentence><sentence id="613">Wyponokie (ph) we call it in Poland. </sentence><sentence id="614">You walk on a street from your house to your aunt's house, and suddenly the street is closed by the gendarmes on both sides. </sentence><sentence id="615">And all the people are surrounded and asked to show their papers. </sentence><sentence id="616">Are you working somewhere? </sentence><sentence id="617">Who are you? </sentence><sentence id="618">What's your occupation? </sentence><sentence id="619">What are you doing now? </sentence><sentence id="620">And whoever appeared not employed in a meaningful way that involves supporting the German war effort was being singled up, put in a truck, shipped to the railroad station and put on a train and shipped to Germany. </sentence><sentence id="621">There were hardly any families that did not feel the...the tragedy of war.

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="707">A: My father, of course, immediately started efforts to bring us over to the United States. </sentence><sentence id="708">Unfortunately, the communist authorities, while giving permission to my mother to leave Poland officially, denied permission to children. </sentence><sentence id="709">Uh...We reasoned that this was because in those heady days with the communism they thought they could indoctrinate the young generation and...and use them and didn't want to lose them. </sentence><sentence id="710">A decision was then made that I would escape from Poland and if the road...route was successful, my sister would follow. </sentence><sentence id="711">So...uh...in the meantime I graduated from high school and made a successful escape from Poland to Sweden in the bottom of a coal freighter on December 31, 1948.And I was to be followed by my sister in a few months. </sentence><sentence id="712">I made it to a lovely, colorful, untouched by war, just fabulously looking town in Sweden called Goteborg. </sentence><sentence id="713">And from there I managed to...uh...to come to the United States within 3 days of my 21st birthday when my non-quota visa, immigrant visa was expiring. </sentence><sentence id="714">So I was lucky again. </sentence><sentence id="715">And, I met...I flew from New York LaGuardia Airport to Detroit Old Willowrun airport and looked up my father in the telephone directory and it's a very funny feeling to find your father's name in a strange directory in a strange city. </sentence><sentence id="716">And...uh...called his number. </sentence><sentence id="717">There was no answer and I stood at the counter not knowing what to do and I heard my name. </sentence><sentence id="718">He recognized me from the back. </sentence><sentence id="719">And I was a big strapping 6 footer at the age of 21.Uh...My mother came in May of that year, 85 officially. </sentence><sentence id="720">But my sister trying the same route...uh...did not make it, was caught by the communists and imprisoned and eventually came to the United States in 1958 when the conditions in Poland under Gemolka (ph) underwent a famous fall so they would permit families to reunite. </sentence><sentence id="721">Went to school. </sentence><sentence id="722">Decided to study law. </sentence><sentence id="723">Graduated in 56, and started a law practice with then my father-in- law in Polish-American community on the west side of Detroit. </sentence><sentence id="724">In 62, I was contacted by a Congressman of Polish descent, John Dingle, and asked if I know of any identifiable Polish-Americans who would like to work on a foreign claimants settlement commission in Washington to assist in administering a program of adjudication of claims for properties lost in Poland. </sentence><sentence id="725">And after looking around I decided that I'm the one (laughing) for other reasons as well. </sentence><sentence id="726">So I accepted an appointment as a staff attorney on a foreign claims settlement commission and worked on a Polish claims program for about 3 years. </sentence><sentence id="727">Within 6 months....no, I came in August of 62. </sentence><sentence id="728">By Spring of 63, I was being sent to our American Embassy in Warsaw to help run our field office to gather documentation to support claims of the American nationals for properties. </sentence><sentence id="729">A lot of those claims were by the American relatives or...uh...survivors of the Jewish population of Poland...uh...who were claiming properties that were confiscated or destroyed during the war or after the war. </sentence><sentence id="730">And for 3 months in 1963, I traveled through Poland collecting documents...uh...seeking  5 evidence because our function was not simply to sit as a tribunal and tell claims...show me, prove to me, but we were actively assisting them in this effort. </sentence><sentence id="731">And at that time I came in contact with a...a...personnel of the Jewish Historical Institute in Warsaw, and obtained from them a number of valuable documents and...and publications, some of which I have turned over to you for the...uh... Museum. </sentence><sentence id="732">And it is that period of time that kind of gave me a broader perspective on the enormity of what happened between 1939 and 1945. </sentence><sentence id="733">Only then when traveling to little towns and villages of Poland, I was able to see the devastation, the...the tremendous...the tremendous losses that were inflicted on the population, especially the Jewish population. </sentence><sentence id="734">pause </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="765">Q: Do you hear personal testimony as well? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="767">A: Yes. </sentence><sentence id="768">Testimony was, in most cases, limited to description of property, possessions, but in many situations the survivors of those years...uh...who came to the commission offices here in Washington testified as to their...uh..experiences during the Nazi's occupation. </sentence><sentence id="769">And I'm sure the records of the Foreign Claims Settlement Commission, the so-called Polish Program have that testimony and they're probably in the U.S. Archives. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="773">Q: How did you...you first. </sentence><sentence id="774">How did you handle all of this? </sentence><sentence id="775">How did you feel when you...your seeing these people and dealing with these people. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="779">A: First, I wanted to do a good job. </sentence><sentence id="780">First, I wanted justice done. </sentence><sentence id="781">I did want to make sure that if there is any doubt, that doubt should be resolved in favor of the survivors. </sentence><sentence id="782">There were other families. </sentence><sentence id="783">We were, after all, involved in a rather futile attempt to at least compensate materially for the...the enormity of evil that happened to these families, both Jewish and Polish. </sentence><sentence id="784">Unfortunately, under American law, we had the obstacles, such as citizenship at the time of loss. </sentence><sentence id="785">And many, many people did not meet the requirement of U.S. citizenship by the time of loss occurred. </sentence><sentence id="786">We could not grant compensation award reparations to peoples who were not American nationals or citizens at the time the loss occurred. </sentence><sentence id="787">I remember distinctly one decision which I, myself, was very pleased about...uh...because we applied a legal principal that permitted granting reparations to a much greater number of people rather than if we simply applied the official date of confiscation of the...of the property...uh...by the communists regime. </sentence><sentence id="788">We used the concept of loss of use and enjoyment. </sentence><sentence id="789">Very often, communists in their profidious manipulation of the records and...and the law would leave the title and people, but would so restrict the rights of the owners or the ...uh...benefits that owners would derive from ownership of the property that for all intents and purposes, these people had all the burdens without any benefits. </sentence><sentence id="790">A  6 rental property for instance. </sentence><sentence id="791">So we then developed the concept that it was the loss of use and enjoyment of the property rather than the passage of title to the state that determined when people lost their possessions. </sentence><sentence id="792">And that's how we were able to...to award compensation to people who otherwise would not have gotten it. </sentence><sentence id="793">On a deeper level (Pause) ....Dr. Kuzmack, it's very hard to think of those times without projecting on those times, what I feel today. </sentence><sentence id="794">We all evolve and we all become much more sensitized and much more aware of...uh...the measure of tragedy than at the time that we are involved in the mechanics or addressing this or that narrow issue. </sentence><sentence id="795">I cannot really tell how I felt about it because honestly the same goes for my life. </sentence><sentence id="796">Today, I think I'm a much more aware person. </sentence><sentence id="797">I'm much more in touch with my emotions than at that time. </sentence><sentence id="798">That's an honest answer. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="819">Q: Is there anything you would like to add? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="821">A: I felt a regret at times and I have tried to put it to rest because it was a naive regret that had I been older maybe I would have been able to do more when I saw inhumanity and evil of those years. </sentence><sentence id="822">At the same time, I'm...I'm honest enough to admit that it's a...it's a hope tinged with fear because I wonder how many of us would have lived up the ideal of really disregarding our own safety and our own obligation to our loved ones to help a fellow man. </sentence><sentence id="823">How many of us would really live up to this principle when tested? </sentence><sentence id="824">I think there is a awareness in Poland today which I sense from letters from relatives and friends and visits from friends and relatives...uh...what...what a great loss Poland suffered because of the extermination of its Jewish population. </sentence><sentence id="825">As a child, as a youngster, I read...uh..some of the greatest poets and writers of Poland who were Jews, Julian Tooly (ph) and...and so many others. </sentence><sentence id="826">Uh...Poland is impoverished. </sentence><sentence id="827">To what extent it could have been prevented or its...its enormity limited, who's to judge? </sentence><sentence id="828">I just hope that in my own generation and in my own family and in my own children...uh...not only I hope but I make sure that there is awareness of the fact that we're all brothers and sisters, that we're all...to the extent that we discriminate or deprive of rights another human being, we do it to ourselves. </sentence></p></dialogue>
