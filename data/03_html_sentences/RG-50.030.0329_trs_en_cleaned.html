<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="133">A: I recall that in 1940 -- as I said before Jewish children were not allowed to go to school. </sentence><sentence id="134">But I think the teacher -- not the teacher, he was in charge of the school. </sentence><sentence id="135">He liked us so much and we were very good students and he kind of overlooked this particular year 1940 and allowed us to go. </sentence><sentence id="136">But by 1941, we couldn't go to school anymore. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="141">Q: What else couldn't you do? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="143">A: We were not allowed to go outside the town, and people were just running and bringing in food, you know. </sentence><sentence id="144">Initially people were gathering in the houses and just listening what to do and how to go on with life. </sentence><sentence id="145">I had the grandma and I think there was 01:10  an uncle that had two sons, and the parents were taken away and the two sons came to live with us. </sentence><sentence id="146">I asked my mother and my two sisters, we asked should we run away to a village to hide someplace and the grandma was ready to go with us. </sentence><sentence id="147">She was about 74 years old but she had from her son the other two children and she said where will I leave them. </sentence><sentence id="148">So, she remained. </sentence><sentence id="149">She remained and at that moment when we were ready to leave the little town for a village they started shooting. </sentence><sentence id="150">So, we run away quickly. </sentence><sentence id="151">We didn't know where we were running, but we run into a neighboring village that my mother was dealing with some of the people and we went into hiding into barns. </sentence><sentence id="152">They took us into barns and we couldn't go out during the day, only at night. </sentence><sentence id="153">We were there for quite a while and we were going from one family to the other. </sentence><sentence id="154">They took us for a while and then they said we cannot hold you because at that time, it came out a decree that if the polish people will hold Jews, they will be killed themselves. </sentence><sentence id="155">Or they gave them a prize, like five pounds of sugar to give out the Jewish person or the Jewish family. </sentence><sentence id="156">So, they were not able, even my mother's best friends, they said you know I would like to help you maybe by yourself but not with a whole family and you have to leave my premises. </sentence><sentence id="157">So we were wandering from one family to another. </sentence><sentence id="158">This was going on maybe more than a year that we were wandering from one family to another and this is how we lived, 01:12 and then one day my mother went into a family that she was very poor and approximately her children were our age. </sentence><sentence id="159">How my mother came to the thought to buy or to offer her money she should go to the church and to take out some kind of documents that we should leave the place where we were born or the surrounding villages that they knew us, and she said she dressed us in very long dresses and scarves over the heads and we started to look like 15, 16 year old girls and at that time the Germans were catching people to go to work to Germany. </sentence><sentence id="160">You know we were working around the Germans, the Gestapo and nobody caught us. </sentence><sentence id="161">Nobody caught us and we were like disappointed. </sentence><sentence id="162">So, at one point my mother said she took the train, she brought the kids for the train and we went to Warsaw. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="185">Q: Okay. </sentence><sentence id="186">I want to stop you a moment. </sentence><sentence id="187">I have some questions. </sentence><sentence id="188">So, you were hiding out in these barns and fields and did you have to pay these people something to keep you? </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="208">Q: What was their reaction towards the Germans and the Nazis? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="210">A: They liked them. </sentence><sentence id="211">The Germans -- in the beginning they brought in a certain prosperity. </sentence><sentence id="212">You know they were wheeling and dealing and selling things, I don't recall what kind of merchandise but there was a certain prosperity that arrived with the Germans at that time. </sentence><sentence id="213">The Polish population, they I would say that they were silently working together with the Germans. </sentence><sentence id="214">They were indifferent to the Jews. </sentence><sentence id="215">They wanted to get rid of these Jews. </sentence><sentence id="216">Poland had three million Jews before the war. </sentence><sentence id="217">This was the largest Jewish population in Poland, and the Polish people were 75 percent illiterate at that time and the churches had the big influence morally, politically whatnot and they knew, they were told that the Jews killed Jesus and the Jews are non desired to be there. </sentence><sentence id="218">So, like the rest of the world, they tried to overlook that you are human beings and when you are a Jew you 01:16 have no right to live. </sentence><sentence id="219">There were very few of them, that they were real Catholics, and they really suffered from this point, that the people are getting killed like that. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="253">Q: I have just one more question for you and you were going to tell me that you went to Warsaw. </sentence><sentence id="254">As a young girl was -- at this time was there a sense of adventure about this, or was it frightening, do you remember? </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="255">A: Ninety percent was fear, but there was maybe ten percent of adventure. </sentence><sentence id="256">I think in moment of fear you cannot appreciate life at all. </sentence><sentence id="257">You were trying to run from one place to another, just to survive, just to sleep over the night, just for another day and to hope that someday this will end. </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="258">Q: Now, your mother's plan was to then go to Warsaw? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="260">A: It wasn't her plan to go to Warsaw. </sentence><sentence id="261">She wanted to run away from the territories that we were known, or maybe we could be recognized. </sentence><sentence id="262">So, we went and we bought tickets, she bought tickets for all of us and we went on a train and this train was going to Warsaw. </sentence><sentence id="263">There was a lot of people that they were smuggling like food and other articles from villages, the food probably mostly, and she started to talk to somebody on the train and she gave an address to a German Volksdeutsche, that they needed help for their homes. </sentence><sentence id="264">The Volksdeutsche, either she was a Volksdeutsche or he, so they had certain privileges by the German government they received all kinds of goodies. </sentence><sentence id="265">I don't know if they received any money, but they were especially elite like, and they started to hire help. </sentence><sentence id="266">So, my mother was hired in Warsaw. </sentence><sentence id="267">I don't know where we slept. </sentence><sentence id="268">We probably got up and got off the train at night or in the morning and she got this particular address from the other women. </sentence><sentence id="269">She was a Volksdeutsche, and he had a wife and four children and she was pregnant with the fifth and she needed help. </sentence><sentence id="270">So, he hired my mother right away with my twin sister and this lady directed me to my family also a Volksdeutsch family that at the time I think I was approaching 14 already. </sentence><sentence id="271">This was in 1943. </sentence><sentence id="272">She hired me to be with her children I should go to park and to play with children or go with children and do for the children things. </sentence><sentence id="273">So, my main job was to help a little in the kitchen. </sentence><sentence id="274">I did some marketing and basically to play with the children. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="290">Q: Where did they think you came from? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="292">A: We told them that we run away from the territory of Lublin, that the Germans chased us out and they took away our possessions and they called us Fluechtlinge (refugees), we (were) chased out 01:21 from our homes. </sentence><sentence id="293">And as I said, I emphasized that to speak very well Polish and to be from a small town, we thought we maybe assimilated as other Jews. </sentence><sentence id="294">In other words, our Polish language was so good that we could pass by that nobody should have a hint that we were Jewish. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="299">Q: So, this was in 1943 when you got to Warsaw? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="301"> A We arrived I believe in late 1942 in Warsaw. </sentence><sentence id="302">It was around November, in the fall, and the Ghetto started to burn the next year, in 1943. </sentence><sentence id="303">So, I was at that time in Warsaw. </sentence><sentence id="304">I was going for walks with the children and I have seen Jews going from place to place like  hundred Jews together. </sentence><sentence id="305">They were -- their clothes were torn. </sentence><sentence id="306">They had the yellow swastikas (means stars of David) on them and they were going from one place to another. </sentence><sentence id="307">I don't know where they were going, but I stopped and I looked at them and it inserted in me such a pain. </sentence><sentence id="308">In a way I was happy that I wasn't one of them. </sentence><sentence id="309">I could have been there among them, but the pain was unbearable. </sentence><sentence id="310">I turned away and I cried that nobody should see me that I was in such pain. </sentence><sentence id="311">When I was in this family, I think this was my mother's teaching that we should all go to church. </sentence><sentence id="312">So, I asked the family where is the nearest church, and I took the children every Sunday, and I dressed them and I went to church every Sunday with them. </sentence><sentence id="313">Around -- and this is how we lived. </sentence><sentence id="314">My sister had an incident the older one she was walking in the street and a woman from our place recognized her and she started to call her. </sentence><sentence id="315">So, she run away and we were told that. </sentence><sentence id="316">So, there was a period of time when we were afraid to walk the streets, you know, how big is whole Poland. </sentence><sentence id="317">There may be some people coming shopping and being on the street, somebody can recognize. </sentence><sentence id="318">So every moment, every step that you did, you had a certain fear in yourself. </sentence><sentence id="319">There was a fear of being recognized. </sentence><sentence id="320">At one point, my family, the husband of the wife brought up a girl and she had a document, she had dark hair, she looked like a typical Jewish girl, and he started to interrogate her and she had the paper and the seal was like of a penny, or a dime, and he started to question her and he took her away to the Gestapo, and he interrogated her in front of me. </sentence><sentence id="321">You can imagine how I felt at that time when he interrogated the girl and he did bring her to the Gestapo. </sentence><sentence id="322">But life was going on until about July when all of a sudden two Gestapos showed up in the 01:25 apartment and they said to my lady, to the wife of this man, you have here "ein Juedisches Kind", you have a Jewess here. </sentence><sentence id="323">She looked at him, I have a Jewish girl here?This is not possible. </sentence><sentence id="324">And she opened the bedroom and she showed him Hitler. </sentence><sentence id="325">She said, Hitler is my god. </sentence><sentence id="326">How would I be able to hold a Jewish girl in my household. </sentence><sentence id="327">She denied it, and I will never forget this. </sentence><sentence id="328">I was peeling potatoes at that time, and I became almost stiff, and he was talking to her that this young girl has a mother with another girl, and so she started to swear to them that it's not possible that she's Jewish. </sentence><sentence id="329">Either her mother or the other sister is Jewish. </sentence><sentence id="330">She will swear by that. </sentence><sentence id="331">So, he said tell her and he spoke to me German but I stood with the back, not to understand from Jewish to German is very easily to be understood and I pretended I don't understand. </sentence><sentence id="332">So, she told me in Polish that I should get dressed and I should go to my mother. </sentence><sentence id="333">I had no other choice. </sentence><sentence id="334">It was July. </sentence><sentence id="335">It was hot, whatever I took and the two Gendarmes took me down to the street and I was going over to my mother and the fear in my mind what my mother will see if she will see me with the two Gendarmes going there. </sentence><sentence id="336">But while 01:27:  I was walking with them one to the other said, "Ich glaube nicht dass das ist ein Juedisches Kind", in German he said I don't believe that this is a Jewish child and this give me such a strength that I recovered myself of the initial fear and when I walked into my mother, my mother saw me, I saw my mother is pale and is dropping like she's falling and my sister and they start to talk to this man at the time, this wife of his just gave birth to the fifth child, and he happens to be home, the husband and he was a high official in Warsaw. </sentence><sentence id="337">He was an SS man, you know, he was working in Allee Sucha (??). </sentence><sentence id="338">Allee Sucha was like they would arrest in a criminal court. </sentence><sentence id="339">Once you go in there, forget about it, nobody comes out. </sentence><sentence id="340">So, his wife started to cry. </sentence><sentence id="341">She said how can I be left alone. </sentence><sentence id="342">She gave birth and on top of it she was very ill I think she had a lung infection, pneumonia, and she was about to die. </sentence><sentence id="343">I think she eventually did. </sentence><sentence id="344">And he said to the Germans, to the two SS people, you know, I'll go with them. </sentence><sentence id="345">I can swear by God that they are not Jewish people, but I'll go with them. </sentence><sentence id="346">And he emphasized also that they are going to the church with my children and he would never allow himself to lose his high position that the was a high ranking man and to hold Jewish people in his place. </sentence><sentence id="347">He dressed himself and he went with us to Allee Shukha. </sentence><sentence id="348">When J arrived there I did not know my older sister was already there. </sentence><sentence id="349">What happened with my older sister, she said that she's from a village some place, but she had beautiful underwear and she wore glasses and this woman that she worked for, she said, you know, you don't look like a peasant. </sentence><sentence id="350">You look like you come from a learned family and you wear glasses. </sentence><sentence id="351">Tell me, I think you are Jewish. </sentence><sentence id="352">So, my sister didn't say yes or no, but she started to cry. </sentence><sentence id="353">As soon as she started to 01:30: cry, they arrested her. </sentence><sentence id="354">They also took two Germans and they also brought her to Allee Shukha. </sentence><sentence id="355">When we came there I saw her in a different room with two Germans and I and my mother they took us by train, a trailer car. </sentence><sentence id="356">I looked at my mother, and I knew that within a couple of hours we will be dead, that we are already in the hands of the SS.When we arrived there, they started to ask us about religion, if I know the religion the prayers, so I knew the prayers by heart.

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="678">Q: A Jewish head, what did she mean? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="680">A: I was too smart. </sentence><sentence id="681">I was so smart that I am thinking like a 01:48: real Jew. </sentence><sentence id="682">So, she said this Easter you will go with me to the church and you will do the confession in front of a priest. </sentence><sentence id="683">When she told me that I almost died inside. </sentence><sentence id="684">I said how will I be able to do that? </sentence><sentence id="685">I went to the church. </sentence><sentence id="686">I was hiding someplace in the corner. </sentence><sentence id="687">I said the prayer, whatever I said, nobody was listening to me if I said correctly or not, and here I will have to stand in front of a priest and to say all those prayers, and she was standing right behind my back. </sentence><sentence id="688">I kneeled down -- again, I brought myself the catechism, this is a  religious book, and there was no electricity and I bought candles, and where I took the money from the candles I don't recall, and at night I was learning the catechism from the beginning to the end. </sentence><sentence id="689">And I must say I had a terrific head. </sentence><sentence id="690">I had a good memory. </sentence><sentence id="691">I don't know if this was out of necessity or I was young or I was brilliant, and I knew all those prayers. </sentence><sentence id="692">So, the holidays came closer and I prepared myself like every night and when she went to sleep I put on the candle and I was studying and I went in front of the priest and I kneeled down and I said you have to unburden yourself with all the sins that you committed during the year, and I was I think past 14 at that time, and I really was an innocent child, what could I have sinned. </sentence><sentence id="693">You know what I told the priest? </sentence><sentence id="694">That I was saying bad things about my mother which wasn't true, but I had nothing else to say. </sentence><sentence id="695">He looked at me and he saw such a young face and he gave me a prayer 30 times to say I should cleanse myself with those prayers and I went to the corner of the church and I said all the prayers, and I came out of the church and I was very, very relieved. </sentence><sentence id="696">Believe me, since then she never said that I had a Jewish head on my shoulders. </sentence><sentence id="697">This was around Easter time. </sentence><sentence id="698">I think around end of June I started to see Russian soldiers coming in, and they said that the Germans are running away already from the territories that I was there, but I couldn't believe it. </sentence><sentence id="699">They were dirty, they were torn. </sentence><sentence id="700">The uniforms that they wore they looked like they run away from concentration camps themselves. </sentence><sentence id="701">It didn't look to me like military people. </sentence><sentence id="702">I was sitting quiet but I was running over to my mother and I said you know I think the Germans are going. </sentence><sentence id="703">We have already the Russians. </sentence><sentence id="704">She said be quiet and sit still and don't talk to nobody. </sentence><sentence id="705">We have to see and wait what will go on. </sentence><sentence id="706">Then in August I don't know if I heard from people or papers, I saw that Lublin is already free. </sentence><sentence id="707">Lublin is freed by the Russian people. </sentence><sentence id="708">I went again to tell my mother this news, and she started -- I started to feel like you know she was stepping on me and I was doing a lot of chores and no matter what I did when she was killing a pig she needed maybe 50 pails of water and I had to carry it by myself and I just felt the evenings that I couldn't do this any more. </sentence><sentence id="709">She started to get very rude and I had the sense of feeling that I was already liberated in a way. </sentence><sentence id="710">The Russians are here already why should I perform such work and she doesn't deserve it. </sentence><sentence id="711">So, I went to my mother and I told her that I'm going to leave this lady because she became unbearable to me. </sentence><sentence id="712">She said sit another couple of months and we'll see what will 01:53 develop. </sentence><sentence id="713">But I packed myself up. </sentence><sentence id="714">I can only tell you that I had only one pair of shoes and one little underwear, my whole thing was a little package, and I took this package one day and I said to mother I arrived at mother's place and said you can kill me here. </sentence><sentence id="715">I am not going back to that woman. </sentence><sentence id="716">She's a real witch, and I don't want to suffer any more. </sentence><sentence id="717">My clothes started to fall apart. </sentence><sentence id="718">You know as you grow you start to expand so I started to get holes in my clothes and she wouldn't buy me nothing. </sentence><sentence id="719">There was a certain resentment and anger, so I was working only for the food. </sentence><sentence id="720">But really the liberation and knowing that the Germans are going, I wanted to see what will be next. </sentence><sentence id="721">And when I said to my mother that even if she'll kill me, I'm not going back to the woman, she had no choice. </sentence><sentence id="722">So, she said okay you will sleep here. </sentence><sentence id="723">The next day I walked out into the garden and there were a lot  of -- at this Volksdeutsch, the man that my mother worked for, he run away already. </sentence><sentence id="724">There was no supervision over nobody, over the food that they have grown it was just like everybody lived by themselves. </sentence><sentence id="725">I met a man, listen to that, and he was an adult, I was at the time already close to 15, and he took me aside in the garden and he said I suspect that you are a Jewish girl and your mother too, with the other sister. </sentence><sentence id="726">I can tell you that in Lublin there is already the Jewish committee from America that they came and they established, and you are too young to live here in the villages and you will ruin yourselves. </sentence><sentence id="727">Go to Lublin and there will be new hope for you. </sentence><sentence id="728">I was afraid to tell my mother. </sentence><sentence id="729">I couldn't believe my ears what he told me. </sentence><sentence id="730">I didn't know if he wants to convince me that you know that I'm Jewish that I should confess or he really wants to help me. </sentence><sentence id="731">So, I didn't tell my mother that this guy spoke to me. </sentence><sentence id="732">But I told my mother that I heard that the Lublin there are Jews already, that they are congregating the old survivors are there, that they are running to Lublin. </sentence><sentence id="733">So, she said let's sit another couple of 01:56: months. </sentence><sentence id="734">Don't talk to nobody that you are Jewish and we'll see what will happen. </sentence><sentence id="735">She was pulling time. </sentence><sentence id="736">She wanted to reassure herself that we shouldn't be too hasty to make a step forward that we shouldn't get lost. </sentence><sentence id="737">You know what I did. </sentence><sentence id="738">Once a Russian soldier spoke to me and | asked him if he can bring me to Lublin and he said he's going in that direction&gt; I was fearless, and I said I'll go and I'll take a look by myself. </sentence><sentence id="739">I went on a big truck. </sentence><sentence id="740">He didn't touch me, you know I didn't think of it that he will abuse me or rape me or something like that. </sentence><sentence id="741">Somehow I was so innocent and I believed in the goodness of the people that they liberated me that he cannot do nothing wrong to me. </sentence><sentence id="742">I came to Lublin and I go on the street and I looked at someone that look to me like a Jewish person and I asked him in Polish do you know where the Jewish Gemeinde is here? </sentence><sentence id="743">So, he asked you are you Amkho. </sentence><sentence id="744">Amkho was Jewish code word for being Jewish. </sentence><sentence id="745">I couldn't answer him in the Jewish language because my tongue just couldn't speak any more Jewish. </sentence><sentence id="746">I told him in Polish that yes I am a Jewish girl. </sentence><sentence id="747">That I am one of the survivors and I am looking for the Gemeinde. </sentence><sentence id="748">When I came there, they met me there and they tried to talk to me and I told them that I have a mother left near Sokolove? </sentence><sentence id="749">Polaski, and he said that I should bring her here with my sister and they will be maybe able to give us some lodging and we will be able to start to live as Jews again. </sentence><sentence id="750">End of Tape #1  Tape #2 </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="825">Q: So, you arrived in Lublin and who are these people that you met? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="827">A: You know when we arrived in Lublin, they had a place they called Dom Peretz. </sentence><sentence id="828">A Peretz was a famous scholar [writer] or I think that was probably related with the history of Palestine before the war, so there was such a home like an organization where they met. </sentence><sentence id="829">It was called Dom Peretza, or the House of Peretz. </sentence><sentence id="830">People went there daily to meet other people and to hear what is going on, just to communicate and how to live and how to organize our lives. </sentence><sentence id="831">So, my mother met there people that she knew from before the war that they had already an apartment there and they recommended a small apartment on Lubartovska 18 in Lublin. </sentence><sentence id="832">02:03: </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="871">A: I skipped this part. </sentence><sentence id="872">You see when we were liberated already and I ran away from that lady and I didn't want to work with her, so and we were talking about Lublin so my mother took my twin sister and she bought her a ticket to go to the older sister where she was in Warsaw, and this is for the first time that she knew that we were alive and that she is alive and she was there and we brought her to us where we were together where my mother was when everybody was running away. </sentence><sentence id="873">I'm telling you there was food, plenty of everything because there was nobody to take charge so my mother was the whole  housekeeper there. </sentence><sentence id="874">So, my sister came there too, and then all of us we proceeded to Lublin. </sentence><sentence id="875">02:06: </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="881">Q: When you got Lublin, you found an apartment? </sentence></p></dialogue>
