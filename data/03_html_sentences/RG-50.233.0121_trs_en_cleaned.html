<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="662">A: Cattle cars, yeah. </sentence><sentence id="663">One more thing that I should mention because it was significant. </sentence><sentence id="664">Was adding to our tortures was the amount of bedbugs that was eating you alive during the night and you couldn't escape because when you even slept on the table providing every leg of the table into a pail of water, they were crawling on the wall and then on the ceiling and dropping on your body from the ceiling directly. </sentence><sentence id="665">It was amazing. </sentence><sentence id="666">It was completely impossible to fight them. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="672">Q: They give you some food within the prison? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="674">A: Yes, you were getting very small amount. </sentence><sentence id="675">Well now things were rolling very fast now because between Warsaw and Piajkov the very next big station going west from Warsaw few guys who worked in Poviak in the machine shop, they somehow smuggled hand drill at their body so when I found myself with them in the same cattle car, with small holes they drill through a few planks, wooden planks, removed it from the top and you could slide down and upward between the channels, steel channels there were wooden planks. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="678">Q: This was the floor of the car? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="680">A: No, that was side, between the buffers, between the cars, parallel with the trucks. </sentence><sentence id="681">And they removed few planks, enough for human body to go through. </sentence><sentence id="682">They just placed themselves nicely under the buffers and one after another started escaping because the caboose where the soldiers were never expected first somebody might escape. </sentence><sentence id="683">They were playing cards or something, did not paying attention. </sentence><sentence id="684">So the first few, seven only, were able to escape. </sentence><sentence id="685">I was also in the line to escape but the first shot was fired as noticed them running away. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="692">Q: This was daytime? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="694">A: Daytime, yes. </sentence><sentence id="695">And their nice situation was that the machinist were appalled so he rode the engine for another maybe half a mile before he stopped. </sentence><sentence id="696">So they had enough area to be separated from the train so they didn't bother to chase them. </sentence><sentence id="697">But all the madness they concentrated on the car where we were in. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="702">Q: Right, somebody was going to suffer for this. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="704">A: Right, so when the train stopped, the first SS jumped on the buffer, taking advantage of this open spot through which they escaped and he emptied entire magazine of the machine gun. </sentence><sentence id="705">So he killed two guys and he wounded about five guys. </sentence><sentence id="706">I heard only whistle above my head so for the first time I had a barrel of the gun facing against me. </sentence><sentence id="707">That was the first time. </sentence><sentence id="708">Immediately they opened the doors and they took us all out and it was some small how to say, it's not village,   it's not town. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="715">Q: It's the railroad siding? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="717">A: Railroad siding, people who lived closed to railroad tracks. </sentence><sentence id="718">Put us against the fence with two machine guns right on both sides and the officer started telling us now who was the leader we want to know or you will all be shot. </sentence><sentence id="719">So people next to me already started giving certain smell away and everything physiological part of your body is very weak if you're under duress. </sentence><sentence id="720">And something was telling me all the time that this is not the place where you're going to die and I was kept so I went cool. </sentence><sentence id="721">Now we were lucky. </sentence><sentence id="722">In our group there was one fellow who spoke perfect German. </sentence><sentence id="723">We knew German language but not to such extent as could assume you are of German origin. </sentence><sentence id="724">But this guy was fantastic and he told with certain respect. </sentence><sentence id="725">You should know before you execute us he said that it was not our will. </sentence><sentence id="726">They had gun, they had instruments, everything ready for their escape and it was not our fault that you have not probably cleared them or caught them when you were loading us at the platform. </sentence><sentence id="727">And that was reason that he got mad but he realized that he was telling the truth. </sentence><sentence id="728">It is possible. </sentence><sentence id="729">That was not a story but possible to accept. </sentence><sentence id="730">And he opened next two cars, split the group in half and put additional guys on both cars and we quietly arrived to Auschwitz. </sentence><sentence id="731">That was eleven o'clock in the evening. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="747">Q: So it was a full days journey? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="749">A: Full day journey. </sentence><sentence id="750">And the soldiers were still mad at us and they were wounding people with bayonets pushing us between the platform, railroad platform and the main gate of the camp. </sentence><sentence id="751">It was also quite an area, maybe half a kilometer or so. </sentence><sentence id="752">So during this small distance they still had a chance to wound few prisoners with their bayonet. </sentence><sentence id="753">When we arrived there nothing happened. </sentence><sentence id="754">We were in such a disarray and tired. </sentence><sentence id="755">The very next morning they told us to undress. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="763">Q: Where did they hold you overnight? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="765">A: In one of the barracks -- get undressed, washed, and before we got cup of tea you might call. </sentence><sentence id="766">That was something -- combination of all kind of herbs collected from the fields dried and they were making tea out of this weeds, giving us to drink every morning. </sentence><sentence id="767">So I didn't drink, I only rinsed my mouth and brushed my teeth. </sentence><sentence id="768">The next thing was to be sure that everybody's name they have and we received a tattoo. </sentence><sentence id="769">And please mark the number, 119431 </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="775">Q: So they issued you the uniforms also with the vinkel on it? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="777">A: Oh no, not yet. </sentence><sentence id="778">Only the next day or so. </sentence><sentence id="779">So I was taken to one of the barracks and there were attendants checking twice. </sentence><sentence id="780">First time at six o'clock in the morning and second time at six o'clock at night. </sentence><sentence id="781">Since the entire area was still not completely adjusted the ground was mud so after rain, there were puddles. </sentence><sentence id="782">That was my first experience with the assistant to kapo. </sentence><sentence id="783">You're supposed to stand in a row that would be perfect horizontally, 90 degrees between rows and lines. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="791">Q: This was the Appell? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="793">A: Appell, yes. </sentence><sentence id="794">So when there was a puddle, huge puddle in front of me so I stood little bit off the line, the guy came to me and pushed me into the puddle with tremendous blow with a stick that they were carrying similar to the baseball stick, baseball bat, and he said, you SOB you are   afraid of what, are you gonna drink this water.. From now on don't forget that you are not a man you are only a number. </sentence><sentence id="795">And I think that was quite characteristic. </sentence><sentence id="796">I never forgot this because I realized that I was only a number from now on. </sentence><sentence id="797">After two weeks being in Birkenau.. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="804">Q: Were you pretty much idle at that time, they weren't working you? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="806">A: Yeah, we were working on the Fraulager that means preparing the area to be occupied by women that's supposed to arrive to Birkenau. </sentence><sentence id="807">Birkenau is not Auschwitz. </sentence><sentence id="808">Please distinguish these two locations. </sentence><sentence id="809">One is apart from another approximately one mile. </sentence><sentence id="810">And all transports to Birkenau always, not to Auschwitz just like my transport. </sentence><sentence id="811">After two weeks I was transferred to Auschwitz thanks to my cousins because they were first in Auschwitz and they noticed from the list obtained from Schreibshtuber that I was in transport and they took me under pretext that I am sick. </sentence><sentence id="812">They took me to Kreinkinbau, that means hospital in Auschwitz located -- buildings, number of buildings, I think 24 or 25 something like that. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="820">Q: They told you to pretend you were sick? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="822">A: Pretend I am sick, yeah. </sentence><sentence id="823">So one guard and me walked from Birkenau to Auschwitz and when I arrived I met immediately I saw my cousin but he told me pretend that we don't know each other. </sentence><sentence id="824">He placed me in the hospital and I was there for three days only and then remain in Auschwitz but still since I did not have two weeks quarantine that was required for all newcomers we were called Tzuganga. </sentence><sentence id="825">Tsugang is the new arrival. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="830">Q: What did you say you were sick with? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="832">A: Cold, cold, yeah, fever. </sentence><sentence id="833">I was there not quite two weeks as on quarantine because I fainted in the next week or so standing in line for Appell and when I was first time, I met these two gentlemen from my hometown. </sentence><sentence id="834">Their names just to record them I have to mention Jan Musdorf and Oleg Guretsky and they saved my life because when I went to hospital for the second time I really had pneumonia in full swing with pleurisy, water in my lungs, completely flooded, and if not for care of these two guys I wouldn't live today. </sentence><sentence id="835">Unfortunately I must tell you that one of them, Jan Musdorf, was executed as a member of the Underground. </sentence><sentence id="836">Somebody squealed when he was in camp in Auschwitz and he was executed together with other Polish patriots at the end of 1943. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="842">Q: With pneumonia did you go back to the hospital? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="844">A: No, I was recuperating and my friends since my cousin was an old prisoner, since June of 1940, he had many, many friends, and therefore they respected old prisoners. </sentence><sentence id="845">I was kept in this block where there were after illness you had to recuperate. </sentence><sentence id="846">Usually you were staying one week in hospital SS doctor was coming and sending you to gas chamber immediately as an Arbeit Shoy. </sentence><sentence id="847">Arbeit Shoy means afraid of work. </sentence><sentence id="848">So you had to be very careful. </sentence><sentence id="849">That's why I was always hiding, always hiding, lucky to have friends. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="856">Q: You stayed in a barrack hidden. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="858">A: Yeah, and now during my presence there, that was summer of 43, another atrocity occurred that could indicate what kind of inhuman treatment you could expect from the Nazis. </sentence><sentence id="859">They executed first thirteen members of the surveying group that one of them escaped. </sentence><sentence id="860">Thirteen were   executed at Black Wall on Block number eleventh and twelve remaining after one month just as an example that no one should even think about escaping, they hung them in front of all of us, twelve members of the surveying group. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="865">Q: So one was shot and the rest were...? </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="873">A: And watch yeah, and they were hung in front of the kitchen. </sentence><sentence id="874">They were hung there for at least three days before the bodies were taken away and gallows was removed. </sentence><sentence id="875">And while I was on that -- I received a red point which meant in the distinction of the camp meant he's not allowed to work outside the camp because they called us Flukfergocht which means suspected of any escape. </sentence><sentence id="876">I received this probably because the Gestapo had me from the first, my first escape from the Skarasheska Street. </sentence><sentence id="877">And maybe all the guys who were with me in this car, the train that was carrying us from Warsaw to Auschwitz. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="883">Q: This was that red triangle? </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="893">A: It was approximately one- inch diameter that was red on white piece of cloth and here were letters IL. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="895">Q: So it looked something like a Japanese flag? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="897">A: Like a Japanese flag, yeah. </sentence><sentence id="898">So my cousin said to me, Michael, you will live about two weeks, that's all, because that was the approximate time elapsing between.....they didn't want to keep the Im Lager, the Red Points in camp. </sentence><sentence id="899">You could be shot after six o'clock when you were walking. </sentence><sentence id="900">After working hours when you were walking in camp SS soldiers were trying to experiment or exercise their aim at the points and they were shooting at you like to a rabbit. </sentence><sentence id="901">So immediately after being discharged from quarantine I started working in the washroom. </sentence><sentence id="902">I was so good at folding the SS shirts that they gave me the storeroom to take care of, otherwise I had to keep every SS guys names inside my notebook and receiving the dirty clothes and giving them back already washed and cleaned and pressed and everything. </sentence><sentence id="903">So it was pretty good. </sentence><sentence id="904">That happened until December | of 1943. </sentence><sentence id="905">They decided to collect all the Red Point guys and put them to bunker. </sentence><sentence id="906">So I was taken to Block 11 which was known from the executions and that was the final stage of your -- like the death row or the final alley before they executed you. </sentence><sentence id="907">So you imagine how I felt. </sentence><sentence id="908">And that was the time when new commanding officer of Auschwitz arrived and this blood thirsty son-of-a-bitch was replaced by name of Liebehenstetshen (probably Arthur Liebehenschel) or something like that. </sentence><sentence id="909">He, would you believe, he said that during his presence there would be no more executions. </sentence><sentence id="910">So I was saved again but he concentrated all these guys who were on the black list and he sent us to another trip from   Auschwitz to Flossenburg in Bavaria, Germany. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="926">Q: How long were you held in Block 11? </sentence></p></dialogue>
