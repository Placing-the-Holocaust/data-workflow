<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="6">Q: Who did this? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="8">A: My Uncle who survived in Poland. </sentence><sentence id="9">He was the officer of Polish Air Force. </sentence><sentence id="10">| used the coins for about two years to survive. </sentence><sentence id="11">| didn't do nothing. </sentence><sentence id="12">It was, situation very chaotic in Poland. </sentence><sentence id="13">The Communists took over. </sentence><sentence id="14">The only chance was to go to school. </sentence><sentence id="15">So | thought, well, there's time to do it. </sentence><sentence id="16">| registered, | had saved all my documents, they were buried. </sentence><sentence id="17">All my documents except my High School Degree, which somehow was lost. </sentence><sentence id="18">But | did have my University Degrees, my University books, and attendance in the classes, and fortunately all the professors from my former University in Luneburg called Woolf (ph), they moved to Western Poland at that time, and | decided to move to Breslau, , former German territory, where the same professor of my former school, Woolf (ph), resided now in the same town. </sentence><sentence id="19">So | registered with no problem whatsoever. </sentence><sentence id="20">The papers were okay. </sentence><sentence id="21">The only thing is there was another Jewish student with me, don't recall exactly where he came from, but the remarks | heard in the class. </sentence><sentence id="22">It was, another two Jews. </sentence><sentence id="23">Hitler didn't kill all of you? </sentence><sentence id="24">You know, and the class was so annoying, not annoying but frightening even. </sentence><sentence id="25">And the common trend was at that time the refugees  Felix Horn 4 [Date not labeled] Page 4 coming back from Russia to Poland, not finding no purpose living in Poland, they all were going West. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="49">Q: Let me ask you about that a little bit, just the atmosphere in Poland at that time. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="51"> The Nazis were gone, but as you're describing, it was still not a very friendly </sentence></p><p><sentence id="52"> environment for Jews. </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="53">A: Right. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="55">Q: Can you tell me a little bit more about what that was like? </sentence><sentence id="56">What that felt like? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="59">A: Well, just to mention here that | was raised in a rather very modern Jewish home, although my home was kosher. </sentence><sentence id="60">Just because kosher was believed to be healthier and free of any contamination and so on. </sentence><sentence id="61">But my father was very progressive man. </sentence><sentence id="62">First he was a locksmith then he became an architect with night education and so on. </sentence><sentence id="63">He was a modern person. </sentence><sentence id="64">And we were living away from the Jewish center mostly so | had a formal Jewish education. </sentence><sentence id="65">| had a teacher come to my home teaching me religion, Torah, you know, Hum-ish (ph), all the biblical stories and so on. </sentence><sentence id="66">| never spoke Yiddish though. </sentence><sentence id="67">My parents spoke Yiddish to each other. </sentence><sentence id="68">| brought from school, | was going to a Catholic school, Yiddish was foreign to me. </sentence><sentence id="69">But | did understand everything they were saying but they were talking to me in Polish. </sentence><sentence id="70">| was so comfortable, my Polish is really impeccable. </sentence><sentence id="71">Poles have difficult time to look at me, | have Semitic look though. </sentence><sentence id="72">And then my Polish is so different   Felix Horn 5 [Date not labeled] Page 5 than the Jews in Poland. </sentence><sentence id="73">You can spot a Jew during the war, they looked super. </sentence><sentence id="74">In other words, they looked like typical Pole, Nordic type. </sentence><sentence id="75">Blonde, blue eyes, etc. </sentence><sentence id="76">| have a very short nose and the way they walked and so on you can tell the difference. </sentence><sentence id="77">Jews were walking more as bent , kind of scared a little bit. </sentence><sentence id="78">Even peaceful time, they are looking left and right. </sentence><sentence id="79">Someone might be hitting them or attack them or something. </sentence><sentence id="80">It didn't have to be a problem. </sentence><sentence id="81">You could be hit by one person, only two people, but young hooligans. </sentence><sentence id="82">Boys. </sentence><sentence id="83">Seven, nine, ten years old throwing stones, hitting with a piece of anything, an iron pipe, or whatever. </sentence><sentence id="84">So, you know, | was different. </sentence><sentence id="85">| was straight. </sentence><sentence id="86">My Polish was impeccable as they say but they knew who | was because | did return to my original name, which is not classical Polish but its not Jewish or Yiddish either. </sentence><sentence id="87">Horn is really rather German or Dutch. </sentence><sentence id="88">Van Horn, Von Horn, they are German names. </sentence><sentence id="89">So there was a little confusion, wanted to know who | am. </sentence><sentence id="90">No one dared to ask me exactly, are you a Jew or not? </sentence><sentence id="91">But then shortly in classes | didn't hide it. </sentence><sentence id="92">| didn't have no reason to hide it anymore. </sentence><sentence id="93">| was hiding all those years. </sentence><sentence id="94">So then they come and seek it, who | am. </sentence><sentence id="95">So there was people, | still have quite a few friends, Polish friends. </sentence><sentence id="96">But many of them were for safety or security reasons, to say, shy away from me. </sentence><sentence id="97">They exchange words with me rather polite and so on but not very cordial. </sentence><sentence id="98">So | felt very uncomfortable. </sentence><sentence id="99">And then during the pilgrim in Kielce in Poland  Felix Horn 6 [Date not labeled] Page 6 | got fired to existing situation, you know, and we felt, we felt very insecure. </sentence><sentence id="100">And being young, saying what am | going to do in Poland? </sentence><sentence id="101">| couldn't live in a country that | didn't have a grave to go to. </sentence><sentence id="102">We had nobody left. </sentence><sentence id="103">My Uncle went back to Yugoslavia. </sentence><sentence id="104">The other one converted to Christianity, the first one. </sentence><sentence id="105">They had nothing to do with Judaism, they had nothing to do with me either because | was Jewish. </sentence><sentence id="106">Not that he hated the Jews. </sentence><sentence id="107">No. </sentence><sentence id="108">Why did he do it? </sentence><sentence id="109">| don't know. </sentence><sentence id="110">We never talked about it. </sentence><sentence id="111">He was not a person | could have a dialogue with anyway. </sentence><sentence id="112">When | left | didn't say good-bye to him, he was not very interested. </sentence><sentence id="113">So talking to a few other students of other departments in University, the University school, philosophical department, so on and so on. </sentence><sentence id="114">We talked about it and | inquire how they feel about it? </sentence><sentence id="115">What would they do? </sentence><sentence id="116">Would they stay here? </sentence><sentence id="117">What are their plans actually? </sentence><sentence id="118">They were all in the same boat. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="203">Q: These were other Jewish students? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="205">A: Pardon me? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="207">Q: These were other Jewish students or? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="209">A: Who? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="211">Q: That you were speaking with about this. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="213">A: Some of them. </sentence><sentence id="214">But most of them not. </sentence><sentence id="215">But they admitted who they are. </sentence><sentence id="216">They </sentence></p><p><sentence id="217"> were Jewish and so on. </sentence><sentence id="218">And we all agreed that probably it is time to leave. </sentence><sentence id="219">It would </sentence></p><p><sentence id="220">  Felix Horn 7 [Date not labeled] </sentence></p><p><sentence id="221"> Page 7 </sentence></p><p><sentence id="222"> have to be illegal. </sentence><sentence id="223">There was no legal way for them to have left. </sentence><sentence id="224">You didn't have no visa. </sentence><sentence id="225">You have nobody over seas to send us legal papers. </sentence><sentence id="226">Besides those papers would take ages before you get legal entry, you know. </sentence><sentence id="227">Even after you get you're visa you might take five, ten years. </sentence><sentence id="228">Some of my friends had to go to Sweden because it was much faster to get out of Sweden to the United States they say than wait in Poland for you're number to come up and not to be recognized, especially if you're a Jew. </sentence><sentence id="229">And so | organized a student Kibbutz (ph), an academic Kibbutz (ph) of students. </sentence><sentence id="230">And | think in Hebrew they call it Kibbutz acadamime (ph) if | recall correctly, what | was told. </sentence><sentence id="231">| was not good at Hebrew either. </sentence><sentence id="232">| read Hebrew, | read my Prayer Book and so on but | don't understand them. </sentence><sentence id="233">| read automatically. </sentence><sentence id="234">| know the text, what it means, but not word by word. </sentence><sentence id="235">But my wife speaks Hebrew. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="236">And we elected to leave and we made contact with some what they call a Bree-ha (ph), | don't know if you're familiar with that word? </sentence><sentence id="237">Bree-ha (ph) is a group of young, Jewish people. </sentence><sentence id="238">The avant-garde of the Pal-mach (ph), of the Jewish driving force of information of Israeli Armed Forces. </sentence><sentence id="239">Those are the young people who are politically involved in Zionist organizations and they are pioneering, collecting the remnants of whatever is left over for the Jewish people to go back to Palestine at that time. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="240">There was no Israel yet. </sentence><sentence id="241">And this was one of the stages, first to get us out of the hostile Poland where people didn't want to give us back nothing what we had. </sentence><sentence id="242">As a </sentence></p><p><sentence id="243">  Felix Horn 8 [Date not labeled] </sentence></p><p><sentence id="244"> Page 8 </sentence></p><p><sentence id="245"> matter of fact all my furniture was given to some neighbors and so on. </sentence><sentence id="246">They refused to give me anything, you know? </sentence><sentence id="247">They belonged to us. </sentence><sentence id="248">The fur coats and radios, instead of give to the Nazis we give to the Poles. </sentence><sentence id="249">They did not have to relinquish their status. </sentence><sentence id="250">And we gave to them, good idea, that if we survived we'd get something back, at least something. </sentence><sentence id="251">Talking about silverware, the candelabra that were a few hundred years old, heavy, tall. </sentence><sentence id="252">All those things perished of course. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="253">They, when they found out that | am alive, you know, they said the Germans took it, they had to sell it, some of them. </sentence><sentence id="254">They couldn't survive. </sentence><sentence id="255">Anyway, it was immaterial anymore to me, | lost more than that. </sentence><sentence id="256">And with this we made a contact with the bra- ha (ph) and on a given night all gathered and by train we are going to a little town near the border. </sentence><sentence id="257">From there we were met by a group of people, we never really introduced before. </sentence><sentence id="258">They knew about us though. </sentence><sentence id="259">And with their help and their contacts with the border police and so on, they just looked the other way. </sentence><sentence id="260">We went right across the border to Czechoslovakia. </sentence><sentence id="261">Don't forget, this was, at that time it was 1946. </sentence><sentence id="262">Still people coming and going to Poland, looking for family. </sentence><sentence id="263">From Poland to Vienna, Austria, Czechoslovakia. </sentence><sentence id="264">Looking for some _ survivors, different concentration camp. </sentence><sentence id="265">So the guards at the border were not very religious in stopping people. </sentence><sentence id="266">Even if they seen somebody. </sentence><sentence id="267">There was no invasion or so, there was a peaceful type of a bi-directional type of movement, you know. </sentence><sentence id="268">But anyway, as a </sentence></p><p><sentence id="269">  Felix Horn 9 [Date not labeled] </sentence></p><p><sentence id="270"> Page 9 </sentence></p><p><sentence id="271"> group maybe we would create suspicion so we were able to get from Czechoslovakia. </sentence><sentence id="272">They put us on trucks to Vienna. </sentence><sentence id="273">And then over there we were met by a group of Zionists, all Zionists. </sentence><sentence id="274">And they were very instrumental. </sentence><sentence id="275">Thanks to them, they saved us in the beginning. </sentence><sentence id="276">First they had contact with the local authorities, also notorious. </sentence><sentence id="277">Don't forget they had a lot of influence because Austrian authorities were more Nazi than the German Nazis. </sentence><sentence id="278">So they were very, very guilty during the war, what happened. </sentence><sentence id="279">So for that reason alone probably they tried to collaborate with the Jewish organizations. </sentence><sentence id="280">First we got a school to our disposal. </sentence><sentence id="281">We have no home so they give us a whole school, big room, and there were twenty or twenty-one of us, two married couples and some girls and some boys. </sentence><sentence id="282">So we had to divide the one huge room, it was like a theater of some kind or an auditorium, with sheets, wires, and we cover, you know, separate, like small cubicles. </sentence><sentence id="283">We had the beds over there like military beds. </sentence><sentence id="284">And it was very comfortable really. </sentence><sentence id="285">And they took all of our documents, I'm talking about student books and our academically type of documentation, and they translate everything for us into German. </sentence><sentence id="286">And they, having some contacts at the University, we didn't have to go to a very rigorous type of screening or so, as long as our documents were in order, then they segregated us into different facilities and who ever was in medicine, some were first time that they started the University. </sentence><sentence id="287">| was already a third </sentence></p><p><sentence id="288">   Felix Horn 10 [Date not labeled] Page 10 year medical school student, fourth year. </sentence><sentence id="289">| had one year after the war in Poland so this would be my fourth year. </sentence><sentence id="290">But medicine in Vienna was seven years so | still had four, five, six, four more years to go. </sentence><sentence id="291">In German, that | never handled. </sentence><sentence id="292">| spoke French. </sentence><sentence id="293">| speak Slavic languages, Polish, Russian, Ukrainian, never German. </sentence><sentence id="294">But | learn it fast. </sentence><sentence id="295">And they were accepted, they accepted all my former papers and exams | passed. </sentence><sentence id="296">Maybe because we were survivors. </sentence><sentence id="297">I'm sure there was some bearing to it, you know? </sentence><sentence id="298">They did not let us suffer, they wanted to make it as smooth as a transition until they knew, around this new medical school, as they could. </sentence><sentence id="299">Which | was very grateful for. </sentence><sentence id="300">We had no tuition. </sentence><sentence id="301">American Joint provided this. </sentence><sentence id="302">And then we received food, they provide food for us too. </sentence><sentence id="303">So we were like a little Kubbutz (ph), student group, living and doing nothing but study so we were not hungry. </sentence><sentence id="304">And that's, slowly we got ourselves kind of use to the new surroundings, new people. </sentence><sentence id="305">We met some friends who were there before us from Poland. </sentence><sentence id="306">Some of them Viennese Jewish students, one. </sentence><sentence id="307">We were very close. </sentence><sentence id="308">I'm sure we're much closer now than if this would have happened before the war. </sentence><sentence id="309">Because we have something in common, we're all Jews and we all lost somebody. </sentence><sentence id="310">There was not one person who was not victimized by loosing his family or part of his family. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="311">   Felix Horn 11 [Date not labeled] Page 11 </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="312">Q: Let me just ask you did people in that situation you're in, with people with that background, did you all talk about, did you compare experiences much? </sentence><sentence id="313">Talk about what had happened? </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="314">A: Yes. </sentence><sentence id="315">| think our experiences were different. </sentence><sentence id="316">Everybody had a different story to tell. </sentence><sentence id="317">And, someone came from Russia, some had survived in the labor camps in Romania, some students survived in ghettos in Hungary and they were beaten and so they were persecuted, but they survived. </sentence><sentence id="318">And someone survived in their families even, like a sister or two brothers or one parent survived, you know? </sentence><sentence id="319">But always someone had somebody that he lost, he or she lost, you know? </sentence><sentence id="320">But we had common ground because we belonged to the same group of people. </sentence><sentence id="321">We were Jews, we are students, but we got there different ways, by different routes, you know? </sentence><sentence id="322">And everybody had their own stories. </sentence><sentence id="323">We sit at night and talk and talk and talk. </sentence><sentence id="324">And everybody was not fascinated because this was a tragic story to be fascinated with, but it proved the just human will to survive and the question was, how did you survive? </sentence><sentence id="325">Until today | ask myself the same question, how did | survive?| don't know. </sentence><sentence id="326">There was nothing that you are smart, that you knew what to do. </sentence><sentence id="327">If you turn left it was you're death but | didn't know that. </sentence><sentence id="328">You turn right, you survive. </sentence><sentence id="329">If you walked out during the day no one stopped you. </sentence><sentence id="330">At night, they shoot you. </sentence><sentence id="331">So it's hard to say. </sentence><sentence id="332">Is that fate? </sentence><sentence id="333">| never believe in fate, but | don't know. </sentence><sentence id="334">Some of my   Felix Horn 12 [Date not labeled] Page 12 Indian colleagues, physicians, right now who is very, , he believe fate is something of, some external thing. </sentence><sentence id="335">He tried to convince me, this was inscribed in the Book upstairs, that | would survive. </sentence><sentence id="336">Well, | can't prove it, let's prove that. </sentence><sentence id="337">But | had many, many days and nights of doubt if | will. </sentence><sentence id="338">The only sad story was, if | perish this second, this minute, why didn't | perish earlier? </sentence><sentence id="339">Why should | have to suffer all the time, you know? </sentence><sentence id="340">But we had one goal, to go ahead and study was the number one. </sentence><sentence id="341">Most of us promised our parents, we want the memory of our parents not let down. </sentence><sentence id="342">| personally promised my Mom before they took her away to concentration camp that if | escaped from the ghetto, my town Lublin, she had asked me that | had to promise to her, if | ever survive. </sentence><sentence id="343">She apologized, she cannot help me anymore, that | will never forget to go back to school. </sentence><sentence id="344">To make a better person of myself. </sentence><sentence id="345">And | promise her. </sentence><sentence id="346">My Mom was an opera singer. </sentence><sentence id="347">She was very disappointed when | decide to go to medicine. </sentence><sentence id="348">My Dad, after he became an architect, he was upset | won't be an architect. </sentence><sentence id="349">| play violin so | try to compromise. </sentence><sentence id="350">| drew, I've been drawing beautiful pictures of buildings, talent from my father, that | got accustomed to seeing everyday. </sentence><sentence id="351">And to them, the best writer, clearly, printing and so on, you know, | draw things beautiful, | paint. </sentence><sentence id="352">So | do lots of things, so in memory of my Mom that | still play music. </sentence><sentence id="353">Maybe this gives a little peace, that | didn't let her down completely. </sentence><sentence id="354">But | felt since | was 13, that's all | want to do. </sentence><sentence id="355">|   Felix Horn 13 [Date not labeled] Page 13 remember sick little boy. </sentence><sentence id="356">He was at that time maybe seven or eight, | don't remember his age exactly. </sentence><sentence id="357">| was maybe 13 or so, and he was getting shots and he was so sick. </sentence><sentence id="358">There was a clinic, we couldn't afford a private doctor, we go to poor people's clinic. </sentence><sentence id="359">And | felt if | could help that kid, if | could do something for him but | didn't know what | could do. </sentence><sentence id="360">But that give me the idea that | would like to go to medicine. </sentence><sentence id="361">Didn't know what I'm going to do in medicine but | like to be a doctor. </sentence><sentence id="362">Anyway, | have no regrets. </sentence><sentence id="363">| am happy | am, I'm almost not anymore, I'm retired now, private practice. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="418">Q: Another question | have about, there you are in you're sort of student Kabbutz (ph) as you describe it, and all these people who survived this experience. </sentence><sentence id="419">Do you think that, and it sounds like you're all very diligent in you're studies, I'm wondering whether because of the experience, because you survived, whether that was part of the motivation to do this? </sentence><sentence id="420">To make sure you became a doctor? </sentence><sentence id="421">Or for the other students to make sure that they did what they intended to do? </sentence><sentence id="422">I'm guessing maybe people were even more serious than they might have been? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="428">A: I'll give you a surprising answer, no. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="430">Q: Really? </sentence></p></dialogue>

</sentence><sentence id="4033">What do you have that we don't have? </sentence><sentence id="4034">| don't know what to tell them. </sentence><sentence id="4035">| thought for a moment maybe that's

</sentence><sentence id="4040">What is it? </sentence><sentence id="4041">| don't know. </sentence><sentence id="4042">But it appears to be a certain type of a dislike to that person. </sentence><sentence id="4043">And that because they are different, different because of religion, they're Jews. </sentence><sentence id="4044">That's probably contributed to the rise of

</sentence><sentence id="4046">This goes back into time of Jesus, so | told him | don't know what to tell you. </sentence><sentence id="4047">Maybe I, of course, maybe its from generation to
