<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="395">Q: What was it like being away from her? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="397">A: Well, of course I missed her, but we were so busy working, training, that I didn't have much time to dwell on the fact that I'm away from home and I'm lonesome. </sentence><sentence id="398">I was--of course I missed her, but we just had so many activities going on that we didn't have time to get homesick. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="415">A: Well, we were on the south coast of England, and we could hear the planes of the Air Force going over every night. </sentence><sentence id="416">Bombing somewhere over on the continent and, of course, everything was top secret until the--well, actually it was the Sth of June. </sentence><sentence id="417">At the night of the 5th of June, we heard this tremendous roar of planes going, and that just continued on and on and on. </sentence><sentence id="418">And we're not hearing any planes coming back; so they were making a wide circle, bombing and then coming back. </sentence><sentence id="419">And it was continuing on all night, and this was unusual because normally they would--the planes would go out and we'd hear them coming back, and that was it. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="425">Q: Right. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="427">A: So we knew that that was probably the beginning of the invasion, and of course then the next day, we read in the newspapers that the invasion had started and right at that time we were moved to the marshalling area near South Hampton in preparation for the crossing. </sentence><sentence id="428">This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="429">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="430"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection Now on D Day, the Ist and the 29th Division were the assault troops to go across the channel and land on Omaha Beach and our 30th Division went in behind the 29th five days later. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="474">A: We landed on Omaha Beach, and I can recall it very well because this was on my birthday, the 13th of June. </sentence><sentence id="475">I'm just talking with my wife here. </sentence><sentence id="476">We landed on my birthday on the 13th of June and moved into what we call a bivouac area because this area had been cleared out by the 29th Division about two to three miles inland and so we stayed in the bivouac area over night, and the next day we marched into this little village of Montmarte Grenyas which the 29th Division the day before had taken but were driven back out of it. </sentence><sentence id="477">And so it was our job to then get back into this town, clear it out, and continue on from there. </sentence><sentence id="478">And that was our first day of combat, and we were green. </sentence><sentence id="479">We just didn't realize the seriousness of what this whole thing was all about until the silver bullet hit some of our friends, and they encountered mines. </sentence><sentence id="480">They were hit by artillery shrapnel. </sentence><sentence id="481">And this was--these guys were being hit, became casualties, and the medics had to take care of them the best they could, and then the next--through the night and the next day we had to get replacements in for those men that were casualties of that day. </sentence><sentence id="482">This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="483">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="484"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="500">A: That first day, no. </sentence><sentence id="501">I didn't lose any men, but in subsequent following men, I did lose some men. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="504">Q: That must have been extraordinarily difficult. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="506">A: It was because they were men that I had trained with some back in the states, and some in through my period in England, and during this period of time, you become close to your men and almost like family. </sentence><sentence id="507">And, you know, it hurts when you see a man get wounded or killed, and you feel a partially responsible for it--although it's not your fault-- you feel that you lost one of your boys, and it hurt. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="510">Q: You described just now as rather like being a family. </sentence><sentence id="511">As a platoon leader, did you look at the men under your command, were they more like sons to you or more like brothers? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="514">A: more like sons because, as I mentioned, when I landed there, I was 27 years old on my birthday, and most of my men were 18, 19, 20 years old, what I call kids. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="516">Q: Right. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="518">A: So there was a little bit of a gap there, and I felt more or less they were my sons that I had to take care of them. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="520">Q: Sure. </sentence><sentence id="521">What did you think of--you said before going into combat you had that attitude that. </sentence><sentence id="522">You were going to go in and show these guys the what for. </sentence><sentence id="523">Once you had that experience of close combat, what did you think about the Germans? </sentence><sentence id="524">Were they good soldiers? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="530">A: We found that--we really learned that they were well trained, well disciplined soldiers, and they had weapons that were as good as or better than what we had. </sentence><sentence id="531">And the only way we gained the upper hand was the fact that we just had more men. </sentence><sentence id="532">We had more weapons, more tanks and we just overpowered them by sheer numbers rather than technical better weapons. </sentence><sentence id="533">They had better weapons than we had. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="538">Q: Sure. </sentence><sentence id="539">But let's talk about that a little more. </sentence><sentence id="540">How did you view them, the Germans, that is to say the German soldiers. </sentence><sentence id="541">How did you view them? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="546">A: Well, they were good. </sentence><sentence id="547">The most of them, the Wehrmachts, were very good soldiers, well disciplined. </sentence><sentence id="548">One of the big differences that we found is that they went strictly by the This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="549">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="550"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection book. </sentence><sentence id="551">Whatever was in the training manuals, whatever their leaders told them to do, that's what they did, nothing more. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="560">Q: Okay. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="562">A: But with the American soldiers, we adapted. </sentence><sentence id="563">We were told what to do and how to do it, but if that didn't work, then we had the liberty of doing something else that would work, and we had that flexibility which the Germans did not have. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="566">Q: Okay. </sentence><sentence id="567">Now, as you're moving inland, moving deeper and deeper into France, at some point you came into contact with Jews. </sentence><sentence id="568">Can you tell us about that first experience with Jews? </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="574">Q: Yes. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="576">A: Okay. </sentence><sentence id="577">We did not have any contact with Jews. </sentence><sentence id="578">Now, let me go back a little bit. </sentence><sentence id="579">Back in the early training days. </sentence><sentence id="580">Occasionally, we would hear or read in the newspapers about some Jews being tortured in Europe, slave laborers, and this periodically would appear, but we never pay much attention to it because what we were hearing was that some Jew would escape from some camp--we didn't know about Auschwitz and Dachau back in those days. </sentence><sentence id="581">We heard there were these camps where they were concentrating Jews and torturing them and using them as slave labor, but the story that we would get was that a Jew escaped from a camp, went back to his hometown, and told the people about what was going on in this camp--that the Jews were being tortured and used as slave labor. </sentence><sentence id="582">They wouldn't--they did not believe him. </sentence><sentence id="583">The Jewish congregation in his town did not believe him because, like us, we thought of the German people as being civilized human beings, inelegant people, and they would not do that to another segment of human beings. </sentence><sentence id="584">So this went on, periodically, we would read articles like this while we were in England, but when we got into France, we saw none of that. </sentence><sentence id="585">In fact, Jews didn't even cross our mind. </sentence><sentence id="586">That was not why we were there. </sentence><sentence id="587">We weren't there to liberate to Jews. </sentence><sentence id="588">We didn't know about that whole situation. </sentence><sentence id="589">We were there to drive the Germans out of the land which they had occupied illegally. </sentence><sentence id="590">So we were not concerned with Jews, and we never really saw any Jews because the Germans had taken them all out of France back to Germany to use them as slave laborers. </sentence><sentence id="591">So as we proceeded through Normandy and Northern France and into Belgium, we did never saw or had any contact with any Jews. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="645">A: Right. </sentence><sentence id="646">So we were just chasing them. </sentence><sentence id="647">They were doing what we call--I forgot what it is now--sort of defensive action as they were retreating, and the major part of the German army was moving back eastward toward Germany, and they would leave a small segment of men behind to delay us, to create delaying actions. </sentence><sentence id="648">And that's all we did all the way across northern France and up into Belgium and Holland and not until we got into Holland and the German border where they had the Siegfried Line. </sentence><sentence id="649">That's where we had to stop and of course they stopped as well, but the reason that we stopped there was that we had run across France and Belgium and Holland so fast, we had outrun our supply lines. </sentence><sentence id="650">Now, all of our supplies had to come across England, across the channel into Omaha Beach, and by truck, move them up daily to supply us with food, ammunition, clothing, replacements. </sentence><sentence id="651">So it was kind of a slow process, and we were moving faster than the supply lines could keep up with us. </sentence><sentence id="652">So by the time we got to Holland and the Siegfried Line, we had left thousands of vehicles behind because we ran out of gasoline. </sentence><sentence id="653">We just dropped the vehicles off at the side of the road and abandoned them more or less. </sentence><sentence id="654">So by the time we got to Holland, we were out of food, we were out of ammunition, we were out of gasoline. </sentence><sentence id="655">So we had to stop there nearly a month waiting for supplies to reach us and become resupplied with ammunition, with food, replacement men before we could This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="656">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="657"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection make a successful attack on the Siegfried Line, and once we got the momentum going, to keep on going. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="674">A: That was in about February of "44 or "45. </sentence><sentence id="675">I'm sorry. </sentence><sentence id="676">February "45 that we crashed through the Siegfried Line and we had enough momentum going that we just kept on going, and got up to Monchengladbach and Wessel and across the Rhine River, which was the biggest major obstacle that we had at that time. </sentence><sentence id="677">So we continued on from crossing the Rhine River 24th of March and headed to Brunswick, which is in the northern part of Germany. </sentence><sentence id="678">Now, up to this time, we had not seen nor heard anything about Jews or concentration camps. </sentence><sentence id="679">Nothing. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="686">Q: Now, this should have been around April, was it not? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="688">A: This was the 10th of April that we captured Brunswick. </sentence><sentence id="689">Now, there was a concentration camp BergenBelsen which was a little bit north of Brunswick, because that was in the British zone. </sentence><sentence id="690">So we had nothing to do with it, but it was there nevertheless. </sentence><sentence id="691">But we didn't even hear about it. </sentence><sentence id="692">We captured Brunswick, and then our next objective was Magdeburg. </sentence><sentence id="693">It was probably 75 or 100 miles further east, and we started moving from Brunswick on toward Magdeburg, and we came to this town of Hillersleben where there was a large German air base. </sentence><sentence id="694">We captured that, and then there was a number of large barracks and a hospital, and we thought nothing of it. </sentence><sentence id="695">We just captured that town and went onto the next town of Farsleben. </sentence><sentence id="696">As we were approaching this little village of Farsleben--this village is probably a thousand people at the most. </sentence><sentence id="697">We met some soldiers who were walking along the side of the road westward, and they said that up in Farsleben, the Germans are preparing an attack, an ambush, for you. </sentence><sentence id="698">And they are protecting a trainload of people. </sentence><sentence id="699">We didn't understand exactly what they meant by "a trainload of people." </sentence><sentence id="700">So we had our reconnaissance unit, which was a few tanks and infantry men on the tanks to move forward to this town of Farsleben. </sentence><sentence id="701">They found no resistance in the town. </sentence><sentence id="702">They cleared it out, and on the east side of the town, there was a little hill, and the tanks were still moving forward, and as they mounted the hill, and looked down into the little valley on the other side, they saw a train sitting there with a bunch of people milling around doing whatever they wanted to do really. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="764">A: Well, I was not there the first day. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="766">Q: Okay. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="768">A: See, I was with the other unit, and this was the 743rd tank battalion, which was part of our unit. </sentence><sentence id="769">They were the lead reconnaissance group that were up in the very front. </sentence><sentence id="770">So they were the first ones to meet this group of people, and I didn't see them actually until the next day. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="774">Q: And when you did see them </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="775">A: It was a horrible scene because they had just been liberated--I need to go back just a minute now. </sentence><sentence id="776">On the 6th of April, the camp commander of BergenBelsen was aware that the British troops were approaching his camp, and he wanted to get the inmates of the camp out of there as quickly as he could so that they would not see the condition that these people were in. </sentence><sentence id="777">So on the 4th, 5th, and 6th of April, they loaded up three different trains loaded with about 2,500 Jews and sent them eastward towards a town of Theresienstadt, which was another concentration camp. </sentence><sentence id="778">And that was going to be the final solution for these people. </sentence><sentence id="779">So one was a train that actually did arrive at Theresienstadt, and the second train was captured by the Russian Army, and this was the third train that had come from BergenBelsen. </sentence><sentence id="780">Now, it took six days for that train to come from BergenBelsen to Farsleben. </sentence><sentence id="781">That train was made up of what they call cattle cars-- cattle wagons. </sentence><sentence id="782">They're like our small freight trains. </sentence><sentence id="783">They're a smaller than our normal freight trains. </sentence><sentence id="784">We had used this type of freight train in World War I, and we called them 40 and 8s. </sentence><sentence id="785">Noting that each car was capable of handling 40 men or 8 horses, and that was the general mode of transportation back in World War I, to move troops around by train. </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="786">Q: Okay. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="813">Q: How did you react when you saw them, and how did they react when they saw you as Americans? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="815">A: Well, we were reacted, you know, we didn't believe what we were seeing. </sentence><sentence id="816">You know, we could communicate very vaguely because the language barrier with these people, but to see and understand where they had come from, the conditions that they had for those six days on the train, it was just nauseating to smell these people. </sentence><sentence id="817">We didn't dare to touch them because we were afraid of getting lice on us, fleas, Typhus--which was very rampant disease in those days. </sentence><sentence id="818">We didn't want to actually touch these people at all. </sentence><sentence id="819">They wanted to greet us and hug us and kiss us; so we just had to kind of rebel against them and not have any personal contact with them as much as we could. </sentence><sentence id="820">Now, we understood where they were coming from and the condition that they had. </sentence><sentence id="821">They were hungry, they had only gotten one meal a day which consisted of a big bucket of soup as they called it which was nothing more but a pail of water with some potato peelings or turnip peelings in it. </sentence><sentence id="822">And they were very lucky if they got a few of the turnip peelings in their cup of soup that they got every day. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="893">Q: Right. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="895">A: That they were brought in there and administered help to them, and this was where I got assigned a job of moving these people away from this point in Farsleben because actually this was still a battle zone, and we had American artillery falling in the area. </sentence><sentence id="896">We had German artillery falling in the area. </sentence><sentence id="897">So we didn't want to have anymore casualties. </sentence><sentence id="898">So I was delegated then to round up transportation and take these people out of there to this town of Hillersleben that we had liberated a couple of days before where there was a barracks and a hospital. </sentence><sentence id="899">So I rounded up about 60 or 70 vehicles and got them loaded up and got them out of the area back to Hillersleben. </sentence><sentence id="900">And of course, the medical corps went with them, and they put the sick people in the hospital, and the others went into the barracks, but first of all, as soon as we brought them back to Hillersleben, they were so dirty and stinking and filthy that there was nothing that we could do to give them clean clothing, so we had to have them strip their clothing off, and the engineer battalion set up some shower points, and we started moving them through the showers--the first shower that they had had in months and years. </sentence><sentence id="901">And as soon as they got through the shower, of course, they were given towels and soap, and they were so happy to get cleaned up to little bit, but even through the shower, they could not get rid of the lice that were infested in their hair and in their pubic hairs. </sentence><sentence id="902">And so after they finished the shower, we dusted them with DDT. </sentence><sentence id="903">Now, DDT is today a prohibited item because it's a carcinoginious[sic] item and is, by law, is prohibited for use. </sentence><sentence id="904">But at that time that was the best technology that we had to fight lice and fleas any kind of insect that they might have. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="942">Q: Did they tell you about mass killings? </sentence><sentence id="943">Did they tell you about-- </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="944">A: Well, no because BergenBelsen was not a killing camp you might say. </sentence><sentence id="945">It was a camp where they worked 1215 hours a day, and the working conditions were not good. </sentence><sentence id="946">The food was not good. </sentence><sentence id="947">Their living conditions not good. </sentence><sentence id="948">They told us about their life there in BergenBelsen. </sentence><sentence id="949">I was going to say they didn't have a large crematorium or gas chambers or anything like that in BergenBelsen. </sentence><sentence id="950">It was just a slave labor camp, and part of it was an exchange camp, as I mentioned before, to exchange the people for German prisoners, but they told us about the hardships they had, the life that they had, the living conditions in the barracks there at BergenBelsen was very bad. </sentence><sentence id="951">They had bunks, I think four high, and three or four people had to sleep in one bunk. </sentence><sentence id="952">The living conditions were very, very bad there at BergenBelsen. </sentence><sentence id="953">So this is basically the first time that we ever heard of Jews, slave labor, crematoriums, gas chambers. </sentence><sentence id="954">We never heard anything like that before. </sentence><sentence id="955">We could hardly believe what they were telling us. </sentence><sentence id="956">And they got a lot of this information from some of the inmates who had come Auschwitz and Dachau were being overcrowded there, and they moved them into BergenBelsen, and then those prisoners in turn were telling the others about what was going on in these other camps. </sentence><sentence id="957">That's how they knew what was going on there. </sentence><sentence id="958">And so, you know, we were not trained as humanitarians. </sentence><sentence id="959">We were trained as soldiers. </sentence><sentence id="960">And basically when we saw this train and these Jews, the condition that they were in, we really didn't know what to do. </sentence><sentence id="961">We did the best we could with what we had. </sentence><sentence id="962">Most of it was wrong, by feeding them the food the way we did. </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="963">Q: Did your understanding of what you were fighting for and why we you fighting change with that encounter? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="965">A: Well, we weren't--as we were fighting across Europe, we weren't fighting to save any Jews. </sentence><sentence id="966">We didn't know about them. </sentence><sentence id="967">We were fighting to drive the Germans back out of these occupied countries, to give these people in France, Belgium, and Holland--to give their freedom and liberty back that they had had back in 1940 when they were invaded by the Germans. </sentence><sentence id="968">The Jewish situation was just sort of a sideline that happened that we didn't know anything about. </sentence><sentence id="969">We didn't know what was going on until we saw, and then we believed. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="975">Q: And did that change your attitudes towards the Germans? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="977">A: Well, basically at that point in time, it was too late because here we are at the end of the war now. </sentence><sentence id="978">So from that point on, we didn't have much contact with the Germans. </sentence><sentence id="979">The war was over. </sentence><sentence id="980">| think it was the 8th of May; so it was only about three weeks after we found this train that the war ended. </sentence><sentence id="981">Of course, we didn't have any good feelings toward This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="982">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="983"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection the Germans because they were denying everything, and we knew that they were lying, that they were involved in it. </sentence><sentence id="984">They knew about it. </sentence><sentence id="985">They knew what was going on. </sentence></p></dialogue>

</sentence><sentence id="1221">Well, of course I sent her back copies of pages from some of our history books and from my own personal knowledge about the liberation of Magdeburg on the 16th of the April, 1945. </sentence><sentence id="1222">She put this all together and wrote up her thesis, and she did get her Ph.D. but she took that document to the mayor of Magdeburg, and he was rather surprised to know that the Americans actually had liberated Magdeburg. </sentence><sentence id="1223">He was always of the impression that the Russians had liberated Magdeburg. </sentence><sentence id="1224">Now, we're coming up on April of 2005, which then was going to be the--I think the 40th or 50th anniversary of the liberation--this just happened to coincide with the 1200th anniversary of the founding of the City of Magdeburg. </sentence><sentence id="1225">So they were planing to have a big celebration on the anniversary of the founding of Magdeburg as well as the liberation of Magdeburg. </sentence><sentence id="1226">So in doing so, and unknown to me at the time, they invited a man who had been in a slave labor camp there in Magdeburg. </sentence><sentence id="1227">Now, in Magdeburg, there was a pulte ammunition works which was making ammunition for the German war machine, and this was operated by slave laborers, Jewish slave laborers, which had come from Buchenwald. </sentence><sentence id="1228">And we, the 30th Division, had actually liberated this slave labor camp, and that was in a matter of a few days after we had liberated the Farsleben group. </sentence><sentence id="1229">Anyway, the mayor, through another person, invited this man who--this Jew who had been a slave laborer in Magdeburg in the pulte ammunition works to come back to Magdeburg to tell the people about his incarceration. </sentence><sentence id="1230">At the same time he invited me to come to Magdeburg to tell the people about the actual liberation by the Americans. </sentence><sentence id="1231">So for the first time, when I got to Magdeburg, I met this man, the man who--the Jew that I had liberated in 1945. </sentence><sentence id="1232">So we worked up a nice relationship, and I found that he lived in Boca Raton, Florida, about three hours away from where I lived. </sentence><sentence id="1233">So this was a fascinating thing that I, a liberator, and he, a Jewish slave laborer, should end up living so close together here in Florida. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1252">Q: And have you been in communication with him since? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1254">A: I was. </sentence><sentence id="1255">I'm sorry. </sentence><sentence id="1256">He just died about a month ago. </sentence><sentence id="1257">Anyway, after we came back from Magdeburg, he sent me an email saying, "Frank, look at this web site. </sentence><sentence id="1258">It is tremendous." </sentence><sentence id="1259">And I opened up the web site, and it was a web site created by a history teacher up in the Hudson Falls, New York, and it was about a tank commander of the 743rd Tank Battalion having liberated a train in Magdeburg. </sentence><sentence id="1260">Well, I read the whole story through, and it was exactly the story that I related to you. </sentence><sentence id="1261">And how did this guy get this story? </sentence><sentence id="1262">So I got in contact with this teacher to find out what his relationship was to this web site and story. </sentence><sentence id="1263">And it seems that he was a World War II history buff, but he was at the time concentrating on the Holocaust. </sentence><sentence id="1264">And he gave his class a project to go out in the village and see if you can contact a veteran who had anything to do with his connection with the Holocaust. </sentence><sentence id="1265">The students brought their stories in, and read them. </sentence><sentence id="1266">They discussed them, but there was one boy who had a very unique story--that his grandfather was a tank commander in the 743rd Tank Battalion, and they had captured this train with 2,500 Jews on it. </sentence><sentence id="1267">Well, that's exactly my story. </sentence><sentence id="1268">So I got together with this teacher and we discussed This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="1269">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="1270"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection his side of it, and I told him my connection with it. </sentence><sentence id="1271">And so we've been sort of collaborating together ever since. </sentence><sentence id="1272">Now, at the time, he put his web site out he got in--his story went out on the Internet, and the first hit that he had on it was from a lady in Australia. </sentence><sentence id="1273">Now, she was a young girl on that train, and her family moved to Australia at that time, and of course she's been there ever since, and she saw that web site, and she got back in contact with the teacher, and through that--and then he had two or three other hits up in New York. </sentence><sentence id="1274">So when I was discussing this matter with him, he had probably about 10 or 12 Jews that he had had contact with who were on that train. </sentence><sentence id="1275">Well, I said, you know, I've got this story about the train, and want to get involved in it. </sentence><sentence id="1276">So I went on the Internet and put my story out, and I started getting hits on it. </sentence><sentence id="1277">And it just snowballed, and eventually I got in contact with a person in Israel who had been a young boy. </sentence><sentence id="1278">He had been orphaned, and went to Israel--or went to Palestine and was adopted by a family, was educated there in Tel Aviv, and he became a doctor, a medical doctor and had practiced and just retired when I first got in contact with him. </sentence><sentence id="1279">He could not speak very good English, and it was very difficult for me to understand him, but his daughter was quite interested, and she could speak much better English than he could; although it was kind of broken up. </sentence><sentence id="1280">So she became very interested in his story because, as with many of these Jews, as they grew up, they wanted to forget the past. </sentence><sentence id="1281">They wanted to forget about the Holocaust and not even talk about it to their families. </sentence><sentence id="1282">So she was interested in it, and she wanted to hear more about it, wanted to learn what her father had been through. </sentence><sentence id="1283">So I gave her the whole story as I could recall, and she became very much involved in it. </sentence><sentence id="1284">And her father originally was from Budapest, he was Hungarian, and he remembered the names of some of the people, and she started researching there in Israel for some of those people, and she found a number of them. </sentence><sentence id="1285">So this increased our numbers of people who had survived this train. </sentence><sentence id="1286">Now, going back just a bit on this--on the train originally, there was about 2,500 people, and of them, there were about 600 children. </sentence><sentence id="1287">Now, I say children. </sentence><sentence id="1288">These are people 21 years of age and less. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1326">Q: Okay. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1328">A: Now, the Germans were quite meticulous about keeping records. </sentence><sentence id="1329">When that train left BergenBelsen, and we captured it there at Farsleben, the train commander had a list of all the people that were on that train. </sentence><sentence id="1330">That list contained their name, their birth date, and their birthplace, and of course other data too that was not really relevant. </sentence><sentence id="1331">That document was taken and retained by what is now the BergenBelsen Memorial, and I got a copy of that list and went through it and since it had the birth date of everybody that was on the train, I could determine who the children were. </sentence><sentence id="1332">So I sorted out all the children in the 600 names, and of those--I just assumed half of them were deceased because of malnutrition, age, and other causes. </sentence><sentence id="1333">So we're down to about the possibility of 300plus surviving children out there somewhere. </sentence><sentence id="1334">So with this young lady in Israel doing some research and finding some of these people and some of my research through the Internet, I have found </sentence></p><p><sentence id="1335"> This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="1336">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="1337"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection </sentence></p><p><sentence id="1338"> 235 of these people, and I've been in contact with each one either by mail physical (phone interference) </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1339">Q: Can you say that last part again? </sentence><sentence id="1340">We had a trifle bit of audio difficulty, I lost you at you were contacting them by email. </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1341">A: Either by email or snail mail. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1353">Q: Did most of them respond to you? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1355">A: Oh yes, yes. </sentence><sentence id="1356">In fact, I'm in contact with them right now trying to get any kind of documents, copies of documents, that they might have. </sentence><sentence id="1357">Now, I need to go back here just a little bit. </sentence><sentence id="1358">At the time of the liberation, these people I'm talking about today, they were all young kids. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1363">Q: Sure. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1365">A: 21 years and less. </sentence><sentence id="1366">Those who were ten years and younger, they really don't remember much. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1369">Q: Okay. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1371">A: It's the group that's 10 to 21 they have a little memory of what was happening. </sentence><sentence id="1372">Prior to the war, their parents could see the handwriting on the wall, what was happening to the Jews. </sentence><sentence id="1373">And they were starting to make arrangements to get out of Europe to get away from Hitler and the program that he had to eliminate the Jews. </sentence><sentence id="1374">So many of them had obtained passports from various countries wherever they would be accepted. </sentence><sentence id="1375">Now, in those years, there was a great deal of antiSemitism that United States did not want these Jews. </sentence><sentence id="1376">They had a very, very limited quota, and that's all they would take in here. </sentence><sentence id="1377">So these people got passports to South American countries, Australia, African countries, Canada. </sentence><sentence id="1378">Some got passports to the United States. </sentence><sentence id="1379">So whatever place these people had passports for, that's where they went. </sentence><sentence id="1380">They went--they scattered all over the world because they were citizens of that country. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1391">Q: Sure. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1393">A: And we at the time of the liberation furnished transportation to them to whatever country they had a passport for. </sentence><sentence id="1394">Now, just last night, I was talking with a girl--lady in This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="1395">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="1396"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection Australia, by Skype, and she said she had just found two more girls or ladies in Australia. </sentence><sentence id="1397">So that is the way this thing snowballed. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1405">Q: Yes. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1407">A: So I got two more people that I've got to start researching in Australia. </sentence><sentence id="1408">But we had a lot of them come here to the United States too, but must of them are settled up in around the New York area. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1411">Q: Okay. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1413">A: There's very few here in Florida, and there's a group up in Carolina and a few out in California, and they're just scattered all over. </sentence><sentence id="1414">So two years ago, this young lady in Israel thought it would be a nice idea to have a reunion of some of these people. </sentence><sentence id="1415">So we--she sent word out to them, and I sent word out to the people in the States about a reunion that they wanted to have in April--two and a half years ago. </sentence><sentence id="1416">So we have this reunion in her town in Rehovot, which is between Tel Aviv and Jerusalem. </sentence><sentence id="1417">And we had 60 of the survivors plus their children and grandchildren--total about 500 people. </sentence><sentence id="1418">And we assembled at the Weizmann Institute there in Rehovot. </sentence><sentence id="1419">They had a large auditorium in which we met. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1427">Q: What was that like seeing them again now as grown people who had made lives </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1428">A: It was very emotional to meet these people that I had had a little hand in liberating 6569 years ago. </sentence><sentence id="1429">And they were very receptive and very thankful to me to be one of their liberators, and in fact I have been the only liberator that they had ever met. </sentence><sentence id="1430">And it was a very emotional meeting to be with these people, to physically see some of those people, and the thing is the most of them had never met each other before because they came to Israel, staggered, at different times by different routes, and ended up in different places. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="1434">Some went to Jerusalem, some whet the Tel Aviv, and all the little kibbutz's all over Israel--Palestine at that time. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1436">Q: Sure. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1438">A: And so they were really never had any contact with each other, and this was the first time that they had contact with each other as well as me, as a liberator. </sentence><sentence id="1439">Now, the most of these survivors had never talked about the Holocaust to their families. </sentence><sentence id="1440">As they grew up, they just wanted to forget the bad memories there--that they just wanted to forget it. </sentence><sentence id="1441">The day of their liberation, that was the day of a new life for them. </sentence><sentence id="1442">Anything before that, they just wanted to forget about it and not talk about it. </sentence><sentence id="1443">The children would ask them, you know, what happened? </sentence><sentence id="1444">I don't want to talk about it. </sentence><sentence id="1445">Forget it. </sentence><sentence id="1446">And we'll talk about something else. </sentence><sentence id="1447">And this was going on for years until this reunion time--that I told the story--the one that I more or less had related to you now to these children, and they are learning for the first time what happened to their parents, a little bit about the This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="1448">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="1449"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection BergenBelsen era, but mostly from the actual liberation period, which they knew nothing about. </sentence><sentence id="1450">All they knew was what their parents had told them from the time they grew up in Israel or wherever they were up until the present time. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1466">Q: Sure. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1468">A: So this was a whole new story for these children and grandchildren to learn about something about the liberation of their people. </sentence><sentence id="1469">Now, what one person in particular, girl named lily, she was from Warsaw, and she had lost both of her parents to Auschwitz, and as an orphan, she was being taken care of by various other women. </sentence><sentence id="1470">And she lived through BergenBelsen with them. </sentence><sentence id="1471">And on the day of their liberation, the 13th of April, she said, "That is my birthday." </sentence><sentence id="1472">She did not now exactly where she was born. </sentence><sentence id="1473">She did not know exactly when she was born, so she took that day of liberation, the 13th of April, 1945, as her birth date, and she has considered that her birth date ever since. </sentence><sentence id="1474">This is one example of their feeling toward their liberation--that they feel that day of liberation was a very prominent and famous day as far as they were concerned--the beginning of their life. </sentence><sentence id="1475">And so many of them have told me that their life began on the 13th of April, 1945. </sentence><sentence id="1476">Anything before that never happened. </sentence><sentence id="1477">They just wanted to forget it. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1488">Q: There are those who would say and those who do say that the Holocaust never happened. </sentence><sentence id="1489">What would you say to them? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1492">A: You should have been there. </sentence><sentence id="1493">If you'd have seen it and smelled it, you'd believe. </sentence><sentence id="1494">That's all I can tell them. </sentence></p></dialogue>
