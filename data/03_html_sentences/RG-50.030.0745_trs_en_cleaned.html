<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="101">A: I volunteered at that time. </sentence><sentence id="102">I was out of work, looking for a job, and employers were very hesitant about hiring young men who had not had their military service, but the draft system had just kicked in a short time before that, and they did not want to train new employees for two, three, six months and then lose them to the military. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="105">Q: Right. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="107">A: So they declined employing young men who had not had their military training; so I decided to get my year's training over with and come back and then be able to get a job. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="109">Q: And exactly what were the circumstances of that? </sentence><sentence id="110">And where I'm going with this is did you seek a commission or did you enlist, and how did you come about your commission? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="113">A: To get my commission? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="115">Q: Yes. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="117">A: Okay. </sentence><sentence id="118">I got into the local Company K of the National Guard in Burlington, and we came down here to Camp Blanding and trained here for a year. </sentence><sentence id="119">And we're getting ready to go home back to Vermont, and the Japanese dropped the bomb at Pearl Harbor already; so we're in (? </sentence><sentence id="120">full duration? </sentence><sentence id="121">05:29) and there's no going back to Vermont at that time. </sentence><sentence id="122">So the unit that I was with, the 43rd Division, was then prioritized to go to the Pacific and start fighting the war down there. </sentence><sentence id="123">And at that time, I was chosen to go to Fort Benning to go to an offshore candidate school, and I spent three months there training and became a second lieutenant my commission there. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="131">Q: What rank had you attained in enlisted ranks? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="133">A: A second lieutenant. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="135">Q: Yes. </sentence><sentence id="136">Just before became a second lieutenant, what rank has you attained in the rank? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="139">A: [had risen up through corporal and sergeant. </sentence><sentence id="140">I was a sergeant when I went to Fort Benning. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="143">Q: You said you went in 1940. </sentence><sentence id="144">What--were you conscious of the fact of what was going on in Europe, and did you see a likelihood of the United States entering the war? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="147">A: No. </sentence><sentence id="148">At that time, I did not. </sentence><sentence id="149">I could see the clouds of war in Europe, but it was still far away and really didn't see the United States getting involved in the war at that time. </sentence><sentence id="150">It was not until later on "42'43 that I began to see that they we're going to get involved in this thing. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="155">Q: And tell us about your experience in officer candidate school. </sentence><sentence id="156">What was that like? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="159">A: Well, it was rather difficult because I had been working with the--a supply officer in the 43rd Division, and I did not get the full extent of the basic training of the [(07:32)] that all the rest of the guys got. </sentence><sentence id="160">And so when I went to Benning, I was at a disadvantage because I had not had the basic training. </sentence><sentence id="161">And I was competing with other sergeants who had had the basic training; so I really had to do my military basic training at Fort Benning during the officer candidate course. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="165">Q: And how did you fair there? </sentence><sentence id="166">How did you do in the end? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="169">A: In the end, I did well. </sentence><sentence id="170">And more than likely I got my commission. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="173">Q: Very good. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="175">A: If hadn't got my commission, I'd have gone back in rank to my original unit. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="177">Q: So you said, you know, when the Japanese did attack Pearl Harbor, that's when you realized--America--that we were in it? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="179">A: That's correct. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="181">Q: Tell us your outages about that. </sentence><sentence id="182">What was that experience like? </sentence><sentence id="183">When did you hear about the attack on Pearl Harbor? </sentence><sentence id="184">How did it effect you? </sentence><sentence id="185">What was your feelings? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="191">A: Well, I felt that this was going to get us into the war because the Japanese had bombed Pearl Harbor, but the Japanese were tied in with the Germans as the Axis powers and that, in turn, was going to draw us into the war. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="193">Q: I see. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="195">A: And, you know, I felt confident at that time that, hey, we're going to go over to Europe or to the Pacific and fight these guys, and we're going to get this thing over with maybe two or three months. </sentence><sentence id="196">That was a little optimistic. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="199">Q: Indeed. </sentence><sentence id="200">So when were you--when was the decision a made to send you to Europe? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="203">A: I'm sorry. </sentence><sentence id="204">Give me that again. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="207">Q: When did you go to Europe? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="209">A: Okay. </sentence><sentence id="210">When I left Fort Benning, I went to Camp Wheeler, Georgia, and remained there as a training instructor for 14 months. </sentence><sentence id="211">At that time we had invaded North Africa; so we became involved in the European scene at that time. </sentence><sentence id="212">At the end of that 14 months, I got transferred then into the 30th Infantry Division which was at Camp Forrest, Tennessee finishing up their summer maneuvers there, and they went to Camp Atterbury in Indiana. </sentence><sentence id="213">And I joined them there the first of November of "43. </sentence><sentence id="214">And they were prioritized to go to Europe, but we didn't know that at the moment. </sentence><sentence id="215">We didn't know where we were going to go, but we were doing our immunizations, and the final firing and familiarization with weapons and getting prepared for combat somewhere. </sentence><sentence id="216">And we left Camp Atterbury the first of February of "44, and not knowing where we were going, we got on the train, and we ended up at Boston. </sentence><sentence id="217">And it was only then that we realized that we would be going to the European theater. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="227">Q: And how were you sent there? </sentence><sentence id="228">Did you go by--I assume you were shipped out by ship? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="231">A: Yeah. </sentence><sentence id="232">We shipped out from Boston on the 12th of February on the SS Argentina, and we joined a convoy just outside of Boston. </sentence><sentence id="233">There was a lot of ships that came from New York and Newport News, Virginia. </sentence><sentence id="234">And it was the largest convoy that ever crossed the ocean together. </sentence><sentence id="235">And we went to--our ship landed in Glasgow, Scotland, and from there we entrained down through London and to the south coast of England to a town of Bognor Regis. </sentence><sentence id="236">And that's where we stayed for the next six months training for the invasion if and when it came. </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="237">Q: Okay. </sentence><sentence id="238">How was your crossing? </sentence><sentence id="239">Did you have a good crossing? </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="240">A: It was a relatively good crossing. </sentence><sentence id="241">We didn't encounter any enemy ships. </sentence><sentence id="242">We had all kinds of battleships with us, and periodically we could see them darting out on some sort of a mission. </sentence><sentence id="243">We just assumed they were out chasing a sub somewhere, but we had no problem in going across. </sentence><sentence id="244">The weather was fairly good but in the North Atlantic in the winter it's never very good, but we didn't encounter any storms or anything; so we had a fair crossing. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="250">Q: Was that your first time out of United States? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="252">A: Yes. [ </sentence><sentence id="253">had been to Canada if you call that out of the United Nations, but first time overseas, yes. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="256">Q: What did you--you were in Britain for how many months again? </sentence><sentence id="257">I'm sorry. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="260">A: Until June, about five months. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="262">Q: Did you interact with the British? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="264">A: I'm sorry? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="266">Q: Did you interact with the British? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="268">A: We did somewhat, but not a great deal with the--I think you're probably referring to the British Military, but the British civilians, we had more contact with them. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="270">Q: What did you think? </sentence><sentence id="271">What did you think of them? </sentence><sentence id="272">How did they treat you? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="276">A: They treated us very well. </sentence><sentence id="277">They were very happy to see us come and help them because they had been in the war for four years already. </sentence><sentence id="278">German bombing and that sort of thing. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="282">Q: Sure. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="284">A: So that were very happy to see us come and help them out. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="286">Q: Okay. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="288">A: But we had a very good relationship with the British civilians. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="290">Q: Very good. </sentence><sentence id="291">And I just want to back up a little bit so we don't get too far ahead of ourselves. </sentence><sentence id="292">By this time--I'm referring to you being in Britain before being deployed to the continent to combat that is--were you--by this time you were married? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="296">A: No--yes, I was. </sentence><sentence id="297">I married in March of "43. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="300">Q: And you had met you wife at university? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="302">A: No, here at Camp Blanding. </sentence><sentence id="303">She was teaching at Jacksonville at that time, and I met her there in Jacksonville. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="306">Q: Tell us about how you met. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="308">A: How we met? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="310">Q: Yes. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="312">A: That's kind of a long story. </sentence><sentence id="313">The people in Jacksonville were very hospitable and we, being Yankee boys at Camp Blanding away from home, they thought it would be nice to invite the soldier boys from Camp Blanding to their various church and civic organizations where they put on dances and get togetherers with the young people of the local area, Jacksonville, and of course we were macho guys, and we wanted to have our beer on Saturday night. </sentence><sentence id="314">And when we'd go to those dances or whatever function they were having, all they had was soft drinks, and we didn't tend to go for that. </sentence><sentence id="315">So we declined a lot of these invitations and it got to the point where nobody was going on a voluntary basis; so the army decided we can't disappoint these people. </sentence><sentence id="316">You're going to have to go whether you like it or not. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="322">Q: Right. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="324">A: They volunteered. </sentence><sentence id="325">You, you, you, you, you get Class A uniform on, and you go. </sentence><sentence id="326">So I was one of those that got tiered to go, and I went to this dance one evening and met my wife and we were attracted to each other; so we started up a letter communication. </sentence><sentence id="327">There was no email back in those days; so the only way we could get together was to write, and so we just worked up a nice relationship. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="332">Q: And you recall the first time you saw her, the first time you laid eyes on her? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="334">A: Yeah. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="336">Q: And what was that like? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="338">A: I'm sorry. </sentence><sentence id="339">I didn't get that question. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="342">Q: What did you think when you first saw her? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="344">A: Well, I just thought she was nice looking girl that I'd be interested coming back to see her again. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="346">Q: Sure. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="348">A: So we started writing back and forth, and we'd go back to Jacksonville and visit with her and met her family, and that was when I--I left Camp Blanding and went to Fort Benning and went to Camp Wheeler and sort of picked up the writing communication again with her. </sentence><sentence id="349">And I decided it was time that we got more serious. </sentence><sentence id="350">We did, and in--I think it was January 1st of "42, I invited her to come up to Camp Wheeler, and I give her an engagement ring, and in the following March we were married there at Camp Wheeler. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="355">Q: That was a lovely way to start the new year. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="357">A: Yeah. </sentence><sentence id="358">In a way. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="361">Q: Indeed. </sentence><sentence id="362">So let's go back to Britain then. </sentence><sentence id="363">You're in the South of England. </sentence><sentence id="364">You're writing to your wife at that time as well? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="369">A: Oh yes. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="371">Q: What was it like being away from her? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="373">A: Well, of course I missed her, but we were so busy working, training, that I didn't have much time to dwell on the fact that I'm away from home and I'm lonesome. </sentence><sentence id="374">I was--of course I missed her, but we just had so many activities going on that we didn't have time to get homesick. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="377">Q: Sure. </sentence><sentence id="378">Had you had children by that time or not? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="381">A: I'm sorry? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="383">Q: Did you have any children at that time? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="385">A: No. </sentence><sentence id="386">No we did not. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="389">Q: So when did--when was it made clear to you that you were going to be sent into combat that you were going into continent, and where did you go? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="391">A: Well, we were on the south coast of England, and we could hear the planes of the Air Force going over every night. </sentence><sentence id="392">Bombing somewhere over on the continent and, of course, everything was top secret until the--well, actually it was the Sth of June. </sentence><sentence id="393">At the night of the 5th of June, we heard this tremendous roar of planes going, and that just continued on and on and on. </sentence><sentence id="394">And we're not hearing any planes coming back; so they were making a wide circle, bombing and then coming back. </sentence><sentence id="395">And it was continuing on all night, and this was unusual because normally they would--the planes would go out and we'd hear them coming back, and that was it. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="401">Q: Right. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="403">A: So we knew that that was probably the beginning of the invasion, and of course then the next day, we read in the newspapers that the invasion had started and right at that time we were moved to the marshalling area near South Hampton in preparation for the crossing. </sentence><sentence id="404">Now on D Day, the Ist and the 29th Division were the assault troops to go across the channel and land on Omaha Beach and our 30th Division went in behind the 29th five days later. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="407">Q: So you entered the European theater, combat theater, at D Day plus five? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="409">A: Yeah. </sentence><sentence id="410">That's right, yeah. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="413">Q: What was your position at the time of deployment? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="415">A: I was the platoon leader in the heavy weapon company, border platoon leader. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="417">Q: What was your first experience of combat, sir? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="419">A: I'm sorry? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="421">Q: What was your first experience of combat? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="423">A: Well, it was different than what we expected. </sentence><sentence id="424">When we were in England, we were all gung ho to go there and tear those guys up and make short of the situation, drive the Germans back and into their own country. </sentence><sentence id="425">But we had done some training with live ammunition, but it was all very closely guarded so that we would not have any casualties or accidents. </sentence><sentence id="426">Once we got over to Europe, there was no safety regulations, and bullets were flying around fast and furious, and we never knew when the silver bullet was going to hit it us. </sentence><sentence id="427">It was an entirely different situation. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="433">Q: Do you remember the first time, the very, very first time that either you received fire or you returned fire? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="435">A: Yeah. </sentence><sentence id="436">It was on the 15th of June. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="439">Q: Okay. </sentence><sentence id="440">Where were you? </sentence><sentence id="441">Tell me about it. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="445">A: We landed on Omaha Beach, and I can recall it very well because this was on my birthday, the 13th of June. </sentence><sentence id="446">I'm just talking with my wife here. </sentence><sentence id="447">We landed on my birthday on the 13th of June and moved into what we call a bivouac area because this area had been cleared out by the 29th Division about two to three miles inland and so we stayed in the bivouac area over night, and the next day we marched into this little village of Montmarte Grenyas which the 29th Division the day before had taken but were driven back out of it. </sentence><sentence id="448">And so it was our job to then get back into this town, clear it out, and continue on from there. </sentence><sentence id="449">And that was our first day of combat, and we were green. </sentence><sentence id="450">We just didn't realize the seriousness of what this whole thing was all about until the silver bullet hit some of our friends, and they encountered mines. </sentence><sentence id="451">They were hit by artillery shrapnel. </sentence><sentence id="452">And this was--these guys were being hit, became casualties, and the medics had to take care of them the best they could, and then the next--through the night and the next day we had to get replacements in for those men that were casualties of that day. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="461">Q: As a platoon leader, how did that effect you were you--tell me </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="462">A: I was responsible for 50 men in my platoon, and everything I did, I had to consider the safety of those men to do the actions that we did in firing our mortars, locating positions that were best suited for us, and to have protection as best we could. </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="463">Q: And did you lose any men on that day or on subsequent days? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="465">A: That first day, no. </sentence><sentence id="466">I didn't lose any men, but in subsequent following men, I did lose some men. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="469">Q: That must have been extraordinarily difficult. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="471">A: It was because they were men that I had trained with some back in the states, and some in through my period in England, and during this period of time, you become close to your men and almost like family. </sentence><sentence id="472">And, you know, it hurts when you see a man get wounded or killed, and you feel a partially responsible for it--although it's not your fault-- you feel that you lost one of your boys, and it hurt. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="475">Q: You described just now as rather like being a family. </sentence><sentence id="476">As a platoon leader, did you look at the men under your command, were they more like sons to you or more like brothers? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="479">A: more like sons because, as I mentioned, when I landed there, I was 27 years old on my birthday, and most of my men were 18, 19, 20 years old, what I call kids. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="481">Q: Right. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="483">A: So there was a little bit of a gap there, and I felt more or less they were my sons that I had to take care of them. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="485">Q: Sure. </sentence><sentence id="486">What did you think of--you said before going into combat you had that attitude that. </sentence><sentence id="487">You were going to go in and show these guys the what for. </sentence><sentence id="488">Once you had that experience of close combat, what did you think about the Germans? </sentence><sentence id="489">Were they good soldiers? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="495">A: We found that--we really learned that they were well trained, well disciplined soldiers, and they had weapons that were as good as or better than what we had. </sentence><sentence id="496">And the only way we gained the upper hand was the fact that we just had more men. </sentence><sentence id="497">We had more weapons, more tanks and we just overpowered them by sheer numbers rather than technical better weapons. </sentence><sentence id="498">They had better weapons than we had. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="503">Q: Sure. </sentence><sentence id="504">But let's talk about that a little more. </sentence><sentence id="505">How did you view them, the Germans, that is to say the German soldiers. </sentence><sentence id="506">How did you view them? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="511">A: Well, they were good. </sentence><sentence id="512">The most of them, the Wehrmachts, were very good soldiers, well disciplined. </sentence><sentence id="513">One of the big differences that we found is that they went strictly by the book. </sentence><sentence id="514">Whatever was in the training manuals, whatever their leaders told them to do, that's what they did, nothing more. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="520">Q: Okay. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="522">A: But with the American soldiers, we adapted. </sentence><sentence id="523">We were told what to do and how to do it, but if that didn't work, then we had the liberty of doing something else that would work, and we had that flexibility which the Germans did not have. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="526">Q: Okay. </sentence><sentence id="527">Now, as you're moving inland, moving deeper and deeper into France, at some point you came into contact with Jews. </sentence><sentence id="528">Can you tell us about that first experience with Jews? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="532">A: Jews? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="534">Q: Yes. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="536">A: Okay. </sentence><sentence id="537">We did not have any contact with Jews. </sentence><sentence id="538">Now, let me go back a little bit. </sentence><sentence id="539">Back in the early training days. </sentence><sentence id="540">Occasionally, we would hear or read in the newspapers about some Jews being tortured in Europe, slave laborers, and this periodically would appear, but we never pay much attention to it because what we were hearing was that some Jew would escape from some camp--we didn't know about Auschwitz and Dachau back in those days. </sentence><sentence id="541">We heard there were these camps where they were concentrating Jews and torturing them and using them as slave labor, but the story that we would get was that a Jew escaped from a camp, went back to his hometown, and told the people about what was going on in this camp--that the Jews were being tortured and used as slave labor. </sentence><sentence id="542">They wouldn't--they did not believe him. </sentence><sentence id="543">The Jewish congregation in his town did not believe him because, like us, we thought of the German people as being civilized human beings, inelegant people, and they would not do that to another segment of human beings. </sentence><sentence id="544">So this went on, periodically, we would read articles like this while we were in England, but when we got into France, we saw none of that. </sentence><sentence id="545">In fact, Jews didn't even cross our mind. </sentence><sentence id="546">That was not why we were there. </sentence><sentence id="547">We weren't there to liberate to Jews. </sentence><sentence id="548">We didn't know about that whole situation. </sentence><sentence id="549">We were there to drive the Germans out of the land which they had occupied illegally. </sentence><sentence id="550">So we were not concerned with Jews, and we never really saw any Jews because the Germans had taken them all out of France back to Germany to use them as slave laborers. </sentence><sentence id="551">So as we proceeded through Normandy and Northern France and into Belgium, we did never saw or had any contact with any Jews. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="568">Q: Okay. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="570">A: They were all gone. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="572">Q: Right. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="574">A: So we continued on through Belgium and into Holland in the Battle of the Bulge during the winter of "44 "45, and then we captured the City of Aachen, which was the first city to fall in Germany. </sentence><sentence id="575">And up to that time, we had seen nor heard nothing about any Jews. </sentence><sentence id="576">Now, we continued up onto northward through Monchengladbach and Hameln, Detmold, and we crossed the Rhine River on the 24th of March. </sentence><sentence id="577">Now, up to that time, we had seen nor heard nothing about Jews. </sentence><sentence id="578">That was not in our anything that we cared about. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="584">Q: Sure. </sentence><sentence id="585">As you're fighting along and as you're moving through Belgium and in the Netherlands and Germany, what have you, is the German resistance getting stiffer or can- -do you sense has being an officer that it </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="586">A: Oh it was getting much less. </sentence><sentence id="587">From the time--we had our last major battle in France at the City of Mortain, and that was the beginning of what we called the rat race, that they were moving back to Germany almost as fast as they could. </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="588">Q: So as an officer, you could sense them in retreat? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="590">A: I'm sorry? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="592">Q: You could sense them in retreat? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="594">A: Well, yes. </sentence><sentence id="595">Yeah. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="598">Q: So you crossed the Rhine. </sentence><sentence id="599">Let's go to that period of time, and you're pressing on. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="602">A: Right. </sentence><sentence id="603">So we were just chasing them. </sentence><sentence id="604">They were doing what we call--I forgot what it is now--sort of defensive action as they were retreating, and the major part of the German army was moving back eastward toward Germany, and they would leave a small segment of men behind to delay us, to create delaying actions. </sentence><sentence id="605">And that's all we did all the way across northern France and up into Belgium and Holland and not until we got into Holland and the German border where they had the Siegfried Line. </sentence><sentence id="606">That's where we had to stop and of course they stopped as well, but the reason that we stopped there was that we had run across France and Belgium and Holland so fast, we had outrun our supply lines. </sentence><sentence id="607">Now, all of our supplies had to come across England, across the channel into Omaha Beach, and by truck, move them up daily to supply us with food, ammunition, clothing, replacements. </sentence><sentence id="608">So it was kind of a slow process, and we were moving faster than the supply lines could keep up with us. </sentence><sentence id="609">So by the time we got to Holland and the Siegfried Line, we had left thousands of vehicles behind because we ran out of gasoline. </sentence><sentence id="610">We just dropped the vehicles off at the side of the road and abandoned them more or less. </sentence><sentence id="611">So by the time we got to Holland, we were out of food, we were out of ammunition, we were out of gasoline. </sentence><sentence id="612">So we had to stop there nearly a month waiting for supplies to reach us and become resupplied with ammunition, with food, replacement men before we could    make a successful attack on the Siegfried Line, and once we got the momentum going, to keep on going. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="625">Q: When did that happen? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="627">A: That was in about February of "44 or "45. </sentence><sentence id="628">I'm sorry. </sentence><sentence id="629">February "45 that we crashed through the Siegfried Line and we had enough momentum going that we just kept on going, and got up to Monchengladbach and Wessel and across the Rhine River, which was the biggest major obstacle that we had at that time. </sentence><sentence id="630">So we continued on from crossing the Rhine River 24th of March and headed to Brunswick, which is in the northern part of Germany. </sentence><sentence id="631">Now, up to this time, we had not seen nor heard anything about Jews or concentration camps. </sentence><sentence id="632">Nothing. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="639">Q: Now, this should have been around April, was it not? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="641">A: This was the 10th of April that we captured Brunswick. </sentence><sentence id="642">Now, there was a concentration camp BergenBelsen which was a little bit north of Brunswick, because that was in the British zone. </sentence><sentence id="643">So we had nothing to do with it, but it was there nevertheless. </sentence><sentence id="644">But we didn't even hear about it. </sentence><sentence id="645">We captured Brunswick, and then our next objective was Magdeburg. </sentence><sentence id="646">It was probably 75 or 100 miles further east, and we started moving from Brunswick on toward Magdeburg, and we came to this town of Hillersleben where there was a large German air base. </sentence><sentence id="647">We captured that, and then there was a number of large barracks and a hospital, and we thought nothing of it. </sentence><sentence id="648">We just captured that town and went onto the next town of Farsleben. </sentence><sentence id="649">As we were approaching this little village of Farsleben--this village is probably a thousand people at the most. </sentence><sentence id="650">We met some soldiers who were walking along the side of the road westward, and they said that up in Farsleben, the Germans are preparing an attack, an ambush, for you. </sentence><sentence id="651">And they are protecting a trainload of people. </sentence><sentence id="652">We didn't understand exactly what they meant by "a trainload of people." </sentence><sentence id="653">So we had our reconnaissance unit, which was a few tanks and infantry men on the tanks to move forward to this town of Farsleben. </sentence><sentence id="654">They found no resistance in the town. </sentence><sentence id="655">They cleared it out, and on the east side of the town, there was a little hill, and the tanks were still moving forward, and as they mounted the hill, and looked down into the little valley on the other side, they saw a train sitting there with a bunch of people milling around doing whatever they wanted to do really. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="671">Q: Okay. </sentence><sentence id="672">This should have been--just to clarify where we are in time, that should of been probably the 12th or 13th of April. </sentence><sentence id="673">Somewhere around there? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="677">A: This was the 13th of April. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="679">Q: Okay. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="681">A: That was when we liberated Brunswick on the 10th, and I think we liberated Hillersleben on the 11th or 12th, and this was the next day, the 13th of April, 1945. </sentence><sentence id="682">We saw this train, and not knowing exactly what it was, very cautiously we approached it. </sentence><sentence id="683">They in turn--they saw the tanks and recognized them as American tanks. </sentence><sentence id="684">And they came rushing forward to meet and greet us. </sentence><sentence id="685">Then, we found--through a few of these people who could speak a little bit of English, and one of our guys was a Jew, and he could speak a little bit of Hebrew. </sentence><sentence id="686">Well, they began to communicate, and what they found was this train had about 2,500 people on it. </sentence><sentence id="687">And it had come from BergenBelsen. </sentence><sentence id="688">Well, what is BergenBelsen? </sentence><sentence id="689">We never heard of it. </sentence><sentence id="690">Okay. </sentence><sentence id="691">They told BergenBelsen was a concentration camp where they had about 50,000 Jews. </sentence><sentence id="692">This was the first time, the very first time, that we had ever heard of a concentration camp of Jews. </sentence><sentence id="693">This was the first time we had met any Jews. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="708">Q: How close did you physically--how close did you personally get to that train? </sentence><sentence id="709">Were you right on top of it? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="712">A: Well, I was not there the first day. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="714">Q: Okay. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="716">A: See, I was with the other unit, and this was the 743rd tank battalion, which was part of our unit. </sentence><sentence id="717">They were the lead reconnaissance group that were up in the very front. </sentence><sentence id="718">So they were the first ones to meet this group of people, and I didn't see them actually until the next day. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="722">Q: And when you did see them </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="723">A: It was a horrible scene because they had just been liberated--I need to go back just a minute now. </sentence><sentence id="724">On the 6th of April, the camp commander of BergenBelsen was aware that the British troops were approaching his camp, and he wanted to get the inmates of the camp out of there as quickly as he could so that they would not see the condition that these people were in. </sentence><sentence id="725">So on the 4th, 5th, and 6th of April, they loaded up three different trains loaded with about 2,500 Jews and sent them eastward towards a town of Theresienstadt, which was another concentration camp. </sentence><sentence id="726">And that was going to be the final solution for these people. </sentence><sentence id="727">So one was a train that actually did arrive at Theresienstadt, and the second train was captured by the Russian Army, and this was the third train that had come from BergenBelsen. </sentence><sentence id="728">Now, it took six days for that train to come from BergenBelsen to Farsleben. </sentence><sentence id="729">That train was made up of what they call cattle cars-- cattle wagons. </sentence><sentence id="730">They're like our small freight trains. </sentence><sentence id="731">They're a smaller than our normal freight trains. </sentence><sentence id="732">We had used this type of freight train in World War I, and we called them 40 and 8s. </sentence><sentence id="733">Noting that each car was capable of handling 40 men or 8 horses, and that was the general mode of transportation back in World War I, to move troops around by train. </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="734">Q: Okay. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="736">A: So these are these cattle cars they call them, 40 and 8s, which we had put 40 men in. </sentence><sentence id="737">They had 75 or 80 people in these cars. </sentence><sentence id="738">And they were locked in there. </sentence><sentence id="739">In the corner of the car, they had what we would normally term it like a fivegallon bucket that was their sanitary facility. </sentence><sentence id="740">And if you can imagine 75 or 80 people crammed into one of those small freight cars, and the guy over here in the corner needs to relieve himself, there's no way that he can get over to that bucket and relieve himself. </sentence><sentence id="741">So the only alternative he had was just let it run down his legs. </sentence><sentence id="742">So this is the condition that we found these people in. </sentence><sentence id="743">After six days of standing--there was no way that they could sit or lay down--the only way they could get on the floor was by exhaustion that they would just crumple and fall down to to floor, and they just had to stay there. </sentence><sentence id="744">And that's the condition when we opened these cars up that we found these people, stinking from their feces and urine of six days, dirty, lice infested. </sentence><sentence id="745">It was a horrible sight. </sentence><sentence id="746">Something that we could not believe that was happening. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="758">Q: How did you react when you saw them, and how did they react when they saw you as Americans? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="760">A: Well, we were reacted, you know, we didn't believe what we were seeing. </sentence><sentence id="761">You know, we could communicate very vaguely because the language barrier with these people, but to see and understand where they had come from, the conditions that they had for those six days on the train, it was just nauseating to smell these people. </sentence><sentence id="762">We didn't dare to touch them because we were afraid of getting lice on us, fleas, Typhus--which was very rampant disease in those days. </sentence><sentence id="763">We didn't want to actually touch these people at all. </sentence><sentence id="764">They wanted to greet us and hug us and kiss us; so we just had to kind of rebel against them and not have any personal contact with them as much as we could. </sentence><sentence id="765">Now, we understood where they were coming from and the condition that they had. </sentence><sentence id="766">They were hungry, they had only gotten one meal a day which consisted of a big bucket of soup as they called it which was nothing more but a pail of water with some potato peelings or turnip peelings in it. </sentence><sentence id="767">And they were very lucky if they got a few of the turnip peelings in their cup of soup that they got every day. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="776">Q: How were they clothed when you saw them? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="778">A: Well, some of them were fairly well clothed. </sentence><sentence id="779">The Dutch people and a few of the others were being held more as hostage for exchange purposes with the Americans for some of the German prisoners that we were holding. </sentence><sentence id="780">So they were in fairly good condition and clothing was fairly good, but for the most part, their clothes was very ragged. </sentence><sentence id="781">They were not in the stripped prison uniforms that you often see in pictures. </sentence><sentence id="782">They were in their own civilian clothing, but they had worn these clothes for months and months and months without any possibility of repair. </sentence><sentence id="783">If they got a tear in the clothing, that was it. </sentence><sentence id="784">It's too bad. </sentence><sentence id="785">And the shoes, they were just worn out. </sentence><sentence id="786">Basically there was nothing left of their shoes, just the tops. </sentence><sentence id="787">They were in horrible condition as far as clothing was concerned and hungry. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="799">Q: As best you could tell from the languages that they were speaking, and you when you were speaking and interacting with them, where were these people coming from? </sentence><sentence id="800">Were they primarily Germans? </sentence><sentence id="801">Dutch? </sentence><sentence id="802">French? </sentence><sentence id="803">Italians-- </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="804">A: Oh no. </sentence><sentence id="805">These prisoners were from eastern country: Hungry, Poland, Romania, Ukraine, a number of them were from Holland, a few from France. </sentence><sentence id="806">They were a varied nationalities, and this made the communication with them more difficult because they spoke so many different foreign languages that we understood nothing at all accept a few that--there was one girl in particular who was quite intelligent, and she was fluent in about six languages. </sentence><sentence id="807">So she was the main interpreter for this group. </sentence><sentence id="808">And a few of the others, they had a little bit of what we call Pigeon English. </sentence><sentence id="809">They had a word here or there that they could fling out, and we could understand what they were trying to say. </sentence><sentence id="810">It was mostly sign language, but we felt sorry for them because they were so hungry and they saw us in nice, clean uniforms, smoking cigarettes, and eating candy bars. </sentence><sentence id="811">They just went wild when we handed them a candy bar or a pack of cigarettes, and they were just be fighting over them. </sentence><sentence id="812">But the problem that we did not understand was that these people had not had any kind of food for months. </sentence><sentence id="813">They were on a very, very limited ration, and we were eating high protein food, and as we gave them a candy bar or chocolate or something that we had in our pocket, it was so--their bodies just could not assimilate this high protein food that we had. </sentence><sentence id="814">And they would just gobbled it down, and as soon as they did, they would throw it up. </sentence><sentence id="815">And, of course, by this time the medics--we had gotten the medics in there because there was just so many of these people were sick, and had medical problems that we had to have the medical battalion come in and administer care to them. </sentence><sentence id="816">They said, "Hey, don't give these guys any more food." </sentence><sentence id="817">And they took over from that point on to care for their feeding, and they took our rations and diluted them down with water. </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="818">Q: And what were the--you're talking about the rations that presumably the medical ward took over. </sentence><sentence id="819">Were those--what were those? </sentence><sentence id="820">Were they Krations or </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="821">A: Yeah, they would take our Krations and Crations and water them down so that they were more easily assimilated by these people. </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="822">Q: How long did it take to get those--the corpsmen and the medical personnel--their--how long of a delay was it before the time that you saw them? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="824">A: It was a matter of hours. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="826">Q: I see. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="828">A: Just a matter of hours, because they were located with our division headquarters, and that's where I was at the time. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="830">Q: Right. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="832">A: That they were brought in there and administered help to them, and this was where I got assigned a job of moving these people away from this point in Farsleben because actually this was still a battle zone, and we had American artillery falling in the area. </sentence><sentence id="833">We had German artillery falling in the area. </sentence><sentence id="834">So we didn't want to have anymore casualties. </sentence><sentence id="835">So I was delegated then to round up transportation and take these people out of there to this town of Hillersleben that we had liberated a couple of days before where there was a barracks and a hospital. </sentence><sentence id="836">So I rounded up about 60 or 70 vehicles and got them loaded up and got them out of the area back to Hillersleben. </sentence><sentence id="837">And of course, the medical corps went with them, and they put the sick people in the hospital, and the others went into the barracks, but first of all, as soon as we brought them back to Hillersleben, they were so dirty and stinking and filthy that there was nothing that we could do to give them clean clothing, so we had to have them strip their clothing off, and the engineer battalion set up some shower points, and we started moving them through the showers--the first shower that they had had in months and years. </sentence><sentence id="838">And as soon as they got through the shower, of course, they were given towels and soap, and they were so happy to get cleaned up to little bit, but even through the shower, they could not get rid of the lice that were infested in their hair and in their pubic hairs. </sentence><sentence id="839">And so after they finished the shower, we dusted them with DDT. </sentence><sentence id="840">Now, DDT is today a prohibited item because it's a carcinoginious[sic] item and is, by law, is prohibited for use. </sentence><sentence id="841">But at that time that was the best technology that we had to fight lice and fleas any kind of insect that they might have. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="852">Q: Did it work? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="854">A: It worked. </sentence><sentence id="855">So then we had the German people were ordered to bring clothing to this point and of course they were reclothed, and then the single people were put in the barracks. </sentence><sentence id="856">The married people were put in to some of the private homes that were available. </sentence><sentence id="857">And at this point, I left them. </sentence><sentence id="858">They went back to my unit and continued on my job, and we fought or way onto Magdeburg and we attacked, captured Magdeburg on the 18th of April, and as far as we were concerned, that was the end of the war. </sentence><sentence id="859">Because the Elm River which ran through Magdeburg was the demarcation line between us and the Russians. </sentence><sentence id="860">We could not go beyond that line. </sentence><sentence id="861">So we stopped fighting on the 18th of April, and just sat there and wait for the Russians to come in front of us and move on into Berlin. </sentence><sentence id="862">But basically that was the end of the war, and that was the first and only contact that we had ever had with any Jews, this group of the 2,500 on the train. </sentence><sentence id="863">And of course, in talking with some of them, we found out where they came from, and that they had been incarcerated at BergenBelsen, and they told us a story about their life in BergenBelsen and them being put on the train, and then we captured them. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="874">Q: Did they tell you about mass killings? </sentence><sentence id="875">Did they tell you about-- </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="876">A: Well, no because BergenBelsen was not a killing camp you might say. </sentence><sentence id="877">It was a camp where they worked 1215 hours a day, and the working conditions were not good. </sentence><sentence id="878">The food was not good. </sentence><sentence id="879">Their living conditions not good. </sentence><sentence id="880">They told us about their life there in BergenBelsen. </sentence><sentence id="881">I was going to say they didn't have a large crematorium or gas chambers or anything like that in BergenBelsen. </sentence><sentence id="882">It was just a slave labor camp, and part of it was an exchange camp, as I mentioned before, to exchange the people for German prisoners, but they told us about the hardships they had, the life that they had, the living conditions in the barracks there at BergenBelsen was very bad. </sentence><sentence id="883">They had bunks, I think four high, and three or four people had to sleep in one bunk. </sentence><sentence id="884">The living conditions were very, very bad there at BergenBelsen. </sentence><sentence id="885">So this is basically the first time that we ever heard of Jews, slave labor, crematoriums, gas chambers. </sentence><sentence id="886">We never heard anything like that before. </sentence><sentence id="887">We could hardly believe what they were telling us. </sentence><sentence id="888">And they got a lot of this information from some of the inmates who had come Auschwitz and Dachau were being overcrowded there, and they moved them into BergenBelsen, and then those prisoners in turn were telling the others about what was going on in these other camps. </sentence><sentence id="889">That's how they knew what was going on there. </sentence><sentence id="890">And so, you know, we were not trained as humanitarians. </sentence><sentence id="891">We were trained as soldiers. </sentence><sentence id="892">And basically when we saw this train and these Jews, the condition that they were in, we really didn't know what to do. </sentence><sentence id="893">We did the best we could with what we had. </sentence><sentence id="894">Most of it was wrong, by feeding them the food the way we did. </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="895">Q: Did your understanding of what you were fighting for and why we you fighting change with that encounter? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="897">A: Well, we weren't--as we were fighting across Europe, we weren't fighting to save any Jews. </sentence><sentence id="898">We didn't know about them. </sentence><sentence id="899">We were fighting to drive the Germans back out of these occupied countries, to give these people in France, Belgium, and Holland--to give their freedom and liberty back that they had had back in 1940 when they were invaded by the Germans. </sentence><sentence id="900">The Jewish situation was just sort of a sideline that happened that we didn't know anything about. </sentence><sentence id="901">We didn't know what was going on until we saw, and then we believed. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="907">Q: And did that change your attitudes towards the Germans? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="909">A: Well, basically at that point in time, it was too late because here we are at the end of the war now. </sentence><sentence id="910">So from that point on, we didn't have much contact with the Germans. </sentence><sentence id="911">The war was over. </sentence><sentence id="912">| think it was the 8th of May; so it was only about three weeks after we found this train that the war ended. </sentence><sentence id="913">Of course, we didn't have any good feelings toward the Germans because they were denying everything, and we knew that they were lying, that they were involved in it. </sentence><sentence id="914">They knew about it. </sentence><sentence id="915">They knew what was going on. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="924">Q: When did you hear that the war had ended, and how did you hear about it? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="926">A: I'm sorry? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="928">Q: When did you hear that the war was over, and how did you hear about it? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="930">A: Well, he were in Magdeburg until--basically just sitting there waiting for the Russians to come up in front of us, and I think we got word through our higher channels came down to us that the war had officially ended on the 8th of May. </sentence><sentence id="931">Like I say, we were in Magdeburg, liberated that on the 18th of April, and we could not cross the river to liberate anything more. </sentence><sentence id="932">We just had to sit there and wait for the Russians because that was declared to be their territory. </sentence><sentence id="933">So we had to sit there from the 18th of April I think until about the 25th or 26th of April before the Russians actually moved up in front of us, and we met with them. </sentence><sentence id="934">So of course we knew then the Russians were allocated that territory, which included the city of Berlin, and as soon as they moved in front of us and on up to Berlin, they captured it, that the war was going to be over very, very soon. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="940">Q: And did you meet with or interact with any of the Russians? </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="950">Q: Did you write any letters home to your wife about what you experienced with that train? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="952">A: That I really don't remember. </sentence><sentence id="953">I did write to her basically every day. </sentence><sentence id="954">I'm sure that I did, but very unfortunately after | came home, she had piles of these letters that I written to her. </sentence><sentence id="955">She had saved all my letters, and she returned letters wrote to me every day, which I saved and I would send them back to her, bundles of them, back to her and she saved them. </sentence><sentence id="956">So when I came home, we had boxes and boxes of these letters, and what we were going to do with this stuff? </sentence><sentence id="957">We dumped it, and it was the worst thing I ever did because in those liters I wrote to her in sort of a coded way where I was what I was doing because all of our mail was censored because we were not allowed to tell where we were or what we were doing. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="964">Q: Sure. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="966">A: But in a coded way I could relate to her where I was and what I was doing. </sentence><sentence id="967">So all those things were in there, and the men that I had contact with from day to day, the things that I did from day to day. </sentence><sentence id="968">That was a historical document, and we just threw all of that away because I know all that stuff. </sentence><sentence id="969">I can remember all those people. </sentence><sentence id="970">But now today, I can't remember those things. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="977">Q: Sure. </sentence><sentence id="978">When did you get word that you were going to be sent back to the States? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="981">A: I'm sorry again? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="983">Q: When did you get word that you were going to be sent back to the States? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="985">A: Oh, when we ended the war, basically the 8th of May, we moved southward about 50 miles into an area of occupation, and it was at that time we were notified that the 30th Division was prioritized to come back to the States and have a 15day leave and do some 30day training and go to the Pacific and help finish the war in the Pacific. </sentence><sentence id="986">So we were geared for that, and that was in probably in July. </sentence><sentence id="987">So in midearly August, we started moving back through France and to England in preparation to return to the States, and while we were in England, they dropped the bomb on Hiroshima and Nagasaki. </sentence><sentence id="988">And that, in fact, ended the war, and we felt right then and there that we would not--have--we may have to go to the Pacific, but there would not be any war to be fought as we had planned. </sentence><sentence id="989">We came home, and we were given a 30day leave and during that time, the Great White Fathers of Washington were mulling over what are we going to do with all these guys now. </sentence><sentence id="990">We don't need them anymore. </sentence><sentence id="991">The war in the Pacific is over. </sentence><sentence id="992">So they sent telegrams to everybody telling them to report to their nearest military installation for further orders, which they did. </sentence><sentence id="993">And the most of them got their discharge, and that ended their military service. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1003">Q: But you stayed on? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1005">A: I stayed on. </sentence><sentence id="1006">We had the opportunity to volunteer to stay in service or take a discharge, and I volunteered to stay in service, and so I reported back to the 30th Division, which was then we head quartered at Fort Jackson in South Carolina; so I remained there for about six months. </sentence><sentence id="1007">I was company commander of the 5th Corps Headquarters Company, and at the end of that six months, we were given the opportunity to go to another station in occupation duty, and we were given the opportunity to like the Caribbean, Panama area, Hawaii, and a few other places plus Japan and Europe. </sentence><sentence id="1008">Well, of course Japan and Europe were at the bottom of my list and actually the Hawaii or the Caribbean were at the top of the list, and that's what I chose, but what did I get? </sentence><sentence id="1009">I got orders to go back to Europe. </sentence><sentence id="1010">So I went back to Europe and was stationed in Frankfurt Germany and remained there for three years. </sentence><sentence id="1011">Now, during that time, after I was over there for about four five months, dependants were allowed to come over and join us. </sentence><sentence id="1012">So my wife came to Frankfurt, and we lived there, and that's where we had our family--I'm sorry. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1075">Q: Okay. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1077">A: And then exactly one year later, we had a son born. </sentence><sentence id="1078">Also in the 97th General Hospital. </sentence><sentence id="1079">Now, although they were born in Frankfurt, Germany, I, being an American citizen and she also--they were registered with the United States embassy there, and they are actually American citizens, although they were born in Germany. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1113">Q: Now, that experience with those people on that train, that really wasn't the end of it for you, was it? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1115">A: No. </sentence><sentence id="1116">I never gave it much thought until--I guess in the 80s, we were cleaning out some junk in somewhere, holdings, and I came across a little notebooks that I had kept sort of a diary in. </sentence><sentence id="1117">And I had a lot of information about this train--the encounter with that train, and I just stopped to think about those days and those people, and I thought that that would be a good historical document. </sentence><sentence id="1118">And so I took all the notes that I had in those notebooks and kind of put them together in a handwritten document this was before the days of computers really, and--but a little later, when computers--when the university got involved with computers, I started transferring all that stuff into my computer. </sentence><sentence id="1119">Well, I had this document there and still did nothing with it, just a document for future historical purposes, but it was not until 2005 that I had the opportunity to go back the Magdeburg, Germany. </sentence><sentence id="1120">Now, this was a little story in itself. </sentence><sentence id="1121">A few years before this, I had had communication with a young girl in Magdeburg who was working at the University of Magdeburg on her Ph. </sentence><sentence id="1122">D thesis which was on the liberation of Magdeburg. </sentence><sentence id="1123">Now, when we left Magdeburg in May of 1945, this became a part of the Russian zone. </sentence><sentence id="1124">The Russians moved into Magdeburg and they purged everything that was in the libraries and schools, archives, any documents that were in English and anything that was related to the liberation of Magdeburg. </sentence><sentence id="1125">They instilled in the people of Magdeburg that they were the liberators of Magdeburg. </sentence><sentence id="1126">And for the next 40 years, that was the belief that the people of Magdeburg were brought up in. </sentence><sentence id="1127">So the young girl working on her thesis of the liberation of Magdeburg writing to me indicated that the Russians claimed that they had liberated Magdeburg, but friend of hers had a book which said something about the Americans had liberated Magdeburg. </sentence><sentence id="1128">What is the truth? </sentence><sentence id="1129">Now, she had found my name in the computer. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="1130">I'm not sure just how she found it, but she found my name connected with the 30th Division, and so she was asking this </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1131">Q: How did the Americans really liberate Magdeburg? </sentence><sentence id="1132">Well, of course I sent her back copies of pages from some of our history books and from my own personal knowledge about the liberation of Magdeburg on the 16th of the April, 1945. </sentence><sentence id="1133">She put this all together and wrote up her thesis, and she did get her Ph.D. but she took that document to the mayor of Magdeburg, and he was rather surprised to know that the Americans actually had liberated Magdeburg. </sentence><sentence id="1134">He was always of the impression that the Russians had liberated Magdeburg. </sentence><sentence id="1135">Now, we're coming up on April of 2005, which then was going to be the--I think the 40th or 50th anniversary of the liberation--this just happened to coincide with the 1200th anniversary of the founding of the City of Magdeburg. </sentence><sentence id="1136">So they were planing to have a big celebration on the anniversary of the founding of Magdeburg as well as the liberation of Magdeburg. </sentence><sentence id="1137">So in doing so, and unknown to me at the time, they invited a man who had been in a slave labor camp there in Magdeburg. </sentence><sentence id="1138">Now, in Magdeburg, there was a pulte ammunition works which was making ammunition for the German war machine, and this was operated by slave laborers, Jewish slave laborers, which had come from Buchenwald. </sentence><sentence id="1139">And we, the 30th Division, had actually liberated this slave labor camp, and that was in a matter of a few days after we had liberated the Farsleben group. </sentence><sentence id="1140">Anyway, the mayor, through another person, invited this man who--this Jew who had been a slave laborer in Magdeburg in the pulte ammunition works to come back to Magdeburg to tell the people about his incarceration. </sentence><sentence id="1141">At the same time he invited me to come to Magdeburg to tell the people about the actual liberation by the Americans. </sentence><sentence id="1142">So for the first time, when I got to Magdeburg, I met this man, the man who--the Jew that I had liberated in 1945. </sentence><sentence id="1143">So we worked up a nice relationship, and I found that he lived in Boca Raton, Florida, about three hours away from where I lived. </sentence><sentence id="1144">So this was a fascinating thing that I, a liberator, and he, a Jewish slave laborer, should end up living so close together here in Florida. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1160">Q: And have you been in communication with him since? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1162">A: I was. </sentence><sentence id="1163">I'm sorry. </sentence><sentence id="1164">He just died about a month ago. </sentence><sentence id="1165">Anyway, after we came back from Magdeburg, he sent me an email saying, "Frank, look at this web site. </sentence><sentence id="1166">It is tremendous." </sentence><sentence id="1167">And I opened up the web site, and it was a web site created by a history teacher up in the Hudson Falls, New York, and it was about a tank commander of the 743rd Tank Battalion having liberated a train in Magdeburg. </sentence><sentence id="1168">Well, I read the whole story through, and it was exactly the story that I related to you. </sentence><sentence id="1169">And how did this guy get this story? </sentence><sentence id="1170">So I got in contact with this teacher to find out what his relationship was to this web site and story. </sentence><sentence id="1171">And it seems that he was a World War II history buff, but he was at the time concentrating on the Holocaust. </sentence><sentence id="1172">And he gave his class a project to go out in the village and see if you can contact a veteran who had anything to do with his connection with the Holocaust. </sentence><sentence id="1173">The students brought their stories in, and read them. </sentence><sentence id="1174">They discussed them, but there was one boy who had a very unique story--that his grandfather was a tank commander in the 743rd Tank Battalion, and they had captured this train with 2,500 Jews on it. </sentence><sentence id="1175">Well, that's exactly my story. </sentence><sentence id="1176">So I got together with this teacher and we discussed his side of it, and I told him my connection with it. </sentence><sentence id="1177">And so we've been sort of collaborating together ever since. </sentence><sentence id="1178">Now, at the time, he put his web site out he got in--his story went out on the Internet, and the first hit that he had on it was from a lady in Australia. </sentence><sentence id="1179">Now, she was a young girl on that train, and her family moved to Australia at that time, and of course she's been there ever since, and she saw that web site, and she got back in contact with the teacher, and through that--and then he had two or three other hits up in New York. </sentence><sentence id="1180">So when I was discussing this matter with him, he had probably about 10 or 12 Jews that he had had contact with who were on that train. </sentence><sentence id="1181">Well, I said, you know, I've got this story about the train, and want to get involved in it. </sentence><sentence id="1182">So I went on the Internet and put my story out, and I started getting hits on it. </sentence><sentence id="1183">And it just snowballed, and eventually I got in contact with a person in Israel who had been a young boy. </sentence><sentence id="1184">He had been orphaned, and went to Israel--or went to Palestine and was adopted by a family, was educated there in Tel Aviv, and he became a doctor, a medical doctor and had practiced and just retired when I first got in contact with him. </sentence><sentence id="1185">He could not speak very good English, and it was very difficult for me to understand him, but his daughter was quite interested, and she could speak much better English than he could; although it was kind of broken up. </sentence><sentence id="1186">So she became very interested in his story because, as with many of these Jews, as they grew up, they wanted to forget the past. </sentence><sentence id="1187">They wanted to forget about the Holocaust and not even talk about it to their families. </sentence><sentence id="1188">So she was interested in it, and she wanted to hear more about it, wanted to learn what her father had been through. </sentence><sentence id="1189">So I gave her the whole story as I could recall, and she became very much involved in it. </sentence><sentence id="1190">And her father originally was from Budapest, he was Hungarian, and he remembered the names of some of the people, and she started researching there in Israel for some of those people, and she found a number of them. </sentence><sentence id="1191">So this increased our numbers of people who had survived this train. </sentence><sentence id="1192">Now, going back just a bit on this--on the train originally, there was about 2,500 people, and of them, there were about 600 children. </sentence><sentence id="1193">Now, I say children. </sentence><sentence id="1194">These are people 21 years of age and less. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1229">Q: Okay. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1231">A: Now, the Germans were quite meticulous about keeping records. </sentence><sentence id="1232">When that train left BergenBelsen, and we captured it there at Farsleben, the train commander had a list of all the people that were on that train. </sentence><sentence id="1233">That list contained their name, their birth date, and their birthplace, and of course other data too that was not really relevant. </sentence><sentence id="1234">That document was taken and retained by what is now the BergenBelsen Memorial, and I got a copy of that list and went through it and since it had the birth date of everybody that was on the train, I could determine who the children were. </sentence><sentence id="1235">So I sorted out all the children in the 600 names, and of those--I just assumed half of them were deceased because of malnutrition, age, and other causes. </sentence><sentence id="1236">So we're down to about the possibility of 300plus surviving children out there somewhere. </sentence><sentence id="1237">So with this young lady in Israel doing some research and finding some of these people and some of my research through the Internet, I have found </sentence></p><p><sentence id="1238"> 235 of these people, and I've been in contact with each one either by mail physical (phone interference) </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1239">Q: Can you say that last part again? </sentence><sentence id="1240">We had a trifle bit of audio difficulty, I lost you at you were contacting them by email. </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1241">A: Either by email or snail mail. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1243">Q: Okay. </sentence><sentence id="1244">And how many did you contact? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1247">A: I've contacted 235. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1249">Q: And they--did most of them respond to you? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1251">A: I'm sorry? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1253">Q: Did most of them respond to you? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1255">A: Oh yes, yes. </sentence><sentence id="1256">In fact, I'm in contact with them right now trying to get any kind of documents, copies of documents, that they might have. </sentence><sentence id="1257">Now, I need to go back here just a little bit. </sentence><sentence id="1258">At the time of the liberation, these people I'm talking about today, they were all young kids. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1263">Q: Sure. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1265">A: 21 years and less. </sentence><sentence id="1266">Those who were ten years and younger, they really don't remember much. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1269">Q: Okay. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1271">A: It's the group that's 10 to 21 they have a little memory of what was happening. </sentence><sentence id="1272">Prior to the war, their parents could see the handwriting on the wall, what was happening to the Jews. </sentence><sentence id="1273">And they were starting to make arrangements to get out of Europe to get away from Hitler and the program that he had to eliminate the Jews. </sentence><sentence id="1274">So many of them had obtained passports from various countries wherever they would be accepted. </sentence><sentence id="1275">Now, in those years, there was a great deal of antiSemitism that United States did not want these Jews. </sentence><sentence id="1276">They had a very, very limited quota, and that's all they would take in here. </sentence><sentence id="1277">So these people got passports to South American countries, Australia, African countries, Canada. </sentence><sentence id="1278">Some got passports to the United States. </sentence><sentence id="1279">So whatever place these people had passports for, that's where they went. </sentence><sentence id="1280">They went--they scattered all over the world because they were citizens of that country. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1291">Q: Sure. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1293">A: And we at the time of the liberation furnished transportation to them to whatever country they had a passport for. </sentence><sentence id="1294">Now, just last night, I was talking with a girl--lady in Australia, by Skype, and she said she had just found two more girls or ladies in Australia. </sentence><sentence id="1295">So that is the way this thing snowballed. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1300">Q: Yes. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1302">A: So I got two more people that I've got to start researching in Australia. </sentence><sentence id="1303">But we had a lot of them come here to the United States too, but must of them are settled up in around the New York area. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1306">Q: Okay. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1308">A: There's very few here in Florida, and there's a group up in Carolina and a few out in California, and they're just scattered all over. </sentence><sentence id="1309">So two years ago, this young lady in Israel thought it would be a nice idea to have a reunion of some of these people. </sentence><sentence id="1310">So we--she sent word out to them, and I sent word out to the people in the States about a reunion that they wanted to have in April--two and a half years ago. </sentence><sentence id="1311">So we have this reunion in her town in Rehovot, which is between Tel Aviv and Jerusalem. </sentence><sentence id="1312">And we had 60 of the survivors plus their children and grandchildren--total about 500 people. </sentence><sentence id="1313">And we assembled at the Weizmann Institute there in Rehovot. </sentence><sentence id="1314">They had a large auditorium in which we met. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1322">Q: What was that like seeing them again now as grown people who had made lives </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1323">A: It was very emotional to meet these people that I had had a little hand in liberating 6569 years ago. </sentence><sentence id="1324">And they were very receptive and very thankful to me to be one of their liberators, and in fact I have been the only liberator that they had ever met. </sentence><sentence id="1325">And it was a very emotional meeting to be with these people, to physically see some of those people, and the thing is the most of them had never met each other before because they came to Israel, staggered, at different times by different routes, and ended up in different places. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="1329">Some went to Jerusalem, some whet the Tel Aviv, and all the little kibbutz's all over Israel--Palestine at that time. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1331">Q: Sure. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1333">A: And so they were really never had any contact with each other, and this was the first time that they had contact with each other as well as me, as a liberator. </sentence><sentence id="1334">Now, the most of these survivors had never talked about the Holocaust to their families. </sentence><sentence id="1335">As they grew up, they just wanted to forget the bad memories there--that they just wanted to forget it. </sentence><sentence id="1336">The day of their liberation, that was the day of a new life for them. </sentence><sentence id="1337">Anything before that, they just wanted to forget about it and not talk about it. </sentence><sentence id="1338">The children would ask them, you know, what happened? </sentence><sentence id="1339">I don't want to talk about it. </sentence><sentence id="1340">Forget it. </sentence><sentence id="1341">And we'll talk about something else. </sentence><sentence id="1342">And this was going on for years until this reunion time--that I told the story--the one that I more or less had related to you now to these children, and they are learning for the first time what happened to their parents, a little bit about the BergenBelsen era, but mostly from the actual liberation period, which they knew nothing about. </sentence><sentence id="1343">All they knew was what their parents had told them from the time they grew up in Israel or wherever they were up until the present time. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1356">Q: Sure. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1358">A: So this was a whole new story for these children and grandchildren to learn about something about the liberation of their people. </sentence><sentence id="1359">Now, what one person in particular, girl named lily, she was from Warsaw, and she had lost both of her parents to Auschwitz, and as an orphan, she was being taken care of by various other women. </sentence><sentence id="1360">And she lived through BergenBelsen with them. </sentence><sentence id="1361">And on the day of their liberation, the 13th of April, she said, "That is my birthday." </sentence><sentence id="1362">She did not now exactly where she was born. </sentence><sentence id="1363">She did not know exactly when she was born, so she took that day of liberation, the 13th of April, 1945, as her birth date, and she has considered that her birth date ever since. </sentence><sentence id="1364">This is one example of their feeling toward their liberation--that they feel that day of liberation was a very prominent and famous day as far as they were concerned--the beginning of their life. </sentence><sentence id="1365">And so many of them have told me that their life began on the 13th of April, 1945. </sentence><sentence id="1366">Anything before that never happened. </sentence><sentence id="1367">They just wanted to forget it. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1378">Q: There are those who would say and those who do say that the Holocaust never happened. </sentence><sentence id="1379">What would you say to them? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1382">A: You should have been there. </sentence><sentence id="1383">If you'd have seen it and smelled it, you'd believe. </sentence><sentence id="1384">That's all I can tell them. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1388">Q: Well, sir, it was an outstanding interview. </sentence><sentence id="1389">Thank you for your time and for your story. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1392">A: Okay. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1394">Q: But most of all, I thank you for your service to our nation. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1396">A: Thank you very much. </sentence><sentence id="1397">It has been a pleasure for me to do this and to contact these people and get their information and be able to relate that with others. </sentence><sentence id="1398">Now, I must add on here that our 30th infantry division has annual reunions, and I think it was about five years ago we had a reunion at Fayetteville, and we invited as many as would come of these survivors, and we had I think it was eight came to our reunion in Fayetteville. </sentence><sentence id="1399">So we--we're working up a close relationship with these people. </sentence><sentence id="1400">In fact, we just had a reunion in Savannah two weeks ago, and we had four of them come. </sentence><sentence id="1401">Unfortunately, this was during the storm period up in the north, and several had planned to come were unable to join with us, but we did have one come from Jerusalem--him and his wife flew over, got here just before the storm hit, and was able to get into Savannah. </sentence><sentence id="1402">And I think it was last year or the year before, we had two people from Jerusalem come and join just for this purpose, to join with their liberators and some others of their surviving peers. </sentence><sentence id="1403">So we're working up a close relationship with these people today. </sentence><sentence id="1404">Yup. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1414">Q: Very good. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1416">A: Yeah. </sentence><sentence id="1417">So I'm working on this project now and trying to get in contact with the two new people down in Australia. </sentence></p></dialogue>
