<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3">A:My name is Emanuel Mandel. </sentence><sentence id="4">I was born in Riga in the country of Latvia in 1936. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="7">Q:1936. </sentence><sentence id="8">And you've said that where you were born is not really important to the story, so would you describe your family and perhaps your earliest memories. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="11">A:I said that it is not important to my story because uh there was an old adage that said you must be born where your mother is, and she was in Riga at the time because my father had a position in Latvia. </sentence><sentence id="12">As a matter of fact, he was about to leave Latvia to go to Hungary and they were just waiting for me to arrive, and when I was, I'm told, perhaps three months old or so, I left Riga and never to return. </sentence><sentence id="13">I've never been there since. </sentence><sentence id="14">I would say that my earliest recollections are probably three or four years later. </sentence><sentence id="15">Uh, and none of them are in Latvia. </sentence><sentence id="16">They are later on in Hungary and places further. </sentence><sentence id="17">As we moved, as the war came, other recollections come up in other countries. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="25">Q:Well, let's start at your earliest recollections, and describe your family. </sentence><sentence id="26">What, who, who made up your family and where did you live? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="29">A:My family consisted at the time of, a small family, I'm an only child. </sentence><sentence id="30">Uh, my parents had a son before I was born, some three years before, who was born healthy according to the pediatrics of the time and at the age of ten weeks died, probably from some problem that in this day This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="31">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="32"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection and age could have been handled uh very simply in any hospital. </sentence><sentence id="33">But that was 1933 and even though they were in major cities with major medical knowledge available, it could not save the child. </sentence><sentence id="34">I came in 1936 and I was the only child to my mother and father. </sentence><sentence id="35">Uh, to, to flesh out in a sense the information about them, my father is alive and well, lives in the city of Philadelphia. </sentence><sentence id="36">He is 85, just turned 85 this year. </sentence><sentence id="37">My mother died uh in 1967 in Philadelphia of causes unrelated to anything else. </sentence><sentence id="38">It was a disease and uh, she died quickly, at a rather young age, just under 60. </sentence><sentence id="39">I, uh, as I say, since I have no siblings, the family is kind of limited. </sentence><sentence id="40">If I were to give you background about the family itself, uh my father comes from a city, not a city, a village, a small village, which was, at the time that he was born in 1904, in Czechoslovakia, maybe Rumania, or maybe even Hungary, because the way the borders were moved at the time nobody really knew. </sentence><sentence id="41">His passport was Czech. </sentence><sentence id="42">His citizenship was Czech. </sentence><sentence id="43">The part of the land was part of Austro-Hungary, and his language is Hungarian, so it is difficult to determine. </sentence><sentence id="44">Legally, he was Czech. </sentence><sentence id="45">He served in the Czech Army and when he was 19 or 20 years old. </sentence><sentence id="46">But he never identified as a Czech. </sentence><sentence id="47">There's a document that I gave a copy of a little while ago, which is a Czech passport, which was, uh the pictures in the document are probably from 1939, 1940. </sentence><sentence id="48">I'm a young child but I'm still a Czech citizen on my father's papers. </sentence><sentence id="49">My father was raised in that general neighborhood which is in...east of Hungary--in Ruthenia today. </sentence><sentence id="50">Today it's in Rumania, as a matter of fact; so it's moved again. </sentence><sentence id="51">But he was raised there; and his travels took him to many places, but maybe you'll want to come back to that. </sentence><sentence id="52">My mother is from another part of the Austro-Hungary empire, that part of Hungary which was really Yugoslav. </sentence><sentence id="53">She's from a city in southern Hungary which today is Yugoslavia. </sentence><sentence id="54">And just to indicate the confusion, it had three names - one in Serb, one in Hungarian, and one in German. </sentence><sentence id="55">And people wouldn't know how to refer to these communities--whether you called them Ujvidek in Hungarian, or Neusatz in German, or Novi Sad in Serb. </sentence><sentence id="56">She was raised there, in a family of uh six children, three boys and three This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="57">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="58"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection girls, and my father met her in that city and again we may want to come to his story, at least parts of it, as you want to pursue that. </sentence><sentence id="59">But . . </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="94">Q:Why don't you tell it to us? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="96"> Azl'd be glad to. </sentence><sentence id="97">Well, uh, my father was educated in Vienna and other places and eventually took a position in the city of Novi Sad where my mother lived, met her and they married and from there they moved to Riga to another position my father had, and that's why I was born in Riga. </sentence><sentence id="98">From there he went to Hungary which was something he wanted to do all his life, but the pattern of migration at that time was by choice, well, semi-choice. </sentence><sentence id="99">He wanted to do this because he was trying to get to a certain particular position in his life, but he also was constrained from getting to Hungary until 1940, uh, 1936, because as a Czech citizen, we go back to the old Czech citizenship, he could get no, he could not receive working papers or whatever permission to work in Hungary, as a Czech citizen. </sentence><sentence id="100">In "36 he received it, so he went from part of Hungary, back to Hungary, after all these various detours, in Yugoslavia, in Latvia. </sentence><sentence id="101">If that's confusing, I can understand. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="108">Q: What was his position? </sentence><sentence id="109">What was his work? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="112">A:My father was a cantor. </sentence><sentence id="113">My father was a cantor in a synagogue and has been that all his life. </sentence><sentence id="114">And he had positions in major congregations in Riga and in Budapest and in Novi Sad and in Vienna. </sentence><sentence id="115">And later on in Israel and in New York and in Philadelphia. </sentence><sentence id="116">And in order to be able to move in his own field, he had certain positions that he wanted to reach. </sentence><sentence id="117">And a cantor in the city of Budapest, in the synagogue that held 3500 seats with a choir of 40 people, was a major position, and he wanted that position. </sentence><sentence id="118">But he didn't have permission to go there until This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="119">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="120"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection "36. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="132">Q:Why not? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="134">A:He was a Czech citizen. </sentence><sentence id="135">And the Czech citizens were not given Hungarian working papers. </sentence><sentence id="136">So the pattern of migration was not because he was either a Jew or because he, the war came. </sentence><sentence id="137">This was before that. </sentence><sentence id="138">There may have been some overtones of that, I don't know. </sentence><sentence id="139">But very legally he was not permitted to get papers until "36 at which point he did assume the position of being one of the chief cantors of the city of Budapest, which was a major Jewish community center in central Europe at that time. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="146">Q:Are you aware of any changes in your family's life when Hitler came to power? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="148">A: Well, "Hitler came to power" needs to be addressed in terms of when - whether when he came to power in Germany, or as his power began to reach out throughout Europe. </sentence><sentence id="149">And what time are you talking about? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="152">Q:Whenever it affected you? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="154">A:Sure. </sentence><sentence id="155">Hitler comes to power in Germany and the laws, the various laws that are passed, the uh... I think there's a term called "Numerus Clausus." </sentence><sentence id="156">These various enumerated clauses that were passed to restrict certain life began way back probably in 1933. </sentence><sentence id="157">And they came, as history indicates, it's not germane to my particular story - it's available in lots of papers - that most of what happened was very legal, very correct, and did everything according to the rules. </sentence><sentence id="158">Now, if you want recollections from me for example, I know that uh one day, this was in Hungary, This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="159">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="160"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection in Budapest, the capital of the country, in a very lovely apartment, a large apartment, on the fifth floor of the building where I had lived which I recall quite clearly. </sentence><sentence id="161">As a matter of fact, for the first time in forty some years I visited it last year. </sentence><sentence id="162">My wife and I went to Hungary and we went to the apartment. </sentence><sentence id="163">Didn't go in because I didn't want to bother the people and there was nobody home. </sentence><sentence id="164">So the building is now probably 80 or 90 years old - it's in reasonable shape. </sentence><sentence id="165">But in 1940 or so, 1938, it was a very lovely apartment. </sentence><sentence id="166">And I remember that one day, I can't tell you which year, but some place in that general period, in "39, "40, "41, a telephone installer came in and said that he must take the telephone away. </sentence><sentence id="167">And I remember asking why, whether I asked him or my parents I don't recall. </sentence><sentence id="168">He said Jews may not have telephones. </sentence><sentence id="169">Period. </sentence><sentence id="170">Another incident. </sentence><sentence id="171">Uh, we had a maid, a live-in-maid - there was a maid's quarters in the apartment, that was very usual in those days, in those circumstances, and uh, she was told she could no longer be with us. </sentence><sentence id="172">She wanted to take me with her to her village. </sentence><sentence id="173">My parents thought about it, chose not to do that. </sentence><sentence id="174">But maids could not be employed by Jews. </sentence><sentence id="175">So the maid left. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="200">Q:Why would she have taken you to her village? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="202">A:Well, she thought she would in some way help me. </sentence><sentence id="203">Or maybe save me, or maybe protect me, or maybe help me, or raise me in a sense, because there were overtones of problems. </sentence><sentence id="204">Uh, I recall rather clearly that as a child of 5 or 6 or so I wanted a bicycle. </sentence><sentence id="205">Not an unusual request, a bicycle for a child of 5 or 6. </sentence><sentence id="206">My parents were certainly in a position to afford a bicycle or five. </sentence><sentence id="207">But there was major concern. </sentence><sentence id="208">I didn't understand the concern at the time. </sentence><sentence id="209">I just understood I didn't have a bike. </sentence><sentence id="210">And I probably threw the normal 5-year-old-tantrums about it. </sentence><sentence id="211">Later on I kind of understood that one of the reasons was that in a city, you ride bicycles in a park, and in the city of Budapest, large, urbane, sophisticated as it was, if a child with a This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="212">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="213"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection yellow star on his chest rode a bike, somebody might have knocked him off the bike, taken the bike and left him on the curb, and nobody really would have said too much. </sentence><sentence id="214">And my parents thought it was just unsafe. </sentence><sentence id="215">Not unsafe in terms of the kinds of problems you might have because of traffic, but just unsafe. </sentence><sentence id="216">I know that when I went to school, the apartment we had was on a corer of a building - you could see down the street if you stood in the bedroom, there was a circular kind of a set of windows - and the street I lived on, my house was number at 13, my school was at number 44. </sentence><sentence id="217">You could see from the fifth floor apartment window at number 13 to number 44. </sentence><sentence id="218">You could almost see the school, which was down the street several blocks. </sentence><sentence id="219">And I didn't know this but I was told that my father, for example, often would both watch me walk to school and sometimes follow me walking to school because of some safety concerns that the kid might be knocked into traffic. </sentence><sentence id="220">Nobody would have necessarily said too much if a child age six or seven with a yellow star would be pushed into traffic. </sentence><sentence id="221">Accidentally or deliberately by somebody who was trying to make an incident. </sentence><sentence id="222">These are certainly things that in some way affected my life as a child, and uh, hindsight is always perfect. </sentence><sentence id="223">Part of what I find fascinating in my own case is that I have very good recollections. </sentence><sentence id="224">But the time that this took place I didn't have the emotional impact of what this meant. </sentence><sentence id="225">I learned that later. </sentence><sentence id="226">A six year old doesn't understand political realities, doesn't understand various kinds of anti- this or anti- that. </sentence><sentence id="227">Uh, to a 6 year old, in a rather peculiar way, wearing a yellow star makes him an adult." </sentence><sentence id="228">All the adults do.

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="278">A:The specific day, no. </sentence><sentence id="279">But it must have been some time in uh ... Well, Hungary was in a peculiar position. </sentence><sentence id="280">Hungary, being an ally of Germany, was not overrun. </sentence><sentence id="281">I am reasonably certain that the reason I'm alive today is because I was not under German rule in 1939. </sentence><sentence id="282">Now, the Hungarian Nazi Party, known as the Arrow Cross, was not what I would call benevolent. </sentence><sentence id="283">On the other hand...

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="294">A:I didn't want to pay attention to the flicker; but I figured when it went out, might as well stop. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="320">Q:Go. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="322">A:I was commenting on the fact that one of the--if you want to call it an advantage, or one of the blessings in disguise--was that Hungary was not occupied by the Germans until fairly late in the war. </sentence><sentence id="323">Hungary was an ally. </sentence><sentence id="324">Again, historians know that the region of Hungary was uh, struck some kind of ally pact with Hitler and they were allies, so Hungarian troops on the Russian front and so forth. </sentence><sentence id="325">As a consequence, the German presence, the physical presence of the Germans, specifically the SS and the Gestapo, did not enter Hungary until very late in the war. </sentence><sentence id="326">Literally until 1944. </sentence><sentence id="327">Earlier, the regime was run by the Hungarian Nazi Party--the so- called "Arrow Cross," the Nylas. </sentence><sentence id="328">And their symbol was crossed arrows, as opposed to the swastika that the Germans had. </sentence><sentence id="329">And as a consequence, the kind of life that one had was probably different. </sentence><sentence id="330">I'm not sure it was any better; but life was certainly different than it would have been under German occupation. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="340">Q:When you were six, you said that you weren't aware. </sentence><sentence id="341">Clearly, you weren't aware of these historical, political activities; but what about your friends, what about other six year-olds? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="344">Were you aware of danger to yourself from other kids? </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="345">A: Well, I have the recollection of recalling at the age of six that I was scared. </sentence><sentence id="346">Of kids. </sentence><sentence id="347">I lived in a fairly closed society, by choice. </sentence><sentence id="348">I mean, we lived in a certain neighborhood. </sentence><sentence id="349">You remember, you realize that the kind of transport that's available today, the kind of mobility that we have today--not because of any sense of available conveyances... I mean, again, Budapest is a major city with a subway, with trolley cars, with buses, with cars, with taxis. </sentence><sentence id="350">You could go anywhere anytime. </sentence><sentence id="351">But if you went anywhere that was more than an hour away, it was a trip. </sentence><sentence id="352">This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="353">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="354"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection Emotionally, it was not the kind of thing people did. </sentence><sentence id="355">People did not go to visit their friends. </sentence><sentence id="356">Certainly, children did not go to visit their friends. </sentence><sentence id="357">And Mom didn't drive you over for the afternoon and pick you up three hours later while she went shopping. </sentence><sentence id="358">It was not the norm. </sentence><sentence id="359">We owned no car. </sentence><sentence id="360">Few people did. </sentence><sentence id="361">It's not a question of where you were in the status of the community, but it was not the thing that people did. </sentence><sentence id="362">We used taxis, buses, trolley cars, subways--as everybody else did. </sentence><sentence id="363">As a consequence, the universe that one lives in is fairly limited. </sentence><sentence id="364">Interestingly, I mentioned earlier that I was back in Budapest last summer. </sentence><sentence id="365">And I kind of walked my neighborhood, all eight or nine blocks of it. </sentence><sentence id="366">It was that limited. </sentence><sentence id="367">It was my school, it was the park, it was the ice skating rink, it was the Danube banks where we used to take walks--which happened to be close to where I lived. </sentence><sentence id="368">It was the area of the synagogue, the area of the school. </sentence><sentence id="369">When we went to the zoo, or the circus, or to the amusement park, or to the other side of the Danube, those were excursions. </sentence><sentence id="370">Children did not do that by themselves. </sentence><sentence id="371">And in a sense, six or seven year-olds don't do it by themselves today, either. </sentence><sentence id="372">So the nature of life was that it was a fairly closed, kind of fairly limited society, for everybody. </sentence><sentence id="373">I was limited in my area. </sentence><sentence id="374">No ghetto. </sentence><sentence id="375">This is not a ghetto limitation, a legal limitation. </sentence><sentence id="376">I was limited in my area. </sentence><sentence id="377">| lived in the 7th District of Budapest, and I probably knew one quarter of the 7th District. </sentence><sentence id="378">And kids like I--Jews and non-Jews--probably living in the 3rd District, knew a quarter of their district. </sentence><sentence id="379">It was the nature of the world. </sentence><sentence id="380">I went to a parochial school, as everybody did. </sentence><sentence id="381">I mean, if you were Catholic, you went to a Catholic school. </sentence><sentence id="382">If you were Jewish, you went to a Jewish school. </sentence><sentence id="383">If you were something else--the term is "Reformed," meaning all Protestants--went to some Protestant schools. </sentence><sentence id="384">So I was with those children; and I recall having children in the building where I lived, around the corner from where I lived, who were my friends. </sentence><sentence id="385">I have no sense, Jews or non-Jews, and I have no sense of their being afraid, scared, or that they were impacted by the war anymore than I was. </sentence><sentence id="386">At least, that's not my recollection. </sentence><sentence id="387">This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="388">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="389"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection 0 </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="445">A:From Riga, if we back up, we moved to Budapest. </sentence><sentence id="446">I spent the summer, or a kind of a long summer, with my grandparents. </sentence><sentence id="447">I'm told that I had some kind of a reaction to...some allergic reaction. </sentence><sentence id="448">I developed some kind of hives at the age of one, and I was not inside Budapest. </sentence><sentence id="449">I was out in the fresh air of the suburbs for about six or eight months. </sentence><sentence id="450">But from that time until we actually were deported and left in 1945, I in fact lived in Budapest. </sentence><sentence id="451">The bulk of my life--I was eight when we left, so seven and a half years I spent in Budapest. </sentence><sentence id="452">From 1936, in the early...late summer, until the summer of 1944. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="465">A: Well, history tells it that at one time the Germans came into Hungary in early 1944. </sentence><sentence id="466">Eichmann, as the man in charge of the solution to the Jewish problem, was attempting to solve the problem. </sentence><sentence id="467">He was approached--and the story is very complex. </sentence><sentence id="468">But it's not my personal story. </sentence><sentence id="469">So I'm not going to detail all the issues about Eichmann and his negotiations with a man by the name of Joel Brand, who was sent to negotiate with the Allies, was arrested in Syria, was in jail in Egypt, and survived the war and died fairly recently. </sentence><sentence id="470">Or a man by the name of Kasztner--a lawyer, a Hungarian lawyer, who negotiated with uh Eichmann--who then immigrated to Israel after the war and was assassinated there by some people who thought...by a person who thought that he had done something that was inappropriate, or there was a collaborator." </sentence><sentence id="471">Those particular stories are well documented elsewhere. </sentence><sentence id="472"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection 1 Specifically, there was an arrangement made based on the concept that Eichmann enunciated as a blood for merchandise, or blood for material, or blood for an exchange. </sentence><sentence id="473">The exchange proposal was that Eichmann wanted 10,000 trucks, western trucks, to be used against the eastern front, and for that he would release one million people and stop the extermination in the gas chambers. </sentence><sentence id="474">That didn't happen for many reasons, not the least of them being that the Allies would not give them the trucks and that they were not available, and the emissary was jailed in Syria [NB: Egypt], as I said. </sentence><sentence id="475">But there was a test group, essentially a group that was bartered, for serious money. </sentence><sentence id="476">The European Jewish community, the Hungarian Jewish community, and the rich Jewish community, they had money. </sentence><sentence id="477">And at that point, this is, we are talking about April/May of "44. </sentence><sentence id="478">Now, remember that the war ended in "45. </sentence><sentence id="479">The war was not going well for the Germans in "44. </sentence><sentence id="480">And I would not be surprised if they had made some decisions that said that whatever they do they will do to in someway improve their positions, whether it was personal or national I don't know. </sentence><sentence id="481">And an arrangement was made that some 1600 people would be assembled, would be placed on trains, and would be taken, I think...There were three choices that I recall--through Turkey, or through the Baltics, or through Spain--to Palestine. </sentence><sentence id="482">I think the final decision was to go through Spain. </sentence><sentence id="483">And the ruse was--and the Germans, you see, would do anything as long as it was legal and properly stamped, documented, indexed, filed and in a good chronology. </sentence><sentence id="484">It's amazing what kind of regimentation we were able to deal with. </sentence><sentence id="485">The 1600 plus people primarily professed to claim to be displaced persons captured in Central Europe, because of the war; but they really had Palestinian papers. </sentence><sentence id="486">Now, if you want to figure that one out, I mean, that's interesting. </sentence><sentence id="487">But the point remains, as long as you could provide Palestinian papers as citizens of Palestine under  http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection 2 British mandate, no matter where they had been born they were Palestinians. </sentence><sentence id="488">If you could provide those papers, the Germans would accept; because it is part of understanding that you don't challenge the documentation.
