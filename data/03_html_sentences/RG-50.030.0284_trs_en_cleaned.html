<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="36">Q: What did you study? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="38">A: Anything which did not equip me to make a living. </sentence><sentence id="39">And then toward the end of the depression, I got out of school and I had to get a job. </sentence><sentence id="40">And the federal government was then in the process of expanding its operations that were -- Roosevelt was seeing, you know, trouble in Europe. </sentence><sentence id="41">And I got a job in the Treasury Department. </sentence><sentence id="42">This is a long time ago. </sentence><sentence id="43">I recall that I was in the Procurement Division, that is, they were buying paper and supplies and other materials to be used by the federal government and by the military. </sentence><sentence id="44">And it was an important job. </sentence><sentence id="45">I mean, we kept -- I remember going to the White House even, in about 1942 or something to talk to them about some paper they had ordered, etc. </sentence><sentence id="46">I did have a sense that I was doing something important, you know. </sentence><sentence id="47">But I was exempted from the military because I had some physical problem which I've never really gotten through. </sentence><sentence id="48">It's not life threatening, but it was enough to get me exempted. </sentence><sentence id="49">And then, you know, when the war was over </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="62">Q: Let me interrupt for a moment. </sentence><sentence id="63">What did you know about what was going on in Europe in terms of national security? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="66">A: Not very much, really. </sentence><sentence id="67">We knew that the Jews were being mistreated and there were massacres. </sentence><sentence id="68">That information reached us through the mass media. </sentence><sentence id="69">And we knew it was a war for democracy to survive. </sentence><sentence id="70">And it had this Jewish component, which I felt very strongly about. </sentence><sentence id="71">And so at the end of the war -- and I don't remember the name of the people -- it was somebody who worked for a congressman in Washington who approached me and said, you know, UNRRA is looking for people to work in their program. </sentence><sentence id="72">UNRRA had two programs after the war. </sentence><sentence id="73">They had a program for refugees, and they had a program for countries which had suffered at the hands of the Axis. </sentence><sentence id="74"> There the country programs were designed to ship goods, needed goods, to strengthen -- to begin the pouring of life blood into the economy. </sentence><sentence id="75">There was a big program in Poland. </sentence><sentence id="76">Some in Italy. </sentence><sentence id="77">None in Germany, and, of course, the very big one in the Far East, China. </sentence><sentence id="78">Which really attracted me, you know. </sentence><sentence id="79">I wanted to go someplace, and I asked for China. </sentence><sentence id="80">And then, one day, I was at the University of Maryland after I had been accepted -- and it was sort of touch and go, because of my health problems with the military, but I made it. </sentence><sentence id="81">And I was now at the University of Maryland getting briefed, educated on the whole program. </sentence><sentence id="82">And somebody from UNRRA headquarters came over to speak to us. </sentence><sentence id="83">And he said to me, "Why are you going to China?" </sentence><sentence id="84">I really didn't have a good reason, you know, except I wanted to see that part of the world. </sentence><sentence id="85">And he said, "You come from New York. </sentence><sentence id="86">Do you speak Yiddish?" </sentence><sentence id="87">and I said, "Yes, I do speak Yiddish." </sentence><sentence id="88">And he said, "You must go -- our people -- he was Jewish, too -- are in desperate trouble over there." </sentence><sentence id="89">And they were, you know, after the war. </sentence><sentence id="90">And we need Yiddish speaking staff. </sentence><sentence id="91">And I want you to go." </sentence><sentence id="92">And I went. </sentence><sentence id="93">And I was trained for just about a month. </sentence><sentence id="94">We had seminars and all the rest, and I took off. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="125">Q: What was the preparation like? </sentence><sentence id="126">What was the training like? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="129">A: Well, first of all, they told us structurally what the program was about, who supplied what, and what was the chain of responsibility. </sentence><sentence id="130">In Germany, the principal responsibility for refugee programs lay with the military. </sentence><sentence id="131">And they were very unwilling participants in the program. </sentence><sentence id="132">They didn't want -- "We're not welfare workers. </sentence><sentence id="133">And we're not --" You know, some of the things which were being said. </sentence><sentence id="134">They had no taste for it. </sentence><sentence id="135">Refugees are a terrible pain in the behind in getting in the way of the movement of troops and materiel, and they just distract the military from its principal mission. </sentence><sentence id="136">And so now UNRRA was designated to work as the agency of the occupation forces in Germany, Italy, Austria, running these camps. </sentence><sentence id="137">Staffed UNRRA by international personnel, people -- United Nations agency, therefore, the people were drawn from Western powers, you know, France, the Benelux countries. </sentence><sentence id="138">We had a Swiss on my team, and Americans. </sentence><sentence id="139">And so we learned about that chain of command and some of the problems. </sentence><sentence id="140">By the way, they really didn't know too much about the problems. </sentence><sentence id="141">There was a great dissociation between what was happening in the field and what these people knew in the national headquarters. </sentence><sentence id="142">And that's a constant difficulty. </sentence><sentence id="143"> And then we took off. </sentence><sentence id="144">And we -- I remember I went on the Gripsholm. </sentence><sentence id="145">I was put aboard with a group of UNRRA people. </sentence><sentence id="146">Gripsholm, which had been during the war, an exchange ship for diplomats. </sentence><sentence id="147">It is not the present-day Gripsholm. </sentence><sentence id="148">There are new Gripsholms. </sentence><sentence id="149">And this Gripsholm was a real rat trap. </sentence><sentence id="150">During the war, it had exchanged diplomatic people, Japanese from the United States to Japan, etc., </sentence><sentence id="151">and reverse. </sentence><sentence id="152">And I spent ten seasick days on the Gripsholm. </sentence><sentence id="153">And I think we came into Cherbourg, and from Cherbourg by train to Paris. </sentence><sentence id="154">And there we stayed in Paris for two or three weeks getting more briefings. </sentence><sentence id="155">And then came the day they say, "You are off." </sentence><sentence id="156">And I was sent by train to Munich on the Orient-Express, but it was not that fabulous Orient-Express. </sentence><sentence id="157">And in Munich, I was immediately whisked as the supply officer for UNRRA team, I think it was 560 if I am not mistaken, outside of Munich. </sentence><sentence id="158">Shall I go on? </sentence><sentence id="159">There was a camp there which had just been established, I think in December of "45. </sentence><sentence id="160">I arrived about February, something like that. </sentence><sentence id="161">I don't remember. </sentence><sentence id="162">In the early part of the year. </sentence><sentence id="163">It was the winter. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="200">Q: 1946? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="202">A: "46. </sentence><sentence id="203">And a camp had been established by General McNarmey, who was Eisenhower's successor as the SHAEF (Supreme Headquarters Allies Expeditionary Force) commander or something. </sentence><sentence id="204"> And they had evacuated a whole zedlum (ph) silek? </sentence><sentence id="205">of settlements of small bungalows, I think about 250 such houses, which had been sold by the Nazis, built by the Nazis, for German workers, defense industry workers and their families. </sentence><sentence id="206">Two or three, bed -- two bedrooms apiece, and downstairs was a kitchen. </sentence><sentence id="207">It was in the 1930s style. </sentence><sentence id="208">There was no gas in these stoves. </sentence><sentence id="209">For example, the stoves were fed with, and the heat was created by, use of firewood. </sentence><sentence id="210">But it was nice. </sentence><sentence id="211">I mean, until we began to stuff the people who were coming in, into these places. </sentence><sentence id="212">More than -- you would say in each house, if you had 250 houses, you had four or five people. </sentence><sentence id="213">That would have been maybe 1200 people, but we had as much as 3,000 at one time. </sentence><sentence id="214"> And it was beyond its capacity. </sentence><sentence id="215">When I arrived, and the Jews who came into that camp were infiltrees (infiltrators?). </sentence><sentence id="216">They were not, by and large, survivors of concentration camps. </sentence><sentence id="217">It is estimated, I have read estimates, figures -- accurate figures are very, very difficult to come by. </sentence><sentence id="218">There was so much disorganization. -- </sentence><sentence id="219">that there were no more than 35,000 Jewish concentration camp survivors in Germany and Austria. </sentence><sentence id="220">And this camp in Munich was very close to Dachau. </sentence><sentence id="221">And most, many of the survivors that we got were Dachau survivors. </sentence><sentence id="222">The Germans had tried to destroy -- there was a plan to march all of the haftling, the concentration camp people from Dachau to a quarry, a big quarry, down south near the Austrian border, which, I understand, had been prepared with explosives. </sentence><sentence id="223">And to march them into this quarry and then blow the whole thing up. </sentence><sentence id="224">But the 3rd Army was approaching and at a certain critical moment, the Germans decided they weren't going to risk the arrival of the Americans, and they simply dropped the whole project. </sentence><sentence id="225">Left the Jews where they were standing and took off. </sentence><sentence id="226">And, Dachau had also what is described as ""aussencommandos" that is, branches of Dachau where Jews were sent in various villages and towns in what's called Oberbayern, that is Southern Bavaria, to work as farmers on farmland under the supervision of the owners. </sentence><sentence id="227">Or in some cases, in factories, or some cases, directly in Dachau. </sentence><sentence id="228">But, so we had a lot of Jews scattered over the landscape between Munich and the Austrian border. </sentence><sentence id="229">Little towns like Mittenwalde, which is a famous violin town, had Jews working there in various jobs. </sentence><sentence id="230">And they suffered, you know, they were not fed well. </sentence><sentence id="231">They were beaten, whatever. </sentence><sentence id="232">But it was not an extermination center. </sentence><sentence id="233">So, those people came into Munich, a lot of them, and many of them, stayed in those towns. </sentence><sentence id="234">And we would reach out to them from our headquarters in Munich. </sentence><sentence id="235">Anyway, this camp was just recently set up, and most of the people who were infiltrees who came in from Poland, from eastern Europe. </sentence><sentence id="236">Jews who may have, who were mostly in the Soviet Union during the war. </sentence><sentence id="237"> And I think Jewish agencies, important Jewish agencies, like the JDC (Joint Distribution Committee) and HIAS (Hebrew Immigrant Aid Society), and the Jewish Agency for Palestine became voluntary agencies under the supervision of UNRRA, who were to assign some of their people, welfare workers and others to our teams, to help the international personnel administer the camp and to provide services. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="274">Q: Were there non-Jews when you arrived in these areas? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="276">A: Oh, yes. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="278">Q: In your camps? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="280">A: Not in our camps. </sentence><sentence id="281">There were a tremendous number of Polish nationals, Ukrainian nationals, Balts, and other, Yugoslavs. </sentence><sentence id="282">And their place, origins in Germany are in a shadow. </sentence><sentence id="283">Nobody is quite sure what they came from, but we suspect that many of them came voluntarily. </sentence><sentence id="284">Many of the Ukrainians, for example, had fought in Vlasov's army, that is a Ukrainian army which had deserted Angren and totally deserted. </sentence><sentence id="285">The Russians threw off the uniforms and fought in SS uniforms against the Soviet Union, against Soviet military. </sentence><sentence id="286">But a lot of war criminals, we suspect, people who had some culpability, who were involved in concentration camps and extermination camps, who came, and many who were not. </sentence><sentence id="287">Many who were simple farm workers or whatever. </sentence><sentence id="288">There were many Russian -- former Russian POWs in there. </sentence><sentence id="289">And they had suffered, also, very badly at the hands of the Nazis. </sentence><sentence id="290">I attended a Dachau trial of SS who were accused of exterminating literally thousands of Russian prisoners of war in Dachau, and in other places. </sentence><sentence id="291">Well, anyway, they all came. </sentence><sentence id="292">We're faced with the problem of integrating these people into a camp, setting up a camp. </sentence><sentence id="293">That was a big problem. </sentence><sentence id="294">We had emptied all these houses. </sentence><sentence id="295">The Germans had taken everything they could carry, I think, in the line of bedding and other personal supplies, but they had to leave their furniture. </sentence><sentence id="296">They were taken out, I think, in 24 hours in the winter. </sentence><sentence id="297">So it was a tough time for them. </sentence><sentence id="298">And we had a staff, we had to find people among the Jews to staff the camp. </sentence><sentence id="299">There were some school-age children brought in. </sentence><sentence id="300">We had to find doctors, nurses, cooks, stores, office people, who would distribute food and clothing, blankets. </sentence><sentence id="301">And we had to assign, we had to create a system of assigning a lot of people to rooms. </sentence><sentence id="302"> And nobody was satisfied because it was so packed and so jammed. </sentence><sentence id="303">We had really violated health standards and all of the rest to get them in, but the situation was desperate. </sentence><sentence id="304">Snow on the ground, and people starving, very hungry, but we got them all in. </sentence><sentence id="305">We staffed the camp. </sentence><sentence id="306">We had very devoted international personnel. </sentence><sentence id="307">We had a number of women who worked as welfare workers, Jewish women. </sentence><sentence id="308">We had a big problem with Jewish women because they became so emotional - - so emotionally involved with the problems in their interviews with Jews, what had happened to them, and where had they been, and what had happened, what they had seen -- that we were rotating people. </sentence><sentence id="309">Sometimes people couldn't stay more than a couple of months. </sentence><sentence id="310">It was a very, very difficult time emotionally for them. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="343">Q: Were there men who were coming in doing the same thing? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="345">A: Yeah, we had men, also, but I remember that the welfare workers were women. </sentence><sentence id="346">I told you, I recall one was Rose Wasserman, a wonderful lady who came from Cleveland. </sentence><sentence id="347">And she was with, I think, it's Cuyahoga County Courts. </sentence><sentence id="348">She was the chief welfare officer in Cleveland. </sentence><sentence id="349">And she did a wonderful job with UNRRA -- UNRRA , yeah. </sentence><sentence id="350">And then we had to provide food. </sentence><sentence id="351">Now food, under an agreement made with the military, was a responsibility of the Germans to provide food, and also to provide money, marks, to pay workers. </sentence><sentence id="352">We had salaried workers. </sentence><sentence id="353">The problem with the marks was that they were worthless. </sentence><sentence id="354">I think, from a nominal value, I think of four to the dollar before the war. </sentence><sentence id="355">A few years later, they were selling for 400 a dollar, and they went up to 4000 a dollar. </sentence><sentence id="356">They were really worthless. </sentence><sentence id="357">But it was important to get them on the worker's list because you did get better -- more calories. </sentence><sentence id="358">We had a specific, specified calorie count that we fed the families. </sentence><sentence id="359">And so you got more calories. </sentence><sentence id="360">And then there were some other privileges for people who were working. </sentence><sentence id="361">We had a limited number of jobs, you know, a place like Neu Freimann, with about 2,500 people. </sentence><sentence id="362">We maybe had 200 or 300, maybe 400 people. </sentence><sentence id="363">There were people who would load wood for firewood, cooks, stores of various sorts. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="384">Q: Who got most of the jobs? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="386">A: Jews in the camps. </sentence><sentence id="387">The people who applied for them. </sentence><sentence id="388">There were many Jews who didn't want to work. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="392">Q: Also, I'm talking about -- were men primarily given the jobs? </sentence><sentence id="393">Older men, younger men -- </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="396">A: Yeah no, yeah, well, the jobs went based on the gender attached to the job. </sentence><sentence id="397">That is, a Arankenschwester was a kranken nurse, you know, was a woman. </sentence><sentence id="398">We had some nurses. </sentence><sentence id="399">You know, you'd never see a man who was a nurse. </sentence><sentence id="400"> All of the doctors were men, the dentists were men, one or two exceptions. </sentence><sentence id="401">And the women were clerks. </sentence><sentence id="402">They helped people fill out their DP documents. </sentence><sentence id="403">I will talk about those in a moment. </sentence><sentence id="404">And there were people who did various clerical tasks, and that was where women could produce, could contribute. </sentence><sentence id="405">We also had a relegazerampt we called it, a religious office, and some of these houses were reserved for synagogues in the camp. </sentence><sentence id="406">They're small houses, and so we had Rusisha shul, Russian shul, and a Poylissha shul, a Polish synagogue. </sentence><sentence id="407">There were two or three, four maybe different branches, and they were separate. </sentence><sentence id="408">And people knew where they wanted to go. </sentence><sentence id="409">We had to find rabbis, by the way. </sentence><sentence id="410">I had an American assistant who went around looking for people with beards, and they were designated rabbis. </sentence><sentence id="411">These Jews, by the way, the Hasidic Jewish community, and we had some that came, were clearly identifiable. </sentence><sentence id="412">We wondered, you know, how they'd made it through the war, but they were in the Soviet Union during the war. </sentence><sentence id="413">And then we began the distribution of food. </sentence><sentence id="414">We set up community kitchens. </sentence><sentence id="415">Now, these houses had stoves so that people could cook, take their food and cook as they pleased. </sentence><sentence id="416">And then we had a community kitchen where we had people come who were single, who had no family, to eat their three meals a day. </sentence><sentence id="417">We had to supply the military with a Table of Organization for the camp for the purpose of salaries. </sentence><sentence id="418">We had to justify all the salaries. </sentence><sentence id="419">And the religious ampt I remember, gave us a problem because they needed people to erect an eruwv -- this wire around, you know about it, around the town during the Sabbath. </sentence><sentence id="420">I remember this colonel saying, "What is that? </sentence><sentence id="421">What kind of wire around the town? </sentence><sentence id="422">What are you talking about?" </sentence><sentence id="423">Ultimately, when we built a mikvah in that camp. </sentence><sentence id="424">I remember I had to explain the meaning of a mikvah and why they had people who did certain personal -- I am not sure what happens in a mikvah, but they rendered personal service, clipping toenails. </sentence><sentence id="425">Someone was kidding me, he said, takes lint out of the navels, whatever. </sentence><sentence id="426">They were all paid for. </sentence><sentence id="427">And, then, we had some special food habits, you know, for the Hassidim needed kosher food. </sentence><sentence id="428">And we had a real problem with that. </sentence><sentence id="429"> I don't remember how we solved it. </sentence><sentence id="430">I think we went to a butcher, a German place where meat was slaughtered, and we had a -- what do you call the guy who does the slaughtering? </sentence><sentence id="431">I am forgetting my Yiddish, you know -- who slaughters the animals. </sentence><sentence id="432">And he was a hasid. </sentence><sentence id="433">And the meat was taken, carefully handled. </sentence><sentence id="434">Milk for lactating mothers, those women who were pregnant, the cows had to be milked under supervision by a rabbi. </sentence><sentence id="435">They assigned somebody to go and sit in the barn with the -- we had to provide transportation. </sentence><sentence id="436">It was a very complex thing. </sentence><sentence id="437">We had a lot of illness. </sentence><sentence id="438">We had a lot of people with tuberculosis. </sentence><sentence id="439">They were taken out, weaned out, and we sent them to - - we had a tuberculosis center in Bad Reichenhall, nearby. </sentence><sentence id="440">We had medical examinations. </sentence><sentence id="441">There was a big problem with bad teeth. </sentence><sentence id="442">Now, we issued DP cards, identity cards. </sentence><sentence id="443">So they had an identity card from the United Nations with a thumb print, no pictures, a finger print. </sentence><sentence id="444">There was also a DP card kept in our files. </sentence><sentence id="445">Now these people arrived mostly after December and when they arrived, they were not aware that the Truman Directive, signed in early December, I think, which allocated a large number of visa numbers. </sentence><sentence id="446">The military was very wary about infiltrees, about the increasing number of people coming from eastern Europe. </sentence><sentence id="447">And the British also understood that the larger the number of Jewish displaced persons in the American zones, that the greater the pressure would be on them in the United Nations and in other forums to relinquish the mandate in Palestine or part of the mandate for the Jews, or to admit more Jews into Palestine. </sentence><sentence id="448">Something they did not wish to do. </sentence><sentence id="449">So the Americans, who didn't want DPs generally, General Patton was in command in that area, and he was not terribly sympathetic to the Jews, tried to shut them off from coming by, declaring that in order to emigrate from the American zones of Germany and Austria to the United States, you had to show that you had arrived in the zone prior to December 22, 1945. </sentence><sentence id="450">And so, these people who came in January, they were not aware of this, you know. </sentence><sentence id="451">And they gave accurately that they had arrived in January or early February and that their place of birth was in Poland, a place not favored by the realities of the quota system, the    national origins quota system. </sentence><sentence id="452">They would have to sit in Europe for years before they got out. </sentence><sentence id="453">But they were being truthful, and they said who they were and when they came and all of the rest. </sentence><sentence id="454">Later on, they found to their unhappiness, that disqualified them. </sentence><sentence id="455">They said, "Had I known, I would have told them I came here earlier." </sentence><sentence id="456">We thought about it, by the way I've used the metaphor, you know, it was December 22 which they made the cutoff date, that on the 25th where Christmas was celebrated, there was no room in the inn, our inn, for Jews. </sentence><sentence id="457">And anyway, we got them all into the camp and we created our own health programs, under the supervision of international medical people, and our own feeding programs, our own schools. </sentence><sentence id="458">Right away, the Jews were energetic. </sentence><sentence id="459">They set up everything they needed, cultural programs, newspapers began to sprout. </sentence><sentence id="460">Now, prior to that time, there was a question early on at the end of the war, how would these people be housed, the refugees. </sentence><sentence id="461">They were, after all, multi-national -- Poles and Ukrainians and Jews. </sentence><sentence id="462">And a Jew was nominally -- most of them were nominally Polish, Polish nationals. </sentence><sentence id="463">And so therefore, they would take a whole bunch of Poles, Polish speaking people, and put them, try to put them into one camp, into one area, under one administration. </sentence><sentence id="464">But, you know, the Jews did not consider themselves Polish anymore. </sentence><sentence id="465">They would not opt in a legal sense, for that identity. </sentence><sentence id="466">And so, they -- I am not quite sure how it happened -- but they all declared themselves, I think maybe for immigration purposes, as staatenlos that is, stateless, or as Jews. </sentence><sentence id="467">Now, there was a great deal of jockeying around over how the Jews would be housed, whether they would be housed among the people, as I say, of the countries in which they were born, which they didn't want. </sentence><sentence id="468">American-Jewish leaders were also, I think, playing a role in that thing. </sentence><sentence id="469">And they wanted all of the Jews together, which was a wise thing to happen. </sentence><sentence id="470">And ultimately, the military gave in. </sentence><sentence id="471">For them, you know, looking directly at it, or for the United Nations looking directly at it, these were Poles or Latvians or Lithuanians. </sentence><sentence id="472"> But, no, they did not consider themselves that. </sentence><sentence id="473">And so they all became of one national group. </sentence><sentence id="474">And in all of the DP camps in which Jews lived after the war, they lived together, surrounded by a fence, whose perimeter was often patrolled by Jewish police. </sentence><sentence id="475">We organized the police force. </sentence><sentence id="476">We had a police force in that camp alone of over 100 people. </sentence><sentence id="477">They were not armed police, but they were Jews who wore armbands declaring that they were policemen, and they patrolled the perimeters of the camp. </sentence><sentence id="478">Conditions were so bad in the camps. </sentence><sentence id="479">At this time, I was the supply officer for Neu Freimann camp and all of the small little camps I mentioned before, which had sprung loose from the Dachau concentration camp. </sentence><sentence id="480">And also for all "free living" Jews in the city of Munich. </sentence><sentence id="481">In effect, I became ultimately sort of the mayor of the Jewish community of Munich. </sentence><sentence id="482">And they would come to our camp. </sentence><sentence id="483">They were Polish Jews, mostly. </sentence><sentence id="484">There were very few German Jews remaining in -- just a very few that I ran across, who would come to us for food, identity papers certifying that they were stateless, or that they had been persecutees, and therefore, entitled to certain privileges as to immigration, food, medical care, clothing, whatever. </sentence><sentence id="485">And as I say, conditions were so bad that in the United States, the White House was hearing about it. </sentence><sentence id="486">There was a lot of anguish, a lot of anger, and so Eisenhower was sent by Truman to Europe to investigate. </sentence><sentence id="487">There had been a report by the Harrison Committee which had stressed some of these inadequacies, but Eisenhower went over to look, he said, for himself. </sentence><sentence id="488">And what happened was, a week before he arrived in Munich, the director of our camps quit. </sentence><sentence id="489">He wanted to go home. </sentence><sentence id="490">I don't know what happened. </sentence><sentence id="491">Anyway, and so I was called by UNRRA saying would I make myself ready to receive the General and to brief him on whatever questions he wanted to be raised. </sentence><sentence id="492">And sure enough, two or three days before the arrival of the General, all of the security people, military security people, came and checked the whole road running down to the city of Munich out to this camp. </sentence><sentence id="493">For security purposes, they emptied buildings with windows overlooking the road, the whole business. </sentence><sentence id="494"> I was very impressed, of course. </sentence><sentence id="495">And on that day, we were laid on and out came the General, riding in -- it had to be either Goering or Hitler's car -- a great big Mercedes. </sentence><sentence id="496">And he was accompanied, of course, by six or eight general officers. </sentence><sentence id="497">You were going to ask something? </sentence><sentence id="498">McNarney was among them, Huebner. </sentence><sentence id="499">I remember those names. </sentence><sentence id="500">And they came into the camp and they spent -- I greeted them as he stepped out of the car. </sentence><sentence id="501">He spent about three or four hours, I guess, in the camp. </sentence><sentence id="502">And we talked about supplies. </sentence><sentence id="503">He went and looked at it. </sentence><sentence id="504">We talked about housing; he went and looked at the housing. </sentence><sentence id="505">He talked to the people. </sentence><sentence id="506">A great big sign had been hung by the Jews over the entry to the camp, "Welcome General Eisenhower." </sentence><sentence id="507">And I was impressed. </sentence><sentence id="508">He's a very stern-looking guy, very impressive you know, with all of those stars. </sentence><sentence id="509">And some of his staff took notes on what I was saying. </sentence><sentence id="510">And I think it had an impact, my own contribution to that, because within a matter of maybe a month, things began to improve. </sentence><sentence id="511">We were getting things that we were not getting before. </sentence><sentence id="512">Of course, the White House had played its role, but Eisenhower coming over there was the basis for making whatever changes were necessary.

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="633">Q: How honestly could you talk to him? </sentence><sentence id="634">I mean, here you are, a 25-year-old young man? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="637">A: Well, I could talk pretty honestly. </sentence><sentence id="638">I just told him, "General, the situation's tragic. </sentence><sentence id="639">We have people, you know, stuffed into a room together in such numbers -- the people are sick, their ability to resist disease is down. </sentence><sentence id="640">And so, we are going to have typhus. </sentence><sentence id="641">We are going to have this, and we're going to have that. </sentence><sentence id="642">They are not getting adequate food." </sentence><sentence id="643">And he listened carefully. </sentence><sentence id="644">I remember, though, some funny scenes. </sentence><sentence id="645">We took him into a school, a Yiddish school. </sentence><sentence id="646">And the guy who was the director of that school was a fellow who then went to Baltimore. </sentence><sentence id="647">His name was Spector. </sentence><sentence id="648">Mr. Spector was a teacher, and both he and his wife were dedicated. </sentence><sentence id="649">He and his wife were wonderfully dedicated people. </sentence><sentence id="650">They set up the school with teachers, and the children, they got paper and they got pencils. </sentence><sentence id="651">It was very difficult. </sentence><sentence id="652">I told you "IMCA" YMCA supplied us with writing pads for the Jewish children. </sentence><sentence id="653">And he had coached the children to sing "The Star Spangled Banner", in just learning the lines. </sentence><sentence id="654">They didn't know what they were saying. </sentence><sentence id="655">And Eisenhower stood there, you know, his hat under his arm, and he listened as they sang. </sentence><sentence id="656">And when it was finished, I was stunned. </sentence><sentence id="657">I didn't tell Spector until much later. </sentence><sentence id="658">He said to me, "What are they singing?" </sentence><sentence id="659">He didn't recognize it at all. </sentence><sentence id="660">I wouldn't spoil what these children had done. </sentence><sentence id="661">There was also some confusion. </sentence><sentence id="662">He walked into a synagogue, I remember, and he took his hat off, you know. </sentence><sentence id="663">And McNarney leaned over him and says, "General, put your hat on. </sentence><sentence id="664">You're in a synagogue." </sentence><sentence id="665">It was a pleasant visit. </sentence><sentence id="666">The Jews were extremely welcoming to him, applauded. </sentence><sentence id="667">He was the great hero who had liberated them. </sentence><sentence id="668">And it was a wonderful day. </sentence><sentence id="669">He is a stern-looking guy, you know. </sentence><sentence id="670">He has his dignity, very little joking around with him, my impression. </sentence><sentence id="671">I wouldn't want to cross him, based on what I saw. </sentence><sentence id="672">Anyway, the visit went well. </sentence><sentence id="673">And as a result, as a matter of fact, in about a couple of weeks, I was notified that I had been appointed director to replace the departed director. </sentence><sentence id="674">And, that situation went on for, I think, until 1947 when we learned that UNRRA was going to be terminated, go out of business. </sentence><sentence id="675">And that it was to be replaced by an agency known as the PCIRO, Preparatory Committee or Commission for the International Refugee Organization. </sentence><sentence id="676">And that a new modus operandi was to take place. </sentence><sentence id="677">That is, many of the international personnel on our team were to be terminated. </sentence><sentence id="678">And their responsibilities were to be turned over to indigenous staff-people, essentially, the Jews themselves, in the camps. </sentence><sentence id="679">And there would be no camp director for a given camp; he would be replaced by a camp chairman. </sentence><sentence id="680">And he had a sort of a cabinet with him for food, and welfare and housing and security and whatever. </sentence><sentence id="681">And that the Jews were to pick their own people. </sentence><sentence id="682">And they did so with elections in the camps. </sentence><sentence id="683">And it was marvelously organized. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="732">Q: Can we not get to 1947 first, can we stay ... </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="734">A: Yeah. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="736">Q: What happened to you when you became director? </sentence><sentence id="737">You became director of this camp -- </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="740">A: Of this camp and -- </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="742">Q: -- and the subsidiaries? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="744">A: -- the subsidiaries and the Jews of Munich. </sentence><sentence id="745">That is, I was responsible for meeting their needs. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="748">Q: How many people, then, are you responsible for? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="750">A: I think at that point it got to be about 3,000, 3,500, something like that. </sentence><sentence id="751"> And what I would do is move around through the various installations under my supervision and meet with their chairman and find out what their problems were. </sentence><sentence id="752">Maybe once a week, I would be in this place, drive around. </sentence><sentence id="753">I would drive a car, go around and meet with them. </sentence><sentence id="754">But my office was in the Zedlum, (ph) in the Neu Freimann. </sentence><sentence id="755">I supervised all of the programs and saw how they went and people reported to me. </sentence><sentence id="756">And I reported to my superiors. </sentence><sentence id="757">Life was very, very difficult. </sentence><sentence id="758">People were trying to get out, and they soon found that the national origins quota defeated that. </sentence><sentence id="759">There was illegal immigration to Palestine. </sentence><sentence id="760">And by the way, I recall now that I had very good part of the people on the Exodus who came from the Neu Freimann camp and from nearby camps. </sentence><sentence id="761">You know, the Exodus was caught and returned to Ger -- Bremerhaven and the Jews were forced off, you know, by British, I think it was British soldiers, with the water hoses. </sentence><sentence id="762">I got, and I lost -- a lot of things happened to me -- a little book written by children who had been on the Exodus and describing their experiences. </sentence><sentence id="763">And they dedicated it to me, to undzer khaver director. </sentence><sentence id="764">I don't know what happened to it. </sentence><sentence id="765">There are things I have lost I regret so. </sentence><sentence id="766">I don't know what happened. </sentence><sentence id="767">And we had to receive other people all the time. </sentence><sentence id="768">There was constant tension. </sentence><sentence id="769">The camps had been closed to infiltrees, and we were taking them in. </sentence><sentence id="770">One of the ways we were able to take them in was when a group of people went illegally to Palestine, their DP cards were left behind. </sentence><sentence id="771">When you leave the camp, you are supposed to turn them in or to do something. </sentence><sentence id="772">They were turned over to the camp committee, who used them for the purpose of supplying other infiltrees coming to the camp. </sentence><sentence id="773">The UNRRA people told me that apparently we have a very low death rate in our camps because the population remained fairly static. </sentence><sentence id="774">Actually, they were leaving, but they were being exchanged with other people. </sentence><sentence id="775">And then other ways had to be found to avoid the restrictive immigration policies of the United States and also of the Canadians. </sentence><sentence id="776">And the documentation, which was on file in our offices, on each of the Jews, prevented them if they had to get their DP records to present to the consul generals. (?) </sentence><sentence id="777"> They would reveal that they had arrived in the zone after December "45, or that they were born in Poland or in Latvia or Lithuania, and therefore they had to wait for a long time for their quota numbers. </sentence><sentence id="778">Some people had a lot of scars on their lungs, lesions which were healed, but it was not known exactly when the tuberculosis had been active, and they were prevented. </sentence><sentence id="779">So, if you presented an accurate x-ray, you could be out of luck. </sentence><sentence id="780">It was a desperate struggle because everything militated against them -- people who had suffered so. </sentence><sentence id="781">I remember this was said to me, very often, I am going to say it in Yiddish, "Mir haben gemeynt az zey velen uns trogen oyf de pletzes." </sentence><sentence id="782">We thought that when we got out that we would be carried around on the shoulders of the Allies, of the United States, that we would be heroes for having made it through this terrible experience. </sentence><sentence id="783">Instead, they're finding all kinds of ways to keep us out. </sentence><sentence id="784">It was a terrible disillusion. </sentence><sentence id="785">And while there was a division in the Jewish community of survivors about where they would go, some said they would go nowhere but to Palestine. </sentence><sentence id="786">And of course, they knew what was in Palestine. </sentence><sentence id="787">It was illegal, first of all. </sentence><sentence id="788">If you managed to get in, you would be housed in a tent city on some mud flat someplace. </sentence><sentence id="789">No jobs. </sentence><sentence id="790">It was a terrible scene. </sentence><sentence id="791">Nevertheless, they wished to go there. </sentence><sentence id="792">But others wished to go to the United States. </sentence><sentence id="793">They had family in the United States. </sentence><sentence id="794">People who would make space for them and had jobs for them. </sentence><sentence id="795">And they saw their future there. </sentence><sentence id="796">So there was a constant tension within the DP, Jewish DP community on that score. </sentence><sentence id="797">They tried to invest the Jews with the kind of Zionist patriotism, but they were all patriotic about the establishment of the state. </sentence><sentence id="798">But many of them wished to go to the United States. </sentence><sentence id="799">A commission was sent over by the United Nations. </sentence><sentence id="800">And they came to our camp to talk to Jews about where they wished to go. </sentence><sentence id="801">The committee was made up of five diplomats, one of whom was from India before it was divided. </sentence><sentence id="802">I am trying to remember which country became a Muslim country, maybe Pakistan. </sentence><sentence id="803">And he was very hostile. </sentence><sentence id="804">And he tried to probe, you know, "Where do wish to go?" </sentence><sentence id="805">And they picked some people at random from in the camp to come before them. </sentence><sentence id="806">There was a big audience in the room listening to this procedure. </sentence><sentence id="807">And I was the interpreter. </sentence><sentence id="808">And the first guy they picked to be examined was the brother of a business associate of my own father, who asked me to get him out. </sentence><sentence id="809">He had arrived with his wife and two children. </sentence><sentence id="810">They had been in the Soviet Union, and he was desperate to get to the United States. </sentence><sentence id="811"> I didn't know what would happen, but they took care of it themselves. </sentence><sentence id="812">That is, the guy asked, after checking his personal history, said to him, "Now, where do you wish to go?" </sentence><sentence id="813">And he proudly spoke up, "Vu alle yiddin forn" he said "Where all Jews wish to go, to Eretz Yisrael." </sentence><sentence id="814">And a great cheer broke out. </sentence><sentence id="815">Now, he left a week later for the United States, so there was a solidarity in support of the claim of Jews for Palestine, for Eretz Yisrael, and for the right of Jews to be allowed to emigrate there. </sentence><sentence id="816">There was 100 percent solidarity, but a lot of people had made decisions about their lives, about where they wished to go. </sentence><sentence id="817">But -- </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="889">Q: Was there pressure on these people to not go to the United States, not only to not say it -- </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="891">A: Well, there was some pressure. </sentence><sentence id="892">Yeah, the Jewish Agency was working in the camps, and they did a valuable job. </sentence><sentence id="893">And the whole leadership of the Jewish community was Zionist in its orientation. </sentence><sentence id="894">So that when, for example, camp administrations were made up, as I've indicated, they were elected on Zionist lists. </sentence><sentence id="895">Liste eyns, or tsvey -- list one, two. </sentence><sentence id="896">And on that basis, these represented various Zionist political parties. </sentence><sentence id="897">There was a strong, and I think the Jewish Agency and the leaders, Ben Gurion and the rest understood, the value of the DP, Jewish DP community and the experience which the Jews had had -- if you want to call it a value. </sentence><sentence id="898">But they understood the meaning of it, for bringing pressure against the British and the United States to partition Palestine or to create a Jewish entity, and to allow the Jews to leave. </sentence><sentence id="899">And for the United Nations, by the way, ultimately when they did go legally, the UN paid all fares for transportation costs for Jewish refugees travelling to whatever destination they were going to. </sentence><sentence id="900">So there was a unity within the Jewish community. </sentence><sentence id="901">And they would never allow it to be understood outside of our community. </sentence><sentence id="902">There was a unity that Israel or the Jewish state would have to be created. </sentence><sentence id="903">It would have to be supported. </sentence><sentence id="904">And those Jews, and there were many who wished to go to Palestine, and no place else, would be permitted to go. </sentence><sentence id="905"> And there were efforts made. </sentence><sentence id="906">You know there was by the way, also a mobilization effort on the part of the Zionist community, that is, to mobilize Jews, young men and women to serve in the Haganah. </sentence><sentence id="907">They were trained in our camps. </sentence><sentence id="908">They would be marching around and training with broomsticks as bayonets, rifles. </sentence><sentence id="909">So they were preparing themselves. </sentence><sentence id="910">But as I say, you had this tension in the community which is, I think, something which happens today, again, you have in the Soviet Union some of the same things, that is, Israel accuses HIAS, Jewish agencies, of talking Jews into not going to Israel, which is absolutely untrue. </sentence><sentence id="911">Jews know where they wish to go. </sentence><sentence id="912">And my own feeling is they should go where they wish to go, where they will be happy. </sentence><sentence id="913">So we had that immigration. </sentence><sentence id="914">Then we had the illegal immigration. </sentence><sentence id="915">I was, I think, the only Jewish camp director I know of in Munich. </sentence><sentence id="916">There was one or two before me in these camps, but they had left. </sentence><sentence id="917">So a lot of efforts by the Jewish Agency or by the JDC centered on me. </sentence><sentence id="918">They knew they could come to me and they could speak frankly, and that I was part of the whole apparatus. </sentence><sentence id="919">So I remember supplying blankets and gasoline and other things, illegally -- to people on the move illegally, to France or to Italy. </sentence><sentence id="920">Mostly I knew about France, to go to Marseille for immigration. </sentence><sentence id="921">I think the Exodus people took that route, they went to Marseille. </sentence><sentence id="922">And I was asked by them, by the Sochnut or by the Brichah to accompany a transport of, I don't remember, maybe 500 Jews who had been gathered up to go to Marseille and to board boats there, and to go to Palestine. </sentence><sentence id="923">And so I sat there in the uniform in the lead car. </sentence><sentence id="924">And I had some phony document saying that these people are authorized to travel, in transit, through France, to Marseille on their way, I think, to Uruguay or Peru, one of those South American countries. </sentence><sentence id="925">And I carried a group visa with me. </sentence><sentence id="926">It was done also on onion skin paper, which had names listed and birth dates and they absolutely did not conform to the birth dates or to the people in this transport. </sentence><sentence id="927"> And we drove through the French zone, me in the front, and we got to Mulhouse -- Muehlhausen, that's in Alsace. </sentence><sentence id="928">And we presented this transit visa. </sentence><sentence id="929">Well, first of all, the visa from the Uruguayans or one of those Latin American -- they were all fraudulent, provided by some consul, vice consul in Paris, maybe. </sentence><sentence id="930">And he had been paid something to do that, I think. </sentence><sentence id="931">And we presented the visas and the transit letter to the French gendarmes at the border. </sentence><sentence id="932">In the meantime, two of these guys working from Palestine Brichah, I could see them going around the back of the booth, with two big cartons, and I knew there were cigarettes in those cartons. </sentence><sentence id="933">The French, also, were badly in need of cigarettes, and deposited it there. </sentence><sentence id="934">And then, we were saluted through, and we came into Mulhouse, and we went to the town square, and by God, I was stunned. </sentence><sentence id="935">There was the mayor of Mulhouse, all dressed up with his red sash across his chest, and women, volunteers, greeted us and provided hot coffee, cocoa or something, and some bread. </sentence><sentence id="936">Some other food for the people to eat. </sentence><sentence id="937">We were treated to a speech by the mayor. </sentence><sentence id="938">Wishing us, wishing our people, a good life in Uruguay or Paraguay or whatever. </sentence><sentence id="939">It was a very nice ceremony. </sentence><sentence id="940">And I got back in my car, drove back over the border to Munich. </sentence><sentence id="941">It's a very -- I did that twice, but only once did the Muehlhausen mayor come out for me. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="995">Q: Did you have any hesitancy doing this? </sentence><sentence id="996">You were after all..... </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="999">A: No. </sentence><sentence id="1000">I - I did have -- first of all, 1 am trying to remember whether there were some restrictions on my movement into the French zone. </sentence><sentence id="1001">I was crossing a zone line. </sentence><sentence id="1002">But I remember that if -- if -- somebody had picked this up, they would ask me where did they get the gasoline and the blankets which were military. </sentence><sentence id="1003">The trucks were military. </sentence><sentence id="1004">They were UNRRA trucks. </sentence><sentence id="1005">They had it on the front. </sentence><sentence id="1006">So there was a risk. </sentence><sentence id="1007">They were my trucks in my motor pool. </sentence><sentence id="1008">Yes, there was a risk. </sentence><sentence id="1009">I could have -- I don't know what would have happened. </sentence><sentence id="1010">I imagine, based on some other things I have seen over there, they would have cut me. </sentence><sentence id="1011">I would have been dismissed from UNRRA, and they would have sent me immediately home. </sentence><sentence id="1012">I don't know whether there would have been any criminal charges, because the military is very leery about getting themselves involved. </sentence><sentence id="1013">It's a public relations problem. </sentence><sentence id="1014">So, it would have been tough on me. </sentence><sentence id="1015">I would have been shipped back home, and in some disgrace, not with Jews, I guess. </sentence><sentence id="1016">So there was some risk. </sentence><sentence id="1017">But it's one of my fondest memories. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1037">Q: What made you do it? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1039">A: Well, I was Jewish, and my sense of solidarity with my people, with the people, you know, around me. </sentence><sentence id="1040">I was profoundly sympathetic. </sentence><sentence id="1041">Then, well, there was also the question of how do you get around the Americans. </sentence><sentence id="1042">Now, Jews would apply for immigration to the United States, and when they would come in there, with their documentation, there was a consul general in Munich, with their DP cards and their records. </sentence><sentence id="1043">It would show they had arrived after December 22nd of "45, and they were automatically eliminated. </sentence><sentence id="1044">I am a little unclear about the immigration laws at the time. </sentence><sentence id="1045">Eventually, a new law was passed in "48, I guess, also very controversial, and very stacked against Jewish DPs and the countries where they came from. </sentence><sentence id="1046">But it still remained that they had to be in the zone before December 22, 1945 in order to be eligible. </sentence><sentence id="1047">So what would happen was, Jews would come in and say, in effect, to one of my staff people, "I came here after, and Poland is no good for me. </sentence><sentence id="1048">Here I have this paper saying that I was born in Dresden or Breslau." </sentence><sentence id="1049">German cities were favored, because during the four, five years of the war, Germans were prohibited from emigrating to the United States, or after, as ex-enemy nationals. </sentence><sentence id="1050">And so all of these unused numbers -- and Germans had a very big quota for the United States under that national origins quota. </sentence><sentence id="1051">These numbers -- Germans who could not use these quota numbers had to stay, and the numbers were saved up and they were turned over to the DPs by the Truman Directive to be used. </sentence><sentence id="1052">All of these used up numbers going back to 1939, or thereabouts. </sentence><sentence id="1053">So that relieved some of the problems. </sentence><sentence id="1054">But the point was, they still operated under the national origins quota, very restrictive. </sentence><sentence id="1055">And under the requirement that they be in a zone December 22nd of 1945. </sentence><sentence id="1056">So what happened was such people, if they came and asked for help -- I am going to be very candid here -- we would take out their documents and tear up the document. </sentence><sentence id="1057">Nobody knew the difference. </sentence><sentence id="1058"> I was in control of these things. </sentence><sentence id="1059">And put a new DP card in the file. </sentence><sentence id="1060">And I remember in one office, we had a guy who was an expert at aging these documents. </sentence><sentence id="1061">Of course, they had to be about two or three years old, you know, so if you saw a fresh, the paper was lousy, if you saw a fresh white paper, you knew it was fresh. </sentence><sentence id="1062">So we had them stacked on radiators to age them a little bit. </sentence><sentence id="1063">And then they would bring these papers in, and it didn't take long before the consul generals, they are pretty bright people, understood that there was something not kosher about these. </sentence><sentence id="1064">A lot of people came in, declared they were born in Germany, but had no German accent. </sentence><sentence id="1065">You know, they spoke strong Yiddish, and there was some cockamamie story made up to cover that. </sentence><sentence id="1066">And then they were asked finally to find some document that you told somebody, and it was true, if you were in a concentration camp, and you didn't keep your birth certificate in Auschwitz or Buchenwald or whatever. </sentence><sentence id="1067">They would say write away to the city in which you were born. </sentence><sentence id="1068">And many of them said they were born in German cities, East Germany where it could not be checked. </sentence><sentence id="1069">Russians were occupying East Germany. </sentence><sentence id="1070">And well, first, they would say "Look, I didn't have any papers. </sentence><sentence id="1071">And I have written, here is a copy of a registered letter which I sent to some East German city." </sentence><sentence id="1072">There were all sorts of means to get out, to get around these restrictive laws or regulations. </sentence><sentence id="1073">The German quota was an important one. </sentence><sentence id="1074">Sometimes they would go up to some small town someplace, where it was learned there were some birth certificates or birth documents for people who had died already. </sentence><sentence id="1075">And they would get these, maybe having to bribe an official. </sentence><sentence id="1076">But it was a survival struggle. </sentence><sentence id="1077">And we countenanced it all. </sentence><sentence id="1078">Some years ago, I met a guy had been the U.S. Ambassador to Cairo in the State Department. </sentence><sentence id="1079">He came to Milwaukee to make a speech, and I sat next to him at a lunch. </sentence><sentence id="1080">I recognized his name, and when his bio was read, I remembered he was vice consul in Munich, way back when I was there. </sentence><sentence id="1081">I told him, "I don't know whether you remember me, but I used to come in and plead the case that the people were unjustly denied. </sentence><sentence id="1082">I would come down to see them." </sentence><sentence id="1083">And he said he remembered me. </sentence><sentence id="1084">He said, "I know that you had" -- what he called "a document factory" out there, near one of these camps nearby." </sentence><sentence id="1085">I said, "We probably did." </sentence><sentence id="1086">I mean, they were good people, but they were operating according to the regulations. </sentence><sentence id="1087">By the way, when I spoke to him, he was an Assistant Secretary of State, yeah, Assistant Secretary of State. </sentence><sentence id="1088">Very well known man. </sentence><sentence id="1089">I don't recall his name. </sentence><sentence id="1090">Tape 2  Well, we went through a very difficult year 1946 and to 1947, when UNRRA decided to go out of business, and be replaced by the IRO (International Refugee Organization). </sentence><sentence id="1091">At the same time, the decision was made to evacuate Neu Freimann, and that became one of the most difficult parts of my whole year, my whole stay in this job. </sentence><sentence id="1092">Neu Freimann was considered a privileged camp because it was right on the border of Munich, and therefore, easily accessible to Jewish agencies which had to visit, dealing with various problems, a lot with immigration. </sentence><sentence id="1093">We had the USNA, the United Service for New Americans, which, I think, was like a JDC operation, which processed applications. </sentence><sentence id="1094">We did, too, but they did, I think, a lot of the processing of applications to the United States. </sentence><sentence id="1095">The HIAS was there. </sentence><sentence id="1096">There was the Jewish Agency, JAFP, Jewish Agency for Palestine, with Chaim Hoffman as its director. </sentence><sentence id="1097">And there was an extensive black market in the city. </sentence><sentence id="1098">I want to speak about the black market because that played a very important role, not only in assuring the Jews a way of sustaining themselves -- not only Jews, but anybody. </sentence><sentence id="1099">I mean, it was open to all. </sentence><sentence id="1100">The black market was not a Jewish making, it was a creation of the German merchants who were backed up with merchandise, which they were beginning to produce. </sentence><sentence id="1101">And they could not sell and make anything unless they sold it on the black market, because the controlled price in German marks, what you would get would be zero. </sentence><sentence id="1102">I could get four opera seats for two cigarettes. </sentence><sentence id="1103">Opera seats had a nominal value of, let's say, 20 marks apiece. </sentence><sentence id="1104">So the black market was really a creation of the economic system. </sentence><sentence id="1105">That has to be understood. </sentence><sentence id="1106">And Jews could not live on the 2,000 calories a person, especially what those calories were made of. </sentence><sentence id="1107">They were made of potatoes and starchy haferflocken, which was a German term for a wheat, a cereal of some sort, dried eggs, dried skim milk. </sentence><sentence id="1108">Jews could not eat dried eggs. </sentence><sentence id="1109">That stuff used to lie and rot in warehouses. </sentence><sentence id="1110">One day we discovered, by the way, that a couple of tons of dried skim milk had disappeared from one of the camps. </sentence><sentence id="1111">It didn't bother us a bit -- except we wanted to know what happened to it -- because the Jews did not enjoy, or take, or drink dried skimmed milk. </sentence><sentence id="1112">But what happened was, about two or three weeks or thereabouts later, we saw wandering around the camps Jews carrying a box slung over shoulder shouting "Lody! </sentence><sentence id="1113">Lody!" </sentence><sentence id="1114">Lody is ice cream in Polish. </sentence><sentence id="1115">They had used this milk to manufacture ice cream pops, or something, and they were selling them on the streets. </sentence><sentence id="1116">I recall that. </sentence><sentence id="1117">That's very funny, the creativity of our folk. </sentence><sentence id="1118">But, as I say, the packages which came from the JDC, the Jewish relief agencies, were the real waluta, the real currency, of the DP camps. </sentence><sentence id="1119">The cigarettes in them, which sold for, I think, a dollar a package -- I mean, in the United States were 15 cents or something, or maybe more. </sentence><sentence id="1120">I mean, $10 a carton, I think. </sentence><sentence id="1121"> Coffee, marmalade, jam, fat in cans, other things which were priceless. </sentence><sentence id="1122">They became the basis upon which many Jews -- they could trade them for meat, for bread, for other things to sustain their family. </sentence><sentence id="1123">And so going into Munich became very important. </sentence><sentence id="1124">People had access either by the few buses which were running, or by trucks which they could hitch a ride on to go and do their business. </sentence><sentence id="1125">There was a famous street in Munich. </sentence><sentence id="1126">I want to mention it, called Mohl Strasse, M-o-h-l. I've been back there, by the way. </sentence><sentence id="1127">I once went back some years later to buy some Meissen Rosenthal china for my mother-in-law. </sentence><sentence id="1128">But it was a great center of black market currency dealings. </sentence><sentence id="1129">Jews were carrying currency during the war. </sentence><sentence id="1130">Those who were not in concentrations camps, those who were in hiding, sewed into the linings of their clothing. </sentence><sentence id="1131">They were carrying many things in order to enable themselves to live, if they ever made it through. </sentence><sentence id="1132">And they went to exchange these dollars for various things, whatever, or to trade them up, in some way to change them. </sentence><sentence id="1133">All currencies into national hard currencies were being traded there. </sentence><sentence id="1134">Not German marks, but Swiss francs and British pounds and American dollars. </sentence><sentence id="1135">And they were subject to raids all the time. </sentence><sentence id="1136">The military would come pouncing down on them because the military declared its intention to protect the German economy or to rebuild the German economy, and these black market operations were, they felt, destructive of the economy. </sentence><sentence id="1137">I think that's subject to some doubt, but that's what they said. </sentence><sentence id="1138">But in any case, when the announcement was made that there would be an evacuation, there were great protests, and it took a long, long time for us to move these people out to other camps. </sentence><sentence id="1139">Some attrition, some people went away to Palestine, others emigrated. </sentence><sentence id="1140">Nevertheless, we were accused of using all of the terminology of the wartime period of deportations, of Aus Zeslac (?) </sentence><sentence id="1141">or whatever they used. </sentence><sentence id="1142">Just like, about the ghettos, Jews were being forced, against their will, out of these camps. </sentence><sentence id="1143">Neu Freimann, as I say, was a favored camp in that setting. </sentence><sentence id="1144">And ultimately, it was closed. </sentence><sentence id="1145">And I was then asked to take over Foehrenwald, which was one of the biggest DP camps in Germany at the time. </sentence><sentence id="1146">I think, well, it was designed for about 3,000 people. </sentence><sentence id="1147">There must have been more, I don't recall the figures, 4,000. </sentence><sentence id="1148">And Foehrenwald was actually two or three installations. </sentence><sentence id="1149">One was about 30 miles south of Munich toward the Austrian border where Innsbruck was situated. </sentence><sentence id="1150"> There was Foehrenwald itself, which had been a work camp for German labor. </sentence><sentence id="1151">And then there was a place called Geretsried, a small camp which housed about 1,000 people. </sentence><sentence id="1152">It became, ultimately, by the way, I believe the first legal exit point for immigration to Israel when it became legal. </sentence><sentence id="1153">People were processed there for health, their teeth, and the rest, for our paperwork. </sentence><sentence id="1154">And they would move from Geretsried, whose name was changed to Camp Negev, because it looked like it was in the Negev, a really forsaken area in the woods someplace. </sentence><sentence id="1155">That's where a lot of military training took place. </sentence><sentence id="1156">We were, by the way, being watched by air, by airplane by the intelligence people trying to find evidence that military training was going on in these camps, and it was. </sentence><sentence id="1157">And then there was a children's center nearby which brought children, picked up in various ways by khappers, grabbers, who went around Czechoslovakia and Poland finding Jewish children that they had heard about. </sentence><sentence id="1158">I am sure that in some cases in their haste to get out, there were some non-Jewish orphans among them, who are now living someplace in Israel. </sentence><sentence id="1159">But finally, we closed it down, and we moved all of our operations to Foehrenwald and to other places. </sentence><sentence id="1160">The great movement of Jews I forgot to mention. </sentence><sentence id="1161">You know, after the war, through maybe about March of "46, there was movement of Jews, but it was ona small, relatively small scale, infiltration. </sentence><sentence id="1162">But as you know, I don't remember the precise month, maybe May, I think, or thereabouts in 1946, a pogrom took place in Kielce, where there was a trumped-up charge that Jews were baking the blood of a Polish kid who had disappeared into the matzahs, which were being consumed for Passover. </sentence><sentence id="1163">I think that was it. </sentence><sentence id="1164">Ultimately, the Polish government -- this is not known -- punished very severely those people responsible for this. </sentence><sentence id="1165">There were 46 Jews killed. </sentence><sentence id="1166">Right wing anti- Semitic movements in Poland were accused of having fomented this thing, and there may be something to that. </sentence><sentence id="1167">But the Kielce program came like an enormous shock over the whole of the Eastern European community, such as it was at the time after the war, especially in Poland. </sentence><sentence id="1168">And then we, in the west, in Germany and in Austria, mostly in Germany, experienced a strong wave, I don't know how many thousands. </sentence><sentence id="1169">They say, I have heard 80,000 or so people came, all of a sudden, into West Germany into camps which had been declared closed by the military. </sentence><sentence id="1170"> And we had to accommodate them in some way. </sentence><sentence id="1171">And it was done contrary to regulations and the rest of it. </sentence><sentence id="1172">And I received, I remember, trainloads of people -- no, no. </sentence><sentence id="1173">In Munich, we got a lot of these people at Neu Freimann, then in Foehrenwald. </sentence><sentence id="1174">And then there was a constant movement of Jews. </sentence><sentence id="1175">I think the next relatively major movement was as a result of the Berlin airlift. </sentence><sentence id="1176">That was in 1947, I think. ( </sentence><sentence id="1177">Berlin Airlift was June 24, 1948-May 12, 1949).We got Jews, they had cleared the DP camps, Jewish DP camps in Berlin. </sentence><sentence id="1178">And each time that happened, it was a tremendous amount of effort, how to fit them in. </sentence><sentence id="1179">We would have to put them in among others and maybe among other families. </sentence><sentence id="1180">A terrible crisis was precipitated anytime that happened. </sentence><sentence id="1181">I have to speak about this children's center which we had. </sentence><sentence id="1182">I remember the man's name was Merrin (ph). </sentence><sentence id="1183">I have a picture of that Jewish center. </sentence><sentence id="1184">And he wrote me a message on the back of the picture when I left, I guess. </sentence><sentence id="1185">It was a    beautiful place, an installation. </sentence><sentence id="1186">I am not sure what it was for before, but we kept kids in there. </sentence><sentence id="1187">And the Brichah would bring in a load of kids, children maybe six, eight years old, something like that, who had been concealed. </sentence><sentence id="1188">I don't know where they had been, but they would bring them in. </sentence><sentence id="1189">And maybe 30 or 40 at a time would come. </sentence><sentence id="1190">And then, a quarrel broke out within the Jewish community between the Jewish Agency, I guess, and the various elements in the Jewish Agency and the central committee. </sentence><sentence id="1191">They were all going to Palestine, these kids, it was decided. </sentence><sentence id="1192">But what was very important, under whose auspices? </sentence><sentence id="1193">And so a rotating system was set up. </sentence><sentence id="1194"> This is very funny. </sentence><sentence id="1195">I think I am remembering it carefully. </sentence><sentence id="1196">We agreed to it. </sentence><sentence id="1197">We just wanted to get the kids out. </sentence><sentence id="1198">They would stay in this place, this group, let's say 20 or 30 kids, would stay for a month or six weeks. </sentence><sentence id="1199">And during that six weeks, the camp would be run by, let us say, the Mapai socialist party, Ben-Gurion's party, or Mapam, the more leftist. </sentence><sentence id="1200">And they were being taught and trained according to the philosophy of that branch of Zionism. </sentence><sentence id="1201">And they were wonderful. </sentence><sentence id="1202">I mean, these kids absorbed it like water. </sentence><sentence id="1203">And we had the right wingers, the "revisionistim" they were called, and they were singing revisionist songs and marching up and down in the military style of the revisionists. </sentence><sentence id="1204">And that's the way we finally dealt with the problem, just rotating a whole group, a new group of people came in to take over the training of these children. </sentence><sentence id="1205">They were wonderful-looking children, looking at some of them. </sentence><sentence id="1206">Some of them spoke some Yiddish. </sentence><sentence id="1207">I remember asking "vu forst du?" " </sentence><sentence id="1208">Where are you going?" </sentence><sentence id="1209">And this kid, "for ken Eretz Yisrael" He was from the right wing. " </sentence><sentence id="1210">Ich for hargenen ale," ("I am going there to kill Arabs,") he said. </sentence><sentence id="1211">It was not funny to me. </sentence><sentence id="1212">I said, "Is that what you're training these kids to do?" </sentence><sentence id="1213">Anyway, so we had these three installations, and there were others in towns. </sentence><sentence id="1214">Waltershausen, the city nearby, had some people. </sentence><sentence id="1215">And constantly, again, circuit riding. </sentence><sentence id="1216">We also had people who were struck down. </sentence><sentence id="1217">We had a lot of people with tuberculosis, and we would send them to Bad Reichenhall, where there was a big sanatorium. </sentence><sentence id="1218">Later on, we even sent people to Sweden, I think, Malmo. </sentence><sentence id="1219">There were a number of Jewish survivors recovering from tuberculosis, patients. </sentence><sentence id="1220">Do you know about that? </sentence><sentence id="1221">I had a number of people, one of my assistants, I sent a woman, a girl, from Hungary, to Malmo. </sentence><sentence id="1222">And now I worked under IRO's auspices in Foehrenwald. </sentence><sentence id="1223">Subsequently, they asked me also to give some attention to Feldafing. </sentence><sentence id="1224">It was quite a ride, on the other side of the lake, there was a big installation. </sentence><sentence id="1225">And I'd come in and meet with the people and talk about their problems, see what could be done. </sentence><sentence id="1226">So that's -- yeah. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1423">Q: When you went and visited the different camps, whether it was under UNRRA or, when it was IRO, did you meet with the people who were sort of    </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="1425"> the camp functionaries? </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1426">A: Right. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1428">Q: Or did you also go in the street and just meet with the people? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1430">A: Well, they knew. </sentence><sentence id="1431">There would be an office that I had in each of these places or aroom that I would sit in. </sentence><sentence id="1432">So first, I would meet with the functionaries, that is, the man in charge of food, housing, immigration, various aspects -- health care. </sentence><sentence id="1433">And discuss their problems, shortages, what they needed. </sentence><sentence id="1434">A guy in charge of education would complain about the absence of school materials. </sentence><sentence id="1435">Supply questions, and also internal problems, political problems. </sentence><sentence id="1436">In the broad sense, political problems. </sentence><sentence id="1437">Having problems putting people in there, they don't want to go there, and people are making trouble about this or that or whatever. </sentence><sentence id="1438">So, I tried to handle all of that, write them down, and see what could be done. </sentence><sentence id="1439">We had limited resources. </sentence><sentence id="1440">I would do whatever I could. </sentence><sentence id="1441">But then came a time for what we call "bittes", that is, requests or complaints. </sentence><sentence id="1442">I would sit in an office. </sentence><sentence id="1443">People would line up outside 20 or 30 or40, whatever. </sentence><sentence id="1444">If it was a busy time, there would be more, and they were admitted one-by-one. </sentence><sentence id="1445">And I would talk with them about what they needed. </sentence><sentence id="1446">Very frequently, it had to do with immigration, that is, "mir hut mir upgesugt": "I was refused by the consul general" and "What do I do?" </sentence><sentence id="1447">I would offer some advice. </sentence><sentence id="1448">I can't tell you what I offered, but sometimes I offered, and this was pretty frequently the case, that they tear up their documents, get new documents, go to Stuttgart to the north, where there was a consul general and reapply all over again. </sentence><sentence id="1449">And it worked. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1470">Q: What other things did people come, when they came in? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1472">A: Immigration, illness, "Can you find a relative of mine in the United States?" </sentence><sentence id="1473">I am looking for somebody in Cleveland or Chicago," or whatever. </sentence><sentence id="1474">Police, problems of the law. </sentence><sentence id="1475">Jews frequently ran afoul of the laws, that is, they were caught. " </sentence><sentence id="1476">My son has been arrested. </sentence><sentence id="1477">He was carrying illegal currency or black market, other operation, caught selling cigarettes or whatever. </sentence><sentence id="1478">And his trial will be so and so. </sentence><sentence id="1479">And it will destroy us if he is convicted. </sentence><sentence id="1480">He may not be able to get to the United States or to emigrate. </sentence><sentence id="1481">Can you help me?" </sentence><sentence id="1482">And I spent a lot of my time in the courts, in the summary courts, that is, the military summary courts in Munich where I had cultivated -- because I saw it as my responsibility -- cultivated acquaintances with the judges, who were American military officers. </sentence><sentence id="1483">One was my neighbor, lived down the street from me in Munich. </sentence><sentence id="1484">And we would have parties. </sentence><sentence id="1485">He would come over, I would go to his place, to parties. </sentence><sentence id="1486">It was a very good contact. </sentence><sentence id="1487">Not that he would simply let people off when I asked, but he would understand better what their cases were, and very frequently gave them a very light sentence or let them off or suspended a sentence, or did whatever. </sentence><sentence id="1488">And that was a very, very significant part of my responsibility. </sentence><sentence id="1489">I don't think it would have been the responsibility of another, somebody who was an UNRRA who didn't have the same sort of commitment that I had. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1509">Q: Because you were Jewish? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1511">A: Yes, because I felt a responsibility to these people. </sentence><sentence id="1512">I grew very expert at explaining all of the problems faced by Jews after the war, what they had experienced during the war. </sentence><sentence id="1513">We had a lot of pathologies, I say, people who were sick. </sentence><sentence id="1514">And we tried in our own primitive ways to deal with them. </sentence><sentence id="1515">I remember a very extreme case of a man who had survived by eating the flesh of his fellow haftlinger in the concentration camp, some bad place he had been. </sentence><sentence id="1516">This was on his mind, his head -- every once in a while he had a breakdown, "Ich hab gegesen" because | ate, you know. </sentence><sentence id="1517">He was in the camp. </sentence><sentence id="1518">He'd come to see me. </sentence><sentence id="1519">There was a lot. </sentence><sentence id="1520">One day Sam Haber, the director of the JDC came on a visit to a camp. </sentence><sentence id="1521">And he drove up in a nice-looking station wagon. </sentence><sentence id="1522">They have jeep-looking station wagons. </sentence><sentence id="1523">And on the side it was written, American Joint Distribution Committee. </sentence><sentence id="1524">And we were talking. </sentence><sentence id="1525">Whenever I met him here in the states, he would remind me: I saw a man who had been in a katzet someplace come up behind him. </sentence><sentence id="1526">The guy held up a lead pipe, and was going to smash Haber over the head. </sentence><sentence id="1527">I jumped in front of the guy and grabbed his arm. </sentence><sentence id="1528">He was shouting, "ganovim" , calling everybody thieves. </sentence><sentence id="1529">They are stealing. </sentence><sentence id="1530">My family is sending me from America. </sentence><sentence id="1531">I mean, we had really an impossible situation. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1553">Q: What did you do with people who were really out of control? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1555">A: We tried to hospitalize them. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1557">Q: In psychiatric hospitals? </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1632">Q: Let's go back over some of the details -- the legal situation, the problems that people would get into trouble with the law or violate something. </sentence><sentence id="1633">Can you tell us about the situation with the stolen car -- not stolen, but the car that was bought, on the -- accident, and what you did. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1636">A: There was a tendency -- I want to say as background, in the very beginning, when the Americans occupied Germany, they thought in the American way that all of the people living in Germany would be subject to German police and the German courts. </sentence><sentence id="1637"> And if a DP was arrested for smuggling cigarettes or beating somebody, whatever, that he would be put into a jail, which was a German jail, and arrested by the German police, and tried under German law. </sentence><sentence id="1638">Well, it was an abuse of that. </sentence><sentence id="1639">There were a lot of hard feelings, as you can understand. </sentence><sentence id="1640">And there was violence, and German police did some things which were vicious, and protests were raised by various people, including the American Jewish community. </sentence><sentence id="1641">And then a decision was taken, it was a very important decision, that no Jew could be arrested by German police. </sentence><sentence id="1642">They had no power over Jews, except they could detain them until military police came by and got them. </sentence><sentence id="1643">And if Jews were sentenced to jail, they were sentenced to jail in stockades, a military term for jail, where American soldiers were sentenced for various offenses. </sentence><sentence id="1644">They did their time in stockades, and when they were tried, they were tried in a military court. </sentence><sentence id="1645">We had two or three levels, it was a summary court. </sentence><sentence id="1646">I mean, depending on the seriousness of the offense. </sentence><sentence id="1647">And there would be a military prosecutor and a military judge sitting in judgment on them. </sentence><sentence id="1648">And this protected them, insulated them. </sentence><sentence id="1649">This was for criminal acts, of course, smuggling mostly, black market, whatever, but also occasionally, for some more serious offenses. </sentence><sentence id="1650">But mostly, it was sort of a black market thing. </sentence><sentence id="1651">I was constantly running down their pleas. </sentence><sentence id="1652">You know, Joe or John, whatever the judge's name was, please think about this guy, what he had been through, and all of the rest. </sentence><sentence id="1653">It very frequently worked. </sentence><sentence id="1654">But then there were offenses of Jews, one Jew against another Jew, in the camps. </sentence><sentence id="1655">Thefts took place. </sentence><sentence id="1656">Fights took place over such thing as housing or some deal which they had made with each other and didn't work out. </sentence><sentence id="1657">And there was an embarrassment, I think that's the best word I can think of, for the goyim, for the non-Jews, that these things were happening, that after the war, Jews were beating each other up or doing things to each other. </sentence><sentence id="1658">And so these things we tried to settle internally in the camps. </sentence><sentence id="1659">And a kind of primitive justice system was set up. </sentence><sentence id="1660">And for want of a better one, I remember, I served for about a year in Neu Freimann, I think, yeah, as a judge. </sentence><sentence id="1661">I would hold court as a guy sitting there, listening to the evidence, and deciding whether to dismiss the case or get together and settle the thing, or whether there was some penalty. </sentence><sentence id="1662">I had no jail. </sentence><sentence id="1663"> [had no way of doing that, but the penalty was deprivation of some privilege or something. </sentence><sentence id="1664">But at least there would be a statement, a verdict, some finding. </sentence><sentence id="1665">And we also had a problem, I think I mentioned this, occasionally when a kapo would be found, or a ghettopolizei who was accused of cooperating with the Germans in the ghettoes or in the concentration camps, resulting in the suffering of Jews maybe the death of Jews. </sentence><sentence id="1666">After we pried him loose from an angry mob, all bloodied and I tell you, terrible, we would try to listen to what this man had to say for himself. </sentence><sentence id="1667">And he would try to produce witnesses. </sentence><sentence id="1668">Of course, there were accusers, people who found them in the camp, and came and told how he extracted money from them in a ghetto somewhere, and then sent their son off for deportation. </sentence><sentence id="1669">But so often, we would find that where a group of people told stories on one side, another group of people who knew him from that town would line up and say he was wonderful. " </sentence><sentence id="1670">He saved my life" or "He saved my father." </sentence><sentence id="1671">It was a very, very difficult area to try to be a judge. </sentence><sentence id="1672">And, I was not trained to be a judge. </sentence><sentence id="1673">I just used whatever common sense I had. </sentence><sentence id="1674">People seemed to be satisfied with that. </sentence><sentence id="1675">Now, what did we do with those Jews? </sentence><sentence id="1676">We had no way of dealing with them. </sentence><sentence id="1677">We were embarrassed to turn them over on a war crimes charge, can you imagine, to an American judge or American prosecutor who would have been unheard (?) </sentence><sentence id="1678">of Jews, you know. </sentence><sentence id="1679">And I am trying to remember -- I am not clear. </sentence><sentence id="1680">What we would sometimes do, we would call in the people who were from Palestine, working in the Brichah. </sentence><sentence id="1681">And they were young, strong guys. </sentence><sentence id="1682">I don't know what they did with them. </sentence><sentence id="1683">We would give them to take them away. </sentence><sentence id="1684">They must have questioned him, in the Sochnut offices. </sentence><sentence id="1685">And some people told me they were drugged and taken away on illegal transports to Palestine where they were again tried. </sentence><sentence id="1686">And if there were really serious offenses, I don't know what would happen. </sentence><sentence id="1687">Shame played a big role in the punishment, that his name would be published in Israel. </sentence><sentence id="1688">He is a man who, in this and this ghetto, Lodz or whatever, did the following. </sentence><sentence id="1689">And so he would be sort of a marked man in Palestine. </sentence><sentence id="1690">I think, my recollection is that this played a powerful part - - people didn't want that attached to them. </sentence><sentence id="1691">It was almost as bad as, maybe, as a jail sentence. </sentence><sentence id="1692">So that's the way these things were resolved. </sentence><sentence id="1693"> Then there was the civil justice. </sentence><sentence id="1694">There were questions of civil justice, where agreements had been breached, mainly in the area of black market, where a load of cigarettes or coffee or something had been paid for, and on the way to delivery, were stopped by military police and confiscated, the whole load, including the truck. </sentence><sentence id="1695">And the driver was thrown into jail. </sentence><sentence id="1696">So now the guy who supplied these cigarettes, for example, came to the guy he sold them to and said, "Give me my money." </sentence><sentence id="1697">In the case where there was no prior payment, the guy had to get some money out of it or something. </sentence><sentence id="1698">Then there would be an argument about who was responsible. </sentence><sentence id="1699">In that case, these things were submitted to a deen torah, that is, a rabbinic court. </sentence><sentence id="1700">And we had a rabbi, a number of rabbis in the camp, but there were a number of rabbis around who would hold court on this. </sentence><sentence id="1701">And there was agreement that the verdicts they reached would be obeyed, would be complied with. </sentence><sentence id="1702">So generally, that was the sort of justice system. </sentence><sentence id="1703">We tried to avoid, and I tried to avoid, any reference to any access to the general criminal justice system which, for Jews, was by and large was the military authority. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1775">A: Oh, yeah. </sentence><sentence id="1776">Well, we had our attitudes. </sentence><sentence id="1777">Speaking of "ours," I mean Jews in Germany immediately after the war, knowing of the unbelievable horror under which these people had suffered, we had the same hatred towards Germans that the Jewish DPs had. </sentence><sentence id="1778">Not quite the same, but it was there. </sentence><sentence id="1779">And very often, it skewed our sense of equity. </sentence><sentence id="1780">So one night, I was asleep. </sentence><sentence id="1781">It was about midnight, and suddenly in this graphone (ph), in this big house, somebody's banging at the front door downstairs. </sentence><sentence id="1782">I heard the girl go down and open the door, ask him in. </sentence><sentence id="1783">He said, "/kh muz mit dem director sprechen, redn, sprechen," whatever. </sentence><sentence id="1784">Speaking Yiddish. </sentence><sentence id="1785">And I came down. </sentence><sentence id="1786">There was this guy panting. </sentence><sentence id="1787">I asked him what happened. </sentence><sentence id="1788">He said he had bought a car illegally, and he was riding the car around, and he lost control of the car. </sentence><sentence id="1789">And the car ran up on a loading platform for street cars, where there were a lot of people. </sentence><sentence id="1790">There was massive use of street cars. </sentence><sentence id="1791">No cars on the streets at all, hardly any. </sentence><sentence id="1792">And he struck a number of people, but I don't know what he said. </sentence><sentence id="1793">I think he may have killed a woman. </sentence><sentence id="1794">And he said to me -- "I don't know whether I killed her. </sentence><sentence id="1795">I don't know. </sentence><sentence id="1796">Ir muz mir rateven," he said, "You have to save me!"" </sentence><sentence id="1797">Well, I didn't think very much about it. </sentence><sentence id="1798">Here was a man, probably with a number on his arm or something. </sentence><sentence id="1799">And I said, "Come inside and in the morning, I will take you to one of the camps, and we will see that you are placed on a transport bound for Palestine, illegal transport." </sentence><sentence id="1800"> And we did that the next morning. </sentence><sentence id="1801">About three or four days later, I was told he was gone. </sentence><sentence id="1802">Now, whether he was picked up in Cyprus by the British on a ship, I don't know, but he was certainly not in Munich anymore. </sentence><sentence id="1803">I have thought about that for many, many years. </sentence><sentence id="1804">Was that a proper exercise of my values? </sentence><sentence id="1805">I don't know. </sentence><sentence id="1806">I am deeply troubled even to this very day. </sentence><sentence id="1807">That is, I think we have to avoid situations where Jews, because of the sufferings they experienced, are exempt from the best human standards of mankind. </sentence><sentence id="1808">And what I did to him was, I said to him, "You're exempt." </sentence><sentence id="1809">And I think that was wrong. </sentence><sentence id="1810">I have lived with that ever since. </sentence><sentence id="1811">I was wrong. </sentence><sentence id="1812">I wouldn't do it in the States. </sentence><sentence id="1813">But it didn't take me 30 seconds to say come on in. </sentence><sentence id="1814">And when I have discussed it with friends of mine who are survivors, and said "What would you do?" </sentence><sentence id="1815">They say, "I would take him in." </sentence><sentence id="1816">They would have condemned me had I handed him over. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2168">A: Well, they were very anxious to talk to me, that is, survivors, especially concentration camp survivors. </sentence><sentence id="2169">This is what was done to me. </sentence><sentence id="2170">They had to speak. </sentence><sentence id="2171">They were anxious to talk about it. </sentence><sentence id="2172">And the people who were in the woods would also speak about it. </sentence><sentence id="2173">I learned a lot from them. </sentence><sentence id="2174">But what I have learned has been modified, or enriched, by what I got from my reading. </sentence><sentence id="2175">That is, I was really dealing with a sort of macro at the very local level where great events were, like when Jews moved by the hundreds of thousands out of the Soviet Union in 1946, as a result of the Mikolajczyk ohpmacht. </sentence><sentence id="2176">Mikolajczyk was the president of the London government of the Poles, who had reached an agreement with the Russians to allow the Polish nationals to leave the Soviet Union. </sentence><sentence id="2177"> I learned that from somewhere else, or I learned the real truth. </sentence><sentence id="2178">That is, these people also had a very limited view of their universe, which was very small. </sentence><sentence id="2179">And lead to some miscalculations on their part, or misunderstanding, so it's a combination of both. </sentence><sentence id="2180">But I think the human feelings, the sense of what these people experienced, I seemed to get from my personal encounter with them. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2250">A: Well, we would go occasionally on vacations. </sentence><sentence id="2251">But the only place that I could go with some regularity -- we'd get away maybe once every couple of months. </sentence><sentence id="2252">If you look at your map, you could see we were about three or four hours from Switzerland, from the Swiss border. </sentence><sentence id="2253">And we'd drive down to Konstanz, which is the border town on the Swiss German border. </sentence><sentence id="2254">And from there, about another 30 miles to Zurich. </sentence><sentence id="2255">And there was just an incredible change, you know. </sentence><sentence id="2256">Schlagsaahner, that's whipped cream and cookies and cakes and chocolate and night clubs and all of the rest. </sentence><sentence id="2257">And you'd spend three or four days. </sentence><sentence id="2258">You thought you were refreshed. </sentence><sentence id="2259">And then, you would come back to the grimness of the horrors. </sentence><sentence id="2260">Occasionally, I would accompany a group of Jews who were being, again, treated for tuberculosis in Switzerland. </sentence><sentence id="2261">I remember that Davos was the place, the site. </sentence><sentence id="2262">Have you heard of Davos, D-a-v-o-s? </sentence><sentence id="2263">Now I hear about it in ski contests. </sentence><sentence id="2264">It's a resort city and they hold ski meets there. </sentence><sentence id="2265">But Davos was a place with a number of sanitoriums, and the Jews stayed there to recover. </sentence><sentence id="2266">And then they were sent back. </sentence><sentence id="2267">UNRRA paid the bill in Davos and Malmo. </sentence><sentence id="2268">You have heard of Malmo? </sentence><sentence id="2269">Where is that, Norway or Sweden? </sentence><sentence id="2270">Sweden. </sentence><sentence id="2271">I have to say something about the international organization. </sentence><sentence id="2272">Malmo -- I mean, all of the processing of Jews, that is, was paid for, the welfare and their migration, their tickets were bought, to Israel when it was established, to the United States, to Canada. </sentence><sentence id="2273">Their medical care in foreign countries when that became vital, when people were thought to be able to be helped. </sentence><sentence id="2274">So it was a great humanitarian service. </sentence><sentence id="2275"> I know that many of our people here, UNRRA, think of the Arab states and the refugee problem and there is a negative feeling about the U.N., generally. </sentence><sentence id="2276">You know, the U.N. intrudes -- especially on the basis of the U.N. -- the Middle Eastern situation. </sentence><sentence id="2277">But they can be eternally grateful to the United Nations to UNRRA, for the great service which they rendered to the Jewish people as well as other refugees. </sentence><sentence id="2278">But the Jews especially. </sentence><sentence id="2279">Tape 3 </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2310">Q: Can you talk a little bit more about the black market, both looked like a solution to a lot of problems, but I suspect it also generated its own problems? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2312">A: Terrible. </sentence><sentence id="2313">I think the black market, more than anything else I can think of, generated hostility towards the Jewish community as it then existed in the camps, among the military and among, I think, Germans, generally. </sentence><sentence id="2314">And the newspaper people would come over from the United States and want to know about "the black market" because I think it was publicized here in the United States, as well. </sentence><sentence id="2315">And we were very sensitive about it. </sentence><sentence id="2316">UNRRA was told that a number one priority of the occupation immediately after the end of the war was the reconstruction of Germany's economy, which was smashed. </sentence><sentence id="2317">And Eisenhower and the people that came after him, and in particular, John McCloy, General Clay, all made that a number one priority. </sentence><sentence id="2318">And therefore, the diversion of goods, of manufactured goods, and food from the regular market was considered a very great threat to the economy. </sentence><sentence id="2319">And measures were to be taken against it, police measures. </sentence><sentence id="2320">At the same time, the people who were withholding these goods -- if you walked into a German shop, camera store, for example -- until the currency was reformed, that store lay absolutely empty of any merchandise. </sentence><sentence id="2321">You couldn't buy food. </sentence><sentence id="2322">You couldn't buy clothing because the clothing had to be sold at regulated prices, and the mark, the reichsmark, which was still the old reich before the d-mark, was practically worthless. </sentence><sentence id="2323">I mean, it went to like 800 to a dollar at one point, so that the Germans would not sell their goods on the open market. </sentence><sentence id="2324">That is, on the regular market under controlled prices, because they would be losing their shirts. </sentence><sentence id="2325">And it was only to be bought with hard currencies: dollars, or Swiss francs, or British pounds, or whatever. </sentence><sentence id="2326">Now, for the Jews, the black market was the only place. </sentence><sentence id="2327">These were people who had come out of the most terrible conditions, in eastern Europe, either concentration camps or in hiding, or in the Soviet Union where there was nothing to eat. </sentence><sentence id="2328">And there was a thrust to rebuild themselves, to rebuild their families. </sentence><sentence id="2329">They were producing children, doing all of these things, and the black market became the only way in which they could meet that need. </sentence><sentence id="2330"> And, also, to produce some income for them, so that when they went overseas to the country in which they would settle, they would have a few dollars in their pockets. </sentence><sentence id="2331">And so this black market developed. </sentence><sentence id="2332">It took the form very frequently of little shops in the DP camps, thriving in Feldafing, Foehrenwald, Neu Freimann also. </sentence><sentence id="2333">You could buy most anything you needed or wanted. </sentence><sentence id="2334">Food, cloth for making clothing. </sentence><sentence id="2335">The joke was, you could get anything you want -- You couldn't get anything you want, but you could get a lot of things. </sentence><sentence id="2336">And it thrived. </sentence><sentence id="2337">Now, the military authorities knew about it, and they would launch raids on the camps to grab these people in the act. </sentence><sentence id="2338">And early in the morning, maybe about 5:00, 6:00, or 7:00 o'clock in the morning, they would surround the DP camp with armed vehicles, and they would go marching in there looking for contraband: cigarettes, coffee, all kinds of things. </sentence><sentence id="2339">I remember a funny story about how this stuff got into the camp at Foehrenwald. </sentence><sentence id="2340">There's a big meat market. </sentence><sentence id="2341">The question is, where do you get meat in a market? </sentence><sentence id="2342">Now, we discovered the meat was gotten in this way: garbage was collected by German firms. </sentence><sentence id="2343">And they didn't use trucks, they used sort of sledges, which were dragged along the ground, no wheels, just like sleighs. </sentence><sentence id="2344">And they were pulled by two oxen; they would come into the camp with two oxen. </sentence><sentence id="2345">And then, the same sledge would emerge with one ox. </sentence><sentence id="2346">Then for a few days, there would be meat, kosher meat in the camp. </sentence><sentence id="2347">But in any case, in the event of a raid in a camp, the United Nations had to receive prior notice from the military. </sentence><sentence id="2348">No military people could enter a United Nations Displaced Persons Camp without prior clearance from UNRRA, from the responsible United Nations official. </sentence><sentence id="2349">So, when any of the camps over which I had any kind of supervising relationships were about to be raided, I would receive a call from the colonel in Munich saying, "Mr. Sorrin, tomorrow morning at 7:00 o'clock, we are going to be entering your camp." </sentence><sentence id="2350">And of course, now, 40 or 50 years later, I am free to say it -- I would call up and tell Haim Yankel or the president of the camp, tomorrow is going to be a razzia, a raid. </sentence><sentence id="2351">You know, I could not abide these -- I mean, I was sympathetic with what the Jews were trying to do. </sentence><sentence id="2352">I had no participation in it, but I would just tell them, if you don't want to be raided, put your stuff out of sight. </sentence><sentence id="2353">And that thrived. </sentence><sentence id="2354"> And I understood it. </sentence><sentence id="2355">And the military did not, from their vantage point, nor did the United Nations authorities. </sentence><sentence id="2356">They were simply obeying the mandate of the military government. </sentence><sentence id="2357">But without that, it would have been tragic for Jewish families. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2406">Q: What happened between Jews, because obviously, some people were more entrepreneurial and others were not so entrepreneurial? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2408">A: That's right. </sentence><sentence id="2409">Some people made a lot of money, but most people made a little money, enough to get along. </sentence><sentence id="2410">But we used to hear that some people made big deals. </sentence><sentence id="2411">Now, I want to also mention that very often, involved in these big deals were members of the armed forces themselves. </sentence><sentence id="2412">That is, some of the PX. </sentence><sentence id="2413">people who had access to cigarettes and coffee from the P.X. They didn't have to steal it. </sentence><sentence id="2414">It was charged out as purchased in some way, and it ended up in a black market operation. </sentence><sentence id="2415">And these black market operations were not of course only Jewish -- everybody was participating in them because Germany was vulnerable, its economic system was vulnerable, because of the war, to that kind of activity. </sentence><sentence id="2416">What happened here in the United States, if you went to go buy a camera, let's say, for $400, and each dollar is worth a tenth of what its value is, so that you're really buying it for $40 dollars, or maybe even $4 when the mark really went down, the people producing these cameras are going to take them off the shelves and wait for someone to come in with another currency. </sentence><sentence id="2417">But then a real act of genius occurred, a genius on the part of the United States and their economic planners. </sentence><sentence id="2418">When the war was over, the currency which was in use was reichsmarks. </sentence><sentence id="2419">And a lot of their currency had pictures of German emperors on them, whatever. </sentence><sentence id="2420">But some of them, many of them had Hitler and Goering and Goebbels and people like that. </sentence><sentence id="2421">That money was discarded. </sentence><sentence id="2422">But the other currency, the old currency was still in circulation, and it was subject to extraordinary fluctuation because of the black market situation. </sentence><sentence id="2423">Now, a decision was taken by the military government in connection with the finance leaders of West Germany at the time -- Conrad Adenauer was the chancellor of Germany -- to change the currency, to completely abandon the reichsmarks, and to substitute d-marks for them. </sentence><sentence id="2424">And this had to be done secretly, because if it got out, there would be all kinds of dislocations. </sentence><sentence id="2425">All kinds of things would happen if this was happening. </sentence><sentence id="2426"> It was no secret, by the way. </sentence><sentence id="2427">You can't do something that massive without somebody knowing. </sentence><sentence id="2428">But what happened was that for a couple of weeks before the day of the currency reform, which I think took place in "48, black market goods disappeared. </sentence><sentence id="2429">You couldn't buy, because nobody knew what the price would be. </sentence><sentence id="2430">And the people were withholding it, waiting for the new currency to come on line. </sentence><sentence id="2431">And that was a period of enormous restlessness in the Jewish DP camps at the time. </sentence><sentence id="2432">I guess it must have been out in the general society, but in the camps, I could -- we could see the tension rising. </sentence><sentence id="2433">There were fights. </sentence><sentence id="2434">There was a small riot in some camp, I remember. </sentence><sentence id="2435">They had all kinds of problems, because you couldn't get anything to eat. </sentence><sentence id="2436">And people had to feed themselves and their families. </sentence><sentence id="2437">And then on a given day, an announcement was put up, broadcast through the camps, and the currency reform began. </sentence><sentence id="2438">Now, what they did was -- I am trying to remember -- everybody got, I think, 10 marks, or maybe it was 100 marks. </sentence><sentence id="2439">If you had 10 million dollars stashed in old currency, it was worthless to you. </sentence><sentence id="2440">You could just burn it in the furnace because you got the same thing. </sentence><sentence id="2441">Every individual got the same amount in d-marks. </sentence><sentence id="2442">And it was a miracle. </sentence><sentence id="2443">By the way, the Germans had a word for it, wirtschaft wunder, economic wonder, economic miracle. </sentence><sentence id="2444">Within days, the shops filled with merchandise, cameras, food, cakes, meat, cookies. </sentence><sentence id="2445">You could buy whatever you wanted, clothing, just in a matter of weeks, because the d-marks were around, and people suddenly had lots of d-marks, even though they were distributed in this democratic way. </sentence><sentence id="2446">And that began Germany's real economic recovery, and changed entirely the nature of the black market -- it disappeared. </sentence><sentence id="2447">It was no longer a viable instrument, you know, for doing business in Germany. </sentence><sentence id="2448">Before, during the days of the black market, it was necessary. </sentence><sentence id="2449">Otherwise, you would not move anything. </sentence><sentence id="2450">So I remember that day. </sentence><sentence id="2451">We had to supervise. </sentence><sentence id="2452">We went camp to camp, saw people lined up. </sentence><sentence id="2453">And there were German treasury officials, handing out -- taking -- you had to bring a certain amount of reichsmarks. </sentence><sentence id="2454">There was an exchange for the old marks to the new marks, but you had a limited amount that you could get. </sentence><sentence id="2455">And I tell you, I remember, it was an absolute wonder. </sentence><sentence id="2456">And that was done by the American people, the American economists who were working over there, together with the Germans and the Jews. </sentence><sentence id="2457">It changed the life of the Jews in the camps at that time, very much so. </sentence><sentence id="2458">And the people living in the cities as well. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2513">A: Now, this is an interesting story. </sentence><sentence id="2514">In Feldafing, there was a street, I don't remember its name, on which Jewish DPs lived. </sentence><sentence id="2515">They had built small -- in Yiddish it's called geveldelach, little shops, little stands, one after the other. </sentence><sentence id="2516">On these stands, you could buy almost anything. </sentence><sentence id="2517">Fruit, oranges, apples, meat, bread, booze, and cloth. </sentence><sentence id="2518">Whatever you needed, for to live. </sentence><sentence id="2519">And it thrived. </sentence><sentence id="2520">I mean, the market was busy. </sentence><sentence id="2521">In this camp, most of the Jews, I would say like 97 percent of the Jews or 95 percent of the Jews were Polish Jews. </sentence><sentence id="2522">And they controlled -- they were the big merchants in these geveldelach, these little stores. </sentence><sentence id="2523">But there was a little commer where the Greeks had established themselves. </sentence><sentence id="2524">Now, Greek Jews had a hard time, and many of them were    deported, and lived and died in Dachau. </sentence><sentence id="2525">They were a rough and ready group of people. </sentence><sentence id="2526">These Jews that I met there, were from Salonika. </sentence><sentence id="2527">They lived on the waterfront and worked the waterfront. </sentence><sentence id="2528">They were people known for their roughness, you know, their occupations, and all of the rest. </sentence><sentence id="2529">And they ran these businesses and competed with the Poles, and the Poles didn't like these Greek Jews taking some of their business away. </sentence><sentence id="2530">There was an ethnic competition. </sentence><sentence id="2531">And fights would break out. </sentence><sentence id="2532">And they were bloody. </sentence><sentence id="2533">I mean, they were fighting with clubs and knives, you name it. </sentence><sentence id="2534">And we decided that we had to do something about it. </sentence><sentence id="2535">We had to get these Greeks out of there, otherwise there would be deaths. </sentence><sentence id="2536">But I do recall that in one fight between the Greek Jews and the Polish Jews that the Greek Jews went to Munich, where there was a colony of Greeks, who had also suffered in the concentration camps. </sentence><sentence id="2537">They had been dragged in as forced labor, and called on them to come to Feldafing to fight the Polish Jews. </sentence><sentence id="2538">In other words, there was a Greek ethnic solidarity. </sentence><sentence id="2539">It was unprecedented in a sense, solidarity against the Polish ethnic group. </sentence><sentence id="2540">Well, the end was, we reached a decision that they would have to leave. </sentence><sentence id="2541">We would find space for them in another camp. </sentence><sentence id="2542">But then began a great problem because they had established businesses. </sentence><sentence id="2543">They liked it in Feldafing, and they didn't want to leave. </sentence><sentence id="2544">And then the cry went up from them. </sentence><sentence id="2545">They had a rabbi there, by the way, a Greek Sephardic rabbi, who was a survivor himself. </sentence><sentence id="2546">He came and charged us, charged me right in my office, with doing, for the second time, what had been done to the Greek Jews, that is, a deportation. </sentence><sentence id="2547">It wasn't a deport - - but it was for dramatic effect. </sentence><sentence id="2548">And we were very sensitive to that. </sentence><sentence id="2549">We were trying to save these people. </sentence><sentence id="2550">There would have undoubtedly been a death, or something. </sentence><sentence id="2551">But you know what they did? </sentence><sentence id="2552">They were in touch with a famous Sephardic rabbi in New York -- he was a very close friend of Franklin Roosevelt, by the way. </sentence><sentence id="2553">His name was Rabbi de Sola Pool. </sentence><sentence id="2554">I think he had a big synagogue on 5th Avenue in New York. </sentence><sentence id="2555">And he sent us a message, telegram, which read "You are deporting my people." </sentence><sentence id="2556">You know, whatever, some charge. </sentence><sentence id="2557">And he came over. </sentence><sentence id="2558">He flew over. </sentence><sentence id="2559">He got permission to enter the zone. </sentence><sentence id="2560">He met with us and made the same charge. </sentence><sentence id="2561">But we explained to him what was involved here, that it was a lifesaving venture, that the Jews were not being deported. </sentence><sentence id="2562">They would have the same privileges they had in other camps. </sentence><sentence id="2563">They may not be able to run those black market operations, but their rights were being protected. </sentence><sentence id="2564">The thing settled down after a while. </sentence><sentence id="2565">Then, I think, the Greeks drifted away, and maybe the Poles were initially involved. </sentence><sentence id="2566">I don't remember how it was ultimately settled, but it was quieted down. </sentence><sentence id="2567">But that was a very strange sort of an incident for us in these camps. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2626">A: There were lots of fights, but as I say, none of them on this ethnic basis. </sentence><sentence id="2627">There would be fights about "you aced me out of this", or "you swindled me". </sentence><sentence id="2628">And we would try to settle those things ourselves, or they would settle them themselves, that is, through    a deen Torah, through a rabbinic court. </sentence><sentence id="2629">The decisions of that rabbinic court were obeyed to the letter. </sentence><sentence id="2630">And there were some very big sums of money involved, I heard. </sentence><sentence id="2631">So the black market, as I say, played a powerful -- I hear it to this very day -- a powerful role in defining the Jewish survivor community in that way. </sentence><sentence id="2632">And it was an unjust one. </sentence><sentence id="2633">I was once in a bus with a group of American officials going someplace, some meeting and somebody sitting next to me, some army officer. </sentence><sentence id="2634"> And we passed a Jewish DP camp, and we could see the big sign, a Magen David outside. </sentence><sentence id="2635">He said to me, "You know, I wouldn't go in there if my life depended on it." </sentence><sentence id="2636">I said, "Why?" </sentence><sentence id="2637">He didn't know I was Jewish. </sentence><sentence id="2638">He expressed great fear. </sentence><sentence id="2639">He had heard about the black market, you know, a bunch of cut throats, and all kinds of things. </sentence><sentence id="2640">It was so stupid. </sentence><sentence id="2641">But that attitude was very strongly held in the military. </sentence><sentence id="2642">Patton himself spoke in the most anti-Semitic terms about Jews. </sentence><sentence id="2643">Couldn't stand Jews. </sentence><sentence id="2644">Hated Jews. </sentence><sentence id="2645">Called them sub-humans, I think, at one point he is quoted. </sentence><sentence id="2646">You know, he was killed about 25 or 30 miles from Foehrenwald in an automobile accident. </sentence><sentence id="2647">I saw a documentary on Patton the other day, a couple of weeks ago, in which Eisenhower comes to his office in Germany to give him the bad news, that because of various comments he had made, you know -- Patton had organized an S.S. military unit after the war, which was unbelievable. </sentence><sentence id="2648">And these troopers, he explained, were getting ready to fight the Russians. </sentence><sentence id="2649">And of course, he retained Nazi officials in the Bavarian government. </sentence><sentence id="2650">So when it got to be too much, they ordered him transferred or downgraded, so he was appointed the commanding officer of the 15th Army or something, which was an army which only kept a history. </sentence><sentence id="2651">It had about 150 troops or something. </sentence><sentence id="2652">But Eisenhower is portrayed in this documentary, coming in to talk to Patton, to explain to him why he is being transferred. </sentence><sentence id="2653">And Patton says now one more thing, he said, "I am here by order of the president," he said, "to check into conditions in the DP camps." </sentence><sentence id="2654">And that was the time, I saw it on the film, that he had come to see us in Neu Freimann. </sentence><sentence id="2655">So it was an important visit. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2689">A: Well, anti-Semitism. </sentence><sentence id="2690">It was a stereotype of the Jew that had existed prior to World War II. </sentence><sentence id="2691">Anti-Semitism was very great. </sentence><sentence id="2692">People who study anti-Semitism in America say it reached a peak precisely at the end of World War IL, after the Nazis were destroyed. </sentence><sentence id="2693">That's when it rose here. </sentence><sentence id="2694">There was strong anti-Semitism, and the black market seemed to fit the stereotype, those notions. </sentence></p></dialogue>

" </sentence><sentence id="3170">Never say that this is your last way to go." </sentence><sentence id="3171">There were some other songs he had written, which were sung very emotionally by Jews. </sentence><sentence id="3172">And he was a Polish Jew. </sentence><sentence id="3173">And he composed that song. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3189">Q: You mentioned in passing, when you were in the theater watching Bernstein, and you would be in a room packed with people, because of the lack of soap, it smelled. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3193">Q: What were the sanitation conditions in the camp? </sentence><sentence id="3194">What were the toilet facilities -- </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3197">A: It depended on the camp. </sentence><sentence id="3198">In the beginning, when casernes -- caserne is a military building. </sentence><sentence id="3199">F/unt caserne, loch caserne, various places where soldiers were housed. </sentence><sentence id="3200"> It was very bad. </sentence><sentence id="3201">I mean the conditions were very bad. </sentence><sentence id="3202">There were no sinks. </sentence><sentence id="3203">There were these troughs which they used. </sentence><sentence id="3204">There was no private housing, you know, primitive. </sentence><sentence id="3205">As time went on, things began to change. </sentence><sentence id="3206">Neu Freimann came in. </sentence><sentence id="3207">These were houses, and you had sinks. </sentence><sentence id="3208">We distributed soap. </sentence><sentence id="3209">We distributed sanitary materials, toilet paper, towels, and things of that sort. </sentence><sentence id="3210">Otherwise, people had to go out and organize it for themselves if they needed something. </sentence><sentence id="3211">But they worked out their own way. </sentence><sentence id="3212">In places where there was community housing, people used basins. </sentence><sentence id="3213">They would go to a place. </sentence><sentence id="3214">It was worked out. </sentence><sentence id="3215">It was very difficult, but it was worked out. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3235">Q: Were sanitary napkins brought in for women? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3237">A: Yes, we had sanitary napkins for women. </sentence><sentence id="3238">We had all of that. </sentence><sentence id="3239">It was a massive job of organization, of distributing the meats, you know, which were cut. </sentence><sentence id="3240">We had to weigh them up, as we gave them out in a community kitchen, you would cook up a big bowl of meat, or whatever. </sentence><sentence id="3241">But in a home where people were cooking by themselves, it had to be weighed out. </sentence><sentence id="3242">We tried to be as equitable as possible. </sentence><sentence id="3243">We had hospitals. </sentence><sentence id="3244">In Foehrenwald, there was a good size hospital which contained operating rooms, and I think about 60 beds. </sentence><sentence id="3245">It had been used by the Germans for the troops who were living in those casernes. </sentence><sentence id="3246">We found out later on that the equipment, including a pretty well- equipped surgical suite with the beds and the lights on top, was taken by the Germans, as they were wont to do, from the Romanians, who were their sort of partial allies. </sentence><sentence id="3247">The Germans just packed up this hospital from Romania and just shipped it right off to Germany. </sentence><sentence id="3248">Now, we were using that hospital. </sentence><sentence id="3249">It was very, very important to us. </sentence><sentence id="3250">We had people operating in there. </sentence><sentence id="3251">We had all of the equipment, surgical tools, and all of the rest, pretty well-equipped. </sentence><sentence id="3252">One day, I got a letter from General Clarence Huebner, who was by then the commandant of the American zone, I think. </sentence><sentence id="3253">The letter said that the hospital is going to be returned, as of such and such a date, to the Romanian government, and that the United States had agreed that this hospital, which had been taken by the Germans, would now be returned. </sentence><sentence id="3254">Well, I was stunned. </sentence><sentence id="3255">The doctors came and saw me, and we discussed what to do. </sentence><sentence id="3256">So I went down to Frankfurt to see Huebner. </sentence><sentence id="3257">I am trying to remember where he was. </sentence><sentence id="3258">By the way, he ended up, ultimately, as the Director of Civil Defense for the State of New York. </sentence><sentence id="3259">He was a decent man. </sentence><sentence id="3260">I said to him, you know, "These are people who have all sorts of illnesses and problems which they received as a result of the years in the concentration camps and the years of their treatment, and if you take it away, people are going to die." </sentence><sentence id="3261">He said he agreed. </sentence><sentence id="3262">He said, "I am going to appeal this decision." </sentence><sentence id="3263">And we won it. </sentence><sentence id="3264">We kept the hospital. </sentence><sentence id="3265">There was also a railroad, a trunk line going into Foehrenwald, and we shipped foodstuffs, coal, wood, and other supplies on it. </sentence><sentence id="3266">A locomotive and two or three freight cars ran along the short line, about two miles. </sentence><sentence id="3267">And they wanted that back, too. </sentence><sentence id="3268">That also came from Romania. </sentence><sentence id="3269">And we beat them on that one, too. </sentence><sentence id="3270">Because if they had done that, if we didn't have that short spur, I don't know how we would have gotten tons of potatoes and fuel and other stuff into the camp. </sentence><sentence id="3271">All kinds of problems. </sentence><sentence id="3272">Germans said we were holding their stuff, and we had to fight them. </sentence><sentence id="3273">We had all kinds of difficulties. </sentence><sentence id="3274">Now the Israelis came, people checking on immigration to Palestine. </sentence><sentence id="3275">Dentists came to check the teeth of people going to Palestine because they did not want to have an enormous dental burden at the time that the state was being established. </sentence><sentence id="3276">And they had all kinds of problems. </sentence><sentence id="3277">So we had a dental clinic, which was equipped by the military. </sentence><sentence id="3278">They gave us about 15 or so chairs, which were run, not by electricity, but by a foot pedal. </sentence><sentence id="3279">And we had 15 or so dentists, zahnarzt in there, doing dental work. </sentence><sentence id="3280"> But now something interesting happened. </sentence><sentence id="3281">Some of these dentists had been in the Soviet Union during the war. </sentence><sentence id="3282">And they'd learned the Soviet system. </sentence><sentence id="3283">So what would happen was, a Jew would come in a DP and he'd get free dental care. </sentence><sentence id="3284">He would present himself and the dentist would say "Look, my friend, I can't take you now. </sentence><sentence id="3285">It's very busy. </sentence><sentence id="3286">It will be about a month. </sentence><sentence id="3287">Come back." </sentence><sentence id="3288">And this guy has a toothache. </sentence><sentence id="3289">He says, ""I can't come back in a month." </sentence><sentence id="3290">So then the dentist would say -- and this is exactly a duplicate of Soviet system corruption in plumbing or anything -- "Look, I will tell you what. </sentence><sentence id="3291">If you want fast service, you come to my house. </sentence><sentence id="3292">I have a dental chair and I will take you right away." </sentence><sentence id="3293">You understand there was a competition between UNRRA and this guy's private interests. </sentence><sentence id="3294">And I can't tell you what happened, what used to happen. </sentence><sentence id="3295">Then they were competing among themselves for the business, and they were doing things to patients of other people. </sentence><sentence id="3296">We had a big scandal. </sentence><sentence id="3297">I am not going to tell you all, because it is too horrible to remember. </sentence><sentence id="3298">But we had to reform that. </sentence><sentence id="3299">We had to kick some people out. </sentence><sentence id="3300">It was "Nellie Bar the Door." </sentence><sentence id="3301">But imagine, altogether, we did get out. </sentence><sentence id="3302">When Gehretzreid was open, this Israeli departure center we had, suddenly thousands of people began to show up from all over, Jews, to be processed. </sentence><sentence id="3303"> We had a dental problem of enormous proportions in this place, Gehretzreid. </sentence><sentence id="3304">But as I say, everything, I guess, seemed to work. </sentence><sentence id="3305">Sometimes you turned your head away. </sentence><sentence id="3306">I don't want to hear about it. </sentence><sentence id="3307">And when you turn back, it was gone. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3381">Q: Were a lot of the dental problems a function of the -- </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3383">A: Of the war. </sentence><sentence id="3384">Lack of diet and the rest. </sentence><sentence id="3385">You see people with occluded, badly occluded, teeth falling out, rotting gums, and all of the rest. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3389">Q: And you actually had facilities to give people dentures? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3391">A: Oh, yeah. </sentence><sentence id="3392">I forgot to mention, the chairs and some of the instrumentation came from the army. </sentence><sentence id="3393">But teeth and drugs and other things came from the JDC. </sentence><sentence id="3394">They did a fantastic job. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3399">Q: What other effects, physical effects did you see? </sentence><sentence id="3400">Were there people with -- I don't know -- broken legs? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3403">A: We had all of that. </sentence><sentence id="3404">One of the most visible effects was the distended stomachs. </sentence><sentence id="3405">Women, you could see a lot on women. </sentence><sentence id="3406">I don't know whether it occurs more on women than on men, but I don't know what produces that but when you are underfed for a long time, children, babies you see that. </sentence><sentence id="3407">You have distention of the stomachs. </sentence><sentence id="3408">I remember there was a Hungarian woman, who was a clerk, a brilliant, intellectual woman. </sentence><sentence id="3409">I sent her to the United States. </sentence><sentence id="3410">And she was to marry a guy from her town who was a doctor here. </sentence><sentence id="3411">When I came over, I met them. </sentence><sentence id="3412">And he met me, took me aside. </sentence><sentence id="3413">And he said, "Look at her stomach." </sentence><sentence id="3414">He spoke about her distention. </sentence><sentence id="3415">I don't know. </sentence><sentence id="3416">Eventually, she ended up in the New York Public Library as the curator of the Hungarian collection -- they have a big Hungarian collection. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3431">Q: How long did you see the effects? </sentence><sentence id="3432">The physical kind of -- </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3435">A: I don't know. </sentence><sentence id="3436">I think I saw them all of the time. </sentence><sentence id="3437">They always looked bad to me. </sentence><sentence id="3438">I could tell. </sentence><sentence id="3439">Until they really came over here and stayed here for a couple of years, I could see, I could just look, pass somebody in the street, and say that's a Jewish DP. </sentence><sentence id="3440">There was something about them physically. </sentence><sentence id="3441">Of course, they had scars of various sorts, the numbers and -- it's tough. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3449">Q: What about education? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3451">A: Now -- yeah, education. </sentence><sentence id="3452">There was adult education. </sentence><sentence id="3453">And there was ORT, trade schools, fachshul. </sentence><sentence id="3454">We had a problem getting, especially men, not the women, men into these trades schools. </sentence><sentence id="3455">I don't know, they were not interested. </sentence><sentence id="3456">They didn't see their future as working as watchmakers or tooth technicians. </sentence><sentence id="3457">We had to convince them by giving them Joint packages. </sentence><sentence id="3458"> Not we, the ORT did. </sentence><sentence id="3459">Rabbi Max Braude, who had been a chaplain in the military, did some work with DPs. </sentence><sentence id="3460">And when he came back here, he was named World ORT Director. </sentence><sentence id="3461">Anyway, they had to give them special inducements which were packages, a supplementary packet, to get them into these schools. </sentence><sentence id="3462">This happened while Eisenhower was there, and looked in at a school. </sentence><sentence id="3463">We took him to another school and a guy had gone to two schools, he got two packages, and he really didn't attend either one. </sentence><sentence id="3464">We had a problem with that. </sentence><sentence id="3465">That was one of the unattractive things. </sentence><sentence id="3466">I remember, Jews were very good working in places where they had some authority. </sentence><sentence id="3467">They were clerks, assigning people to houses, or doing whatever. </sentence><sentence id="3468">But when it came to some of the physical things, stacking wood, clearing away garbage, forget it. </sentence><sentence id="3469"> We could not get any volunteers. </sentence><sentence id="3470">So one day, a group of American Jews came through one of the camps, and they passed by. </sentence><sentence id="3471">They saw it looked like maybe a ghetto, you know. </sentence><sentence id="3472">A guy sitting in the sun smoking cigarettes, and nearby a German is working, cleaning up the street. </sentence><sentence id="3473">So the American, applying his standards, called the guy over and said in Yiddish, "Why aren't you working? </sentence><sentence id="3474">This is your town, this is where you live. </sentence><sentence id="3475">Why aren't you cleaning up?" </sentence><sentence id="3476">The man replied, "I worked for them for five years. </sentence><sentence id="3477">Now they will work for me." </sentence><sentence id="3478">That's what he said. </sentence><sentence id="3479">I don't know whether it was a rationalization, but, you know, that kind of work is not attractive. </sentence><sentence id="3480">We see it in Israel today. </sentence><sentence id="3481">Even Russians who come, or even the Jews who came, they don't clean up. </sentence><sentence id="3482">The Palestinians, Arabs were cleaning up. </sentence><sentence id="3483">And that is still happening today. </sentence><sentence id="3484">And we had a problem. </sentence><sentence id="3485">We were trying to convince the people because it is an American tradition that you work in your own community. </sentence><sentence id="3486">It's your wood. </sentence><sentence id="3487">We had a lot of vandalism, for example, within the houses. </sentence><sentence id="3488">And it was irresponsible, sometimes done in anger. </sentence><sentence id="3489">They would tear banisters off the steps. </sentence><sentence id="3490">Now, the houses were German-owned, and they were saying, "To hell with them." </sentence><sentence id="3491">But they didn't realize that other Jews, when they left, had to come in there. </sentence><sentence id="3492">And then, ultimately, Uncle Sam picked up the bill. </sentence><sentence id="3493">All these places were brought back spanking new by the United States. </sentence><sentence id="3494">They had that commitment. </sentence><sentence id="3495">That included the house I lived in, by the way. </sentence><sentence id="3496">We would have some wild parties there, and they would tear down pictures from the wall and everything else. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3543">Q: You lived in a villa? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3545">A: I lived in a big house, yeah, big villa. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3557">Q: Did they teach languages there? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3559">A: Oh, yeah. </sentence><sentence id="3560">Now most were English classes, given by people who spoke English. </sentence><sentence id="3561">They were very good and very useful. </sentence><sentence id="3562">There was elementary school education for small children. </sentence><sentence id="3563">Schools were organized and they were quite good. </sentence><sentence id="3564">And there was confusion as to what language -- should they learn Hebrew? </sentence><sentence id="3565">Where were you going? </sentence><sentence id="3566">If you're going to Palestine, you had to learn some Hebrew. </sentence><sentence id="3567">If you were going to America, you learned English. </sentence><sentence id="3568">But they were very assiduous. </sentence><sentence id="3569">We suffered shortages of supplies, mainly, but we made do. </sentence><sentence id="3570">In Foehrenwald, I have to talk about, there were streets. </sentence><sentence id="3571">All of the streets were named after Nazis when the camp was taken. </sentence><sentence id="3572">You had Adolph Hitler Platz, Goebbels Strasse, Goering Strasse. </sentence><sentence id="3573">And of course, no Jew is going to say he lives on Goering Strasse or on Adolph Hitler Platz. </sentence><sentence id="3574">So they tore all these signs down, and they named these streets after American states. </sentence><sentence id="3575">And that was constantly a source of humor. " </sentence><sentence id="3576">Vu voynt er? </sentence><sentence id="3577">Where do you live? </sentence><sentence id="3578">On the Michiganiga Gass. </sentence><sentence id="3579">They added a syllable, so Michigan became Michiganiga. " </sentence><sentence id="3580">Ich voyn oyf dem kantuzki" because the "C" in Polish is a sibilant like an "S." That's the way they named their streets. </sentence><sentence id="3581">It was so funny. </sentence><sentence id="3582">It was very serious. </sentence><sentence id="3583">An American would come in and ask him where do you live, he would say Ochyo. </sentence><sentence id="3584">What? </sentence><sentence id="3585">Ochyo -- Ohio. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3613">Q: Ok, let's cut the tape. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3615">A: Well, I want to say a few words about the meaning, the significance for the Jewish community, for Jewish history, of the whole DP experience. </sentence><sentence id="3616">We are commanded to communicate to the world what it is Jews experienced during this period of the Holocaust. </sentence><sentence id="3617">And the principal vehicle for that is the DP survivor community. </sentence><sentence id="3618">Both those survivors who survived the horrors, and they are a smaller number of the concentration camps and the extermination camps, and those who survived by fleeing into the woods, or fighting in the Soviet army, or living as refugees within the Soviet Union. </sentence><sentence id="3619">Without them, the world would not know anything at all about these experiences. </sentence><sentence id="3620">So I think, to the degree that we are commanded to tell the story and retell it to generations which follow us, they serve this vital purpose. </sentence><sentence id="3621">They are also an indication of the vitality, the will to life, and to survival of the Jewish community, both the survivors and the rest of us, who face formidable challenges to our survival. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="3622">These people were so grimly determined. </sentence><sentence id="3623">It used to seem to me that if I had children, I would say to them maybe I don't want them to be Jewish. </sentence><sentence id="3624">Who needs that kind of threat hanging over our lives? </sentence><sentence id="3625">Yet, these people produced children, recreated their </sentence></p><p><sentence id="3626"> families. </sentence><sentence id="3627">We could not provide the beds, to birth these children that they needed. </sentence><sentence id="3628">A great will, a great desire, even to be found in the so-called black market, to provide the means for survival and the means to support whatever families they would create. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="3629">They were really the phoenix rising out of the ashes of European Jewry. </sentence><sentence id="3630">And they have gone on to produce great things, both here and in Israel. </sentence><sentence id="3631">All over the United States, I know Jews who are survivors and are wonderfully contributing members of society. </sentence><sentence id="3632">There is so much talk about immigrants coming in, and the threats which are posed by immigrants to the American economy and the American people. </sentence><sentence id="3633">The Jews of Europe who came here did nothing but produce life and energy and things that we need in order to maintain the richness of our society. </sentence><sentence id="3634">So it's an important thing. </sentence><sentence id="3635">We have to be truly thankful to these people and understanding of who they were, what motivated them, and the dangers which they lived through. </sentence><sentence id="3636">Even after the Holocaust appeared to have ended came this period. </sentence><sentence id="3637">We know so much about the sufferings, but now we ought to know more about the work which they did, the sacrifices which they have made. </sentence><sentence id="3638">Do you agree with me? </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3639">A: That was very well put. </sentence><sentence id="3640">End of Tape #3 End of Interview    </sentence></p></dialogue>
