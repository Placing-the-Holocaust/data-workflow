<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="640">A: No, it wa -- first of all, it was fear, not just for the baby's survival, but for the adults" survival, what would happen with a pogrom, with the killings, that we have to go into hiding. </sentence><sentence id="641">So we already knew that he might not sur -- I mean, we knew that we were all in major danger, so I think, now that you mention it, that was probably one of the reason that we moved from building number one to building number two, because    Interview with Feiga Hollenberg Connors 25 October 8, 2010 there was a little bit more liberty, or people didn't say we won't allow the baby in the -- in the bunker. </sentence><sentence id="642">Because every building had a bunker, and in building number one, the bunker was between the two houses, so it was a wall was walled off, and we'd crawl into a s-- into a small place to get into th -- this wall. </sentence><sentence id="643">And in building number two, the one that we moved, the bunker was in the cellar. </sentence><sentence id="644">So when the killing began, everybody went into the -- to the building, that was during the Purim massacre, and -- and they didn't allow the baby to come in with us. </sentence><sentence id="645">He was, by then, four or five weeks old, he was still tiny. </sentence><sentence id="646">And you know -- and I know he was tiny in -- in the recollection of what he did, he was just lying there, he cou -- you know, he couldn't even smile yet. </sentence><sentence id="647">So he was very tiny. </sentence><sentence id="648">And so we all went into -- into the bunker in the cellar, and we couldn't bring the baby, so we left the baby on a big bed, surrounded with pillows. </sentence><sentence id="649">And my mom was crying and they kept holding her down. </sentence><sentence id="650">And we stayed there, I don't remember how long, but we stayed there til it was almost dark, you know, from the morning. </sentence><sentence id="651">And when we got upstairs we found the baby dead. </sentence><sentence id="652">But not just this, the baby's cries were so loud, that the baby jeopardized the people next door, who were hiding in that compartment in between the walls, between one wall and another. </sentence><sentence id="653">So here were the people, here were the two -- you know, and the cry from this bed -- from this room to the -- the police, it -- this was not -- this massacre wasn't a German massacre, it was the Ukraine police and the German and the Poles that did it. </sentence><sentence id="654">So it   Interview with Feiga Hollenberg Connors 26 October 8, 2010 wasn't primarily the German Gestapo like when they cleaned out Korolewka, like in the first pogrom. </sentence><sentence id="655">So this was a kind of cobr -- co-cooperation with everybody. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="682">A: That -- everything was -- that was in Borschev in the ghetto, a--a few weeks after -- after the -- the massacre. </sentence><sentence id="683">But -- so, to finish the story with that -- with that massacre o- on y -- on Purim, after it was over, we went upstairs and we saw the baby dead. </sentence><sentence id="684">And the next day, or maybe it was even the same day, there was a cart with a horse, and would drive by each building and people would put their dead on this cart. </sentence><sentence id="685">And my mother was so upset and crying that I took the baby, she gave me the baby, or I took the baby -- anyways, I took the baby out and put the baby wrapped up in a blanket, on the cart. </sentence><sentence id="686">So I don't even know where the baby was buried. </sentence></p></dialogue>
