<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1158">Q: So the war had ended? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1160">A: The war had ended by then, and we had lots of transport available and these -- the need for getting those people out of there as fast as possible, was great. </sentence><sentence id="1161">So -- </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1170">A: We knew we -- by that time there was a lot of information out. </sentence><sentence id="1171">And so -- I mean, months and months earlier we knew about it. </sentence><sentence id="1172">And -- and that was, of course, one of the great reasons that -- and I'm sure that it was on everyone's mind that if--if we don't k -- if we don't knock the head off that monster, that these people, there will be nobody left. </sentence><sentence id="1173">So we were aware of it, and we were very shocked by it. </sentence><sentence id="1174">Of course, we were very shocked by it, way before June. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1195">Q: Oh my goodness. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1197">A: And then the -- the trenches were f--- full of nice small birch trees, beautiful birch trees, and I got some pictures that eventually the museum will get. </sentence><sentence id="1198">And there's a picture of a 88" and everything, made out of birch. </sentence><sentence id="1199">Kind of a big entrance-like to our -- our -- our Amiens base. </sentence><sentence id="1200">So that -- that's where we took off from, and the idea was to be closer to carrying troo -- gasoline with the various tanks and so forth. </sentence><sentence id="1201">Patton went so fast that the -- his big express that they had designed to keep gasoline flowing to him, just couldn't -- couldn't keep up, and he was being slowed down, and they got together and just a day or two later they come up with the idea of flying them in by troop carrier and flying out the wounded. </sentence></p></dialogue>
