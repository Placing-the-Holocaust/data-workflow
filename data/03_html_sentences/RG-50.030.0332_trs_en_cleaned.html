<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="662">Q: What happened? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="664">A: What happened is normally my mother used to give us packages, not with food, but she used to give us let's say a piece of material that you can make a dress or pair of pants whatever it is and a piece of leather which the farmers don't have it. </sentence><sentence id="665">Do you know what I'm talking?Therefore, in case there's a shooting and we have to run or split, you know, at least for that they'll give you a piece of bread, some butter, or some milk. </sentence><sentence id="666">Something. </sentence><sentence id="667">You'll have something to eat. </sentence><sentence id="668">And everytime there was an the alarm, you used to take this little package and I started running and it was like a false alarm. </sentence><sentence id="669">You know what I'm talking? </sentence><sentence id="670">The day that was really important because that was the day that no Jews allowed to be living in the town so they're going to make Judenrein. </sentence><sentence id="671">So how can you live there? </sentence><sentence id="672">You can't. </sentence><sentence id="673">So of course that morning I didn't take nothing. </sentence><sentence id="674">What I had on me, this is it. </sentence><sentence id="675">Everybody. </sentence><sentence id="676">So, my brother, he lives in Northbrook, in Illinois, he was with me. </sentence><sentence id="677">My mother, father and youngest brother were running one way. </sentence><sentence id="678">Me and this brother were running. </sentence><sentence id="679">I don't know where we were running but we were running and two houses from us was my uncle. </sentence><sentence id="680">That's my uncle that's the uncle that makes my shoes, you know. </sentence><sentence id="681">So, my mother went the other way and then she remember half way running to the hideout, she forgot, she better go back home and get a loaf of bread. </sentence><sentence id="682">She just baked fresh bread in case you have to sit a day or two so you have something. </sentence><sentence id="683">By the time she got to the house she couldn't go back. </sentence><sentence id="684">So, my father and my little brother, the youngest one, they were hiding in an attic somewhere with another few couples and after two nights I think, they ran away to the forest because the town was a lot of forest. </sentence><sentence id="685">As soon as you walk out of the city there were forests. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="709">Q: You were saying your brothers ran out, the city was surrounded by forest? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="711">A: And a lot of people are from farmers, from the little towns, the little villages, you know, where they got married in our town to somebody or vice a versa. </sentence><sentence id="712">So in other words, they knew the vicinity very well. </sentence><sentence id="713">So, my father, my brother and this guy and a few more, they went to the forest. </sentence><sentence id="714">I was sitting with my brother knowing what my uncle did last time when they were killing us that he spared his wife and kids and everybody, you know. </sentence><sentence id="715">So I don't know, something told me I should go there. </sentence><sentence id="716">I went there with my brother and they also had a hideout, you know, down and we were hiding there. </sentence><sentence id="717">We were sitting. </sentence><sentence id="718">The first day was very quiet except they came in -- the Germans used to come in with a ball,a round ball, you understand, and we didn't have carpet so they used to take the ball and roll it over the floor. </sentence><sentence id="719">You see, if you dug something underneath it would settle, do you know what I'm talking?So, the ball would have to stop. </sentence><sentence id="720">So it means that underneath there is somebody. </sentence><sentence id="721">You understand? </sentence><sentence id="722">Do you understand what I'm saying? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="736">Q: Sort of. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="738">A: On a straight floor when you throw a ball, okay, it runs until it stops by itself, you know. </sentence><sentence id="739">But here is not the case. </sentence><sentence id="740">You see if they dug underneath the dirt settled let the floor down. </sentence><sentence id="741">You know what I'm talking? </sentence><sentence id="742">Okay. </sentence><sentence id="743">So, it makes just like a dent, it's lower, the floor. </sentence><sentence id="744">So they put the ball and it stops in the middle of somewhere they figure they better check, you know. </sentence><sentence id="745">Anyway, things got..., everything was fine. </sentence><sentence id="746">Then my aunt she was the aunt, my mother's sister, her kids, four of them. </sentence><sentence id="747">They had two boys and two girls. </sentence><sentence id="748">We were all sitting. </sentence><sentence id="749">My uncle's sister, with the children, maybe ten people, or whatever, and my uncle comes back because the zungenfuhrer (ph) asks him, "Where is your wife and kids?" </sentence><sentence id="750">He says, "I don't know. </sentence><sentence id="751">I better go looking." </sentence><sentence id="752">And he told them he's going to try to spare them too this time. </sentence><sentence id="753">So they told me, he come to us at night and took his wife out and the kids and he says that the zungenfuhrer (ph) said he's going to let you live and he told us there's going to be Judenrein, no Jews, you better go away from here. </sentence><sentence id="754">Go somewhere else. </sentence><sentence id="755">So anyway the following day we heard that my aunt and the kids got killed. </sentence><sentence id="756">They killed them right away. </sentence><sentence id="757">They only let live my uncle and the son. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="778">Q: How did you hear these things. </sentence><sentence id="779">I'm trying to get a sense of what it was like. </sentence><sentence id="780">You said, "we heard this." </sentence><sentence id="781">You said the following day "we heard that my aunt was killed." </sentence><sentence id="782">How did you get this information? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="788">A: He came back. </sentence><sentence id="789">My uncle came back the following night and said they killed everybody except his son and he said we should better get out and that there was a little town that they had still our ghetto. </sentence><sentence id="790">So, this is what we did the night he came telling us. </sentence><sentence id="791">We ran away, I mean I ran away. </sentence><sentence id="792">We walked all night and during the day we went somewhere. </sentence><sentence id="793">I don't even know, on a farm, in an attic where they had the pigs and the cows whatever. </sentence><sentence id="794">We saw the Germans from far but you know your heart is in your mouth and you hope you survive. </sentence><sentence id="795">So, of course after the night, after the day got dark a little bit and we went walking to that little town with the ghetto. </sentence><sentence id="796">So, we came to the ghetto. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="807">Q: What was the name of the town, Sonia? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="809">A: Dworitz (ph). </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="811">Q: One other question. </sentence><sentence id="812">When you left your ghetto, was it easy to get out that night? </sentence><sentence id="813">Were there guards or were you just able to walk out? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="817">A: You could walk out, yes, because between shooting and killing so many people there was no more ghetto. </sentence><sentence id="818">So, they used to put x amount of people, I don't know the amount, we had a movie house and they stuffed them into the movie house and from there they used to take them to the graves. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="821">Q: So, you got out, you slept in a barn or something that night and the next day you continued to the other town? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="823">A: The evening. </sentence><sentence id="824">You couldn't walk during the day. </sentence><sentence id="825">Let's say if it was in the summer time, which it was, or in the winter time when the days are longer or shorter so by evening most of us knew how to go to these small towns because they were not, maybe they were ten miles all together. </sentence><sentence id="826">You understand. </sentence><sentence id="827">So, leaving there was no problem to go into a little town and know how to get in there, you know. </sentence><sentence id="828">So, this is what we did. </sentence><sentence id="829">We came there in the morning and all the people. </sentence><sentence id="830">My brother was also the same place in the market place but he was also making shoes so they let him out. </sentence><sentence id="831">I mean not they let him out, they took all the people, all the workers, what they need, and they send them over to another working... It's like, a camp and the rest whoever did not make it they cut out with them. </sentence><sentence id="832">Some of them stayed in the hideout for four or five days because they had enough food. </sentence><sentence id="833">And then the Germans sooner or later the Germans got them. </sentence><sentence id="834">So, the people that ran away to the forest which most of them are alive, and those that didn't, that was the end of it. </sentence><sentence id="835">So, when I came to Dworitz (ph), I found my cousin there that he came also from another town. </sentence><sentence id="836">My brother was in that working camp about 30 kilometers. </sentence><sentence id="837">And my younger brother, he was there too. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="853">Q: In the town or the working camp? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="855">A: In the working camp, not in town. </sentence><sentence id="856">So, I don't know how long it was, they went to the forest. </sentence><sentence id="857">I haven't seen him yet. </sentence><sentence id="858">I just had my younger brother with me. </sentence><sentence id="859">My father survived with the little brother and they came also in the forest. </sentence><sentence id="860">So, one of the guys heard that his sons are alive also in the same place where I was and he was also from a farm town so he knew exactly how to come. </sentence><sentence id="861">So, he came and took maybe ten of us, so he took me, and my brother, he took his kids. </sentence><sentence id="862">They were there too, in that Dworitz, that I'm calling that little town, and we went to the forest. </sentence><sentence id="863">Then I came to the forest I found my father, my three brothers and one Thad with me, is four, you know, and what can I tell you? </sentence><sentence id="864">It was another time of life. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="875">Q: Let me just stop you. </sentence><sentence id="876">So, the forests were near by and this was early summer of "42? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="879">A: Yes, right. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="881">Q: When you got to the forest, were there a lot of people, what was going on? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="883">A: Well, it wasn't like a huge place you come in. </sentence><sentence id="884">No, forget it. </sentence><sentence id="885">He took us and he brought us where his wife and children are, okay, and he let us stay there. </sentence><sentence id="886">You stayed underneath the, the, the sky. </sentence><sentence id="887">I mean, what? </sentence><sentence id="888">You got a home there? </sentence><sentence id="889">So, anyway, we came with what we had. </sentence><sentence id="890">We used to make a fire at night to make something to eat because during the day we couldn't make it in case the smoke from the fire the Germans will catch on to, you know. </sentence><sentence id="891">So, actually the nights was ours. </sentence><sentence id="892">We were not afraid for the nights because the Germans didn't want to go in the woods in our territory because to them it's strange. </sentence><sentence id="893">You see? </sentence><sentence id="894">So, at night and of course the winter came, we used to make a fire. </sentence><sentence id="895">I slept in my coat and I woke up in the morning and they were burned out, you know. </sentence><sentence id="896">And what can I tell you? </sentence><sentence id="897">That's all we had. </sentence><sentence id="898">The following winter I think we made a tent, you know, like the army, I suppose, and that's what we slept. </sentence><sentence id="899">We didn't have anything, nothing. </sentence><sentence id="900">We became like this and that's it. </sentence><sentence id="901">So, the second year we were there and the Germans again started to kill us and made it again the same thing, a killing. </sentence><sentence id="902">They used to come and whoever they caught they caught. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="923">Q: In the forest? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="925">A: In the forest, that's right. </sentence><sentence id="926">So, they caught my youngest brother. </sentence><sentence id="927">He was eight years old. </sentence><sentence id="928">And what they didn't do to him. </sentence><sentence id="929">And then they killed him. </sentence><sentence id="930">You know, they cut you up and they mutilate you and then they kill you. </sentence><sentence id="931">So, we ran away, we ran away from that place to another place. </sentence><sentence id="932">In other words, we could move around in the forest but you still have to-- if there is a big highway, it's a no no because you don't know who's driving and who's going by, you know. </sentence><sentence id="933">So, we learned how to go this way or that way and we didn't have a compass or nothing. </sentence><sentence id="934">Compass. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="945">Q: When they killed your brother, did they make you watch it or did you just hear about it? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="947">A: They took him away. </sentence><sentence id="948">Where are you going to go looking for him? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="951">Q: You just learned later what happened? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="953">A: Yes, yes. </sentence><sentence id="954">The Gentiles were there. </sentence><sentence id="955">The people there they tell us what they did with him and that was it. </sentence><sentence id="956">So, he got killed. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="961">Q: How many, I'm just trying to get a sense of how many people were in your group at this point? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="963">A: There was no such a thing as groups. </sentence><sentence id="964">The partisans they were organized just like my brothers. </sentence><sentence id="965">The younger one -- both of them did but the younger one did by himself, he went back to the walking log(?), </sentence><sentence id="966">what's another name, and he and another boy they dug under the barbed wire and he already knew because he was there. </sentence><sentence id="967">He ran away from there and he dug it and he came in and he talked to an uncle of ours, they wanted winter boots. </sentence><sentence id="968">He was there with his son, you know, and he took up maybe 25 guys and he came back to the forest with them and went another time and took out my uncle, this one. </sentence><sentence id="969">The first time he took the son, and the second time he took the uncle and more people and they came to the forest. </sentence><sentence id="970">So, you see the people that were the partisans, they organized. </sentence><sentence id="971">We had nothing to do with them and they had nothing to do with us. </sentence><sentence id="972">So in other words if you take here families, ten families, one was living in this corner somewhere, the other one was living somewhere else. </sentence><sentence id="973">You didn't pay rent. </sentence><sentence id="974">You can move around. </sentence><sentence id="975">Nobody told you not to move around. </sentence><sentence id="976">You know, so we managed. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="991">Q: How many were with you? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="993">A: Well, in the beginning maybe three families, that's all. </sentence><sentence id="994">When I say families it could be two people out of the family, because the other ones they killed. </sentence><sentence id="995">You know what I'm talking? </sentence><sentence id="996">It depends who survived. </sentence><sentence id="997">Sometimes let's say you hear about, oh your sister is..., somebody told me that your sister is in this and this place. </sentence><sentence id="998">You know. </sentence><sentence id="999">They would pick themselves up, they had nothing anyway, and they would go there. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1007">Q: So, from time to time maybe another family would join you or someone would leave? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1009">A: Yes, that's right, but we had nothing to do with the partisans. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1011">Q: Now, how did you get whatever you needed like food or supplies? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1013">A: I'll tell you. </sentence><sentence id="1014">We used to go at night to the farmers to beg. </sentence><sentence id="1015">My brother went, I went all of us went wherever we wanted to eat. </sentence><sentence id="1016">So, we used to go in different places and some of them used to give us something and this is how we survived. </sentence><sentence id="1017">Of course in the forest we had cranberries, blueberries, boysenberries, you know that grows in forests, so we used to go-- mushrooms--we used to go and pick them and we had something to eat. </sentence><sentence id="1018">Bread we used to get sometimes from the farmers. </sentence><sentence id="1019">What can I tell you? </sentence><sentence id="1020">We didn't have an oven, we didn't have nothing only the fire, you know, to make a fire that's all we had. </sentence><sentence id="1021">Nothing else. </sentence><sentence id="1022">Water, we used to dig a little hole and dig deep enough until the water comes up. </sentence><sentence id="1023">When it came up we used to take it out and take a handkerchief and push it through, you know what I'm talking, the dirt because otherwise you're going to drink dirt. </sentence><sentence id="1024">This is how we had water. </sentence><sentence id="1025">We didn't starve to death. </sentence><sentence id="1026">Nobody starved in the forest, but we didn't have enough to eat, but we survived. </sentence><sentence id="1027">It was enough. </sentence><sentence id="1028">We used to go to the forest there, the outside and see potatoes so we used to take them out from the ground. </sentence><sentence id="1029">Sometimes we used to bake them by the fire. </sentence><sentence id="1030">Sometimes we ate them raw, potatoes. </sentence><sentence id="1031">We didn't have salt. </sentence><sentence id="1032">So we didn't, okay. </sentence><sentence id="1033">But we did survive, you see. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1056">Q: How did you know which farmers to trust? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1058">A: We didn't. </sentence><sentence id="1059">The only thing is if the farmers knew if they're going to give out a Jew to the Germans, especially on the forest, the next day the partisan will be there and going to put them, let them in the house, let them stay, take all the cattle and burn up the cows with them together. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1062">Q: But you weren't working with the partisans? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1064">A: The only -- my connection with the partisans is because my two brothers were fighting. </sentence><sentence id="1065">My father had two brothers they were there fighting. </sentence><sentence id="1066">My other uncle his son -- like I said it was a small little town so there was somebody that I went to school with, you know what I'm talking. </sentence><sentence id="1067">So when | used to go sometimes if they stayed close to us sometimes, you know, but if it's far we didn't, we couldn't go, so they used to give us food. </sentence><sentence id="1068">But the majority we had to go ourselves at night. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1074">Q: Were you ever, well, you found out sometimes where the people you knew in the partisans were sort of a word of mouth in the area? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1076">A: Sometimes we knew, not all the time and we wouldn't go risking our lives to go where they're at. </sentence><sentence id="1077">Let's say if it's within a few miles we'll go to see them, but anything further or maybe I don't know we wouldn't go. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1080">Q: But you might come across other people who would say to you I ran into your cousin? </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1616">A: Oh, they came, they came to see us yes, in the beginning. </sentence><sentence id="1617">See, we were inexperienced how to live there and what to do there, you know what I'm talking. </sentence><sentence id="1618">To us, it was new. </sentence><sentence id="1619">Well, how do you know how to, what to do and when to do. </sentence><sentence id="1620">So in the beginning, yes they would. </sentence><sentence id="1621">But later on they didn't. </sentence><sentence id="1622">They send those other ones, the Ukraines and the Lithuanians to do the dirty work. </sentence><sentence id="1623">Oh, yes, we had it. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1632">Q: So as time went on this got easier or you learned how to live there better? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1634">A: No, the same thing, the same thing. </sentence><sentence id="1635">Like I said we didn't think there was any Jews outside of the forest because they made every city Judenrein, no Jews, so where are they? </sentence><sentence id="1636">We didn't know the concentration camps that they are alive or whatever it is. </sentence><sentence id="1637">Sometimes the farmers used to come from the city and tell something, the partisans or whoever it is, you know, what's going on but other than that they didn't have radios. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1642">Q: When you talk about, I think that's really interesting that you say you thought you were the only Jews alive. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1644">A: Correct. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1646">Q: How did that make you feel or what did you think was going to happen in the future? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1648">A: I'll tell you something. </sentence><sentence id="1649">When we saw the Red Army, this was it. </sentence><sentence id="1650">Now we are alive, you understand. </sentence><sentence id="1651">So it means the Germans are not here because the Russians are here so of course this gave us a big boost. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1656">Q: But before that, when you thought we're the last Jews in Europe or in Poland-- </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1658">A: Yeah, Poland, yeah. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1660">Q: Did that make you feel -- give you more strength that you had to stay alive or make you depressed? </sentence><sentence id="1661">It's a strange feeling isn't it? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1664">A: Nope. </sentence><sentence id="1665">You know why? </sentence><sentence id="1666">Because we took it each day as it comes. </sentence><sentence id="1667">We did not know what tomorrow's going to be and we knew that the Germans are here and how long it's going to take for them to kill us all. </sentence><sentence id="1668">So therefore we didn't have any hopes, anything. </sentence><sentence id="1669">No hopes. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1676">Q: When, I guess in 1943 the Soviet army really took charge of the partisans did that make any difference to you? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1678">A: Well, to me, no. </sentence><sentence id="1679">But it made difference to everybody actually because they used to come with airplanes for the partisans not for us and send down whatever food or instructions so it was different. </sentence><sentence id="1680">Sure, you felt a little bit like somebody's here to help. </sentence><sentence id="1681">You know what I'm talking? </sentence><sentence id="1682">They didn't. </sentence><sentence id="1683">They didn't come to the bottom of the, you know. </sentence><sentence id="1684">They used to turn down from the sky sort of, you know, and fly away. </sentence><sentence id="1685">They never came to land. </sentence><sentence id="1686">They did not land. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1696">Q: But you would find out about this through the partisans? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1698">A: Nope. </sentence><sentence id="1699">You see they, I'll tell you why. </sentence><sentence id="1700">Because they had a certain place where there's no trees. </sentence><sentence id="1701">It has to be a big place, okay, so they already knew where to come and the partisans knew where to wait for them so they used to drop whatever it is, ammunition, medication, whatever it is and they went back up. </sentence><sentence id="1702">But at least we knew that Russia knows that we're here. </sentence><sentence id="1703">You understand? </sentence><sentence id="1704">SO, it gave us a different feeling. </sentence><sentence id="1705">But eh... </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1714">Q: I know, but how did you know that if you didn't have contact with the partisans? </sentence><sentence id="1715">How did you know this was happening? </sentence></p></dialogue>
