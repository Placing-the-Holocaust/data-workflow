<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="392">Q: And why were you going there? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="394">A: Because I had the i -- I knew the eastern part of Czechoslovakia, he -- has -- has been liberated, so I had the foolish idea to go east, east, east, and cross the high mountains in -- in winter and go to this liberated part of Czechoslovakia. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="551">A: Thad, because you see, at that ttme American immigration was based on quotas and the quotas depended on the pla -- on the country where you were born. </sentence><sentence id="552">So I was not born in Czechoslovakia, I'm Viennese born, so I was in the Austrian quota. </sentence><sentence id="553">And because of persecution, and the Austrian quota was always oversubscribed, it was very difficult to get a visa. </sentence><sentence id="554">And I got priority because after having married, I was the husband of an American citizen. </sentence><sentence id="555">Elizabeth was already an American. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="674">A: Oh, certainly it was very meaningful. </sentence><sentence id="675">It was more than meaningful, it was a major event, because you mustn't forget, we always speak about the Holocaust and of -- and of persecution. </sentence><sentence id="676">But the fact that we were refugees before, meant that we were odd man out, we had no legal status. </sentence><sentence id="677">We had no country to which we could appeal for protection. </sentence><sentence id="678">Nobody cared for us. </sentence><sentence id="679">So to be again -- to have again a little status, and what was more, to be an American citizen was grandiose. </sentence><sentence id="680">So that was certainly a great event. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1573">A: Not to the same extent as some people believe in, particularly the people who founded and who promoted the Holocaust Museum, because the horror of these    USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0003 8 events is not a sufficient deterrent to prevent its repetition. </sentence><sentence id="1574">And moreover, concentration on the Holocaust alone doesn't give you a sufficient explanation of what happened. </sentence><sentence id="1575">You cannot understand the Holocaust if you only speak of the Holocaust. </sentence><sentence id="1576">You have to see the whole system which ruled in Germany and which was one of the most barbaric systems in history. </sentence><sentence id="1577">Imagine what they did. </sentence><sentence id="1578">Not only did they kill people, murder people, but they took their teeth, their gold teeth or their hair. </sentence><sentence id="1579">Now, the most backward people considered it anathema to utilize parts of human bodies. </sentence><sentence id="1580">I mean, the -- the cannibals, that's a different -- the cannibals are something quite different. </sentence><sentence id="1581">The Germans, the Nazis were below cannibalism. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="1582">Below cannibalism. </sentence><sentence id="1583">So did you bring us sandwiches, Liesel?
