<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="456">Q: That's right. </sentence><sentence id="457">He would have to start pretty much from the beginning. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="460">A: And he was a very arrogant man. </sentence><sentence id="461">Like I said, this is happening to all of the other Jews, not me. </sentence><sentence id="462">So I I don't remember doing much with my parents except for when my father bought a car, we used to on Sundays, go out into the suburbs, I guess, and I remember buying ice on a stick that was, you know, it was quite new. </sentence></p></dialogue>
