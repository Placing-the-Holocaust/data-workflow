<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="9">A: I was born in The Hague in Holland in the 8th of May, 1926. </sentence><sentence id="10">I was born in a Catholic hospital. </sentence><sentence id="11">I like to say I was born in Bethlehem because that was the name of the hospital. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="12"> Q; Tell me about your family, will you? </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="13">A: Well, how far back do you want me to go? </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="19">A: Well, I would like to introduce you to my family as far back as my great grandfather in a hurry? </sentence><sentence id="20">My great grandfather...his name was Jacob. </sentence><sentence id="21">Jacob Lessing was a tailor in the ghetto in Amsterdam. </sentence><sentence id="22">He had a nickname. </sentence><sentence id="23">He was called Uncle Kool. </sentence><sentence id="24">He was an interesting, colorful character. </sentence><sentence id="25">And he had let me see. </sentence><sentence id="26">He had a whole bunch of children, but my grandfather was also a tailor. </sentence><sentence id="27">His name was Isaac. </sentence><sentence id="28">There was Jacob, my great grandfather; Isaac was my grandfather. </sentence><sentence id="29">My grandfather was also a tailor, but he was the first one to move out of the ghetto in Amsterdam and set up a tailor shop outside the ghetto in what was then one of the newer sections of Amsterdam which is now right in the heart of course. </sentence><sentence id="30">And he moved around quite a bit. </sentence><sentence id="31">He moved with his family to The Hague right near the Royal Palace of the Queen and many of his clients were barons and baronesses of the Court for a while there. </sentence><sentence id="32">So he was a tailor all his life. </sentence><sentence id="33">Later on he became an important man in one of the big clothing industries of Holland. </sentence><sentence id="34">He was the first one to set up a assembly line kind of procedures. </sentence><sentence id="35">So essentially, he was a tailor. </sentence><sentence id="36">He had three sons. </sentence><sentence id="37">My father, Nathan; his old brother, Jacob; and my father's youngest brother, Joseph. </sentence><sentence id="38">They all had different nicknames though. </sentence><sentence id="39">My father called himself Nardus. </sentence><sentence id="40">I don't know how he got to that. </sentence><sentence id="41">I never found that out. </sentence><sentence id="42">N-A-R-D-U=S. Nardus. </sentence><sentence id="43">And Jacob was called Jaap, which is a Dutch name, Jaap. </sentence><sentence id="44">J-A-A-P, Jaap. </sentence><sentence id="45">And Joseph was called Joop, J-O-O-P. Jacob died before the war. </sentence><sentence id="46">Joseph was killed by the Germans. </sentence><sentence id="47">So was his wife, Jeana and their little son, whose name I can't recall right now. </sentence><sentence id="48">In essence, those three people are the only ones in my family, my direct family...near family that were killed in concentration camps. </sentence><sentence id="49">Everyone else either had died before or died a natural death. </sentence><sentence id="50">So my father's older brother died 01:04:  before the war, and his younger brother died in a concentration camp in, | think, Auschwitz. </sentence><sentence id="51">So my father...oh, by the way, this younger brother, Joseph or Joop was also a tailor or went into the clothing industry, helped by my grandfather. </sentence><sentence id="52">My father was the only one who somehow or other got into a completely different profession. </sentence><sentence id="53">He became a musician. </sentence><sentence id="54">And when he was 17 he left his parental house...home, and from what I can find out he never returned. </sentence><sentence id="55">He booked on or he signed on a ship as a musician at 17, and it was his first trip overseas, and he never forgot it. </sentence><sentence id="56">He always told me about it. </sentence><sentence id="57">So he was a musician all his life. </sentence><sentence id="58">No matter what he tried to get out of it, he never...he never managed. </sentence><sentence id="59">He tried many things, together with my mother later on. </sentence><sentence id="60">They tried to set up businesses and sell things and it never worked. </sentence><sentence id="61">Papa always came back to being a musician. </sentence><sentence id="62">So let me say now... </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="108">Q: Tell us about you as a child. </sentence><sentence id="109">What was your home like growing up as a child. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="112">A: Well, it's a little difficult to tell you because my father and my mother married in 1925 and had me, of course, in 1926, and traveled around a lot. </sentence><sentence id="113">In 1929, for instance, my parents decided that they would go to the United States. </sentence><sentence id="114">They would follow in the path of my aunt and uncle who had moved there. </sentence><sentence id="115">They had moved. </sentence><sentence id="116">My aunt and uncle lived in Holyoke, Massachusetts, and my parents decided that that they also wanted to go to the United States. </sentence><sentence id="117">So 1929, I, as a three year old, arrived in the States, and learned to speak English. </sentence><sentence id="118">However, they had a lot of bad luck. </sentence><sentence id="119">1929 wasn't a very good year to arrive in the States as you can imagine. </sentence><sentence id="120">So Pop had a hard time finding work and, in addition he got sick. </sentence><sentence id="121">He got tuberculosis, which ran in the family. </sentence><sentence id="122">Tuberculosis was a kind of a family disease with us. </sentence><sentence id="123">A lot of members had it...got it. </sentence><sentence id="124">My daughter got it. </sentence><sentence id="125">Pop got tuberculosis and had to go to a hospital. </sentence><sentence id="126">And Mom had to go and scrub floors and later worked in a travel agency in Boston. </sentence><sentence id="127">And I was farmed out to to a lady who was supposed to take care of me, but who took very badly care of me for one of the reason I have been in psychotherapy for the last 22 years is that [it] didn't help what happened later on [in] the war. </sentence><sentence id="128">So we moved to the States in 1932. </sentence><sentence id="129">Pop not finding work. </sentence><sentence id="130">Well, very occasionally, he had some friends in the Boston Symphony who helped with the summer engagement, but all in all he didn't find much work. </sentence><sentence id="131">In 1932 they moved back to Holland. </sentence><sentence id="132">In Holland they moved around from place to place, wherever Pop could find work. </sentence><sentence id="133">Pop worked as a musician mostly in night clubs, bars or restaurants, hotels, in the time that hotels still had live music, you know, little trios and... So we moved around quite a bit throughout Holland. </sentence><sentence id="134">I once counted that between the time that I was born and the war that we had...and the war was 1940, so it's between 1926 and 1940, that I once counted approximately 32 addresses. </sentence><sentence id="135">So that's a lot, you know. </sentence><sentence id="136">Some places, we may have been only...I don't know, a month so, but we had a lot of moving around. </sentence><sentence id="137">So my parents, as I said, came back in  1932 to Holland. </sentence><sentence id="138">Then Pop started playing and my mother had...my mother got three...three more children. </sentence><sentence id="139">One, another boy after me, died. </sentence><sentence id="140">His name was Joop...Joop again named after my grand...I guess great grandfather Jacob. </sentence><sentence id="141">Yeah. </sentence><sentence id="142">He died when he was 9 months. </sentence><sentence id="143">It was a terrible blow for my mother. </sentence><sentence id="144">And as my father said...a psychiatrist...he had consulted a psychiatrist because my mother was...was totally distraught. </sentence><sentence id="145">He said the best thing was to get Mother a child as quick as possible. </sentence><sentence id="146">She got two more children. </sentence><sentence id="147">Two...my two brothers, my brother, At, and my brother Fred. </sentence><sentence id="148">So there's a difference...a big difference between my brothers and me. </sentence><sentence id="149">The next my brother At is 8 years younger and my brother, Fred, is 10 years younger than I am. </sentence><sentence id="150">So I sort of stood alone most of the time. </sentence><sentence id="151">I was alone...a loner. </sentence><sentence id="152">We lived the last years before the war sort of in The Hague, Holland. </sentence><sentence id="153">And just before...a year before the war...I think 1939, with the help of my grandfather, who you may recall was a tailor, opened a clothing store in Delft, the nearby small town. </sentence><sentence id="154">01:10: Delft is located between The Hague and Rotterdam, a small town, a beautiful little town where Delft pottery comes from. </sentence><sentence id="155">So we moved there and that was...no I was going to say it was the last move before the ...that was the last move before the war, of course. </sentence><sentence id="156">So the war of 1940...the invasion, the German invasion found us in Delft with a sort of a small clothing store. </sentence><sentence id="157">And when the war broke out, I was 14, and my brother Fred was 4 and my brother At, was 6. </sentence><sentence id="158">Does that give you some background on my family? </sentence><sentence id="159">What else would you like me to go into at this point? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="210">Q: Tell us what happened when the war broke out. </sentence><sentence id="211">Can you remember? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="214">A: Yeah. </sentence><sentence id="215">Very well. </sentence><sentence id="216">I was 14. </sentence><sentence id="217">The war broke out 2 days after my birthday. </sentence><sentence id="218">My birthday was the 8th of May. </sentence><sentence id="219">I remember very well getting a canoe for my birthday because Delft is sometimes called the Venice of Holland. </sentence><sentence id="220">It's riddled with canals, little bridges. </sentence><sentence id="221">It's [a] very, very beautiful little town. </sentence><sentence id="222">I got the canoe on the 8th of May and I was very happy with that. </sentence><sentence id="223">It was my birthday. </sentence><sentence id="224">And on the 10th...that was the 8th of May, 1940. </sentence><sentence id="225">And on the 10th of May, 5 o'clock in the morning, I woke up to thunderous noises, machine gun fire, planes flying over. </sentence><sentence id="226">Great commotion. </sentence><sentence id="227">Dawn was just breaking. </sentence><sentence id="228">It was a most beautiful day. </sentence><sentence id="229">It was sun[ny], warm, unusual day for Holland in that sense. </sentence><sentence id="230">I went upstairs, looked out of the attic windows. </sentence><sentence id="231">The sky was full of planes. </sentence><sentence id="232">And some of the planes men were jumping with parachutes. </sentence><sentence id="233">I thought it was fabulous. </sentence><sentence id="234">It was wonderful. </sentence><sentence id="235">I tried to climb on the roof. </sentence><sentence id="236">Almost got shot down by Dutch machine nest which had been placed right near the hole by that time. </sentence><sentence id="237">My father ...my father retrieved me from the roof and said you shouldn't be doing this. </sentence><sentence id="238">I thought it was fabulous. </sentence><sentence id="239">I mean this was like stuff you'd see in the movies. </sentence><sentence id="240">I was 14 years old. </sentence><sentence id="241">What the Hell did I know? </sentence><sentence id="242">Besides, we hadn't the faintest  idea of what was going on really. </sentence><sentence id="243">We thought it was sort of an exercise of the Dutch, probably Dutch air force. </sentence><sentence id="244">No idea of what was going on. </sentence><sentence id="245">We soon found out, of course. </sentence><sentence id="246">By news that came from the radio that the Germans had invaded Holland. </sentence><sentence id="247">To give you a little background in this, Holland hadn't been in a war as far as I know since the Napoleonic war. </sentence><sentence id="248">Holland was neutral in the first world war. </sentence><sentence id="249">Matter of fact, I remember my father telling that in their home...at my grandfather's home, they had a Belgian refugee. </sentence><sentence id="250">Somebody from the first world war fled the battlefields in Belgium and come to Amsterdam and to The Hague and lived with them for a while. </sentence><sentence id="251">I think that was the most exotic story that happened ages ago. </sentence><sentence id="252">Of course, I never realized that that 01:14: was in that time only maybe 25 years ago or so. </sentence><sentence id="253">So Holland wasn't a country that was used to battles and war. </sentence><sentence id="254">The idea that there was a actual war going on was...was ludicrous in our eyes. </sentence><sentence id="255">I mean it was...but it took 5 days. </sentence><sentence id="256">After the first morning, it sort of died down. </sentence><sentence id="257">My father almost got shot I remember. </sentence><sentence id="258">He wanted to go out get something to eat near the nearby grocery and there was Dutch soldier. </sentence><sentence id="259">You see, we had a street that had in the middle a canal, and on each side, couple thin streets, and across the canal on the other side was a Dutch soldier standing and Pop opened the front door and shouted to the Dutch soldier...was it alright and go to the grocery store? </sentence><sentence id="260">And the soldier misunderstood him and fired at him. </sentence><sentence id="261">And the bullet hit in the wall right next to him. </sentence><sentence id="262">That would have been the end of my father right there and then. </sentence><sentence id="263">So my father was in a hurry very pale. </sentence><sentence id="264">Five days the war took and, of course, in the course the Germans bombarded Rotterdam and brought the Dutch government to its knees in a hurry. </sentence><sentence id="265">And quiet reigned after that. </sentence><sentence id="266">As a boy I remember going out with a friend as soon as the war was over and going out on the highway, and there were all these German planes that had been shot down...one right next to another...these planes that had dropped parachute troops which were easy targets because these were slow flying planes. </sentence><sentence id="267">One after another. </sentence><sentence id="268">And we thought it was fabulous. </sentence><sentence id="269">It was interesting. </sentence><sentence id="270">All these crashed planes and... I'll give you a cute little sideline. </sentence><sentence id="271">Everyone one of these planes had two engines. </sentence><sentence id="272">And on each engine was a little plaque. </sentence><sentence id="273">Blue and White. </sentence><sentence id="274">It said BMW. </sentence><sentence id="275">And to this day, it's very difficult for me to accept anyone driving a car with those emblems. </sentence><sentence id="276">Of course, there is a lot. </sentence><sentence id="277">They're preferred cars now. </sentence><sentence id="278">Right? </sentence><sentence id="279">But to me, that symbol means war and German invasion. </sentence><sentence id="280">That's strange isn't it. </sentence><sentence id="281">So as a boy and with my friends on bicycles, we thought it was all fabulous. </sentence><sentence id="282">All these crashed planes, and I remember going out to some other planes that were parked. </sentence><sentence id="283">The Dutch had parked some planes under trees. </sentence><sentence id="284">Supposedly, if there would be some battle and these planes had never been touched. </sentence><sentence id="285">They were totally outmoded planes. </sentence><sentence id="286">By the way, my friend and I loved planes. </sentence><sentence id="287">I still do. </sentence><sentence id="288">So my friend and I went in there and got instruments out of these planes you know, and for the first time I had a real instrument out of an airplane. </sentence><sentence id="289">So you realize that, to me, the German invasion was kind of...well, it was a little scary, but it was a lot of fun. </sentence><sentence id="290">There was a lot of excitement. </sentence><sentence id="291">And when the first German rolled into town...the first one that I saw was in a camouflage suit with a...with a typical German helmet on, and on a motorcycle with a sidecar and in the sidecar was another German. </sentence><sentence id="292">And they all had camouflaged suits and...and the  motorcycles were...oops... Maybe you want to make a break here. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="374">Q: Can we stop the tape a minute please. </sentence><sentence id="375">We need to fix this. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="378">A: I've had quite a time with this mike. </sentence><sentence id="379">This is the second time it fell off. </sentence><sentence id="380">Is this alright now? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="384">Q: You're fine. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="386">A: Okay. </sentence><sentence id="387">You tell me when I should resume. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="390">Q: Alright. </sentence><sentence id="391">You're fine. </sentence><sentence id="392">You were looking at all these planes. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="396">A: And the Germans came in. </sentence><sentence id="397">The first Germans right on the motorcycles. </sentence><sentence id="398">They were kind of curious specimens. </sentence><sentence id="399">They didn't speak Dutch. </sentence><sentence id="400">They sort of roared through town. </sentence><sentence id="401">They seemed harmless. </sentence><sentence id="402">As a boy I had no idea what this really meant. </sentence><sentence id="403">We settled in with the Germans. </sentence><sentence id="404">By now, the Germans would march through town as they [were] singing sometimes or they would walk by the stores. </sentence><sentence id="405">As a matter of fact, there was a German came into my father's store to buy a suit and my father helped him and the guy bought a suit. </sentence><sentence id="406">I think he bought two suits and he bought that. </sentence><sentence id="407">Life seemed normal. </sentence><sentence id="408">We seemed to be able to live with this you know. </sentence><sentence id="409">That's how it all started. </sentence><sentence id="410">Nice days in May. </sentence><sentence id="411">Strange people walking the streets, but rather harmless. </sentence><sentence id="412">It would all be over pretty soon anyway. </sentence><sentence id="413">That was the story. </sentence><sentence id="414">The war would be over soon. </sentence><sentence id="415">It would last maybe a couple of months and then the English would come and the American would come and the Russians...no, the Russians...I guess...they hadn't invaded Russia yet. </sentence><sentence id="416">Well, then, of course, the English got defeated and the English and French got defeated in a hurry in France, and there was Dunkirk and then everything came to sort of a standstill you know, sort of the English were in England and we were in Holland and life would go on until the war was over. </sentence><sentence id="417">And very slowly, very slowly, things began to happen. </sentence><sentence id="418">Little notices in the newspapers about.... Now, I don't exactly know the sequence, of course, but little notices in newspapers such as Jews were not allowed anymore to live right near the coastal areas because they could be traitors. </sentence><sentence id="419">And then some weeks later maybe there would be a notice that said that Jews shouldn't have any radios. </sentence><sentence id="420">So every Jew was supposed to bring his radio to town hall. </sentence><sentence id="421">This went all through the Dutch government you see, so it all didn't seem so terrible. </sentence><sentence id="422">It and the reaction of my parents and I guess most Jews in Holland who hadn't been repressed for 300 years probably was that was a minor thing, you know. </sentence><sentence id="423">They wanted our radios. </sentence><sentence id="424">So the hell with them. </sentence><sentence id="425">We'd bring the radio. </sentence><sentence id="426">If they wanted us not to live in the coastal areas, so we'd move inland a ways. </sentence><sentence id="427">It all seemed rather...how shall I say childish to us....all this nonsense, you know. </sentence><sentence id="428">And the choice always was either you comply or you go to jail. </sentence><sentence id="429">Well, nobody in my family had ever gone to jail. </sentence><sentence id="430">You didn't go to jail. </sentence><sentence id="431">You didn't...the Dutch were very disciplined people. </sentence><sentence id="432">When somebody said don't go through this gate because that is private property, you didn't go through that. </sentence><sentence id="433">You followed the law. </sentence><sentence id="434">And these laws were new laws. </sentence><sentence id="435">So the idea was... mean you  begin...you begin to feel something was going on there that we didn't like, of course, but it was easier to comply with it than to to get thrown in jail. </sentence><sentence id="436">You weren't going to be thrown in jail for having a radio. </sentence><sentence id="437">This is crazy you know. </sentence><sentence id="438">So you brought your radio. </sentence><sentence id="439">But then a little later on... think it was a matter of copper and brass and all kinds of stuff. </sentence><sentence id="440">And for strange reason we thought that was kind of ridiculous so we took all...I remember taking all our copper and brass pots that we had in the house. </sentence><sentence id="441">It wasn't... my parents weren't very rich so it wasn't much of any consequence and burying it somewhere in a park, where we were sure after the Germans were gone, we'd dig it up and put it back on the shelf. </sentence><sentence id="442">As a matter of fact, after the war I went back and never find the Goddamn stuff back. </sentence><sentence id="443">I never could find a park. </sentence><sentence id="444">It was so changed. </sentence><sentence id="445">Who the hell knows. </sentence><sentence id="446">So there was this slow infiltration of little things. </sentence><sentence id="447">And the best thing was to comply with it because the alternative was heavy punishment. </sentence><sentence id="448">None of it seemed worthwhile. </sentence><sentence id="449">Then it was bicycles. </sentence><sentence id="450">Jews shouldn't have bicycles. </sentence><sentence id="451">We should bring all our bicycles. </sentence><sentence id="452">People brought their bicycles. </sentence><sentence id="453">I don't think we did. </sentence><sentence id="454">Now let's see. </sentence><sentence id="455">How did it go on? </sentence><sentence id="456">Then there came a decree. </sentence><sentence id="457">And this is all issued in the Dutch newspapers, mostly through Dutch authorities. </sentence><sentence id="458">It would say that the German command had issued a decree to the Dutch government, and the Dutch government said that Jews were no longer allowed to have businesses. </sentence><sentence id="459">Well, my father had a big business, so they sold all the clothing as fast and made quite a bundle of money because by that time clothing was rationed. </sentence><sentence id="460">They sold the clothing. </sentence><sentence id="461">And rented a house...a large house in Delft in a different location...had many rooms there...had 17 rooms I think, and rented out rooms to students. </sentence><sentence id="462">Delft is a university town. </sentence><sentence id="463">So they set themselves in sort of a business renting rooms to students which was a very common business in Delft because there was so many students and lots of people just lived on renting out rooms to students. </sentence><sentence id="464">So they did that, and they got this big house I remember and lots of rooms in it. </sentence><sentence id="465">And meanwhile, new decrees slowly came out. </sentence><sentence id="466">Jews couldn't have this. </sentence><sentence id="467">Jews couldn't do that. </sentence><sentence id="468">Jews couldn't go to school. </sentence><sentence id="469">I was in school. </sentence><sentence id="470">I was a teenager, and I was in high school. </sentence><sentence id="471">By the way, I was an awful student. </sentence><sentence id="472">Probably one of the worst. </sentence><sentence id="473">My parents were at wits end with me. </sentence><sentence id="474">I was a lousy student. </sentence><sentence id="475">I was a clown. </sentence><sentence id="476">I had a good time everywhere and tried to attract attention by being very funny and was held back several times and finally my father, you know, said, "I don't know what the hell to do with him." </sentence><sentence id="477">He went to to a friend and said what should I with this boy? </sentence><sentence id="478">And he said, "Why don't you let him learn a profession?" </sentence><sentence id="479">So I was sent to, what do you call that,...a trade school, which was kind of shame because there weren't any Jewish kids in trade schools. </sentence><sentence id="480">This was for non-Jewish kids who wanted to become carpenters and electricians and stuff like. </sentence><sentence id="481">Here I was and I was supposed to first become an electrician. </sentence><sentence id="482">And, of course, I horsed around there too and didn't learn. </sentence><sentence id="483">And then I was switched and my father talked with someone and said, "What should my son do? </sentence><sentence id="484">What do you think is a good profession." </sentence><sentence id="485">And this man said, "Do you know what's a good profession? </sentence><sentence id="486">Instruments making, tool maker." </sentence><sentence id="487">And so I started studying for that. </sentence><sentence id="488">And...but as I said one bad day there was a notice in the paper that Jewish children couldn't go to the  regular schools anymore...could go only to special Jewish schools. </sentence><sentence id="489">Since I lived in a very small town, there were no special Jewish school. </sentence><sentence id="490">All in all maybe in Delft before or during the war...I said before...at the beginning of the German invasion, my guess is maybe that there were maybe 150 maybe 200 Jews in Delft. </sentence><sentence id="491">It's a small town. </sentence><sentence id="492">So we knew most of them by the way. </sentence><sentence id="493">No Jews in school anymore meant that I couldn't go to school anymore. </sentence><sentence id="494">So I was out of trade school. </sentence><sentence id="495">And Pop said to me...he said "Well, you know the best thing is maybe you should learn to play music." </sentence><sentence id="496">Because he was a musician. </sentence><sentence id="497">So I took up the trumpet for a while. </sentence><sentence id="498">And I kinda liked that. </sentence><sentence id="499">I played...started studying the trumpet with a teacher, a very nice man. </sentence><sentence id="500">Everyone felt sorry for me that I couldn't go to school anymore, you know, that kind of stuff. </sentence><sentence id="501">So I studied the trumpet for a while, and I also played the piano. </sentence><sentence id="502">Pop gave me lessons which was horrendous because it's very, very terrible to take lessons from your parents, you know. </sentence><sentence id="503">It didn't work out too well. </sentence><sentence id="504">He taught me piano, and I still play the piano. </sentence><sentence id="505">Badly. </sentence><sentence id="506">Then...oh, and I also had a part-time job as a delivery boy for a for a pharmacy. </sentence><sentence id="507">All these things to keep me busy while my parents got more and more worried about what was going on of course.. I still don't think I grasped exactly what was going on. </sentence><sentence id="508">I just sort of went along with it. </sentence><sentence id="509">Then came a decree one day that you had to wear a star. </sentence><sentence id="510">All Jews had to wear a star if they went out of the house. </sentence><sentence id="511">So my mother sewed on stars on my clothes. </sentence><sentence id="512">And I remember an incident. </sentence><sentence id="513">I have a cousin. </sentence><sentence id="514">My cousin, Hans, who lives in Springfield, Massachusetts now. </sentence><sentence id="515">He's about my age, and at the time we looked a little bit similar. </sentence><sentence id="516">And we had both gotten the same overcoats from my father's former clothing store, so we looked like twins. </sentence><sentence id="517">And Hans always said, "Let's go out and walk like twins." </sentence><sentence id="518">So we put on the same socks, shirt, much as possible...same outfit and we walked as twins. </sentence><sentence id="519">That was wonderful. </sentence><sentence id="520">Except I had a star. </sentence><sentence id="521">He didn't. </sentence><sentence id="522">Well, that was the only thing different. </sentence><sentence id="523">His mom...his mother...my Aunt Clara had married a non-Jew. </sentence><sentence id="524">So Hans was only half Jewish. </sentence><sentence id="525">And I remember walking through Delft and once get stopped by a German. </sentence><sentence id="526">This was the only time a German physically touched me. </sentence><sentence id="527">I was stopped by this German. </sentence><sentence id="528">We were stopped by this German in our same overcoats. </sentence><sentence id="529">And the German said to my cousin, Hans, "What're you do walking with a Jew?" </sentence><sentence id="530">And I said, "He's my cousin." </sentence><sentence id="531">And the German slapped me full in the face and I fell on the ground. </sentence><sentence id="532">Pow. </sentence><sentence id="533">Like this...he said something like "You lousy Jew." </sentence><sentence id="534">And he said to my cousin, "Don't let me ever see you walking with him...with a Jew." </sentence><sentence id="535">It's the only time that I physically was abused by a German. </sentence><sentence id="536">And I'll never forget it. </sentence><sentence id="537">When I think of the concentration camps and what people went through that's my only reference. </sentence><sentence id="538">That incident was like...I think it must have woken me up to what was really going on to some extent. </sentence><sentence id="539">Not that I remember it as such now, but that was the only time that I was really physically abused by those bastards, if I can use that expression. </sentence><sentence id="540">Well, he went away. </sentence><sentence id="541">And, of course, my cousin and I still would be together. </sentence><sentence id="542">As a matter of fact during the war, I spent  0 a short time hidden by my Aunt Clara. </sentence><sentence id="543">Hans and I would go out at night after dark...go to the Catholic churches. </sentence><sentence id="544">I'll get back to that later. </sentence><sentence id="545">It's little bit of ahead. </sentence><sentence id="546">Well, the shipments [i.e. deportations?] </sentence><sentence id="547">begin. </sentence><sentence id="548">Jews were to register, of course. </sentence><sentence id="549">We had all registered I presume at the beginning of the war. </sentence><sentence id="550">I forget that part because some point or another we all supposed to register and we all did. </sentence><sentence id="551">The punishment I guess for not registering was death. </sentence><sentence id="552">So...what the hell? </sentence><sentence id="553">You go to register. </sentence><sentence id="554">What's the big deal. </sentence><sentence id="555">Since in Holland, ostensively there was no anti-Semitism. </sentence><sentence id="556">I mean you could walk out in the street with a star. </sentence><sentence id="557">Nobody'd say, "Hey, you lousy Jew." </sentence><sentence id="558">It was like a sign of respect. </sentence><sentence id="559">People felt sorry for you. </sentence><sentence id="560">It was kind of nice to have people feel sorry for me. </sentence><sentence id="561">Shipments began, of course. </sentence><sentence id="562">Since I lived in a very small town, it didn't immediately hit us that much. </sentence><sentence id="563">It happened mostly in Amsterdam...big city where there was thousands and thousands of Jews. </sentence><sentence id="564">And you heard this and you read about it and, of course, we got the Jewish newspaper that was published by something called the Joodse Raad, the Jewish Committee in Holland, that sort of tried to regulate...diminish the pain sort of. </sentence><sentence id="565">But in the process actually now as I look back at it helped the Germans, of course. </sentence><sentence id="566">But there again...the goal was to...i1f somebody had to go and work in Poland as it was held up to us, they would...let's first send healthy people who are not going to suffer too much from the cold there. </sentence><sentence id="567">So they regulated who would go on shipments and so on and who would not. </sentence><sentence id="568">All that for us a little bit far away, but we knew that someday we will have to go and work in Poland. </sentence><sentence id="569">This was...now I want you to understand this very clearly. </sentence><sentence id="570">That not until May 1945, the liberation of Holland, did I have the slightest idea of what was going on with these people who were sent away. </sentence><sentence id="571">We had no idea. </sentence><sentence id="572">I had no idea. </sentence><sentence id="573">I don't know who... Some people must have. </sentence><sentence id="574">As far as we were concerned, you went to Poland to work. </sentence><sentence id="575">And I remember very much very well a member of my family in Amsterdam...I think a cousin of my father's...who stood in the open market in a stall and sold underwear and socks. </sentence><sentence id="576">Saying, her name was Beppie saying, "What's the big deal? </sentence><sentence id="577">We work like dogs here. </sentence><sentence id="578">So we'll go work over there if they want us to do that. </sentence><sentence id="579">This was commonly accepted. </sentence><sentence id="580">And so my father and mother in anticipation of being shipped to Poland, having to go to Poland to work, got nice bundles of backpacks. </sentence><sentence id="581">We got blankets. </sentence><sentence id="582">We got water containers or whatever...socks. </sentence><sentence id="583">You know, socks, warm shoes, whatever...sweaters. </sentence><sentence id="584">It was all neatly in a closet in our house you know. </sentence><sentence id="585">We were ready. </sentence><sentence id="586">All set. </sentence><sentence id="587">We'd be warm. </sentence><sentence id="588">01:36: We'd have clothing, blankets. </sentence><sentence id="589">We'd go and if we had to Poland, we'd go there. </sentence><sentence id="590">It might be a little colder. </sentence><sentence id="591">Papa and Mom would have to work a little harder, but gee, they were used to work. </sentence><sentence id="592">We were all set. </sentence><sentence id="593">Interesting thing is that my grandfather came over from Amsterdam and he, of course, told horror stories of thousands of Jews being shipped off and the way I remember it. </sentence><sentence id="594">I don't know if I have this from a story by my grandfather or by my father or I was there myself at that particular instant that my father and mother opened this closet and showed my grandfather how well they were prepared. </sentence><sentence id="595">How beautiful. </sentence><sentence id="596">Backpack and how wonderful the blankets, and my grandfather saying, "Do you think you're going to go to Poland to work? </sentence><sentence id="597">And my parents saying, "Yes." " </sentence><sentence id="598">You're not going to go to work. </sentence><sentence id="599">You're going to get killed there. </sentence><sentence id="600">You're gonna die there." </sentence><sentence id="601">Not  1 that I think he knew that we were being murdered outright but that it was cold and that you'd work yourself to death and that you might die in..you know, like in Siberia, people died in camps. </sentence><sentence id="602">And it's at that point I guess that my parents decided we weren't going to go. </sentence><sentence id="603">Now the penalty for that was death. </sentence><sentence id="604">But by now we came to a state where you had to choose between possibly instant death by being caught and by being set up against and the wall being shot or being shipped to Poland to maybe die of cold and hunger or whatever that was there. </sentence><sentence id="605">Surely no one came back from there. </sentence><sentence id="606">So I guess at some point my parents decided, "We're going to take the chance." </sentence><sentence id="607">And when I think about it now, it's almost impossible to convey what it must have meant for my parents who had never defied a single law in their life in that sense. </sentence><sentence id="608">To defy a law that had the death penalty on it. </sentence><sentence id="609">But they decided. </sentence><sentence id="610">They made a decision. </sentence><sentence id="611">Now this town was very small and there was a gentleman in town, Mr. Kohn, who was sort of the Joodse Raad, the member of the committee in Delft who was to oversee shipment of people from Delft. </sentence><sentence id="612">I guess he was made responsible or whatever. </sentence><sentence id="613">He was a German Jew who had immigrated to Holland. </sentence><sentence id="614">He knew what it was all about I think. </sentence><sentence id="615">And he said, "I'll give you a warning when they come to get you." </sentence><sentence id="616">And I guess as close as I can find out, in October 1942, the warning came. </sentence><sentence id="617">They're coming to get you. </sentence><sentence id="618">My father and mother, two brothers, and I just put on coats and walked out of the house. </sentence><sentence id="619">Shut the door behind us and walked out. </sentence><sentence id="620">And walked to a different part in Delft...outskirts of Delft where we had some friends of the family. </sentence><sentence id="621">Two older people and two daughters, friends of my parents and settled down there for that day and that night. </sentence><sentence id="622">And that's how we left our house. </sentence><sentence id="623">And I guess we didn't back to Delft until maybe June 1945. </sentence><sentence id="624">Interesting enough, my wife, Carla, was hidden in Delft, the town that I that I had left. </sentence><sentence id="625">And you'll get that story too of course. </sentence><sentence id="626">Well, from here on, it becomes my story. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="861">Q: What do you mean? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="863">A: Well, I once...I need dates a little bit for my...these are only monthly dates. </sentence><sentence id="864">They are not exact dates, but I need them for my own reference because it gets kind of confusing. </sentence><sentence id="865">And I'm not so sure that this is even correct. </sentence><sentence id="866">In any case, 01:41: it's my guess that I stayed there about 3 months. </sentence><sentence id="867">The families was called the Nieuwenhuizens. </sentence><sentence id="868">He was an older gentleman who worked as an amanuensis at the university. </sentence><sentence id="869">A very wonderful old man and his wife and they had a young daughter. </sentence><sentence id="870">And I stayed in a little room. </sentence><sentence id="871">That first evening we dispersed. </sentence><sentence id="872">My little brothers went to my grandfather in Amsterdam, and I can't tell you much more about them from there on. </sentence><sentence id="873">But those stories are all with my brothers. </sentence><sentence id="874">My parents went to some friends somewhere else near The Hague. </sentence><sentence id="875">And so that same evening we were all dispersed, and we didn't really get together again until after the war. </sentence><sentence id="876">All of us. </sentence><sentence id="877">I was the only one who stayed at this address...at the Nieuwenhuizens, and I stayed there for about 3 months. </sentence><sentence id="878">And all ofa sudden, life was very strange. </sentence><sentence id="879">I had no more parents, of course. </sentence><sentence id="880">I had these very loving people, friends. </sentence><sentence id="881">But this was a strange business. </sentence><sentence id="882">I had nothing to do. </sentence><sentence id="883">I mean I would sit  2 there in this little room and read a little bit. </sentence><sentence id="884">I fell in love with the girl, of course. </sentence><sentence id="885">What else was there to do? </sentence><sentence id="886">She would have none of it. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="912">Q: Tell us about it. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="914">A: I can't tell you very much. </sentence><sentence id="915">She was gorgeous. </sentence><sentence id="916">There were a couple...they must have been. </sentence><sentence id="917">I don't know how this happened. </sentence><sentence id="918">They must have been like in their 40s maybe. </sentence><sentence id="919">They looked much older. </sentence><sentence id="920">They were like old people to me. </sentence><sentence id="921">They had this gorgeous young daughter. </sentence><sentence id="922">Beautiful, long hair. </sentence><sentence id="923">I can't tell you very much about her. </sentence><sentence id="924">I talked with her. </sentence><sentence id="925">I tried to... See...how old was I? </sentence><sentence id="926">14. </sentence><sentence id="927">I tried to get her into bed. </sentence><sentence id="928">She wouldn't. </sentence><sentence id="929">I wouldn't know what to do with her probably, but anyway I was very much in love. </sentence><sentence id="930">I was very lonely already right away. </sentence><sentence id="931">I was there from what I could figure out till about January 1942 [43]. </sentence><sentence id="932">I couldn't stay very long. </sentence><sentence id="933">I couldn't stay very long anywhere really. </sentence><sentence id="934">My mother then sort of took over during...when we were all dispersed who started to pretty soon and arranged to find places for the family. </sentence><sentence id="935">And this is the reason why she was later on caught. </sentence><sentence id="936">She was the one...the only one who traveled. </sentence><sentence id="937">She had a false identity card, just like mine. </sentence><sentence id="938">And she traveled and found places. </sentence><sentence id="939">She had contacts here and there I presume with the underground. </sentence><sentence id="940">I'm not quite sure. </sentence><sentence id="941">I really don't know. </sentence><sentence id="942">But the second address I went to were friends of my father when he was a young man. </sentence><sentence id="943">So we're talking about...talking about 1942....we're talking about 19...between 1920 and 1925. </sentence><sentence id="944">He had lived in Utrecht. </sentence><sentence id="945">He'd been a musician. </sentence><sentence id="946">| think he had been in love with one of the sisters. </sentence><sentence id="947">There were three sisters. </sentence><sentence id="948">Now they were all old and middle-aged ladies. </sentence><sentence id="949">And somehow another they talked one of the ladies I think her name was Fie Troost, T-R-O-O-S-t, Troost into taking me. </sentence><sentence id="950">Now remember the...the penalty for taking in Jews was death. </sentence><sentence id="951">That was for sure. </sentence><sentence id="952">So if you took some one in, if you were discovered that's it. </sentence><sentence id="953">You forfeited your life. </sentence><sentence id="954">By this time I was, of course, a fugitive. </sentence><sentence id="955">And I went to this Feetje Troost. </sentence><sentence id="956">I think her name was Fietje Troost, and she lived together with another woman, a younger woman who was a receptionist at a hotel, and I settled in there. </sentence><sentence id="957">I had a beautiful room. </sentence><sentence id="958">I have a picture of that in the pictures that I gave you...the two ladies, and I have a view of the church tower which I made a nice sketch of. </sentence><sentence id="959">My father used to sketch by the way. </sentence><sentence id="960">He was always sort of amateur painter or sketcher and I sort of followed in his steps. </sentence><sentence id="961">I liked the idea. </sentence><sentence id="962">And I started sketching a little bit. </sentence><sentence id="963">So I sketched. </sentence><sentence id="964">01:46: [had nothing to do. </sentence><sentence id="965">Days went by with me sitting in the room. </sentence><sentence id="966">But there was a piano there. </sentence><sentence id="967">So I got my piano books, songs with piano books, and started practicing the piano a couple hours a day. </sentence><sentence id="968">I stayed with these ladies, and at night I would go out after dark. </sentence><sentence id="969">I would take a small walk around the block. </sentence><sentence id="970">Now in those days it was war time. </sentence><sentence id="971">And everything was dark, blacked out. </sentence><sentence id="972">You know, there was a black out. </sentence><sentence id="973">So it was a little easier to get out of the house and nobody could see you really. </sentence><sentence id="974">The streets were pitch...pitch black. </sentence><sentence id="975">The only thing that you could see in the light was like little flashlight that people had and cars had little slits...you know, the head lights were blocked off, and little slits left open. </sentence><sentence id="976">And so everything was very dark. </sentence><sentence id="977">So it was relatively safe to walk  3 out, take a walk around the block and get a little fresh air. </sentence><sentence id="978">I also visited some of Fie's sisters....Fietje's sisters...this lady's sisters who lived about 15 minutes walk away in another part of Utrecht. </sentence><sentence id="979">Is it okay that I go into so much detail? </sentence><sentence id="980">Bizarre things happened sometimes during the war. </sentence><sentence id="981">Here I was a fugitive kid. </sentence><sentence id="982">I was 16 years old at that time. </sentence><sentence id="983">And I would walk over in the dark towards that other home to this lady's sister. </sentence><sentence id="984">That lady's sister had a daughter. </sentence><sentence id="985">She was a illegitimate child conceived by a German years and years ago before the war. </sentence><sentence id="986">These lady's...since there was the mother, the sister of Fee and the daughter who was...about 20 is my guess, had always been kind of pro-German because the mother had conceived this child by a German. </sentence><sentence id="987">And the child was half German in a sense. </sentence><sentence id="988">The child would be kind of attracted to German soldiers to go out. </sentence><sentence id="989">Not the common street soldier I think, but officers. </sentence><sentence id="990">I was with these strange people. </sentence><sentence id="991">In addition, in this house they rented a room to a German officer. </sentence><sentence id="992">He was not a member of the army. </sentence><sentence id="993">He was a member of the railroad corps or something like that. </sentence><sentence id="994">The Germans liked uniforms so everybody had lots of uniforms. </sentence><sentence id="995">My father always said, "There's nothing a German likes more than uniforms." </sentence><sentence id="996">This guy had a elaborate uniform, and actually all he was a clerk I presume or a little higher level clerk in the railroad stations. </sentence><sentence id="997">Of course, all the railroads had been taken over by the Germans because this was vital to the war. </sentence><sentence id="998">I'll tell you something bizarre which I'm ashamed at this point. </sentence><sentence id="999">But it's some clowning around in that basement where these ladies lived which by the way was a basement apartment...part of the house was a basement apartment. </sentence><sentence id="1000">I would I once donned the whole uniform of this officer, strutted around in his boots with his cap on and his black...sort of blackish dark blue and everybody applauded. </sentence><sentence id="1001">They thought it was wonderful the way I looked. </sentence><sentence id="1002">I can't imagine 01:50: doing this now. </sentence><sentence id="1003">But I did. </sentence><sentence id="1004">They were very lovely. </sentence><sentence id="1005">The dangers seems enormous at this point while I'm retelling it. </sentence><sentence id="1006">To go to these people...their heart was in the right place. </sentence><sentence id="1007">They would have never said that they had a Jew visiting, because I was a son of an artist, Nardus, their childhood friend. </sentence><sentence id="1008">Anyway, I stayed with these ladies for ...I have here from January 43 to July 43. </sentence><sentence id="1009">That's my guess. </sentence><sentence id="1010">I'm not quite sure. </sentence><sentence id="1011">Seems...everything seems much longer. </sentence><sentence id="1012">But when I tried to schedule this out until the end of the war, I got in the end compressed. </sentence><sentence id="1013">It was shorter than I thought. </sentence><sentence id="1014">From there I'm not quite sure where we went, but I think what happened was that my parents...I should back track for a second. </sentence><sentence id="1015">My parents wound up in the middle of Holland in a place called Soest. </sentence><sentence id="1016">They wound up for the better part of the war with a couple. </sentence><sentence id="1017">He was an ex-Marine. </sentence><sentence id="1018">She was a ex-cleaning lady. </sentence><sentence id="1019">And these people had taken my parents in a room. </sentence><sentence id="1020">So they were always in there. </sentence><sentence id="1021">This is where my mother knitted. </sentence><sentence id="1022">My father did sketching and went crazy sometimes because no matter how good the relations were, eventually some friction would ensue with all these people, four people in a tight space, a little house. </sentence><sentence id="1023">Irritations set in. </sentence><sentence id="1024">My parents decided that it would be wonderful if they could find a little summer place for just a week to escape and just go like ordinary non-Jewish people. </sentence><sentence id="1025">Stay a week somewhere in a little hotel. </sentence><sentence id="1026">By the way, my father and I had dyed our hair. </sentence><sentence id="1027">It was supposed to come out blonde. </sentence><sentence id="1028">We dyed it with peroxide I remember except that I don't  4 know how Pop came out. </sentence><sentence id="1029">I came out red. </sentence><sentence id="1030">For the rest of the war, I had to keep this up by the way because in Holland anybody who was not blonde and Dutch I mean you know, Jews you could almost pick them out from a crowd in Holland. </sentence><sentence id="1031">There were no Italians. </sentence><sentence id="1032">There weren't any Spanish-speaking people. </sentence><sentence id="1033">The only sort of little bit outlandish looking...well, the darker looking people were Jews. </sentence><sentence id="1034">Not outlandish...darker looking. </sentence><sentence id="1035">So, anyway we dyed our hair and...and Pop and my mother decided they'd go and rent. </sentence><sentence id="1036">They rented a room in a little hotel in a very tiny hamlet called Lage Vuursche. </sentence><sentence id="1037">Lage Vuursche was to play quite a role in my life, I guess. </sentence><sentence id="1038">Lage Vuursche was a little hotel and a gas station I think and five houses and that was it. </sentence><sentence id="1039">It was very lovely. </sentence><sentence id="1040">It was like a little hamlet in the middle of the woods. </sentence><sentence id="1041">And Papa went and rented this rented this room for a week and moved in. </sentence><sentence id="1042">On sort of sideline this because it's important what my father and mother did at that point, they, as Pop told me later on, he said we weren't in that room for more than 15 minutes and there was a knock at the door, and there was a policeman there. </sentence><sentence id="1043">And he said, "I want to talk with you people." </sentence><sentence id="1044">And Papa and Mother knew that was the end. </sentence><sentence id="1045">That's it. </sentence><sentence id="1046">They were caught. </sentence><sentence id="1047">However, the man closed the door behind him and sat down and said, "I want to tell you something." </sentence><sentence id="1048">He said, "I'm a policeman in this village." </sentence><sentence id="1049">He said, "And I can readily see that you are Jews." </sentence><sentence id="1050">He said, "I want to tell you where you should walk and where you should not walk." </sentence><sentence id="1051">He said, "I'll protect you." </sentence><sentence id="1052">He said, "If anything goes wrong, I'll tell you." </sentence><sentence id="1053">This is the man I showed you a picture of, a man sitting with his wife and a child. </sentence><sentence id="1054">This is the policeman. </sentence><sentence

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1219">Q: Okay. </sentence><sentence id="1220">We can get started again. </sentence><sentence id="1221">Let's pick up where we left off. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1225">A: Okay. </sentence><sentence id="1226">We're now at July 1943 and after having spent maybe a week with my parents at this this nature lover's retreat...someone found a new place for me. </sentence><sentence id="1227">Now, I don't know who. </sentence><sentence id="1228">It's the first time that I went to work on a farm. </sentence><sentence id="1229">Now, you gotta realize I was a teenager from the city. </sentence><sentence id="1230">I'd really never done any heavy physical work in my life. </sentence><sentence id="1231">I was rather spoiled I think. </sentence><sentence id="1232">My father and my mother I remember accompanying me not very far from this place in Lage Vuursche, this little hamlet, to a road that led into farm land, grassy farm land, along a canal and you went a couple of miles and you wound up at this tiny little farmhouse. </sentence><sentence id="1233">Far away from really everything. </sentence><sentence id="1234">That's how I remember it anyway. </sentence><sentence id="1235">And a Dutch farm in that part of the country was very small and was all dairy and a few cows, and that's about all the farm I had. </sentence><sentence id="1236">I don't remember him having a wife. </sentence><sentence id="1237">I have a feeling that he had. </sentence><sentence id="1238">Now this is the first that I was placed in a place where the farmer didn't know I was Jewish. </sentence><sentence id="1239">I was now from then on...I was a Christian kid from the city where in the meantime food became less, you know. </sentence><sentence id="1240">I mean it's harder to get and everything was rationed since the Germans stole every damn thing away. </sentence><sentence id="1241">And this was sort of like a pose I presume as a kid from the city who needed fattening up and he would work for his keep. </sentence><sentence id="1242">So here I was, of course, with my red hair and dropped off at this farm. </sentence><sentence id="1243">And the first thing I had to do was wear wooden shoes. </sentence><sentence id="1244">Because that part of Holland is all I would say practically below water level I guess. </sentence><sentence id="1245">It was all green land, all meadows with..with every hundred yards or so little canals to...to drain off the water. </sentence><sentence id="1246">So wherever you went it was wet. </sentence><sentence id="1247">First thing, I had to get pair of wooden shoes because that is the ideal wear in places like that so. </sentence><sentence id="1248">I remember I'm mentioning this because wooden shoes, if you're not used to them, they're hell on your feet. </sentence><sentence id="1249">They will chafe open the upper part of your feet and your heels and this is what I did. </sentence><sentence id="1250">For about a week, I'd walk around with this blood in my...in these wooden shoes. </sentence><sentence id="1251">It's really okay for people who are used to it, but I got used to it. </sentence><sentence id="1252">You grow callouses very fast. </sentence><sentence id="1253">I had to get up at 4 o'clock in the morning and milk cows. </sentence><sentence id="1254">I had to learn how to milk cows, then carry the, you know, 40 gallon cans to a little boat. </sentence><sentence id="1255">Put them in a little row boat, then row them down to the end of the canal where I presume a cart would pick them up. </sentence><sentence id="1256">Other parts were cleaning out stables spreading manure, mowing grassland, feeding the animals, and helping by the birth of one. </sentence><sentence id="1257">I remember pulling out a calf with ropes. </sentence><sentence id="1258">For me it was hell. </sentence><sentence id="1259">It was utter hell. </sentence><sentence id="1260">I mean I was only 16 or 17 years old. </sentence><sentence id="1261">I had no parents. </sentence><sentence id="1262">I was in constant danger of my life. </sentence><sentence id="1263">By then I knew what was going on. </sentence><sentence id="1264">One wrong word, one wrong move, one wrong clue and I would have had it. </sentence><sentence id="1265">Farmer would have said when(??)_ </sentence><sentence id="1266">and he would have maybe denounced me. </sentence><sentence id="1267">Right? </sentence><sentence id="1268">Would have maybe collected some reward for delivering a Jew to the Nazis. </sentence><sentence id="1269">So, it's in that time my mother said and she swore that I  6 have said this several times. </sentence><sentence id="1270">I don't remember anything of it. </sentence><sentence id="1271">My mother swore that during...especially during that time I wanted to give myself up. </sentence><sentence id="1272">I didn't want to hide anymore. </sentence><sentence id="1273">I remember nothing of this. </sentence><sentence id="1274">But my mother has...kept good records in her head usually so I believe and she wouldn't make this up. </sentence><sentence id="1275">She said, "You were so desperate that you wanted to give yourself up and I kept saying to you...we kept saying to you, "It will pass. </sentence><sentence id="1276">It will pass." </sentence><sentence id="1277">My mother had a little sign. </sentence><sentence id="1278">It said, "This also will pass." </sentence><sentence id="1279">So things were pretty grim then. </sentence><sentence id="1280">I was a very lonely kid. </sentence><sentence id="1281">I learned to work, but it wasn't easy. </sentence><sentence id="1282">The farmer was very unhappy. </sentence><sentence id="1283">I was not much help in the beginning. </sentence><sentence id="1284">I couldn't lift 40-gallon cans. </sentence><sentence id="1285">You know...you gotta know how to do it. </sentence><sentence id="1286">I could barely walk in those God damn shoes. </sentence><sentence id="1287">I wasn't there very long. </sentence><sentence id="1288">From what I could find out, I must have been there from July 43 until September 43. </sentence><sentence id="1289">In looking at the map, the farm must have been in place called Tienhoven (?). </sentence><sentence id="1290">It's the closest I can find out. </sentence><sentence id="1291">I don't remember the man's name. </sentence><sentence id="1292">I remember that we ate badly. </sentence><sentence id="1293">He was very poor. </sentence><sentence id="1294">It was a poor little farm. </sentence><sentence id="1295">Where did I go from there? </sentence><sentence id="1296">Let me see. </sentence><sentence id="1297">Yeah, it seems to me that from September 43 for about a month, I went to my Aunt Clara in The Hague where my cousin Hans lived. </sentence><sentence id="1298">I have two more cousins, Hans, Fritz, and Tony. </sentence><sentence id="1299">They all lived in The Hague in a small house. </sentence><sentence id="1300">And I stayed with my Aunt Clara and I stayed with my Aunt Clara's in-laws, older people. </sentence><sentence id="1301">And I think it can't have been for very long. </sentence><sentence id="1302">It can't have been mostly a couple of weeks or a month. </sentence><sentence id="1303">And...yes...I remember being at my cousin Hans's grandfather and grandmother, my Aunt Clara's in-laws in The Hague. </sentence><sentence id="1304">They only lived a couple of streets apart, so I could walk from the one to the other. </sentence><sentence id="1305">And I was with these older people and they were very...very sweet. </sentence><sentence id="1306">But they only would take me for a week. </sentence><sentence id="1307">That was my.... They were scared. </sentence><sentence id="1308">It was all scary. </sentence><sentence id="1309">During that week, their son came to visit...my Aunt Clara's former husband. </sentence><sentence id="1310">They had been divorced. </sentence><sentence id="1311">And I can remember he came unexpectedly and I threw myself under the couch. </sentence><sentence id="1312">And I was lying there and I saw these footsteps going...his shoes going by. </sentence><sentence id="1313">But that whole period in The Hague, that couple of weeks or whatever it was was very wonderful. </sentence><sentence id="1314">It was with my family and my aunt. </sentence><sentence id="1315">It was with my cousin. </sentence><sentence id="1316">My cousin, Hans, and I would go out in the evening for a walk. </sentence><sentence id="1317">In the daytime, of course, I was always indoors. </sentence><sentence id="1318">In the evening we'd go and at night we'd go out and we would go to the Catholic Church and we'd sit in the back of the Catholic Church. </sentence><sentence id="1319">I had never been in my life in a Catholic Church. </sentence><sentence id="1320">So here was all this ceremony going on. </sentence><sentence id="1321">And it was wonderful. </sentence><sentence id="1322">I thought that. </sentence><sentence id="1323">They would come by with these censers and they...and the hats and all the...I thought I'd seen the Pope every time. </sentence><sentence id="1324">I said...I came back to my Aunt Clara, "I saw the Pope." </sentence><sentence id="1325">And she laughed. </sentence><sentence id="1326">This was our entertainment. </sentence><sentence id="1327">We'd go to the church and sit in the back in a pew and watch the processions going. </sentence><sentence id="1328">It it was a wonderful time, but we couldn't stay there. </sentence><sentence id="1329">Everybody was dead scared, you know. </sentence><sentence id="1330">My Aunt who was Jewish herself, of course. </sentence><sentence id="1331">Her children...the only thing that saved her I guess was her children were half Jewish. </sentence><sentence id="1332">So I had to leave. </sentence><sentence id="1333">Now from my recollection what happened was that from there in October 1943, I went back with the help of this policeman to the Lage Vuursche, but not to that little hotel where my parents had stayed for a week. </sentence><sentence id="1334">The policeman had helped to I say build a camp, a underground resistance camp, in one of the woods nearby. </sentence><sentence id="1335">It was right next to a Catholic, what do you call a place where nuns? </sentence><sentence id="1336"> 7 </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1450">Q: Convent. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1452">A: Convent. </sentence><sentence id="1453">Right next to a convent. </sentence><sentence id="1454">There was the fence of the convent and then there was...in Holland, you don't really have large forests. </sentence><sentence id="1455">And in Lage Vuursche at that time, they were like rectangles of forests. </sentence><sentence id="1456">Not very high trees...trees maybe 50, 60 feet maybe at most or something you know. </sentence><sentence id="1457">all planted...these were planted forests. </sentence><sentence id="1458">In the middle of that, the resistance...members of the resistance had dug out a camp. </sentence><sentence id="1459">It was half underground and then covered with timbers and on the timbers sod and on top of the sod, grass and trees and plants. </sentence><sentence id="1460">So that if you would stand right next to it, you wouldn't know it was there. </sentence><sentence id="1461">The entrance to it...well, there was one entrance. </sentence><sentence id="1462">It was sort of dug out was hidden by little pine trees that were cut from some other forests and put there so that...and footsteps were erased, so that you could stand almost in front of this place and you wouldn't know there was anything there. </sentence><sentence id="1463">The entrance to this underground resistance camp was by a very cicuitous road. </sentence><sentence id="1464">It started if...if you can visualize a rectangle...it started in one end and you sort of...it's a little bit like one of these puzzles...how to get out of the maze. </sentence><sentence id="1465">It would swirl around and swirl around and then finally wind up in the center at this camp. </sentence><sentence id="1466">This was in order...also to not have a straight path and not see footsteps and all that. </sentence><sentence id="1467">It was very cleverly done. </sentence><sentence id="1468">Food was and I must mention this wonderful... Food was delivered to us by the nuns of the convent. </sentence><sentence id="1469">Food was delivered to us on their side of the fence and we would lift it over the fence. </sentence><sentence id="1470">It was a high fence...about a 6 or 8 foot high fence. </sentence><sentence id="1471">We would...either we had cut an opening. </sentence><sentence id="1472">Warm food in the evening. </sentence><sentence id="1473">Yes. </sentence><sentence id="1474">It was wonderful. </sentence><sentence id="1475">Nobody knew at first. </sentence><sentence id="1476">The nuns didn't know anything. </sentence><sentence id="1477">The convent was a convent. </sentence><sentence id="1478">The only one who kept all the contact was the policeman. </sentence><sentence id="1479">He had to come back between the nuns and the Nazis. </sentence><sentence id="1480">Now this man posed as a Nazi you see. </sentence><sentence id="1481">This man had intimate contact with the Germans, who thought he was real hero. </sentence><sentence id="1482">You see, there was a Dutch Nazi party called the NSB, The National Socialist Bond and he was a member of that. </sentence><sentence id="1483">He posed very cleverly as a Nazi and played a dual role. </sentence><sentence id="1484">His real heart was with us, I must say. </sentence><sentence id="1485">I was in that camp I do not know how long. </sentence><sentence id="1486">I tried to find out. </sentence><sentence id="1487">It seemed to be me I can't have been there any longer than 1 to 3 months really. </sentence><sentence id="1488">It seemed like a long time. </sentence><sentence id="1489">In that camp I was a non-active member because I was very young first of all. </sentence><sentence id="1490">Most of the members were grown up men. </sentence><sentence id="1491">And the only thing that l actively did there was when they would bring in English or American flying personnel that had been shot down somewhere in Holland some of those they would convey to our underground hideout and I remember I spoke English for some reason. </sentence><sentence id="1492">Now I had lived, of course, for 3 years in the States when I was a little kid, like I told you but I spoke enough English for some...I can't recall how. </sentence><sentence id="1493">I learned some English in high school. </sentence><sentence id="1494">I forgot. </sentence><sentence id="1495">Yeah. </sentence><sentence id="1496">I learned some English in high school and I guess probably what was still resided in the back of my head. </sentence><sentence id="1497">I was designated to find out if these guys were for real because the Nazi would sometimes pose fake flyers and and that discover members of the underground. </sentence><sentence id="1498">So I was designated to sit with these men and interview them. </sentence><sentence id="1499">You know, just like you're interviewing me now, but in a very casual manner and find out if they were real or not. </sentence><sentence id="1500">And I remember sitting up a whole night with a English navigator and a Canadian gunner to find out and they were real alright. </sentence><sentence id="1501">Because the Canadian gunner told me about he would hunt bears. </sentence><sentence id="1502">And their river __ somewhere in the north near the polar  8 circle and he talked very real. </sentence><sentence id="1503">And the English was differently, told about his family and his home somewhere in England. </sentence><sentence id="1504">So that's what I did. </sentence><sentence id="1505">And the rest I don't know what I did. </sentence><sentence id="1506">I guess I learned to play chess. </sentence><sentence id="1507">We listened to classical music. </sentence><sentence id="1508">We had...the members were all over the place as far as denomination or whatever...religions. </sentence><sentence id="1509">There was one communists. </sentence><sentence id="1510">There was one very Christian man. </sentence><sentence id="1511">There was a shoemaker. </sentence><sentence id="1512">There was a bookkeeper. </sentence><sentence id="1513">And there were people who would come in and out. </sentence><sentence id="1514">Women, messengers nearby in the woods were covered caches of guns and ammunition and all that. </sentence><sentence id="1515">They would go out on night raids and raid town halls and city halls for stamps such as you can see on my false identity card. </sentence><sentence id="1516">So we had there a whole like place where they would also steal identify cards and they would falsify them. </sentence><sentence id="1517">So this was sort of like a center like that. </sentence><sentence id="1518">Sometime my guess it was December...sometime during December 1943, our policeman...our friendly policeman gave the warning that he had heard rumors about a raid and it was decided by the members of the camp that we would post guards on the periphery near where the road was...in shifts. </sentence><sentence id="1519">And it happened that a young man...shoemaker...and I got the shift from midnight until or maybe from 4 AM to 8...8 AM. </sentence><sentence id="1520">I think we had four hour shifts. </sentence><sentence id="1521">Everybody else was in bed in the camp. </sentence><sentence id="1522">It was very quiet. </sentence><sentence id="1523">It was very quiet in the morning. </sentence><sentence id="1524">It was overcast. </sentence><sentence id="1525">It was dark. </sentence><sentence id="1526">It was 4 o'clock in the morning, 5. </sentence><sentence id="1527">We heard noise. </sentence><sentence id="1528">We heard like trucks coming up the road, and these little slits of lights and then we saw them come driving up the road. </sentence><sentence id="1529">Now we thought maybe they'd pass by. </sentence><sentence id="1530">Maybe it was just a German convoy going someplace else. </sentence><sentence id="1531">But they stopped like 200 yards away from us. </sentence><sentence id="1532">And they started to dismount. </sentence><sentence id="1533">There were hundreds. </sentence><sentence id="1534">They dismounted, they had dogs. </sentence><sentence id="1535">They had machine guns. </sentence><sentence id="1536">They lined up in hundreds. </sentence><sentence id="1537">Their information was sketchy I presume. </sentence><sentence id="1538">They didn't know what they were going to find. </sentence><sentence id="1539">They knew there was a resistance camp there. </sentence><sentence id="1540">They thought...maybe have thought find a couple hundred resistance men with...with guns. </sentence><sentence id="1541">They came with searchlights. </sentence><sentence id="1542">It was a big, big operation. </sentence><sentence id="1543">As soon as we realized this was it, we ran back to this path...this crazy path...ran into the...into the camp, shouted at the top of our lungs, "The Germans...the Germans. </sentence><sentence id="1544">They're coming. </sentence><sentence id="1545">They're here. </sentence><sentence id="1546">They're here." </sentence><sentence id="1547">Well, it was pandemonium. </sentence><sentence id="1548">You know, these guys trying to jump out of their beds in pajamas and without pajamas trying to get into clothes. </sentence><sentence id="1549">We didn't stop. </sentence><sentence id="1550">As soon as we realized that everybody had been, you know, knew what it was, we fled out. </sentence><sentence id="1551">And just as we were fled out of this rectangle of woods, we saw the Germans coming from around the corner on that side and around the corner on this side, circling. </sentence><sentence id="1552">So he and I...this young man who I don't know his name anymore, just ran into the next wood and into the next wood and into the next wood, and we ran and ran and ran. </sentence><sentence id="1553">We must have run for, I don't know, maybe three quarters of an hour till we were far, far away from that place. </sentence><sentence id="1554">We had made an agreement though...the members of this resistance camp...they were very well organized. </sentence><sentence id="1555">They said if ever there's a raid we will meet again after it's over at a certain, particular place about 2 miles from the camp. </sentence><sentence id="1556">This was the way it was organized. </sentence><sentence id="1557">So we ran and ran and ran and we really didn't know where the hell to go and I said, "You know what? </sentence><sentence id="1558">My father is taking painting lessons  9 somewhere." </sentence><sentence id="1559">Pop you see we had a strange kind of hiding life. </sentence><sentence id="1560">Papa and my mother were hiding in this room, but once a week Pop would get out on his bicycle I think and peddle to this nearby town where there was a painter who gave him lessons. </sentence><sentence id="1561">I'm not sure this...this painter knew he was Jewish. </sentence><sentence id="1562">I think he probably did. </sentence><sentence id="1563">I know my brothers and I have paintings hanging on his mantle. </sentence><sentence id="1564">So I have a painting by Mr.Schluter of all many other German names. </sentence><sentence id="1565">Mr. Schluter. </sentence><sentence id="1566">It's a very good painting...Dutch painting. </sentence><sentence id="1567">So I knew Pop was there. </sentence><sentence id="1568">How I don't know. </sentence><sentence id="1569">I guess it was like a Wednesday or whatever. </sentence><sentence id="1570">So I said, "Let's go there." </sentence><sentence id="1571">What I didn't realize at that point that I been so shocked. </sentence><sentence id="1572">I'm sitting here, I'm still shocked now. </sentence><sentence id="1573">At that point I didn't realize. </sentence><sentence id="1574">I was like just a boy running. </sentence><sentence id="1575">I thought, "Well, we ran and we made it." </sentence><sentence id="1576">Somehow or another I found this painter. </sentence><sentence id="1577">This boy and I we came there. </sentence><sentence id="1578">This young man and I, we came there and there was my father sitting and painting and very quiet. </sentence><sentence id="1579">And I said, "Pop, I got to talk with you." </sentence><sentence id="1580">He said, "Yes." </sentence><sentence id="1581">I said, "Something terrible is happening." </sentence><sentence id="1582">He said, "What happened?" </sentence><sentence id="1583">I said, "The Germans came for us." " </sentence><sentence id="1584">Oh," he said. " </sentence><sentence id="1585">Well," he said, "You're here now." </sentence><sentence id="1586">Pop never understood things too well. " </sentence><sentence id="1587">Well, you're here now. </sentence><sentence id="1588">Relax." </sentence><sentence id="1589">I said, "Yes, but all these men are there and they're all surrounded." </sentence><sentence id="1590">He said, "Oh. </sentence><sentence id="1591">What do you want to do?" </sentence><sentence id="1592">I said, "I don't know what to do." </sentence><sentence id="1593">Christ, I was only...what was I...16, 17 years old boy. </sentence><sentence id="1594">I didn't know what the hell to do in this situation. </sentence><sentence id="1595">Nobody did ever tell if they later come with...as later on found half a division of men with search lights and dogs and machine guns and anti-aircraft...anti...1 mean anti-tank guns and anti-aircraft stuff. </sentence><sentence id="1596">I mean...not to shoot down planes, but kind of, you know guns to...heavier stuff. </sentence><sentence id="1597">They didn't know what they would find. </sentence><sentence id="1598">I said, "Pop, we suppose to meet later on again after dark." " </sentence><sentence id="1599">Oh," he said, "Well, okay. </sentence><sentence id="1600">Then stay here for a time and then you'll meet them after dark." </sentence><sentence id="1601">So we stayed there from all I can remember. </sentence><sentence id="1602">Well, I was...you know, I was in shock. </sentence><sentence id="1603">Pop didn't know it. </sentence><sentence id="1604">Nobody else knew it. </sentence><sentence id="1605">I didn't know it. </sentence><sentence id="1606">It got dark. </sentence><sentence id="1607">Pop in the meantime, I guess, had gone back to his...peddled back to my mother's and gone into his room again and he must have told my mother what was going on. </sentence><sentence id="1608">My mother was much sharper, you see. </sentence><sentence id="1609">Always was. </sentence><sentence id="1610">It got dark, and this young man and I wandered back into what we didn't realize was a huge net which had been set up by the Germans...wondered back into this hugh circle and waited at this spot. </sentence><sentence id="1611">Nobody showed up. </sentence><sentence id="1612">Except one person. </sentence><sentence id="1613">My mother. </sentence><sentence id="1614">She said to the young man and to me...she said, "We will just act like we are lovers. </sentence><sentence id="1615">We will just be a threesome and we'll laugh and we'll act." </sentence><sentence id="1616">I said, "What about my gun?" </sentence><sentence id="1617">I had a 9 millimeter Mauser pistol with me and so did he. </sentence><sentence id="1618">We were armed. </sentence><sentence id="1619">My mother took the guns and she buried them somewhere under a tree and we got to a point where there was a German guard. </sentence><sentence id="1620">Then we laughed it up and we kissed and we hugged and he laughed and he let us through. </sentence><sentence id="1621">And I spent that first night...the boy I don't know where he went, but he went off some place else. </sentence><sentence id="1622">I went with my parents to their hiding place, and spent a night...restless, every home there...their place was right on the highway. </sentence><sentence id="1623">Every time a truck came back I was like this. </sentence><sentence id="1624">For years afterwards, every time a truck went by. </sentence><sentence id="1625">I stayed only one night there because they didn't dare to have me in addition, of course, and I went into a...I was I think again helped by this policeman. </sentence><sentence id="1626">I went for a short while in Hilversum. </sentence><sentence id="1627">It's a nearby town to a home of a notary public and his sister. </sentence><sentence id="1628">Lovely people. </sentence><sentence id="1629">Lived in a mansion from what I remember. </sentence><sentence id="1630">It's probably larger...rather a large house. </sentence><sentence id="1631">They gave me a room with maid service. </sentence><sentence id="1632">Yeah. </sentence><sentence id="1633">Gave me a room with maid  0 service, and it was just what I needed because there's a little picture in the group of small pictures of hiding places that looks out on the garden. </sentence><sentence id="1634">That was my view. </sentence><sentence id="1635">And there was a bookcase. </sentence><sentence id="1636">I was growing up fast. </sentence><sentence id="1637">By then, I wasn't anymore a boy I think. </sentence><sentence id="1638">It's an interesting thing what happened to me there in that I came from a family that was terribly non-religious. </sentence><sentence id="1639">Matter of fact, my father hated anything that smacked of religion. </sentence><sentence id="1640">He always felt that priests and ministers and rabbis were all the same breed and organized religion was hell, and he didn't want to have anything to do with it. </sentence><sentence id="1641">I never was religious either. </sentence><sentence id="1642">I didn't know anything about being Jewish very much. </sentence><sentence id="1643">I was in that room and there was a Bible in the bookcase. </sentence><sentence id="1644">It was a Bible for reading. </sentence><sentence id="1645">A nice big edition. </sentence><sentence id="1646">I'd never read a word in the Bible in my life. </sentence><sentence id="1647">I thought it would be interesting to...as I said, I said I was growing up fast. </sentence><sentence id="1648">I thought maybe I should read something, and something philosophical. </sentence><sentence id="1649">I grabbed the Bible. </sentence><sentence id="1650">I opened it. </sentence><sentence id="1651">I opened it onto one of the prophets. </sentence><sentence id="1652">I think Jeremiah. </sentence><sentence id="1653">And what I read was, "and you shall try to sell yourself and nobody will want to buy you, and you shall try to hide and nobody...nobody will take you." </sentence><sentence id="1654">And on and on and on it went. </sentence><sentence id="1655">And I said, "Gees, this is my story. </sentence><sentence id="1656">This is me." </sentence><sentence id="1657">You know. </sentence><sentence id="1658">I got instant religion, I got instant...it was not instant. </sentence><sentence id="1659">I read through the whole Old Testament. </sentence><sentence id="1660">It was a revelation to me. </sentence><sentence id="1661">Something to hold on to. </sentence><sentence id="1662">All of a sudden, here was my people. </sentence><sentence id="1663">This is my history. </sentence><sentence id="1664">And I pledged...I pledged to God if he would save all my family, I would be religious to the end of my life. </sentence><sentence id="1665">I'm ashamed to say I didn't keep the promise. </sentence><sentence id="1666">I tried to keep it for some years after the war, but it slowly leaked away, especially after I found out that God had let 6 million others perish. </sentence><sentence id="1667">Anyway, I got instant religion. </sentence><sentence id="1668">And I got a Bible. </sentence><sentence id="1669">I got a Bible. </sentence><sentence id="1670">I think I got it for free from the Bible Society. </sentence><sentence id="1671">And I carried that Bible with me from there on wherever I went. </sentence><sentence id="1672">I went from that house...I went back to farming. </sentence><sentence id="1673">But in better farms. </sentence><sentence id="1674">I went from December...We're now at December 43 and I must have been there a few weeks in this house, maybe a month and I recuperated to a great extent. </sentence><sentence id="1675">At least the jitters left me. </sentence><sentence id="1676">I had been very close to death I realized. </sentence><sentence id="1677">And I went out to a farm. </sentence><sentence id="1678">I don't know if the policeman again helped me there with the first farm. </sentence><sentence id="1679">It may well have been because I have the feeling these people knew I was Jewish. </sentence><sentence id="1680">This was an entirely different kind of farm. </sentence><sentence id="1681">This was in the eastern part of Holland more...this was a rotund farm with rotund wife and three rotund daughters. </sentence><sentence id="1682">Big apple cheeks, just like you expect farmers to look. </sentence><sentence id="1683">And they were jolly people, and they were friendly and they ate well. </sentence><sentence id="1684">And by this time, I also knew how to work better. </sentence><sentence id="1685">You know, I again cleaned stables. </sentence><sentence id="1686">I milked cows. </sentence><sentence id="1687">I got very good at milking. </sentence><sentence id="1688">I could milk 14 head of cow in the morning. </sentence><sentence id="1689">You know, I went from that farm to another farm and there I got the shock of my life one morning. </sentence><sentence id="1690">And everywhere I went I read the Bible, which worked excellently because these people didn't know I was Jewish, and they thought I was a very Christian boy. </sentence><sentence id="1691">Little did they know I only read the Old Testament. </sentence><sentence id="1692">Whatever... I slept like Dutch farm hands do in a little room with a straw...bag with straw...straw in it, a straw mattress. </sentence><sentence id="1693">And right in with the animals portion of the house. </sentence><sentence id="1694">I was used to it. </sentence><sentence id="1695">One morning I woke up I heard German voices. </sentence><sentence id="1696">I thought this is it. </sentence><sentence id="1697">Again, this is it. </sentence><sentence id="1698">German voices. </sentence><sentence id="1699">However...I mean it was like dying. </sentence><sentence id="1700">I tell this now you know.... Well, let me finish this first. </sentence><sentence id="1701">It was like dying. </sentence><sentence id="1702">All they came to do is steal a couple of head of cattle. </sentence><sentence id="1703">They had a truck, and they carried them off you know. </sentence><sentence id="1704">I thought it was it. </sentence><sentence id="1705">This is it. </sentence><sentence id="1706">This is me. </sentence><sentence id="1707">You know, as I am telling you it seemed to me that I was in good shape. </sentence><sentence id="1708">However,  1 Ihave been for...the last 22 years in psychotherapy and I tell this story very often over and over again to my psychiatrist. </sentence><sentence id="1709">That on those farms I trained myself to such an extent to forget things that if 1 would walk from here to the door if you had asked me at the door where did you come from, I wouldn't know. </sentence><sentence id="1710">If you ask me where did you go, I would say to the door. </sentence><sentence id="1711">But beyond that, I don't know. </sentence><sentence id="1712">I lived in like a tiny segment of time. </sentence><sentence id="1713">I presume that the past and the possible future were too awful to contemplate so that... It was a strange thing. </sentence><sentence id="1714">Anyway, I worked on these farms and I worked very well. </sentence><sentence id="1715">The last farm I worked got to be winter from all I could find. </sentence><sentence id="1716">Well, now it...from December 1943 to what I figure is August 44, I worked on farms as a farm hand. </sentence><sentence id="1717">I would actually go to the towns where I worked and register at the town hall with my false identify card, which is quite dangerous. </sentence><sentence id="1718">If I would have run into someone who would have recognized what the signs of a false identify card was, I would have been caught. </sentence><sentence id="1719">However, they would register me. </sentence><sentence id="1720">These were Dutch clerks, you know. </sentence><sentence id="1721">My brothers were somewhere...I don't know. </sentence><sentence id="1722">On one of the farms my...one of my brothers...my brother, At, came over for a week and stayed with me. </sentence><sentence id="1723">He was billed as Ed's brother who came from the city who also needed some fattening up. </sentence><sentence id="1724">Actually, he came from some hiding place that I don't know. </sentence><sentence id="1725">My brother could tell you. </sentence><sentence id="1726">My parents were still in their own...in their little place. </sentence><sentence id="1727">But my mother had a plan. </sentence><sentence id="1728">She did a lot of traveling around taking care of places for my brother. </sentence><sentence id="1729">My brother, Fred, almost died here. </sentence><sentence id="1730">I don't know...he had pneumonia, and nobody took care of him. </sentence><sentence id="1731">She found him with high fever somewhere, got him to a hospital. </sentence><sentence id="1732">You see, my mother did all kinds of things. </sentence><sentence id="1733">She traveled. </sentence><sentence id="1734">My mother had a plan. </sentence><sentence id="1735">She had a plan for summer of 1944.She would rent a little cottage, and she would spend it together with my father there as people from the city who came to rent a little place for the summer. </sentence><sentence id="1736">Like you would do any place. </sentence><sentence id="1737">And my two brothers would come there too at times, and would be like having her children around her for a little bit my mother said. </sentence><sentence id="1738">And as she traveled toward my brother...let me not lose track of the time, we're now talking spring of 1944, May 1944. </sentence><sentence id="1739">I was working on farms. </sentence><sentence id="1740">My brothers were in the south of Holland, spread around. </sentence><sentence id="1741">My parents were still in Soest with those two people. </sentence><sentence id="1742">My brother traveled toward my brother or came back from my brother in the south, again arranging another home which was...my brother, At, was a very difficult child. </sentence><sentence id="1743">He was a very nervous child. </sentence><sentence id="1744">It was difficult. </sentence><sentence id="1745">He would wet his bed. </sentence><sentence id="1746">And people wouldn't have anymore. </sentence><sentence id="1747">And it was all very difficult. </sentence><sentence id="1748">I think those boys also went as Christian boys by the way, not just Jewish kids. </sentence><sentence id="1749">They had to pray. </sentence><sentence id="1750">They learned to pray and, you know, all this stuff. </sentence><sentence id="1751">My mother on her way back in May 44...I think it was in Utrecht, somewhere in a railroad station ran into a Gestapo character, green police member who could recognize falsified identify cards, nabbed her and sent her to a Dutch concentration camp, in Westerbork. </sentence><sentence id="1752">From there, she was shipped to Bergen-Belsen in the fall of 44. </sentence><sentence id="1753">I was at the farm. </sentence><sentence id="1754">Pop decided that the little house had been rented already by my mother. </sentence><sentence id="1755">He might as well go there. </sentence><sentence id="1756">He went. </sentence><sentence id="1757">My two little brothers were delivered there by an aunt of mine. </sentence><sentence id="1758">My father had two brothers. </sentence><sentence id="1759">I'm not quite clear. </sentence><sentence id="1760">At some point, we visited them because they were now not  2 very far from where I was working on the farm, about an hour bicycling. </sentence><sentence id="1761">So I visited them, and decided Pop needs helps with these two boys. </sentence><sentence id="1762">By this time I was a man. </sentence><sentence id="1763">I had been working on farms. </sentence><sentence id="1764">I'd been laughing at jokes about Jews at the breakfast table with farmers. </sentence><sentence id="1765">I had learned my lesson. </sentence><sentence id="1766">And I decided Pop needed help. </sentence><sentence id="1767">So I gave up my job at the farm. </sentence><sentence id="1768">bicycled and joined my father and my two brothers. </sentence><sentence id="1769">I guess this is around August 44. </sentence><sentence id="1770">And that's how four of us spent the ending of the war. </sentence><sentence id="1771">Minus my mother, of course, who we knew now had been shipped to Bergen-Belsen. </sentence><sentence id="1772">We still didn't know that they were destroying Jews. </sentence><sentence id="1773">We still didn't know what was going on. </sentence><sentence id="1774">We knew there was a concentration camp. </sentence><sentence id="1775">We didn't know they were killing people. </sentence><sentence id="1776">May 44, my mother was caught. </sentence><sentence id="1777">We spent the winter of 44 in this tiny little cottage of which you have a drawing of mine. </sentence><sentence id="1778">We installed a stove when it got to be winter. </sentence><sentence id="1779">The owner of the cottage lived right next door in a beautiful home didn't know we were Jewish. </sentence><sentence id="1780">He thought we were family from the city who didn't have enough to eat anymore. </sentence><sentence id="1781">By this time things were getting very desperate in Holland. </sentence><sentence id="1782">And he was no friend of ours because, as Pop told me, one of the first days that he was in this cottage this gentleman said to him, "Mr. Lessing, would you like to take a walk and I'll show you the property. </sentence><sentence id="1783">I have many fruit trees and so on." </sentence><sentence id="1784">And Pop said, "Sure. </sentence><sentence id="1785">Sure." </sentence><sentence id="1786">And acted very civilized and took a walk around and as they were walking, the gentleman meandered in talking about the war situation which could hardly help because it had been going on then for about 4, 5 years and he said, "It's a terrible situation with the war." </sentence><sentence id="1787">My father said, "No doubt. </sentence><sentence id="1788">No doubt." </sentence><sentence id="1789">And he said, "Those Germans," he said, "they are terrible." " </sentence><sentence id="1790">No doubt," said my father, "no doubt." " </sentence><sentence id="1791">They are almost as bad as the Jews." " </sentence><sentence id="1792">No doubt," said my father, "no doubt. </sentence><sentence id="1793">You said it." </sentence><sentence id="1794">We then proceeded to steal every Goddamn thing we could find on his property and sell it to the farmers in the area to get bread so I mean I felt so sorry about this. </sentence><sentence id="1795">This man had interesting then...a natural fruit, no artificial fertilizers, nothing...no sprays...natural fruit farm. </sentence><sentence id="1796">He had thousands of of these what you call these...these glass jars in which you preserve...preserve fruits in. </sentence><sentence id="1797">Farmers wanted those very much. </sentence><sentence id="1798">We sold them by the hundreds and survived the war there. </sentence><sentence id="1799">It's a long story that. </sentence><sentence id="1800">I don't know how much time I still have to tell you, but to tell you stories about that little house. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2154">Q: Tell us some. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2156">A: Some. </sentence><sentence id="2157">Alright. </sentence><sentence id="2158">I'll tell you some of the interesting highlights. </sentence><sentence id="2159">Since there was no kitchen in this little cottage, we put a stove in. </sentence><sentence id="2160">Anything was on a very heavy protest of the gentleman next door. </sentence><sentence id="2161">But we said, "Well, we don't want to go back to the city." </sentence><sentence id="2162">We put in a stove. </sentence><sentence id="2163">We needed fuel. </sentence><sentence id="2164">Every night my father and I would go out to a nearby woods where they had high pine trees and with our little saw we would cut apart one of the pine trees and then cut of the branches and spread them around so it wasn't too... We'd go into the forest so you wouldn't see them. </sentence><sentence id="2165">Yeah. </sentence><sentence id="2166">We'd carry this tree on our shoulders. </sentence><sentence id="2167">We had shoulder pads specially made, carried it home, and we cut it up into portions and the next  3 day we would split it and we would cook. </sentence><sentence id="2168">We didn't have salt, so my father found that the farmers had on the corners of their meadows, bit blocks of salt for the cows to lick on. </sentence><sentence id="2169">They called it cow licks I think. </sentence><sentence id="2170">And we'd steal those, and we'd break those in pieces and hammer them down and then boil them in water and then out of that sediment, we'd boil away and out of that we'd have salt. </sentence><sentence id="2171">We got the news from the nearby homes where there many people hidden. </sentence><sentence id="2172">And so every night we go and listen to radio Orange so we got the news from there. </sentence><sentence id="2173">One morning I woke up. </sentence><sentence id="2174">There was something draped over the window of the cottage. </sentence><sentence id="2175">A huge orange parachute. </sentence><sentence id="2176">We're talking now about probably November 44. </sentence><sentence id="2177">I went out the little house and looked around and the ground was covered with parachutes and containers with...as I opened one...guns. </sentence><sentence id="2178">I thought, "This is trouble. </sentence><sentence id="2179">This is trouble for us." </sentence><sentence id="2180">Radios. </sentence><sentence id="2181">Shoes. </sentence><sentence id="2182">Uniforms. </sentence><sentence id="2183">Everything dropped for the resistance. </sentence><sentence id="2184">Miss dropped. </sentence><sentence id="2185">Dropped in the wrong place. </sentence><sentence id="2186">Soon the Germans showed up. </sentence><sentence id="2187">I was still...I presume...too...too adventurous. </sentence><sentence id="2188">I stole a parachute. </sentence><sentence id="2189">I figured we could make blouses out of it or something. </sentence><sentence id="2190">You know, everything was pretty desperate. </sentence><sentence id="2191">Clothing, everything. </sentence><sentence id="2192">I took a parachute. </sentence><sentence id="2193">The goddamn Germans counted the containers and the parachutes and came to our little house and said, "We're missing a parachute. </sentence><sentence id="2194">If it isn't back here within a half hour, we shoot the four of you. </sentence><sentence id="2195">I just brought the parachute back. </sentence><sentence id="2196">They left. </sentence><sentence id="2197">They were really Wehrmacht. </sentence><sentence id="2198">They were really army. </sentence><sentence id="2199">They were...come to persecute Jews. </sentence><sentence id="2200">However, I still had hidden a container with a friend of mine under a... There's a container had fallen under a tree trunk. </sentence><sentence id="2201">That tree had fallen over in a storm. </sentence><sentence id="2202">They never found it. </sentence><sentence id="2203">So we had some English cigarettes and we had chocolates. </sentence><sentence id="2204">We had a couple of things for a little while. </sentence><sentence id="2205">The winter of 44 was very harsh. </sentence><sentence id="2206">We ran out of everything. </sentence><sentence id="2207">We went begging for food. </sentence><sentence id="2208">My brothers we went begging for sandwiches, which was sometimes funny too but I won't go into detail unless I still have time. </sentence><sentence id="2209">But we went begging for sandwiches and we went begging for grain and then we would out of the grain make boiled bread and so on and we were far better off than some of the people in the west of Holland. </sentence><sentence id="2210">At least we could get our hands on some foods. </sentence><sentence id="2211">And we stayed there in the very harsh winter. </sentence><sentence id="2212">My father and I made a trip by bicycle to some of the farms where I had worked. </sentence><sentence id="2213">And we got a couple of eggs and a quart of milk and carried it all back. </sentence><sentence id="2214">And so my brothers worked too...went out begging for grain when they were thrashing..when there was a thrashing machine nearby. </sentence><sentence id="2215">And so the winter went. </sentence><sentence id="2216">And we burned up trees and the forest got pretty thin, and then came the spring. </sentence><sentence id="2217">And it came a tremendous noise and firing and guns and we said, "This is it." </sentence><sentence id="2218">It was Armhem. </sentence><sentence id="2219">No, sorry. </sentence><sentence id="2220">Got it mixed up. </sentence><sentence id="2221">That was in the fall, 44. </sentence><sentence id="2222">Tremendous firing of guns and we said, "This is it. </sentence><sentence id="2223">Freedom! </sentence><sentence id="2224">They're coming." </sentence><sentence id="2225">And it was Arnhem . </sentence><sentence id="2226">And they got defeated as you probably know, and everything stopped for the winter. </sentence><sentence id="2227">But then in the spring, in April, the end of April...I think the beginning of May...May was always an important month for us. </sentence><sentence id="2228">Everything happened in May. </sentence><sentence id="2229">My birthday. </sentence><sentence id="2230">The Germans. </sentence><sentence id="2231">My mother got caught. </sentence><sentence id="2232">We just found out that my mother is still alive, again in May. </sentence><sentence id="2233">Then in May, noise came. </sentence><sentence id="2234">Firing started. </sentence><sentence id="2235">Grenades started flying over. </sentence><sentence id="2236">Explosions. </sentence><sentence id="2237">It was war. </sentence><sentence id="2238">And we were in the center of it. </sentence><sentence id="2239">So we had a dugout where we could hide. </sentence><sentence id="2240">And I don't know if there's enough time? </sentence><sentence id="2241">Is there still enough time for a little story? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2328">Q: Yes. </sentence><sentence id="2329"> 4 </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2332">A: Because this is a cute story. </sentence><sentence id="2333">I don't want to miss it. </sentence><sentence id="2334">Not everything is so heavy. </sentence><sentence id="2335">This is a cute story. </sentence><sentence id="2336">The farmers around us...we lived...the little cottage was actually in the middle of farm country. </sentence><sentence id="2337">There were little farms around. </sentence><sentence id="2338">The farmers never gave us anything. </sentence><sentence id="2339">We would ask them for some bread. </sentence><sentence id="2340">Naw, we ain't got bread. </sentence><sentence id="2341">We had to go a little further away and beg. </sentence><sentence id="2342">As the firing came nearer and nearer, branches started falling off the trees, bullets whizzing around. </sentence><sentence id="2343">Just like you see in a wild west movie. </sentence><sentence id="2344">One of the farmers came over and said, "You want a duck?" </sentence><sentence id="2345">My father said, "A duck? </sentence><sentence id="2346">A real duck?" " </sentence><sentence id="2347">Yeah," you want a duck?" " </sentence><sentence id="2348">Yeah," said my father, "I want a duck. </sentence><sentence id="2349">Sure." </sentence><sentence id="2350">He said, "Okay, here's a duck." </sentence><sentence id="2351">We got this duck which was riddled with shrapnel. </sentence><sentence id="2352">It had been hit by a grenade or something. </sentence><sentence id="2353">Anyway, we took the pieces of steel out and we put it in the fire and started frying the duck. </sentence><sentence id="2354">The fighting got so heavy though that my Pop sent the boys...my brothers into the dugout with that gentleman with his family. </sentence><sentence id="2355">And we didn't want to leave the duck. </sentence><sentence id="2356">I mean a duck, we hadn't eaten any meat for God knows how long. </sentence><sentence id="2357">So the duck was doing okay, but the fire was getting lower so, the stuff was breezing right around our... So finally the duck was done, and we crawled on our bellies, Pop holding the pot with the duck toward the dugout. </sentence><sentence id="2358">And we were in this underground dugout for two days and two nights. </sentence><sentence id="2359">This shell fire was hell. </sentence><sentence id="2360">It was awful. </sentence><sentence id="2361">I mean it...it just holes like, you know, the size of a good size room were dug right around us. </sentence><sentence id="2362">And it stopped. </sentence><sentence id="2363">We heard voices. </sentence><sentence id="2364">Oh, my God, this is it. </sentence><sentence id="2365">Freedom. </sentence><sentence id="2366">German voices. </sentence><sentence id="2367">Two German soldiers with machine guns going right over our dugout. </sentence><sentence id="2368">It's the last Germans I saw. </sentence><sentence id="2369">The last Germans in uniform I saw. </sentence><sentence id="2370">I don't know where they went. </sentence><sentence id="2371">Firing started up again. </sentence><sentence id="2372">It lasted for awhile. </sentence><sentence id="2373">Silence again. </sentence><sentence id="2374">I said to Pop, "Let's go out and see what's happening." </sentence><sentence id="2375">Pop and I walked out of the dugout. </sentence><sentence id="2376">We got in front and I can't demonstrate this here. </sentence><sentence id="2377">We stood un and we both went risht to our knees on the  5 edge of the village with two guys with machine guns post in the street and he had to rattle his way on the bicycle. </sentence><sentence id="2378">In those days there were no more tires that had air in them. </sentence><sentence id="2379">So we made tires out of old car tires. </sentence><sentence id="2380">We cut strips of old car tires. </sentence><sentence id="2381">But, of course, this was solid. </sentence><sentence id="2382">It was like driving on wood you know. </sentence><sentence id="2383">I mean it was like the bicycle rattled and made a horrendous noise, so these two Canadian soldiers must have heard him coming from a mile. </sentence><sentence id="2384">But they were on their alert, and he rattled right in front of them and he pointed the machine gun on him and said, "Who the hell are you?" </sentence><sentence id="2385">He said, "I'm going for some food." </sentence><sentence id="2386">He said, "Get the fuck off the street." </sentence><sentence id="2387">And he passed by and he came back home. </sentence><sentence id="2388">And that was the second time in the war. </sentence><sentence id="2389">At the beginning and the end he almost got killed. </sentence><sentence id="2390">So after that, we got liberated. </sentence><sentence id="2391">I will tell you one small, funny incident. </sentence><sentence id="2392">We had nothing to eat very much. </sentence><sentence id="2393">So Pop decided...I had found some...my brothers and I found some German objects...a helmet and instruction book to go with a gun, a couple of crazy things. </sentence><sentence id="2394">Pop said, "You know what? </sentence><sentence id="2395">Maybe we could trade with Canadians. </sentence><sentence id="2396">These are souvenirs." </sentence><sentence id="2397">So we went to the Canadian camp. </sentence><sentence id="2398">By now we were surrounded by Canadians, all settled down in tents. </sentence><sentence id="2399">And a whole division settled down. </sentence><sentence id="2400">Pop was simply amazing. </sentence><sentence id="2401">He went there and he said, "You want a German helmet." </sentence><sentence id="2402">The guy said, "Yeah." </sentence><sentence id="2403">He says, "Well, we'd like to have some coffee."
