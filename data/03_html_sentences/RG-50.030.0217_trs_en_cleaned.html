<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="5">A:Yes. </sentence><sentence id="6">My name is Stanislaw Soszynski. </sentence><sentence id="7">I was born on February 24, 1931, in Warsaw. </sentence><sentence id="8">I lived in Old Town through my whole childhood. </sentence><sentence id="9">This is the oldest part of Warsaw, mostly inhabited by the poor, craftsmen, merchants. </sentence><sentence id="10">A very diverse population, forming the northern part of Warsaw. </sentence><sentence id="11">The neighborhood was inhabited by many, even very many, Jewish families. </sentence><sentence id="12">In our building, at 11 Fret Street, there lived five Jewish families, out of twenty-odd total in the building. </sentence><sentence id="13">Our relations were those of neighbors, that is apartments were not locked, theft was unknown. </sentence><sentence id="14">Nowadays the full symbiosis that existed in those crowded, packed buildings is forgotten. </sentence><sentence id="15">There were of course disturbances in this symbiosis. </sentence><sentence id="16">There had to be. </sentence><sentence id="17">Whenever people are crowded into a mall space, the conflicts of their interests lead to occasional strife. </sentence><sentence id="18">That peaceful life, that life of storekeepers, tradesmen, craftsmen, minor civil servants, was interrupted by the war. </sentence><sentence id="19">There was an immense market hall near the street that I lived on. </sentence><sentence id="20">It was on Swietojerska Street. </sentence><sentence id="21">It was split in half, and fish were sold on one side, while vegetables, fruits, and dairy products were sold on the other. </sentence><sentence id="22">That market hall will be very important to the lives of many people during the war. </sentence><sentence id="23">Firstly, food will be sent through it, for it stood on the line that was designated by the Germans as the border of the ghetto. </sentence><sentence id="24">Later, in the years of the defense of Old Town, that hall will be transformed into a huge hospital. </sentence><sentence id="25">Although it is impossible to change a fish market or a produce market into a hospital, that was how it was, regardless. </sentence><sentence id="26">The siege of Warsaw in 1939 was a great drama. </sentence><sentence id="27">The Germans, having broken the resistance of the Polish army west of the Vistula, surrounded Warsaw. </sentence><sentence id="28">The city was full of historic architectural artifacts and monuments. </sentence><sentence id="29">Almost 700 antique buildings were so ravaged by the war that they had to be built practically all over again. </sentence><sentence id="30">Besides, the 1.5 million enclosed people of the city defended itself desperately, led by President Stefan Starzynski. </sentence><sentence id="31">The defenders consisted partly of members of the Jewish population. </sentence><sentence id="32">President Starzynski, the defender of Warsaw in 1939, appointed Czerniakow as his co-worker representing the Jewish population, the Jewish society. </sentence><sentence id="33">When the Germans entered Warsaw, a demolished Warsaw covered in snow, in which the walls smelled scorched. </sentence><sentence id="34">I lived through one of the most difficult times in my life. </sentence><sentence id="35">We were going on Wierzbowa Street to Marshall Jozef Pilsudski Square to visit my aunt, passing the burned buildings of Theater Square, when on the other side of the street I saw a man who appeared to be drunk. </sentence><sentence id="36">I was with my father and my siblings. </sentence><sentence id="37">He was stumbling from the sides of the houses to the curb and weaving across the width of the sidewalk. </sentence><sentence id="38">At last he fell down. </sentence><sentence id="39">Father said that we should keep going down the side of the street that we were on, but he crossed the street and approached the man. </sentence><sentence id="40">He picked him up, and now others came up. </sentence><sentence id="41">Together they sat him on a wall. </sentence><sentence id="42">I saw that my father lifted up the man's trouser leg and bound the man's leg with his handkerchief. </sentence><sentence id="43">He kept going down the street, parallel to us. </sentence><sentence id="44">When we came out onto the square, I noticed that Z-shaped anti-aircraft ditches had been dug into the grass of the square. </sentence><sentence id="45">There were some people filling them in while a German sentry watched over them. </sentence><sentence id="46">The soldier wore a helmet and carried a carbine with an affixed bayonet. </sentence><sentence id="47">Father went up to him and looked at him. </sentence><sentence id="48">He came back This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="49">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="50"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection and said "That thug ran his bayonet through that man's leg." </sentence><sentence id="51">I could not understand how someone could simply bayonet someone's leg like that, on the street in broad daylight, simply because he was not filling a ditch fast enough, or, as it later turned out, because he was a Jew. </sentence><sentence id="52">It was an inexplicable situation, but I realized then that a time had come when law went against common sense... these are complex matters, I cannot explain, but I realized that invaders, Germans, bad people had come. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="103">Q:You were eight years old then. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="105">A:I was then eight years old, yes. </sentence><sentence id="106">A common life of poverty commenced. </sentence><sentence id="107">The city was destroyed, there was no running water, no light, no food. </sentence><sentence id="108">Water was carried from the river. </sentence><sentence id="109">Because women did the laundry in their homes, every home had a big kettle for doing the wash. </sentence><sentence id="110">The men stood in a row and together took all of the pots. </sentence><sentence id="111">They went in long strings to the Vistula, taking streets that sloped down to the river. </sentence><sentence id="112">They nailed together boards and put them over the water they collected so that it would not splash out. </sentence><sentence id="113">These problems cemented people all the more; nothing unites like misfortune. </sentence><sentence id="114">Joy may split, while misery draws people together. </sentence><sentence id="115">This is the second scene that I remember, and it also is as if from a ghastly dream. </sentence><sentence id="116">German patrols began appearing in our neighborhood dressed in what were known before the war as anti- [102] suits. </sentence><sentence id="117">They were made out of a watertight, prepared fabric. </sentence><sentence id="118">On their backs they carried tanks and in their hands they had nozzles such as are today used to apply lacquer under pressure. </sentence><sentence id="119">There was some kind of poison in those tanks, phenol or carbolic acid or some other liquid that destroyed everything that it came into contact with. </sentence><sentence id="120">It turned out that these patrols demanded money from owners of Jewish stores. </sentence><sentence id="121">If the extortion money was not paid, the Germans would hose down the inside of the store with the carbolic acid. </sentence><sentence id="122">There was a jeweler in the next building to us. </sentence><sentence id="123">He had a tiny store, so small that the door simultaneously served as the display. </sentence><sentence id="124">There was a counter inside, while the precious things he put on display were hung on an ingenious little shelf in the door. </sentence><sentence id="125">I stood before the door when the Germans came up and demanded payment - he did not have it. </sentence><sentence id="126">Within a few minutes, the store had been soaked with that stinking carbolic acid. </sentence><sentence id="127">To this day, I get a feeling of grimness whenever I enter a newly disinfected room, because I see a man with that destructive nozzle in his hand. </sentence><sentence id="128">There was no talk of a ghetto at the beginning. </sentence><sentence id="129">At first it was even said that the Jews would be in a better situation than the Poles under the occupation because they would be able to understand what the Germans were saying. </sentence><sentence id="130">The lion's share of the Jewish people understood German. </sentence><sentence id="131">This turned out to be an illusion. </sentence><sentence id="132">The winter of 1939-1940 was bitterly cold. </sentence><sentence id="133">The frost was so strong that it split open trees. </sentence><sentence id="134">On New Town Square, there stood a dozen trees at the base of which was a temporary cemetery. </sentence><sentence id="135">In the middle stood a statue of the patron of Warsaw, and the trees broke up so that limbs were falling down on the graves. </sentence><sentence id="136">During that winter I wore my scarf, earmuffs, a fur hat. </sentence><sentence id="137">I was standing in the gate when one of my friends ran out bare-headed. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="171">Q:One of your Jewish friends? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="173">A:Yes, one of my Jewish friends. </sentence><sentence id="174">I motioned to him with my chin, to ask "Hey, have you gone crazy? </sentence><sentence id="175">You should put something on your head." </sentence><sentence id="176">He motioned with his head at a German This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="177">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="178"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection patrol standing at a narrowing in the street to which all the passing Jews had to bow. </sentence><sentence id="179">He did not have a cap so that he would not have to bow, in that horrible cold. </sentence><sentence id="180">I looked at him, he was three or four years older than me, and I felt the strangeness of the situation. </sentence><sentence id="181">Then talk began that there would be a ghetto, that all the nationalities in Warsaw would be put into their own zones. </sentence><sentence id="182">No one said that there would be a Jewish section, an extermination section. </sentence><sentence id="183">I think that the precision with which that society was destroyed was the result of great thought - psychological thought, organizational thought. </sentence><sentence id="184">I think that it must have been done by people who knew mob psychology. </sentence><sentence id="185">It is not so simple to collect three or four hundred thousand people in one place without telling them about one's goal, one's purpose. </sentence><sentence id="186">The first step was simply lying: that is, it was said that Warsaw would be split into sections. </sentence><sentence id="187">There would be an assigned Aryan section, a German section, a Jewish section. </sentence><sentence id="188">The Jewish section was relatively speaking huge, very large in this first phase. </sentence><sentence id="189">These sections were to be inhabited exclusively by those assigned to them. </sentence><sentence id="190">The psychological groundwork for this division was laid by posting on streetcar posts and street lanterns signs that said "Jews Are Forbidden To Walk On This Side Of The Street." </sentence><sentence id="191">Suddenly, a part of the street was off-limits, like stores, like parks, and similar places in the city. </sentence><sentence id="192">Another form of preparation was that the Germans placed signs on the roads that instructed drivers to drive past very quickly because the area was infected with typhus. </sentence><sentence id="193">Finally, small walls sprang up. </sentence><sentence id="194">The people of Warsaw, especially the people of Old Town, the oldest neighborhood, were hot-headed, and if walls were put up against their will, then they took them down. </sentence><sentence id="195">At first those walls were taken part. </sentence><sentence id="196">Someone needed some bricks, and so on. </sentence><sentence id="197">It turned out that this was another ploy: it was said that the walls would form checkpoints where the police could check passer-by's identification, but in reality it was announced that the neighborhood was closed, and that people who were forced to wear armbands with the Star of David had to go there. </sentence><sentence id="198">Tens of thousands of people living in that zone had to be moved, however. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="227">Q:Your house was not in the zone? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="229">A:Our house was on the border of the ghetto. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="231">Q:So it was still on the Aryan side? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="233">A:The back of the house was in the ghetto. </sentence><sentence id="234">But our part, the front of the house, where our apartment was, was on the Aryan side. </sentence><sentence id="235">This later led to an unexpected result: the great smuggling operation that began when the ghetto was closed. </sentence><sentence id="236">For example, people would pour milk down the drain-pipes to the ghetto part. </sentence><sentence id="237">But now I am speaking about the point when tens of thousands of people were leaving the ghetto and tens of thousands were moving in. </sentence><sentence id="238">Because time was very short, the people who had property there had to quickly sell everything in an effort to save something. </sentence><sentence id="239">Those people were pauperized. </sentence><sentence id="240">So a great ghetto was created, containing 300,000 people. </sentence><sentence id="241">Today, when one looks at a map and knows the outcome of it all, one can see that the line of the ghetto was very carefully drawn so as to leave all large parks outside. </sentence><sentence id="242">No large area of greenery, no square that could give some respite to the children there, not to mention the adults. </sentence><sentence id="243">One of the surprising, shocking facts that I have learned is the story of the teacher in the ghetto who asked the children to draw summer. </sentence><sentence id="244">It turned out that the children did not know what it This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="245">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="246"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection looks like. </sentence><sentence id="247">Four and five year-old children who had grown up behind the walls could not; draw a horse, cows, sheep they did not even know what those things were. </sentence><sentence id="248">Families left our house in tears. </sentence><sentence id="249">Superintendent Bomoski [ph -220], a simple man, helped them load what they had - they were not rich people. </sentence><sentence id="250">In any case, we said that sooner or later the war would end, that we would surely see each other again. </sentence><sentence id="251">Unfortunately this was not to be. </sentence><sentence id="252">Those walls were the battle-ground of a contest between the leadership of the ghetto, the people of the ghetto, and the Germans. </sentence><sentence id="253">Because by means of those walls, attention was turned away from the basic facts. </sentence><sentence id="254">If one day it was announced that Zlota, Hoza, or Sienna, or a part of a building was no longer in the ghetto or else was now included in the ghetto, it seemed as if directing energies toward "defense" was the most important thing. </sentence><sentence id="255">In reality, this was not the case. </sentence><sentence id="256">Hunger began there. </sentence><sentence id="257">Rations were purposely reduced so that hunger began. </sentence><sentence id="258">Small boys who could get through the holes knocked in the walls of the ghetto went through. </sentence><sentence id="259">Among others, two boys from our building came. </sentence><sentence id="260">They sat on a stump. </sentence><sentence id="261">All of the houses in that old part of town, since the only heat was from coal stoves, had large stumps in the courtyard for chopping wood. </sentence><sentence id="262">They sat on that stump, we all ran up. </sentence><sentence id="263">They sad that it was hard, that some of their parents were in poor health, that they came because they had nowhere to go and they knew they had friends here, and so on. </sentence><sentence id="264">The adults gave them, I had nothing of course, what they had, some pieces of bacon, bags of flour. </sentence><sentence id="265">I made an appointment to see them. </sentence><sentence id="266">Because the streetcar went through the streets of the ghetto to Powzazki, there was no other way for the streetcar to go, one could board on the Aryan side and ride through. </sentence><sentence id="267">Although a policeman guarded the car, it was possible to jump out, at first, when the streetcar still operated as it did before the war. </sentence><sentence id="268">I suddenly found myself in a city that is hard to imagine. </sentence><sentence id="269">Thousands of people walked back and forth, apparently with no purpose. </sentence><sentence id="270">Peddlers ran around with their carts. </sentence><sentence id="271">Someone was selling bread, which he kept in a basket made of barbed wire, so that no one could take it without paying. </sentence><sentence id="272">All of this was so unbelievable that even now that I am an adult, an old man, an artist, whenever I try to represent it graphically I look at my work and think that it is complete]y surrealistic. </sentence><sentence id="273">Bread bundled in barbed wire is inedible. </sentence><sentence id="274">One cannot even begin to share those peoples experience. </sentence><sentence id="275">I found the boys: it turned out that they lived with ten other people in one room. </sentence><sentence id="276">Sanitary problems began immediately. </sentence><sentence id="277">Today, in a world in which everything works without disruption, we do not understand what it means, twelve people in one room. </sentence><sentence id="278">Not in one apartment, in one room. </sentence><sentence id="279">Now, suddenly that one small water closet intended for the use of a family of four or five must function as a street lavatory. </sentence><sentence id="280">An unbelievable thing started to happen. </sentence><sentence id="281">I cannot talk about people dying. </sentence><sentence id="282">I know it now, but I did not see it then. </sentence><sentence id="283">But there were dead bodies laying on the sidewalks. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="337">Q:In the street or on the side? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="339">A:Everywhere! </sentence><sentence id="340">Today it is known that; on Krochmalna Street there was a building in which, out of four hundred inhabitants, four hundred died! </sentence><sentence id="341">A whole apartment building died, a huge apartment building with four hundred people. </sentence><sentence id="342">After some time, the ghetto was sealed off completely. </sentence><sentence id="343">One could not go in without a special pass, and even with a pass... the story went around Warsaw that a Polish doctor, on the so-called Aryan side, whom a Jewish doctor called because he had a serious case, went into the ghetto with a pass. </sentence><sentence id="344">The Gestapo </sentence></p><p><sentence id="345"> This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="346">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="347"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection </sentence></p><p><sentence id="348"> followed him and killed everyone, the patient and both of the doctors. </sentence><sentence id="349">That information went around the whole city. </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="350">A:Was it true? </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="351">A:Yes! </sentence><sentence id="352">Of course. </sentence><sentence id="353">Today, after the war, the names of those people have been established, and it is known that it was done with all of the perfidy of the consequences that such a form of extermination carries with it. </sentence><sentence id="354">Because the walls of the ghetto moved as those people were crowded even more, and we lived close by, I had an experience that I already told you about that is I sold milk. </sentence><sentence id="355">This was necessary because my father fell ill and could no longer support the household. </sentence><sentence id="356">There were three of us then, my mother. </sentence><sentence id="357">I was twelve years old then. </sentence><sentence id="358">I took a milk can and went outside of town to a farmer who would sell me twelve liters. </sentence><sentence id="359">I was scared while transporting it, because the so-called "sentries" stood guard at all of the train stations. </sentence><sentence id="360">This was often quite dramatic: a German gendarme called "Pretty Boy, " because he had a very pretty appearance, an ideally smooth face, clean-shaven, a pretty boy, came into the compartment and started looking for contraband. </sentence><sentence id="361">Meat, butter, whatever made him happy. </sentence><sentence id="362">I was sitting on my milk can between the seats next to the window. </sentence><sentence id="363">There was another milk can up on the luggage rack, which its owner, another man, had opened so that it would not go sour. </sentence><sentence id="364">The German seized the can by the handle, not knowing that it was open. </sentence><sentence id="365">The milk poured all over him. </sentence><sentence id="366">Everyone began to laugh, he asked politely whose can it was. </sentence><sentence id="367">The man next to me said that it was his. </sentence><sentence id="368">He opened his holster and shot him, right in that train. </sentence><sentence id="369">Within a few seconds, the man was dead. </sentence><sentence id="370">I brought the milk home. </sentence><sentence id="371">That day I also brought; a bottle of honey home, for us. </sentence><sentence id="372">I was supposed to go visit a friend who lived next to the ghetto wall. </sentence><sentence id="373">I poured some honey on a piece of very bad bread, which reportedly was made of sawdust mixed with flour, bread which was rationed to us. </sentence><sentence id="374">I took my bread and honey and went down the street eating it. </sentence><sentence id="375">I got too the street where the ghetto wall was, when a "szaulis, " a soldier working for the Germans, standing by the wall in an ash-grey uniform with black cuffs and a long cartridge belt motioned to me. </sentence><sentence id="376">I was convinced that I had died because I immediately thought that I was just as scruffy and disheveled as those boys who sneaked out of the ghetto in search of food, and that he had taken me for one of those boys. </sentence><sentence id="377">That was the longest walk of my life. </sentence><sentence id="378">I went up to him and waited for him to turn his gun on me and shoot. </sentence><sentence id="379">It turned out that he needed my piece of bread with honey. </sentence><sentence id="380">He twisted my arm, took it and put it in his mouth. </sentence><sentence id="381">Then he waved me off, "Weg." </sentence><sentence id="382">Coming back, I knew that I was alive, but at the same time I realized... maybe for a few minutes I was a Jewish boy - that there was no law there, that this was a horrible lawlessness. </sentence><sentence id="383">At one point a rumor went around Warsaw that Jews were being deported. </sentence><sentence id="384">No one knew how, but the word "Umschlagplatz " entered the vocabularies of the people of Warsaw. </sentence><sentence id="385">Of course the terror inflicted on the people of Warsaw was so strong, people were shot on the street, stopped, rounded up and sent to camps, whole neighborhoods were surrounded where thousands of men would be asked for identification and put in cars known as "boxes, " that all of these terrible rumors fell on different ears then we have today, as I speak. </sentence><sentence id="386">When one sees dead people on the street, one reacts differently than to a man killed in a car accident. </sentence><sentence id="387">But all the same these were horrible matters, exceeding the imagination. </sentence><sentence id="388">I had another experience that was unique. </sentence><sentence id="389">It turned out that there was no hope for my father. </sentence><sentence id="390">He is very sick, so sick that he must die. </sentence><sentence id="391">We were all This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="392">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="393"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection aware of this, but a person wants to... a person clings to his hopes. </sentence><sentence id="394">Father was put in a hospital which had been a specialist hospital before the war. </sentence><sentence id="395">The hospital was located in a T-shaped area that was cut out of the ghetto, but inside the ghetto. </sentence><sentence id="396">To go in, one had to pass a guard, go along a few buildings which belonged to the ghetto, and there was the hospital building that was separate. </sentence><sentence id="397">This was a hospital by name only - there was no proper food there, no beds, nothing. </sentence><sentence id="398">There were beds, but again in name only -- normal, iron beds, not hospital beds. </sentence><sentence id="399">As a result I carried part of the food we were able to obtain to the hospital every day. </sentence><sentence id="400">I carried a can with a spoon and by the Arsenal, because the wall went along Przejazd Street, it was completely empty. </sentence><sentence id="401">Evidently there had just been a round-up or some shooting or... anyway, I saw the Wacht mann in the ghetto gate from a long way away. </sentence><sentence id="402">He mixed up the soup to make sure there were no weapons or ammunition in it and let me pass. </sentence><sentence id="403">As I walked by those walls, people appeared who were fixated by the sight of my can. </sentence><sentence id="404">I saw this, I felt it. </sentence><sentence id="405">They could not cross the wall, but at the same time it was a horrible feeling of an indescribable hunger. </sentence><sentence id="406">That was how I took it. </sentence><sentence id="407">A few months later, the Ghetto Uprising began. </sentence><sentence id="408">From what I remember, it was not the fight that it is described as today, a band of desperate people shooting and so on. </sentence><sentence id="409">Because we lived nearby, I saw it. </sentence><sentence id="410">It was a militarily well-organized defense of parts of buildings. </sentence><sentence id="411">I do not know how the battle looked in the rest of the area, but along Swietojerska, Bonifraterska, and Franciszkanska Streets, within our sight, was fought in an exemplary way. </sentence><sentence id="412">So well that snipers, placed in high points in those buildings, for a few days did not even allow the German soldiers and divisions to enter that way. </sentence><sentence id="413">It was not until heavy artillery, with multiple barrels, was brought in, and houses were subjected to direct fire - they would fire at a spot several times, the wall would collapse revealing an apartment, and they would move on to the next house, they were methodically destroying house after house - that the defenders retreated. </sentence><sentence id="414">Another shocking method, one that the Germans would use massively during the Warsaw Uprising of 1944, were fires. </sentence><sentence id="415">The Germans would set fire to whole blocks of houses. </sentence><sentence id="416">So that northern part of the city had an enormous column of smoke over it. </sentence><sentence id="417">Because they would not let the fire department in and there was no access to that section of the city, those houses burned until they burned out. </sentence><sentence id="418">They then began to demolish those houses. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="491">A:After the Ghetto Uprising. </sentence><sentence id="492">No one was allowed in. </sentence><sentence id="493">The Germans put up signs saying that they would shoot without warning at anyone found in that area. </sentence><sentence id="494">It turned out that this was all part of their plans; in 1939, the architect Pabst had drawn up a plan for the destruction of Warsaw. </sentence><sentence id="495">That northern part of the city was to be leveled with the ground. </sentence><sentence id="496">No one knew that then except for people like Professor Zachwatowicz, who was able to get to the documents dealing with Pabst in the town hall. </sentence><sentence id="497">Now, filled with horror and surprise, we watched as a great city of a million and a half people and covering several square kilometers was turned to desert, completely leveled. </sentence><sentence id="498">Everything of any value was taken out: pipes, balconies, roofing, upholstery, and so on, and then the buildings were blown up. </sentence><sentence id="499">The houses were mined and blown up. </sentence><sentence id="500">In 1944, when the Warsaw Uprising broke out, the northern part of the city that the Germans had designated to be the ghetto was a flat plain. </sentence><sentence id="501">The partisans who went to attack the German divisions in the cemeteries discovered that there was no possibility of cover, because on an open field like that, This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="502">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="503"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection heavy machine guns can stop anything. </sentence><sentence id="504">This is very hard to describe in just a few words, those years, 39 to 45. </sentence><sentence id="505">If one goes to that part of Warsaw today, one can still see how it was. </sentence><sentence id="506">Every time a cable is laid, everytime a shovel touches the earth there, reminders of that city, that life, come up. </sentence><sentence id="507">I wanted to understand why it happened, why those people were destroyed, why that city was destroyed. </sentence><sentence id="508">I looked for some sort of memory of those people. </sentence><sentence id="509">I dug up the strangest things there. </sentence><sentence id="510">Some of them I could not pick up, or, feeling their gravity, I decided that I had no place worthy to hold them. </sentence><sentence id="511">For example, once a bulldozer pushed aside a huge block of bricks, under which lay several hundred trouser and vest buckles, which evidently had been in a bag or a box that had decayed. </sentence><sentence id="512">Oxidized buckles. </sentence><sentence id="513">Because they had been there, crushed, for a long time, they had formed a cluster, a sculpture. </sentence><sentence id="514">I looked at it and thought that this was a kind of summation of what had happened there. </sentence><sentence id="515">There must have been a sickly tailor there who was suddenly told that he had to leave everything. </sentence><sentence id="516">Of course, the buckles were the most important thing to him, because that was his shop. </sentence><sentence id="517">He hid them down there in the basement. </sentence><sentence id="518">They took his live away, and the buckles lay there. </sentence><sentence id="519">An object, a tiny object, can say more about a drama like this than a hundred words. </sentence><sentence id="520">That flat plain was petrifying to the city. </sentence><sentence id="521">It made it clear that life is stronger than that... that... demonic destruction. </sentence><sentence id="522">That was not human destruction, it was somehow devilish. </sentence><sentence id="523">The knowledge that someday this would all be grown over, trees would sprout, neighborhoods, children who did not even know what had happened would be playing, it would be another city for them. </sentence><sentence id="524">I tried to remember and cement in my memory what had happened from this angle and I collected fragments of that city and of that life. </sentence><sentence id="525">Sometimes the images I saw wandering in the ruins were surrealistic. </sentence><sentence id="526">I think that I have told about this already. </sentence><sentence id="527">I once saw that bricks were flying into the air on that flat plain. </sentence><sentence id="528">They would jump up. </sentence><sentence id="529">A brick would leap into the air and fall down again. </sentence><sentence id="530">There were whole fields of jumping bricks. </sentence><sentence id="531">I could not understand, I thought that I was starting to see things, for how do bricks jump? </sentence><sentence id="532">But I put aside my concern and went closer to where the bricks were flying. </sentence><sentence id="533">I now saw with great surprise that that Teutonic fury had destroyed everything on the surface, but that down below the fundament remained, and they contained good, healthy brick. </sentence><sentence id="534">So the local carters earned money by clinging holes down to the fundament, throwing the bricks up to the surface, and selling them to people who were building. </sentence><sentence id="535">It was very simple and logical, there was nothing extraordinary about it. </sentence><sentence id="536">All the same, that was how life began to creep back into that area. </sentence><sentence id="537">Spontaneously, in the general rebuilding of Warsaw, it began by taking out the bricks, restoring order. </sentence><sentence id="538">The bricks were put in piles, the area was cleaned, the Muranow residential district was built, partly on land that had been part of the Jewish section. </sentence><sentence id="539">The city began to expand as far as the cemeteries that are still there today. </sentence><sentence id="540">It turned out that this was a kind of holy place. </sentence><sentence id="541">Today it is very difficult to build something in Warsaw without disturbing the peace of the murdered. </sentence><sentence id="542">A bulldozer scooping up earth to build a fundament brings up human bones, mass graves are found in completely unexpected places. </sentence><sentence id="543">Every time a new urban building site is being chosen, history must be examined to ensure that the place is not one of martyrdom. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="609">Q:You did not tell us your experiences during the Uprising. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="611">A:That is because I did not know that: it was a subject of our conversation. </sentence><sentence id="612">A year after the events in the Ghetto, Warsaw rose to do battle. </sentence><sentence id="613">As it turned out, that what they had done in one district, they now expanded onto a scale of the whole city. </sentence><sentence id="614">My beloved Old Town, in which I grew up, and which was the place on earth to which I belonged, as everyone should have such a place, was leveled just as the ghetto was. </sentence><sentence id="615">It is very hard to understand the words "Your house has burned down." </sentence><sentence id="616">They are only five words, but it is very difficult. </sentence><sentence id="617">When we went out, it was also very surrealistic. </sentence><sentence id="618">I kept fish. </sentence><sentence id="619">I always liked animals, birds, plants. </sentence><sentence id="620">I made myself an aquarium and kept fish. </sentence><sentence id="621">I had already had one sad experience: windows had to be completely blacked-out, so that no light at all got out, and it was winter. </sentence><sentence id="622">Upon opening the curtain one morning, I saw that the aquarium had frozen. </sentence><sentence id="623">It was so cold in the apartment that those poor fish were frozen still in the ice. </sentence><sentence id="624">It is now September 2, 1944, the end of the defense of Old Town. </sentence><sentence id="625">We are to come out with our hands up. </sentence><sentence id="626">I run into the apartment and there is the aquarium. </sentence><sentence id="627">I know that soon there will be a great fire here, and that the aquarium will shatter, and that that little bit of water has no chance of putting the fire out. </sentence><sentence id="628">The apartment is a place to which one comes back, to which one comes with the feeling that it is a place of respite - I will not mention the English saying, my castle, the place in which I rule -- and now it does not exist. </sentence><sentence id="629">The walls of the houses have been jarred apart, and from the gap between them I can see the ruins of the neighboring apartment. </sentence><sentence id="630">These are all surrealistic images. </sentence><sentence id="631">During those 32 days of fighting, Old Town was demolished down to the ground. </sentence><sentence id="632">When we came back in January 1945, Warsaw was dead. </sentence><sentence id="633">It was kilometers of, tens of, hundreds of streets where no one lived and burned out houses stood. </sentence><sentence id="634">Not only that, but it turned out that the whole infrastructure, telephone links, gas, light, water, it all had been destroyed underground with special instruments. </sentence><sentence id="635">I now know, as an architect and as a person who is interested in his city, that German scientists prepared a device called a "Typhoon" which blew up sewers. </sentence><sentence id="636">It was made and used. </sentence><sentence id="637">Unfortunately for them, it was well thought-out scientifically - assuming that all of the sewer entrances were closed. </sentence><sentence id="638">In that case, the sewer would be destroyed. </sentence><sentence id="639">Because both in the Ghetto Uprising and in the Warsaw Uprising soldiers used the sewers to travel under the city, some of the entrances were open. </sentence><sentence id="640">Even on the territory of the ghetto, a board with some debris would be placed over the entrance, and this made blowing the sewer up impossible. </sentence><sentence id="641">Which saved Warsaw in 1945, because it was said that the hundreds of kilometers of sewers could not be built in another place, but here there at least is the existing network. </sentence><sentence id="642">The destruction of Warsaw was planned . </sentence><sentence id="643">I mentioned Pabst's plan. </sentence><sentence id="644">But in 1944, Warsaw was turned into a fortress, Festung-Warschau, on Hitler's orders. </sentence><sentence id="645">This fortress was supposed to hold the Red Army at the Vistula, and to prepare the city for the fighting, special detachments went around dynamiting city blocks. </sentence><sentence id="646">As if this were not enough, places of cultural value were consciously targeted for exploding, and an average soldier could not do this on his own. </sentence><sentence id="647">In Leszno, near Poznan, in 1945, the files of the certified architect Menzenbach [ph - 42 ]. </sentence><sentence id="648">He was a methodical man . </sentence><sentence id="649">Every card in the file was labeled as belonging to him, and each had a photograph of a place he had registered, with a note next to it saying when, where, and what was to blown up. </sentence><sentence id="650">Looking through the cards, one is horrified. </sentence><sentence id="651">A qualified architect, a man whose purpose is to raise buildings from the earth to serve man, to make something beautiful, using all of his knowledge against the works of his This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="652">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="653"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection colleagues; he walked and classified: this is to be blown up, because it has value. </sentence><sentence id="654">This is not to be blown up, because it is not valuable from a cultural standpoint. </sentence><sentence id="655">An example of this is the Bril [ph - "53] Palace. </sentence><sentence id="656">The palace is not distinguished by its architecture compared to a Secessionist [ 55 ] standing next to it that had no cultural importance. </sentence><sentence id="657">But the Bril [?] </sentence><sentence id="658">Palace was blown up, while the remained. </sentence><sentence id="659">Specialists walked around and said "Blow this one up, and leave this one alone," or else burn it down. </sentence><sentence id="660">Another apparatus, whose German name I do not know, was designed to destroy completely sites that were found to have cultural significance, that is a translation from the German. </sentence><sentence id="661">Those buildings that were cultural pillars. </sentence><sentence id="662">One of them was the Royal Palace, and when one looks at photographs of the destruction, one sees that that was not regular mining work done there I have established that a special sort of coal dust was pumped into the basements of such a building, which was then detonated. </sentence><sentence id="663">That dust tore buildings apart into pieces the size of this cup. </sentence><sentence id="664">Nothing remained. </sentence></p></dialogue>
