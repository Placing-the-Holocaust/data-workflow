<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="58">Q: When you arrived in Germany, where did you go? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="60">A: Well, originally I understand my orders were to work in Munich. </sentence><sentence id="61">I might say that when I got to Europe, we spent a week or so in Paris and nobody really knew what was going on in Germany. </sentence><sentence id="62">I was in Munich where I was supposed to work, but reports came in that there were hundreds of Jews in trouble and needing food, clothing, and so forth in a little town in Schwandorf in Bavaria. </sentence><sentence id="63">So I went up to Schwandorf. </sentence><sentence id="64">I found these Jews and they needed...they weren't registered with UNRRA"". </sentence><sentence id="65">So it was a question of getting them jobs, getting them food, and getting them registered and later on helping them to meet their needs. </sentence><sentence id="66">So I began to work in Schwandorf. </sentence><sentence id="67">And slowly, I discovered Jews were living in the small towns in the area so I began traveling to these towns and there again I found an interesting thing that in a number of these towns, the handful of Jews living there were the survivors of the infamous, what I call infamous, death marches. </sentence><sentence id="68">The Germans at the end of the war marched thousands of Jews through the forests. </sentence><sentence id="69">And at the end when they decided to leave, they killed half of the survivors and those that survived dug mass graves and got into the nearest town. </sentence><sentence id="70">So as I got into these towns I found the Jews living in the old barns, over manure piles, and cellars and my job was to get them housing and food and shelter, clothing and...I had Eisenhower's...General Eisenhower's orders in my pocket for the Germans to provide decent housing for them so I was able to do that. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="82">Q: Okay. </sentence><sentence id="83">And what happened...what happened then when you started working with these people? </sentence><sentence id="84">What were some of your experiences? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="88">A: Well, I had many experiences. </sentence><sentence id="89">It should be noted that almost 95 or 99 percent of these Jews were Polish Jews and apparently they came to communities used to organized life, so one of the first thing they did wherever they settled, they formed their own organizations, so I worked through an organization so I had somebody to talk to, committees who wanted food, clothing, money; who needed help. </sentence><sentence id="90">They had trouble with UNRRA. </sentence><sentence id="91">UNRRA, with the United States Army. </sentence><sentence id="92">Uh...I left my wife and two children home. </sentence><sentence id="93">I'll never forget one of the first experiences was being from the little town of Burglengenfeld where I met a little, small child named Ruthie. </sentence><sentence id="94">Ruth Fleischer, who had been in hiding...hidden with a Polish family. </sentence><sentence id="95">Her father was killed. </sentence><sentence id="96">Her mother lived in this little town. </sentence><sentence id="97">She went back to Poland and found Ruth. </sentence><sentence id="98">And when I met Ruth, I'll never forget the little one said to me, "Mr. Levine," in Yiddish, "I am 10 years old and I don't know how to read and write. </sentence><sentence id="99">Please help me go to school." </sentence><sentence id="100">First thing the child asked me. </sentence><sentence id="101">But at the beginning, as I said, we had Jews coming and going. </sentence><sentence id="102">There were Jews drifting in from Poland. </sentence><sentence id="103">There was always the question of &gt; The United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration. </sentence><sentence id="104"> housing for these people. </sentence><sentence id="105">At one point, not too long after I came, we had to open a tent city...tent city near the city of Cham, C-H-A-M. I want to digress for a moment to say that I was...God was good to me because on the first day of my work in Schwandorf, in this little town where Jews hadn't lived for...maybe never lived, German town where the church was built in the 1400s. </sentence><sentence id="106">I met a young man named Moshe, M-0-S-H-E, Rechnitz, R-E-C-H-N-I-T- Z. Moshe was about 21 or 22 years old. </sentence><sentence id="107">He spoke a number of languages. </sentence><sentence id="108">He came from the city of Katowice in Poland and I employed him right there. </sentence><sentence id="109">Moshe was my driver and my assistant almost like my son. </sentence><sentence id="110">Wonderful young man, so I was...he...he was really my right arm. </sentence><sentence id="111">And while I'm talking about Moshe, I might say that he himself spent...was in 5, 6 slave camps, slave labor camps. </sentence><sentence id="112">His mother was killed in one of the labor camps, munitions plant. </sentence><sentence id="113">He was in Buchenwald and he was on one of these death marches. </sentence><sentence id="114">And one morning he and I were driving through these beautiful Bavarian hills when we came to beautiful spot. </sentence><sentence id="115">He stopped the Jeep and he asked me to follow him, went down a little... little brook and there I saw shoes, odd shoes laying on the ground and he told that he was...when he was on a death march, when they came to this little...this area outside of the town of Stamsreid, the Germans killed half of the handful of survivors. </sentence><sentence id="116">And he was one of the living on these people the survivors dug a grave, there was a mass grave and Moshe was freed in Stamsreid. </sentence><sentence id="117">Now, I traveled from town to town because these where Jews were organized and these people needed money for food for programs that they ran, and the Joint really financed most of their stuff. </sentence><sentence id="118">I worked mostly with UNRRA, which provided food and clothing, and the United States Army, so I ended up being the spokesman for the Jews. </sentence><sentence id="119">I had a simulated rank of lieutenant colonel which meant nothing except that it gave me entree to top headquarters. </sentence><sentence id="120">I dealt with the generals in the area, general 4th Armored Division, so that I had no trouble there. </sentence><sentence id="121">Now, many...of course, I have many memories of a lot of things happening. </sentence><sentence id="122">I want: to describe some of them. </sentence><sentence id="123">One morning I was in my office when two men came in. </sentence><sentence id="124">One of them turned to me and said, "Levine, you and the Joint are doing a good job providing food, clothing and shelter, but we need something for the Geist." </sentence><sentence id="125">I think this happened later in the year. </sentence><sentence id="126">At any rate, this incident happened. </sentence><sentence id="127">I said, "What do you mean by Geist?" </sentence><sentence id="128">He said, "Something for the spirit of the Jews." </sentence><sentence id="129">I looked at the man and I said, "What are you talking about?" </sentence><sentence id="130">He said, "We need a Yiddish newspaper." </sentence><sentence id="131">I might digress for a moment to say that I was fortunate to have been in Munich, shortly after...after my arrival and was at that printing plant when the first copy of the...called Unser Weg, the Yiddish paper, came off the press, and I brought a copy to give to the Museum. </sentence><sentence id="132">So there's a man who wants a paper published in Regensburg. </sentence><sentence id="133">So I asked who he was, and he says, "My name is Silverberg,and I was the editor of the Moment in Warsaw, which meant nothing to me, but I later learned that the Moment was the New York Times of Warsaw. </sentence><sentence id="134">And he said, "What you need is a newspaper." </sentence><sentence id="135">I thought the guy was crazy. </sentence><sentence id="136">I had visions of, you know, what's involved in printing a paper. </sentence><sentence id="137">So I said, "How are you going to print a paper?" </sentence><sentence id="138">So he then told me that before the war, he dealt with a firm in Frankfurt that supplied types for European countries. </sentence><sentence id="139">He was confident that even though the building was bombed...it was bombed, he knew where in the basement he'd find Yiddish type. </sentence><sentence id="140">Then the said, "If...if you pay for this thing, and pay the expenses...this man introduced me, and now I will go around...we're gonna find hand typesetters." </sentence><sentence id="141">I said, "Fine. </sentence><sentence id="142">What are you going to print it on?" " </sentence><sentence id="143">Oh," he says, "I've already found a local German printer and made arrangements where if we pay him, he'll print  it." </sentence><sentence id="144">I said, "That's fine. </sentence><sentence id="145">What about a paper and ink?" </sentence><sentence id="146">He said, "That's where you gotta come in. </sentence><sentence id="147">We already located a German who has a lot of paper and ink hidden. </sentence><sentence id="148">You'll have to get the requisition to...through the United States Army. </sentence><sentence id="149">I believed I involved Rabbi Gene Lipman in this deal. </sentence><sentence id="150">At any rate, the paper finally came out called Der Najer Moment. </sentence><sentence id="151">And a interesting thing happened. </sentence><sentence id="152">Shortly before I left for America, I got...received a telephone call from an excited Jew, claiming that there were hundreds of Jews at the railroad station. </sentence><sentence id="153">This was in Regensburg. </sentence><sentence id="154">And that the commotion, couple of them were shot and there was trouble at the railroad station. </sentence><sentence id="155">So I grabbed the man, Abe Cohn, he came to replace me and we jump in a Jeep and I had one of the UNRRA men drive the Jeep and I don't think any Jeep ever cut across the city faster. </sentence><sentence id="156">Lucky we weren't killed. </sentence><sentence id="157">When I got to the railroad station and found six hundred Jews. </sentence><sentence id="158">Apparently, these people were being transported I later learned from Austria to a camp near the Czech border. </sentence><sentence id="159">The locomotive broke down in Regensburg. </sentence><sentence id="160">So when J arrived Jews are sleeping on the ground, some in the box cars, couple tried to make fires to light something. </sentence><sentence id="161">On the far end, there were railroad and German police surrounding young kids, and I understand one young kid was shot in the legs and now...a day later brought him back from the hospital. </sentence><sentence id="162">I learned that these six hundred people --this was in Linz, Austria --were given a couple hours notice to get on the train. </sentence><sentence id="163">There were no chaplains on the train. </sentence><sentence id="164">It was a shameful thing. </sentence><sentence id="165">They were given a couple slices of meat and bread and no water. </sentence><sentence id="166">And I learned that at night some of the young G.I."s shot their guns in the air so the Jews in each freight car thought they were killing Jews so he told me this story. </sentence><sentence id="167">At any rate, as soon as I learned all this I had all my food I had in my litlle warehouse sent over. </sentence><sentence id="168">Emptied my warehouse. </sentence><sentence id="169">Got a hold of the UNRRA, which sent me huge cans of soup and bread and they finally fixed the locomotive, and as the train pulled out I wished at that moment that every [American] Jew could have been with me as these Jews, American Jews who made all this possible, as they waved, thanking me. </sentence><sentence id="170">Then I went back to my home in order to get Munich, spent a hour on the telephone just to be connected. </sentence><sentence id="171">I reported this to my headquarters. </sentence><sentence id="172">A day later checked... made arrangements and in the future no transports went out without a chaplain. </sentence><sentence id="173">Now, I didn't get into my pajamas until about 12 o'clock at night when I received a telephone call from Silverberg, the editor of the Moment, asking that I come to his home immediately. </sentence><sentence id="174">I was exhausted. </sentence><sentence id="175">Said something very important happened. </sentence><sentence id="176">I tushed to his apartment, and he introduced me to two men who escaped from the transport who knew Silverberg. </sentence><sentence id="177">One was Schlomober! </sentence><sentence id="178">Berlinsky, who was supposed to have been one of the leading novelists in Poland, and a man named Mendel Mann, who was one of the rising Yiddish poets in Poland. </sentence><sentence id="179">He introduced me and he wanted me to meet them because these men had no identification. </sentence><sentence id="180">They had nothing. </sentence><sentence id="181">To make sure the next morning I could take care of them so they wouldn't be picked up. </sentence><sentence id="182">While we were talking, Silverberg told me that he would like to print something by these two men to let the world know that they are alive, but he said this presents a problem because I've got the paper set for publication. </sentence><sentence id="183">And it would cost money to reset the paper. </sentence><sentence id="184">And I said, "Go ahead and do it.." Well, to make the story short, the paper came out and shortly thereafter, I was driving to Silverberg's home where outside I saw two young men, one of whom I recognized and he recognized me. </sentence><sentence id="185">Was a member of Kibbutz Nahum, it was a kibbutz about 20 kids, Ha-Shomer ha-Tsa'ir", and I &gt; Hebrew: "the Young Guard"; a collectivist and utopian Zionist youth movement. </sentence><sentence id="186">Mostly active  was like their substitute father. </sentence><sentence id="187">And the kids rushed over to me, and the strange kid held the Moment like a hot coal in his hand. </sentence><sentence id="188">And the kid that knew me asked me, "Where did...where does the editor live?" </sentence><sentence id="189">Silverberg. </sentence><sentence id="190">So I said, "What's the excitement about?" </sentence><sentence id="191">He said, "Let him tell you." </sentence><sentence id="192">This kid told me that before the war, he and his mother and sister and, I think, and father, lived in Warsaw [or] in Lodz; either of the two. </sentence><sentence id="193">At any rate, while his father was awlay seeing his publishers, he and his mother and sister were put in the camp. </sentence><sentence id="194">He lost his mother and sister, never saw his father, and he said that after the war he and another buddy decided to go to Poland to look for their relatives. </sentence><sentence id="195">They came to the city of Bamberg in Germany after the war, and from there they went to Poland. </sentence><sentence id="196">He told me how he went to Poland looking for his father. </sentence><sentence id="197">He knew his mother died and sister. </sentence><sentence id="198">He came back from Poland to Bamberg and went to bed that night, got up in the morning and found our paper, the Moment, which was distributed. </sentence><sentence id="199">He took the Moment, and there's an article about his father. </sentence><sentence id="200">He said, "Where is my father?" </sentence><sentence id="201">So that night we reunited father and son, if did nothing else with the paper. </sentence><sentence id="202">Well, at any rate, that's the newspapers. </sentence><sentence id="203">A number of other interesting things happened. </sentence><sentence id="204">For instance, in "46 most of...for all these Jews, for almost all of them, it was the first free...I mean it was the first time they could observe Pesach as free man. </sentence><sentence id="205">You know, the war is 39, 46 and so forth. </sentence><sentence id="206">So for days, the Joint sent me in a shipment of matzoh and wine and I spent my travel money to make arrangements with communities to come in and pick up their requisitions. </sentence><sentence id="207">And for a week or two Moshe and I spent time doling out matzoh and wines and Haggadot and they gave them money to buy fish. </sentence><sentence id="208">And several things happened. </sentence><sentence id="209">When I...after I got through meeting with the last delegation, I went up to my room to call Munich and I reported that everything was distributed. </sentence><sentence id="210">They then asked whether I gave...distributed wine or matzoh to the camp Deggendorf...1200 Jews. </sentence><sentence id="211">So I told them they hadn't sent it...they didn't send me anything. </sentence><sentence id="212">I felt so wonderful and suddenly the bottom fell out. </sentence><sentence id="213">No wine for 1200 people. </sentence><sentence id="214">So I called Deggendorf and they were smart. </sentence><sentence id="215">They made their own wine, and they baked their own matzoh. </sentence><sentence id="216">Well the reason I tell this story is that at that time the chief medical officer for the area which had 300,000 DPs...there were only a very small number of Jews, like I don't know many thousands...4 thousand, 5 thousand, where the Jewish doctor, woman doctor from Chicago a Dr. Anna Monatov (ph). </sentence><sentence id="217">I remembered her. </sentence><sentence id="218">I also had working with me a nurse sent by the Jewish Agency, Becky Lyons, who is still alive. </sentence><sentence id="219">She is now...she has a doctorate, which she is now a world authority in hospital administration. </sentence><sentence id="220">Lectures all over the world. </sentence><sentence id="221">And then there was the Jewish town major from the Bronx, a kid named Badian. </sentence><sentence id="222">And I invited these three to be my guest, you know, for seder to join the people I was with. </sentence><sentence id="223">After the service in the makeshift synagogue, oh, yes, and the president of the Gemeinde, of the community was the man named Jacob Gottlieb, who unfortunately was my age but his hair was white because I was told he watched his wife and two children thrown in the gas chamber. </sentence><sentence id="224">At any rate, so we went to the first seder...to seder with the kids in the kibbutz and it was heartbreaking for me because there were 20 kids, no mother, no father, no nothing. </sentence><sentence id="225">We had a comparatively short service. </sentence><sentence id="226">No meat of course, just simple seder, but what we lacked in food the kids made up in spirit  as they did all...every time I was with them, their singing and their dancing, and they singing like they're going to go to Palestine. </sentence><sentence id="227">Wonderful singing. </sentence><sentence id="228">When I...we left the kids about 10 o'clock at night, my guests and I walked toward the Jewish center. </sentence><sentence id="229">Now, Regensburg is a city which has streets like those in...in Jerusalem. </sentence><sentence id="230">The city is a thousand years old or more. </sentence><sentence id="231">So as we approached...it was a moonlight night, and as we approached the...the Jewish Center building which, incidently, was in the shadow of a hugh cathedral built 4 or 5 hundred years ago, we heard noises coming from the building. </sentence><sentence id="232">And came to the Center and we found that they had a community seder on the second floor. </sentence><sentence id="233">They cleaned out all the furniture, put up these wooden tables and as we walked in, they had just finished their meal and I saw a sea of men and women and this little child and they weren't happy. </sentence><sentence id="234">But as soon as they saw us, they began to sing and then sang another song. </sentence><sentence id="235">Suddenly, they were not alone. </sentence><sentence id="236">Within a few minutes four guys ran downstairs and they brought up a piano. </sentence><sentence id="237">This was a seder. </sentence><sentence id="238">The guy began...one of of the men sat at the piano, began to play. </sentence><sentence id="239">The other was singing. </sentence><sentence id="240">Then two or three couples got on the top of the tables and began to dance. </sentence><sentence id="241">While this was going on, I saw one man throw...they had huge windows, German windows. </sentence><sentence id="242">He threw them out as if to let the world know that the Jews are still alive and they sang as loud as they could as if to let the Germans and the world know that they were alive. </sentence><sentence id="243">At any rate, this seder went on til about another hour or so, then I went home and wrote a letter to my wife describing that. </sentence><sentence id="244">That was the first seder. </sentence><sentence id="245">I think it's important to describe the first Hanukkah. </sentence><sentence id="246">The first Hanukkah, this is in 45. </sentence><sentence id="247">This was in Schwandorf. </sentence><sentence id="248">The Jews had no Jewish center there so I got a...requisitioned an old beer hall which...when the Germans stopped using a building, you can imagine what condition it was in. </sentence><sentence id="249">But the Jews cleaned it up, repainted the walls, and had the section put up...the section for a synagogue, and the rest was for a social hall. </sentence><sentence id="250">And I got military permission --there was a curfew-- for the Jews to stay out late that night, and we had our first Hanukkah light lit in the synagogue, in the makeshift synagogue in Schwandorf. </sentence><sentence id="251">It happened that at that time...first I got to say that before this synagogue...before Schwandorf, our service, I might tell you that I came back to Schwandorf with a bunch of mail and letters and so forth, and while I was...came into the room of the President Schwarzfuchs, I noticed a gentleman sitting there. </sentence><sentence id="252">He was a bearded man sitting like this. </sentence><sentence id="253">He suddenly turned to me and say, "Was fiir ein Joint ist da?" </sentence><sentence id="254">The Joint is our organization. </sentence><sentence id="255">So I turned to Schwarzfuchs, I said, "Who is this man?" </sentence><sentence id="256">He says, "He is a Rabbi. </sentence><sentence id="257">He came from Warsaw." </sentence><sentence id="258">Survivors of the Warsaw Ghetto. </sentence><sentence id="259">So I said, "Was meint ihr? </sentence><sentence id="260">What do you mean?" </sentence><sentence id="261">He says, "Wo ist die Mikvah fiir die Weiber?" </sentence><sentence id="262">You know the mikvah. </sentence><sentence id="263">I'm in this stinking little town. </sentence><sentence id="264">"Und wo sind die Hanukkah-Lichter ftir Hanukkah?". </sentence><sentence id="265">I didn't realize Hanukkah was in another week. </sentence><sentence id="266">So I went down...so within a few days I went to a warehouse, military warehouse, in a place called Walhalla, on the Danube, not from Regensburg. </sentence><sentence id="267">And when the supply man wouldn't give me any candles...I figured I'd get candles and cut them half and distribute them. </sentence><sentence id="268">So he wouldn't give me that so I got the...called Munich. </sentence><sentence id="269">Took me an hour to get through. </sentence><sentence id="270">And the man in charge gave me...gave this guy permission to give me some cases of candles. </sentence><sentence id="271">So my driver and I then went back and we were cutting candles in half when I got phone call from Munich and advising me that the Rabbi, Chaplain Gene Lipman, had been to Palestine, brought back Palestinian candles, and holders, the Menorahs, and was on the way and within a short time Gene came with his assistant, Si Pava, and the four of us were sorting bundles of candles and we distributed them to the area. </sentence><sentence id="272">Now let me go back to  the synagogue in Schwandorf So the first Hanukkah light I thought I'd spend it with the Jews in Schwandorf. </sentence><sentence id="273">It was my own...almost just like my home. </sentence><sentence id="274">And this Rabbi was still there, so he gave a address. </sentence><sentence id="275">He spoke about a half an hour, and then there was joy and we had kegs of beer and we celebrated. </sentence><sentence id="276">I spent...went a few other towns for different Hannukahs. </sentence><sentence id="277">But the Jast Hanukkah candle lighting and I attended the Synagogue in Straubing. </sentence><sentence id="278">Straubing was not too far from Regensburg. </sentence><sentence id="279">And the head of the community was man named by Steven Schwartz, who was an engineer. </sentence><sentence id="280">Wonderful gentleman. </sentence><sentence id="281">And I took with me from Regensburg, I think I brought the Rabbi, Joseph Glazer, who...later we gave him the title of Oberrabbi, Chief Rabbi. </sentence><sentence id="282">He's alive and lives in Cedarhurst, Long Island. </sentence><sentence id="283">And we came to...to Straubing. </sentence><sentence id="284">I walked in to a magnificent, newly painted synagogue. </sentence><sentence id="285">I learned that during...the synagogue was built in 1907. </sentence><sentence id="286">During the war the Germans turned it into a warehouse. </sentence><sentence id="287">After a war, the young man appeared and told Steven Schwartz that he was a native of Straubing. </sentence><sentence id="288">His grandfather, I think, built the synagogue. </sentence><sentence id="289">That in the cellar of the synagogue they would find the original plans for it, and sure enough in a case they found the original, you know, architectural and drawing plans. </sentence><sentence id="290">And there's a Jewish town major and they forced the Germans to redo the synagogue as it was. </sentence><sentence id="291">So Steven Schwartz used that...used this oocasion of the last candle almost like a rededication of the synagogue I'll never forget Steven had a huge Menorah built in the back of the synagogue and he had huge candles in it. </sentence><sentence id="292">Must have been stolen from some church. </sentence><sentence id="293">On the Bimah, he had covered with velvet, he had this beautiful, little, hand carved Menorah I bought...you know, the Gene Lipman from Palestine, and Palestinian candles were lit. </sentence><sentence id="294">Can you picture the scene? </sentence><sentence id="295">In the audience were the Jews from Schwandorf, from Straubing, a few Jewish Gls, and Schwartz arranged a program which included music by the first musical group in the area, from Camp Deggendorf. </sentence><sentence id="296">And as I listened to them, there were tears down my eyes to think that thousands and thousands and thousands of Jews with that kind of talent were burned in the gas chamber. </sentence><sentence id="297">I was the last speaker, and I'll never forget looking into these sad faces. </sentence><sentence id="298">And when I got through, it was like a wind came in and slowly they drifted out. </sentence><sentence id="299">And when I came home I sat down and wrote my wife a letter and I, of course, realized what do they have to be happy about?Hanukkah, the joyous moment. </sentence><sentence id="300">So that was the Hanukkah. </sentence><sentence id="301">I went one later on, but I missed my first great experience and I better tel] it now, and that is my visit to Dachau. </sentence><sentence id="302">On October 6, 1945, the day before I left Schwandorf, I heard there is a camp at Dachau. </sentence><sentence id="303">I didn't know too much about it. </sentence><sentence id="304">The Joint at that time had a pool of two or three drivers so one of the men was assigned to drive me and it was obvious he was very reluctant to do it. </sentence><sentence id="305">We came to Dachau. </sentence><sentence id="306">It was a beautiful morning. </sentence><sentence id="307">We parked the car at the far end of the lot. </sentence><sentence id="308">We didn't know what we're going to find. </sentence><sentence id="309">It was a large installation, barracks you know. </sentence><sentence id="310">As it turned out that the first building I walked into was the gas chamber. </sentence><sentence id="311">And the driver, this man was in back of me...I believe there was a German guide. </sentence><sentence id="312">I can't say for sure. </sentence><sentence id="313">At any rate, we walked into what I learned was the gas chamber. </sentence><sentence id="314">The walls were covered with blood. </sentence><sentence id="315">Now, it's beautiful, painted white if you go there. </sentence><sentence id="316">It's a museum. </sentence><sentence id="317">From the gas chamber, I walked into the next room that had three ovens. </sentence><sentence id="318">I recall turning back and looking at this man's face. </sentence><sentence id="319">It was green. </sentence><sentence id="320">And mine...mine must have been the same way. </sentence><sentence id="321">I walked into a third room, and the room was lined with shelves with small earten jars. </sentence><sentence id="322">And I looked down and in front of me were two barrels of human ashes. </sentence><sentence id="323">My blood must have been frozen. </sentence><sentence id="324">I turned to my right and I wanted to grab the first thing I could and there was a barrel with these earthen jar  covers, which I brought. </sentence><sentence id="325">And by that point I wanted to get out into the sunlight. </sentence><sentence id="326">And I didn't want to see anything of the camp. </sentence><sentence id="327">And we walked to the far end of the lot and we got to the car. </sentence><sentence id="328">And the man turned to me and said, "Levine, look what you got in your hands?" </sentence><sentence id="329">The jar covers were just almost like glued. </sentence><sentence id="330">So we finally calmed down, both of us and I might say that as we were leaving, we saw Germans playing FuBball, soccer. </sentence><sentence id="331">They were guards who were prisoners of the United States army. </sentence><sentence id="332">They were being fed 4,000 calories a day as prisoners, while the Jews were getting 1700 calories a day from UNRRA and the military, most of it potatoes. </sentence><sentence id="333">At any rate, as we left, we got in the car. </sentence><sentence id="334">We both calmed down. </sentence><sentence id="335">And after 5 minutes or so the man turned...said to me, "Levine, did you notice that I was reluctant to drive you?" </sentence><sentence id="336">I said, "Yes." " </sentence><sentence id="337">So, I'll tell you why." </sentence><sentence id="338">He says, "I was on the last transport...last transport that was brought to Dachau. </sentence><sentence id="339">The Americans were approaching. </sentence><sentence id="340">They couldn't even talke us in the camp. </sentence><sentence id="341">They took us on a march about 30 kilometers. </sentence><sentence id="342">I was on the march from Dachau to Munich. </sentence><sentence id="343">Almost half of the people dropped dead or were shot on the way. </sentence><sentence id="344">And before the Germans ran away...this was the pattern...they'd shot half of the survivors." </sentence><sentence id="345">And he said, "I was among the living and I ended up in Munich. </sentence><sentence id="346">That's why you found me in Munich." </sentence><sentence id="347">Then he said, "Who would have thought that I who was brought to Dachau to be exterminated would walk through and come out alive." </sentence><sentence id="348">So that's; just one of the incidents. </sentence><sentence id="349">I want to say something about my dear friend, Chaim Diamond. </sentence><sentence id="350">Chaim Diamond was a young man who, with his younger brother, were survivors of Auschwitz. </sentence><sentence id="351">Chaim was the president of the little community of Eggenfelden. </sentence><sentence id="352">He later became active and was a member of the Central Committee. </sentence><sentence id="353">And I left him in "46. </sentence><sentence id="354">We renewed friendship in "56 in New York, where he is a successful businessman and we've been friends ever since. </sentence><sentence id="355">And while talking about Chaim, I can also talk about Eggenfelden because this is an example of what kind of work I did. </sentence><sentence id="356">For instanae, one day I received a telephone call from the UNRRA Director, who was a gentlemen from Virgin Islands named Johnson. </sentence><sentence id="357">He called me up. </sentence><sentence id="358">I'd never heard of Eggenfelden but he called me up and told me the story that there were Jews living in Eggenfelden under horrible living conditions and that there was a hotel...I thought he said it was owned by a Jew. </sentence><sentence id="359">At any rate, which is about to be turned over to the Germans by the town major, and he suggested that I try to come down and maybe try to get the hotel for the Jews. </sentence><sentence id="360">So I drove to Eggenfelden and I had my notes home, and I took inventory of how Jews lived. </sentence><sentence id="361">Six people in the basement, five people in one little room with one twin bed. </sentence><sentence id="362">It was horrible conditions. </sentence><sentence id="363">So I talked to the Jews, came back, saw the colonel in charge of this department for the army, gave him the report at 9 o'clock in the morning. </sentence><sentence id="364">By 4 o'clock in the afternoon he sent over a message to me, "You can have the hotel." </sentence><sentence id="365">So they arranged for the Jews to move into the hotel. </sentence><sentence id="366">That wasn't all. </sentence><sentence id="367">After the Jews settled, the delegation came to me, "We need a Jewish center." </sentence><sentence id="368">So we found an abandoned building not...almost a block away from the hotel, and I got that from the military. </sentence><sentence id="369">And the Jews again cleaned it up, painted it, so forth. </sentence><sentence id="370">I took some people with me for the...on the official opening, and what a Joy it was to walk into this newly-painted hall. </sentence><sentence id="371">The fixtures were made by a man who was in the business in Poland before the war, and they made the fixtures from planes...parts of parts of airplanes, and there were Jewish musicians singing and dancing until about 4 o'clock in the morning. </sentence><sentence id="372">That was in the town of Eggenfelden where Chaim Diamond was one of the leaders. </sentence><sentence id="373">Deggendorf has to be mentioned. </sentence><sentence id="374">Deggendorf was a camp of 400 Jews in the area, mostly German Jews who were rescued from Theresienstadt and Chaplain Lipman had a lot  to do with them coming there. </sentence><sentence id="375">And I must say that I met Gene Lipman in Munich and he said, "We'll get together." </sentence><sentence id="376">Two days after I was in the little town of Schwandorf, Gene Lipman appeared with his assistant, Si, Simon Pava, P-A-V-A, wonderful Chaplain's assistant. </sentence><sentence id="377">And he said, "Joe, what did you bring with you from America? </sentence><sentence id="378">Can you take it with you? </sentence><sentence id="379">We're going to a birthday party." </sentence><sentence id="380">And, of course, I was there only one day, so I had stuff that I brought from the United States. </sentence><sentence id="381">Canned stuff to give away. </sentence><sentence id="382">Put it in the Jeep and we road to the little town of Terschenreuth (ph) where there were four sisters whom Gene helped to live. </sentence><sentence id="383">He realled saved their lives. </sentence><sentence id="384">We had a wonderful party. </sentence><sentence id="385">That night I slept with Gene in a small bed. </sentence><sentence id="386">At 6 or 7 o'clock in the morning I was awakened by Gene. </sentence><sentence id="387">He said, "Joe, we're going to Deggendorf," which meant nothing to me. </sentence><sentence id="388">And it was my first four hour ride in a Jeep. </sentence><sentence id="389">Almost killed my insides. </sentence><sentence id="390">We got to Deggendorf and when people saw Gene and his assistant, it was almost that noise like a messiah came. </sentence><sentence id="391">Hundreds of people suddenly began approaching. </sentence><sentence id="392">See, Gene was one of the saviors. </sentence><sentence id="393">The camp was well- organized. </sentence><sentence id="394">A woman named Kitty Rothschild ran it til the end. </sentence><sentence id="395">At any rate, what happened...I'm telling you the story of Deggendorf because when Gene appeared he carried bags of mail. </sentence><sentence id="396">The Jews had no mail service, so Gene...and these people had a lot of American relatives. </sentence><sentence id="397">So Gene arranged with these Jews to address letters to Americans. </sentence><sentence id="398">He sent them out in his own envelopes, with a note: Send your reply to me and I'll deliver it. </sentence><sentence id="399">So he set up a mail service which I inherited. </sentence><sentence id="400">And that was part of my job. </sentence><sentence id="401">I did that too. </sentence><sentence id="402">I might say that while doing that Jews came over to me to ask me to find their relatives in America. </sentence><sentence id="403">So the mail would come and I had an uncle named Jake Bernstein. </sentence><sentence id="404">He moved to Cleveland. </sentence><sentence id="405">So some guy would give me a name Izzy Cohen, he moved to New York. </sentence><sentence id="406">Go find Izzy Cohen I didn't have any copying machine, damn it, but I cabled to America and got telephone books and with my boy and I...with Moshe and I would sit sometime most of the night copying all the Goldbergs like J. Goldberg from Brooklyn, and I sent him a letter with a note that so and so comes from this town. </sentence><sentence id="407">He's looking for his uncle. </sentence><sentence id="408">Maybe you're his relative. </sentence><sentence id="409">Once in a while I got a reply. </sentence><sentence id="410">That was part of the mail service. </sentence><sentence id="411">My work, as I said, required providing food, clothing and shelter. </sentence><sentence id="412">We faced a situation where Jews after the Kielce Pogrom", we had hundreds of Jews coming into the United States Zone. </sentence><sentence id="413">We lacked housing for them. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="746">A: What? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="748">Q: Where was the Kielce Pogrom from? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="750">A: In Poland. </sentence><sentence id="751">The Jews returned to Poland, and there was antisemitism and they killed a number of Jews, so Jews fled from Poland. </sentence><sentence id="752">And this was already in "46 and I got to tell you a story how I was in...at the Czech border, came home tired, when I found a message. </sentence><sentence id="753">Report to </sentence></p><p><sentence id="754"> * The Kielce Pogrom took place on 4 July 1946. </sentence><sentence id="755">Forty-two Jews were killed, and the incident initiated a mass migration of surviving Eastern European Jews to the West. </sentence><sentence id="756"> General Perkins, 4th Armored Division, immediately upon your arrival. </sentence><sentence id="757">So as tired as I was, I jumped in my Jeep and went to headquarters. </sentence><sentence id="758">And when I came in...I'm not trying to impress you, but it's interesting that there were Colonels and Majors waiting to see the General, Chief of Staff a man named Erzag (ph). </sentence><sentence id="759">I remember him. </sentence><sentence id="760">As soon as he saw me, he went into the General's office, out marched a couple of colonels and I was ushered into the General's office. </sentence><sentence id="761">There was another General with him, Robert (ph). </sentence><sentence id="762">I came in. </sentence><sentence id="763">The General greeted me and he did something he never did before. </sentence><sentence id="764">He had a basket of cigarettes. </sentence><sentence id="765">He said, "Joe, sit down. </sentence><sentence id="766">Have a cigarette." </sentence><sentence id="767">I smelled something. </sentence><sentence id="768">I said, "You wanted to see me immediately on my arrival." </sentence><sentence id="769">So he said...he told me then what happened. </sentence><sentence id="770">He said, "While you were gone, the General and I discussed the problem of housing for the Jews." </sentence><sentence id="771">You see the Army was responsible for a lot of this. </sentence><sentence id="772">And they wanted efficiency and they then told me...so he then said, "We decided we found a way to solve the problem." </sentence><sentence id="773">I said, "What do you have in mind?" </sentence><sentence id="774">he said, "Well in the town of Pocking (P-O-C-K-I-N-G) down near Passau, southern part of Bavaria, we have a camp where there are four thousand Hungarians and two thousand Poles now occupying that." </sentence><sentence id="775">He said, "We're going to ship the Hungarians out. </sentence><sentence id="776">We'll take the Poles and send them to some other...there were thousand of Poles...Polish camps." </sentence><sentence id="777">He said, "We'll turn that camp into a Jewish camp." </sentence><sentence id="778">He said, "We'll take all the Jews who live in these little towns and put them in this camp." </sentence><sentence id="779">And I blew my top. </sentence><sentence id="780">When I walked out, I really pinched myself, saying "Did you dare do it?" </sentence><sentence id="781">I talked to these Generals and I said, "Are you guys crazy or nuts?" </sentence><sentence id="782">I said, "Number one, you'll have to take every Jew and carry him bodily. </sentence><sentence id="783">Secondly, I'll have nothing to do with it. </sentence><sentence id="784">Thirdly, I'll let my headquarters know in New York what you want to do. </sentence><sentence id="785">You're talking about people who came out of...came out of the death camps, and you want: to put them in another camp." </sentence><sentence id="786">Well, they saw my reasoning, but they said, "Joe, we're still going to get rid of the Hungarians. </sentence><sentence id="787">We'll still get rid of the Poles. </sentence><sentence id="788">We've got to provide space for the new Jews coming in. </sentence><sentence id="789">Now, mind you, a lot of these people were not...caught in this camp. </sentence><sentence id="790">They came from Poland, so he suggested that Gene Lipman, Rabbi Lipman and I drive down. </sentence><sentence id="791">So we drove to Pocking, and we found these Hungarians. </sentence><sentence id="792">It was maddening for me to see these beautiful, well-dressed women with beautiful expensive fur coats. </sentence><sentence id="793">The Hungarians worked for the Nazis. </sentence><sentence id="794">And there were Poles there, but we found that this was a huge air base, used by Hermann Goring, with hundreds of planes that had been bombed Installation of 1O or 15 thousand people were with hospitals, halls, and so forth. </sentence><sentence id="795">The facilities that were there, many of them bombed out. </sentence><sentence id="796">To make a long story short, they got rid of the Hungarians, who I might say took very movable item that they could. </sentence><sentence id="797">They ripped the walls. </sentence><sentence id="798">They took the pipes. </sentence><sentence id="799">They took the sinks. </sentence><sentence id="800">They took light fixtures. </sentence><sentence id="801">The Army had to rebuild them. </sentence><sentence id="802">They got rid of the Poles, who took all the cut wood with them. </sentence><sentence id="803">And then we began shipping Jews into the camp. </sentence><sentence id="804">Shortly after the camp opened, the General again sent a message to me: wants to see me. </sentence><sentence id="805">He said, "Joe, we'll having trouble with the camp. </sentence><sentence id="806">The Jews are burning beds, which is presenting a problem to the military. </sentence><sentence id="807">Go down and see what's what." </sentence><sentence id="808">So I went down and I...sure enough when the Poles left they took all the wood and the saws and everything else that the Jews were supposed to get, the Gls sold them on the route, and the Jews were freezing so they burned beds. </sentence><sentence id="809">And they complained; well, we took care of that. </sentence><sentence id="810">I might say that two things happened during that visit. </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="819">Q: Continue. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="821">A: Now during this trip to Pocking, I recall several things happened. </sentence><sentence id="822">Number one, if I haven't mentioned it, I want to say that I took along with me...I brought to this camp Becky Lyons, the nurse who came from Palestine sent by the Jewish Agency. </sentence><sentence id="823">I called a meeting of all the people of the camp to explain to them that I was working with the military and will see that they will get whatever they need to make life more comfortable. </sentence><sentence id="824">As we were waiting for this group to get together, I found myself sitting next to a man and little son, about 10 or 11 years old, and I got in a conversation with the man and he told me that he was a partisan. </sentence><sentence id="825">You know, through most of the war he lived in the forest with his son. </sentence><sentence id="826">His wife was killed. </sentence><sentence id="827">And I turned to the little boy and I said, "What did you do?" </sentence><sentence id="828">He said, "I was a partisanchik." </sentence><sentence id="829">I was a little partisan. </sentence><sentence id="830">And then he said, "The other two kids who were there with me used to join me and at night we'd sneak into the nearest town to steal food." </sentence><sentence id="831">And then in Yiddish he said, "If we had to shoot, we shot." </sentence><sentence id="832">This was a little kid. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="845">Q: How old about? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="847">A: About Il, 12 years old. </sentence><sentence id="848">And then his father said to him in Yiddish, "Show them where they shot you." </sentence><sentence id="849">And the kid picked up his sleeve, and he slowed me where he had been shot through the arm. </sentence><sentence id="850">This is a little kid. </sentence><sentence id="851">At any rate, I still remember standing on the platform with Becky Lyons with me, and when I introduced Becky as coming from Palestine, the symbol, a living person from Palestine where they wanted to go, I saw a sea of smiles as she said "Shalom." </sentence><sentence id="852">Just that one word, shalom, lit up the faces of the whole crowd. </sentence><sentence id="853">Another thing that happened that day, I remember, was I found that: there was a transport of about 20 children, the first transport. </sentence><sentence id="854">Later on there were hundreds of children brought in. </sentence><sentence id="855">I'll tell you where they came from. </sentence><sentence id="856">And I walked into a barrack where these kids were sleeping on straw mattresses. </sentence><sentence id="857">I spoke to the leader called Amadrich, a young girl about 18 years old and I'll never forget when I asked her what I could provide that the kids needed most, and her reply was, "Get me paper. </sentence><sentence id="858">Get me pencils. </sentence><sentence id="859">Maybe books. </sentence><sentence id="860">These children have to learn." </sentence><sentence id="861">This was the first thing she asked me for. </sentence><sentence id="862">Well, to end the story of Pocking, I might say that Pocking grew to a camp with about 6 or 8 thousand Jews. </sentence><sentence id="863">You see, Jews were fleeing from Poland and other parts of Europe into the United States Zone. </sentence><sentence id="864">Since they had not been in camps, you know, this was better than sleeping outdoors. </sentence><sentence id="865">Children appeared because the Jewish Brigade boys brought them. </sentence><sentence id="866">You know, people don't know the story that after the war, members of the Jewish Brigade in Palestine volunteered to go into Europe to find children, and they went into Rumania and Hungary, and Poland and they found Jewish children that were living in monasteries or whatever, and they brought them into the United States Zone. </sentence><sentence id="867">And that explains why there were so many children in Pocking. </sentence><sentence id="868">UNRRA threw a large team into  Pocking, a Jewish member of the Joint named, I think the first name was Ruth, Fisher. </sentence><sentence id="869">F-I-S- H-E-R, from Chicago was the Joint worker in Pocking. </sentence><sentence id="870">At any rate, that's the story of Pocking, and at home I have the figures of population....I'll turn it over to the Museum...in Pocking by the end of the time I left. </sentence><sentence id="871">And one unforgettable thing that happened...I don't know whether I gave it to her for...to show here, but I brought it with me is the story of the Barhovich siddur. </sentence><sentence id="872">Now Moshe Barhovich was the head of the Vad Hadati, extreme organized Jews in Regensburg. </sentence><sentence id="873">I worked with Moshe. </sentence><sentence id="874">To give you an example of the kind of work he did, when a Polish young man whom I helped to become a director opened up a small camp in the middle of the forest where they took over the barracks where Hitler trained some of his toughest men for murder, a small camp was opened. </sentence><sentence id="875">And I went on the day when the first transport arrived, and Tony did a beautiful job of fixing the place liveable, and within 10 minutes a delegation came to me, saying, "The camp is fine, but where is the kosher kitchen?" </sentence><sentence id="876">So Tony, as a Polish Catholic, didn't think of the kitchen. </sentence><sentence id="877">The army didn't think of the kitchen, and I didn't mention it. </sentence><sentence id="878">So I had quite a job to convince the Jews that I'm going back to Regensburg, and I'll see that everything was sent up within a day or two for a kosher kitchen. </sentence><sentence id="879">When I came back to my office, Moshe...I mean this man Bohovich, was waiting for me, and he wanted to know what about the kosher kitchen in the camp. </sentence><sentence id="880">So I told him the problem I had. </sentence><sentence id="881">I found there was no kitchen, but we gotta go out and buy the pots and pans, and we'll do it. </sentence><sentence id="882">He said, "You give me the money and I'll go out and get it." </sentence><sentence id="883">Three hours later. </sentence><sentence id="884">I looked out of my office and I saw a sight I'll never forget. </sentence><sentence id="885">This fellow, Bohovich, and two men with him apparently rented a hugh Mercedes, one of the big ones. </sentence><sentence id="886">I looked out of my window and there is Bohovich sitting in this car, surrounded with pots and pans, came to tell he that he was on the way to the camp. </sentence><sentence id="887">That night they had their kosher kitchen. </sentence><sentence id="888">They made a kosher kitchen. </sentence><sentence id="889">Well, at any rate, I think it was Purim, where I went to the services in the makeship synagogue. </sentence><sentence id="890">Moshe showed up with his two young boys. </sentence><sentence id="891">He had maybe 13 or 14 year-old boys. </sentence><sentence id="892">We had few siddurim, prayer books, and as the service started, Moshe pulled out a siddur, a book. </sentence><sentence id="893">And I was sitting next to them, and the three of them, all of them doven, prayed, from this one book. </sentence><sentence id="894">After the service I examined the book and I found that it had...I later counted them...148 pages of a hand- printed siddur. </sentence><sentence id="895">So as to the story of the siddur, which I asked him later to write out, which I have here in Yiddish and I ought to translate into English. </sentence><sentence id="896">And the story was that he and his family lived in the town of Zelechow, in Poland. </sentence><sentence id="897">The Germans entered....captured the town, and the Poles worked with the Germans. </sentence><sentence id="898">He recalls how the synagogue was destroyed, Torahs they ripped up, and how....he describes in this letter how his daughter and wife and sister and children were killed, mentioned to me that he thought he was among only a handful of survivors of 15,000 Jews in Zelechow. </sentence><sentence id="899">He had been a partisan, but when the wrote the siddur, he said he was living in hiding in the cellar of a Pole, who also took advantage of him he said. </sentence><sentence id="900">At any rate, being a former..a pious Jew who worshiped three times a day, fearing that he may die and his boys would not have prayer book to doven, he said I didn't even have room to stand up because I got...somehow he got paper and ink well and ink and from memory he wrote this siddur, Bohovich siddur. </sentence><sentence id="901">So I cabled America, and I got the proper paper and I got a hold of a German who made several copies. </sentence><sentence id="902">I have one copy. </sentence><sentence id="903">I gave Rabbi Lipman the small copy which the German first experimented and I had another copy which I gave to the archives in Munich, so that it is now in the Yad VaShem. </sentence><sentence id="904">My copy was taken by Rabbi Lipman to the  Hebrew Union College. </sentence><sentence id="905">They copied it and it is now in their collection of rare books. </sentence><sentence id="906">Now this was all in.... Now, after the war when I got home, I made efforts and I contacted a number of these people: Americans, Palestine, Israel, New York, elsewhere. </sentence><sentence id="907">I kept on a correspondence and I began looking for Moshe Bohovich. </sentence><sentence id="908">And one day I wrote to Yivo, you know, in New York, and asked them if they heard about it, and they told me that in the memorial book on Zelechow, you know, after the war there were hundreds of memorial books published by groups to memorialize their towns...the pictures of the dead. </sentence><sentence id="909">And they told me if I went to the memorial book on Zelechow, there is something by Moshe Bohovich. </sentence><sentence id="910">And then they said...they suggested I write to a guy named Kaplan Cohn in Chicago. </sentence><sentence id="911">So I wrote to Cohn, and within a week I got a letter from a guy. </sentence><sentence id="912">He said, "I'm Moshe Bohovich. </sentence><sentence id="913">I understand you're looking for me. </sentence><sentence id="914">I live at 233 Grand Street, New York. </sentence><sentence id="915">Within a short time, I was in New York and I met Moshe. </sentence><sentence id="916">Now because he had two chiLdren, he was among the earliest ones I helped to get the heck out of Germany. </sentence><sentence id="917">Of course, I...when he left I assumed he was going to Palestine. </sentence><sentence id="918">When I met him in New York, he told me that he and his children ended up in San Jose, Costa Rica. </sentence><sentence id="919">He started an export business. </sentence><sentence id="920">By that time, his two sons were grown. </sentence><sentence id="921">He had a son with 4, 5 children who was running the business. </sentence><sentence id="922">He spent 4 months in Costa Rica, 4 months in Miami, and 4 months in New York. </sentence><sentence id="923">Goodness. </sentence><sentence id="924">His other son, Bernado, graduated Harvard, got a degree from University of Barcelona, was one of the leading attorneys in Costa Rica; still practices under the name of Baruch Bohovich Abstein. </sentence><sentence id="925">In Costa Rica, was represented Costa Rica, in the UN. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1028">A: Now as I say, in the 50s, I met Moshe Bohovich. </sentence><sentence id="1029">We corresponded. </sentence><sentence id="1030">Since early 70...in 73, when I first...after I retired, I went to Florida and I met him in Florida where he was living with his wife. </sentence><sentence id="1031">For a number of subsequent years I'd see him. </sentence><sentence id="1032">I have this wonderful story about his siddur, and as a Federation Director, I brought many outstanding writers and other peoples to lecture in Fort Wayne and when they heard the story, their answer was, "Joe, write it. </sentence><sentence id="1033">I'll help you print it in a magazine." </sentence><sentence id="1034">The old gentleman refused to give me permission until a few years ago when I last saw him and he finally told me why. </sentence><sentence id="1035">He said that when he was a partisan, the Germans put a price of 100,000 Marks on his head for capture. </sentence><sentence id="1036">He must have done something to antagonize the Germans. </sentence><sentence id="1037">To make a long story short, he said...told me that he didn't want anything written about him, so that anybody who know where he was. </sentence><sentence id="1038">At the age of 87, when he knew he didn't have long to live, he went to Ipala, Israel, where he died. </sentence><sentence id="1039">And after his death, his son gave me permission. </sentence><sentence id="1040">And I wrote the article which was published in the Jewish Spectator. </sentence><sentence id="1041">The editor, Trudy Weis, who died  shortly after the article was published. </sentence><sentence id="1042">So it was the last thing she did was include the article about the Bohovich siddur in the Spectator. </sentence><sentence id="1043">I published the story in the publication of our Indiana Jewish Historical Society. </sentence><sentence id="1044">I didn't mention that I'd been directing the work of the Indiana Jewish Historical Society since 1972. </sentence><sentence id="1045">So that's the story of the Bohovich siddur. </sentence><sentence id="1046">I brought a picture of the Slota, S-L-O-T-A, family. </sentence><sentence id="1047">It's worth mentioning because I was in my office in Regensburg when I got a call advising me that there was some Jews from a transport of Germans that were brought to Regensburg. </sentence><sentence id="1048">I located where they placed these people. </sentence><sentence id="1049">It was in an old, abandoned school house. </sentence><sentence id="1050">When the Germans abandoned school house, you know, 100 years old, you know, the walls were thick and damp, it was cold, and I found 10 Jews in one room, where one double bed occupied by Mr. and Mrs. Slota and two children, Mita and Yana. </sentence><sentence id="1051">They must have been about 11 years old. </sentence><sentence id="1052">I remember I helped the others and I took this family and got them an apartment, clothing for the children and so forth. </sentence><sentence id="1053">And on my last day...and this was before I left that all this happened, I went to say goodbye to the family and by that time we had a little kindergarten. </sentence><sentence id="1054">I'll never forget I went to the kindergarten and there were these two little girls with starched dresses, ribbons in their hair and they turned to me like a record, both of them, says, "You love me. </sentence><sentence id="1055">Yes?" </sentence><sentence id="1056">So I bought a picture of this family. </sentence><sentence id="1057">Both of these girls are now mothers. </sentence><sentence id="1058">One has 5 children and is a grandmother. </sentence><sentence id="1059">The other has four children. </sentence><sentence id="1060">Leo Slota died in New York. </sentence><sentence id="1061">There is a third beautiful daughter that they had in America, and I been in touch with them. </sentence><sentence id="1062">I want to mention that family because again similar to other stories. </sentence><sentence id="1063">I had a experience in the city of Furth, F-U-R-T-H, which is outside of Nuremberg. </sentence><sentence id="1064">This was just shortly after I got to Regensburg. </sentence><sentence id="1065">I found that there was a transport of Jews arriving in Furth. </sentence><sentence id="1066">Now Furth had a...apparently there was a collection of houses used by German slave laborers and I remember being there as these Jews arrived, doling out a cup of soup and potatoes. </sentence><sentence id="1067">The Jews moved into these houses. </sentence><sentence id="1068">Later on, we found that they were in a very unsanitary, unhealthy conditions, so the whole bunch was moved to a place in Bamberg, camp in Bamberg where the Jews lived. </sentence><sentence id="1069">I mention to you because an interesting thing happened. </sentence><sentence id="1070">In the "50s, Becky Lyon whom I mentioned, Israeli Nurse, was in New York. </sentence><sentence id="1071">I arranged to meet her in a Greenwich Village Hotel. </sentence><sentence id="1072">When I called her, she told me that her sister, who was a well known writer, was going to have dinner with us and she said, "I'm gonna have a friend there." </sentence><sentence id="1073">Well, I came there, called her room, and while I was waiting, a gentleman walked up to ne and he said, "Mr. Levine, do you remember me?" </sentence><sentence id="1074">I looked at the guy, and he looked like a thousand other Polish Jews, and I said, "I really don't." </sentence><sentence id="1075">He said, "My name is Ignatz Eichler, E-I-C-H-L-E-R. ]He says, "You gave me a cup of soup and a piece of bread in Furth." </sentence><sentence id="1076">Well, he finally came to America, and he opened an electrical appliance store. </sentence><sentence id="1077">Becky had helped him and in gratitude he shipped over a lot of appliances and we were joined by the two sisters. </sentence><sentence id="1078">We went to a wonderful restaurant on 14th Street...no, 12th Street, where there were these singing waiters and the chorus from the Metropolitan Opera was there, and there was wonderful singing and Ignatz insisted to pay the bill. </sentence><sentence id="1079">After that dinner, then we went to...I forget the name of a well known nightclub where Molly Lyons Bar David, Becky's sister, met a well known American writer. </sentence><sentence id="1080">He was crippled and in a wheel chair. </sentence><sentence id="1081">I forget his names. </sentence><sentence id="1082">We were there til 3 o'clock in the morning. </sentence><sentence id="1083">Ignatz insisted on paying. </sentence><sentence id="1084">I was glad that he was able to do it, but... That's the memories of Furth. </sentence><sentence id="1085">Uh...As I said, most of my time was spent traveling with the problems of the Jews and so forth. </sentence><sentence id="1086">I am just giving you  some of the highlights of things that happened to me. </sentence><sentence id="1087">Uh...I talked... talked about the death marches. </sentence><sentence id="1088">I should mention that I have photographs for myself dedicating monuments. </sentence><sentence id="1089">After a while, the Jews, under some law, had the Germans erect monuments. </sentence><sentence id="1090">So I brought a picture. </sentence><sentence id="1091">You will have it. </sentence><sentence id="1092">How they placed...that's right. </sentence><sentence id="1093">I have pictures of a place in Ergoldsbach, a little town where the Jews put up a series of monuments and this was the dedication service. </sentence><sentence id="1094">I was one of the speakers. </sentence><sentence id="1095">Another one was a professor from Austria, Jew who had been in the concentration camps. </sentence><sentence id="1096">This was a dedication of 78...where 78 people were killed on the last day before the survivors walked into Ergoldsbach. </sentence><sentence id="1097">And this happened in a number of towns. </sentence><sentence id="1098">Now... </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1172">A: Yes. </sentence><sentence id="1173">I will talk about Nuremberg Trial. </sentence><sentence id="1174">I want to say too that the Jews, as I mentioned earlier, came from Poland where they were highly organized. </sentence><sentence id="1175">In Regensburg, they already formed a Central Committee to work with all these towns. </sentence><sentence id="1176">The Central Committee also worked with the large committee in Munich. </sentence><sentence id="1177">See, there was a Committee of Liberated Jews. </sentence><sentence id="1178">In Regensburg, they had the Central Committee of Niederbayern and Oberpfalz. </sentence><sentence id="1179">That was the name of it. </sentence><sentence id="1180">From the district. </sentence><sentence id="1181">It's amazing the set of committees, they had assignments made. </sentence><sentence id="1182">They had a lot of battles too. </sentence><sentence id="1183">There were a lot of fights for power, because if you are committee man you have power to distribute funds and food which the Joint provided. </sentence><sentence id="1184">So that there was a lot of times spent through the local committee, some sad things happened as well as good things happened, working with them.. I want to...Let me close with two stories. </sentence><sentence id="1185">Number one, I say I got talk about the Joint Distribution Committee. </sentence><sentence id="1186">The people should know. </sentence><sentence id="1187">The Joint Distribution Committee was a Jewish American relief agency. </sentence><sentence id="1188">The major food did not come from us. </sentence><sentence id="1189">They came from UNRRA and the Army. </sentence><sentence id="1190">We supplemented. </sentence><sentence id="1191">We supplemented with money to enable...enable the people to buy stuff that they needed. </sentence><sentence id="1192">I think to illustrate the meaning of the Joint people, I want to tell a story how in January of 1946, there was the first Conference of Liberated Jews in Europe, called in Munich. </sentence><sentence id="1193">Ironically, it was held in the Rathaus, the city hall in Munich. </sentence><sentence id="1194">Everything around it was kaputt. </sentence><sentence id="1195">Delegates from United States, French, American zones lived in straw mattress camps came to this conference, and the great of the world came. </sentence><sentence id="1196">I remember. </sentence><sentence id="1197">On Sunday morning, I was way up on the top of the rafter. </sentence><sentence id="1198">I wanted...I didn't want to take a seat from these people. </sentence><sentence id="1199">A little man appeared on the platform I wasn't an ardent Zionist; I was interested. </sentence><sentence id="1200">I didn't know the man. </sentence><sentence id="1201">And speaking in Yiddish at one point, he turned to them, he waved his fist, and his white hair flew around and he said in Yiddish, "You cannot remain, nor will you remain in this hated Germany. </sentence><sentence id="1202">You cannot return to blood covered Poland where the millions have died. </sentence><sentence id="1203">Or Rumania." </sentence><sentence id="1204">And he waved his fist and he said in Yiddish, "There's one little tiny piece of land in this world where," in Yiddish he said, "your brothers and sisters are willing to share their homes, their food." </sentence><sentence id="1205">And he waved his arm again, "If we have to fight and die to bring you to Eretz, we'll do it." </sentence><sentence id="1206">This hall was electrified. </sentence><sentence id="1207">Electrified! </sentence><sentence id="1208">And as I drove...we drove back to Regensburg in that cold and in an open Jeep, Moshe drove me back, I tried to analyze what happened there and I decided that the most important thing that happened was that Ben Gurion let them know they're not alone. </sentence><sentence id="1209">And I'm using this story to point out that that was the role of the Joint. </sentence><sentence id="1210">We Were there. </sentence><sentence id="1211">There was somebody represented American Jewry to  help, and that was exciting. </sentence><sentence id="1212">Just one or two other things, two stories and I'll quit. </sentence><sentence id="1213">My experience in Nuremberg at the Nuremberg trials. </sentence><sentence id="1214">Streicher", the worst...one of the worst of the Nazi had a magnificent mansion outside of Nuremberg. </sentence><sentence id="1215">It was taken over and made into a Kibbutz. </sentence><sentence id="1216">And I should say that before long young Jews began to marry, as if they're going to let the world know we're going to make more Jews. </sentence><sentence id="1217">Interesting, there was a number of marriages going on. </sentence><sentence id="1218">And there was a wedding in Streicher's home, in the kibbutz and me being the Director of the Joint...they had no father, so I was...you know like the...whatever it was...the guy...the substitute father. </sentence><sentence id="1219">So I attended that wedding. </sentence><sentence id="1220">The next morning we drove to Nuremberg and two things happened. </sentence><sentence id="1221">We came to an area where we saw blocks and blocks with piles of cut marble. </sentence><sentence id="1222">We suddenly came to a...what looked like an entrance to a huge field. </sentence><sentence id="1223">We drove into this field that we drove around, just two Jews in a little Jeep. </sentence><sentence id="1224">I learned later that all that marble was cut for Hitler's monument he was going to erect to last a thousand years. </sentence><sentence id="1225">And later that I learned that we were on that field that you've seen on television where Hitler addressed a quarter of a million Germans, in that field. </sentence><sentence id="1226">That was one thing that happened that morning. </sentence><sentence id="1227">Then we passed, what I discovered, was the Court of Justice where the Nuremberg Trial was going on. </sentence><sentence id="1228">So I said "Moshe, stop." </sentence><sentence id="1229">I was in uniform. </sentence><sentence id="1230">Thad a revolver which I carried all through my time, walked in and I talked to a Colonel at the desk and I asked whether I'd be admitted into the trial and he said, "Yes. </sentence><sentence id="1231">Of course, you could." </sentence><sentence id="1232">So I went out and gave my gun to Moshe. </sentence><sentence id="1233">Took a seat in the front. </sentence><sentence id="1234">Oh yes, took a seat in the front row. </sentence><sentence id="1235">On my left, incidentally, when I went in I bought a chart how they sat, was where the prisoners sat on benches. </sentence><sentence id="1236">When I got there, they were still standing around with briefcases, papers, I think it was the board of directors of the Chase National Bank. </sentence><sentence id="1237">In walked Hermann Goring and Hess. </sentence><sentence id="1238">I saw a little Beispiel(r): one or two guys turned their back to Hess, to Gering. </sentence><sentence id="1239">Others clicked their heels, bowed and shook hands with Goring. </sentence><sentence id="1240">Five minutes later, court was called to order, so these men took their seats. </sentence><sentence id="1241">Hermann Goring who sat in the front row facing me, took a huge blanket and wrapped it around his big fanny, sat down and dropped his head and throughout the Trial looked like he feel asleep. </sentence><sentence id="1242">Sitting next to him was Hess, and he had a lot of papers and he kept on writing. </sentence><sentence id="1243">Nobody was paying any attention to the Jews. </sentence><sentence id="1244">I remember Schacht" staring at something at the ceiling all though this thing. </sentence><sentence id="1245">You know, the top, except Bormann and Hitler and the little guy, whatever his name was.. </sentence></p></dialogue>
