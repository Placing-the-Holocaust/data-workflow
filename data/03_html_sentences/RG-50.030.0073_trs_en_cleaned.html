</sentence><sentence id="576">And we started to work in these forests making wood. </sentence><sentence id="577">I don't know for whom. </sentence><sentence id="578">And the part of us were working to building a bridge for this river from wood. </sentence><sentence id="579">It was in the middle of May, 1942. </sentence><sentence id="580">Nearly to the end of July we get information that the families left in Milingihed Sporlavski was taken away to, away. </sentence><sentence id="581">Meanwhile, we could go to Milingihed to take what was left from ours, and so. </sentence><sentence id="582">You know why it's crazy to tell it, but the only way to come through the first month in Poland was to sell everything what you have on you. </sentence><sentence id="583">First the jacket, then a shirt, then the shoes. </sentence><sentence id="584">Because the people, I mean, the Polish people was all so poor. </sentence><sentence id="585">And if you want to have a little milk or you want to have maybe five kilo potatoes, you have to give up a pair of socks. </sentence><sentence id="586">No money. </sentence><sentence id="587">15 So we take some things and went to, back, and then sometimes we can go to this town, to  Milingihed Sporlavski. </sentence><sentence id="588">It was not permitted, but not on the main road, through the forest you can achieve it. </sentence><sentence id="589">And we went, we had some connections to a family, they had a small factory for landscape matins. </sentence><sentence id="590">We met, his name was about Yaborchek or Yaborsky or so. </sentence><sentence id="591">And they explained to us what is Treblinki. </sentence><sentence id="592">Because two brothers who went with the same transport as our families in July, they came back. </sentence><sentence id="593">We wouldn't believe that all is true what they told us. </sentence><sentence id="594">We asked if it is so that they have there so many S.S., so many Ukraine policemen, so many Lithuanian killers. </sentence><sentence id="595">How could you escape? </sentence><sentence id="596">And so the younger told me it was very easy, but others, Jewish members help us out. </sentence><sentence id="597">We are working in a group which was loading shoes, clothes and other things what the people bring to Treblinki. </sentence><sentence id="598">And in the last wagon, it was evening, we stay in the wagon, but they didn't close the wagon. </sentence><sentence id="599">And so when we moved from Treblinki we could open the wagon to jump from the wagon and came home. </sentence><sentence id="600">But in a few days I heard that somebody was telling that they escaped from Treblinki and the German S.S., they take them. </sentence><sentence id="601">So we have been sure, and so we have very good contact to the Polish people around. </sentence><sentence id="602">So, for example, in this forest was a man, his name was Hijuc, he was very sympathy. </sentence><sentence id="603">He has a big sympathy to us. </sentence><sentence id="604">And he allowed us to make a bunker in the forest and my cousin and two other men and one boy from a village, I 16 don't remember exactly, but the name of this boy was Edek. </sentence><sentence id="605">He was about, say, 17, 18 years. </sentence><sentence id="606">He helped us to make the bunker, to buy some food, I mean, potatoes and such things. </sentence><sentence id="607">And we are expecting when they came to take us. </sentence><sentence id="608">And I came not very often but once, two times a week, but in connection with a German and Polish administration of the camp. </sentence><sentence id="609">So if I would go away, so maybe it wouldn't be so good. </sentence><sentence id="610">But these three boys, they went away and they stay in the bunker. </sentence><sentence id="611">And the next day, I don't remember, it was maybe a week or ten days or so, really one day afternoon came trucks, Latvanian and German S.S. men, and they started to shut and take us away. </sentence><sentence id="612">They took us on the tracks and they brought us, on each track, to soldiers with guns. </sentence><sentence id="613">They took us to Milingihed Sporlavski and we stayed on the square sitting on the stones and waiting. </sentence><sentence id="614">I have seen there very many awful things. </sentence><sentence id="615">I saw how they killed small children one year or so only, take by the foots and broken their heads. </sentence><sentence id="616">It was awful. </sentence><sentence id="617">I knew that it is the beginning of the end. </sentence><sentence id="618">At evening we went to a big barrack and put, we spoke about that we destroy the barrack. </sentence><sentence id="619">It was only from wood, and we try to escape. </sentence><sentence id="620">But then somebody from the Germans and we saw that machine guns had been around, five, six machine guns, we .. could do it, but the percentage of success, maybe five, maybe ten percent, not more. </sentence><sentence id="621">The next day we went on the railway station. </sentence><sentence id="622">They put us in wagons. </sentence><sentence id="623">We came then to Lukof. </sentence><sentence id="624">.In Lukof they connected more wagons. </sentence><sentence id="625">And the train went slowly, slowly, 17 slowly. </sentence><sentence id="626">We saw that we are passing railway stations Cherletz. </sentence><sentence id="627">And we knew that from Cherletz is a railway station, the next railway station on the right side, not the railway station; but the railway road, is to Markeniza. </sentence><sentence id="628">And before Markeniza was the next station Treblinka. </sentence><sentence id="629">And we knew what Treblinka means. </sentence><sentence id="630">So everybody started, we was thinking how to, what to do. </sentence><sentence id="631">And on the windows on the wagons they have been not covered already, but only wires with nails. </sentence><sentence id="632">So we tried to lock them. </sentence><sentence id="633">Maybe we could do it. </sentence><sentence id="634">But after Cherletz we passed a main station. </sentence><sentence id="635">As we came out you feel it because when you are going through this crossingways. </sentence><sentence id="636">So the train made a stop. </sentence><sentence id="637">And somebody opened the door from outside and a German soldier came in and asking, "Schnell, schnell, schnell." </sentence><sentence id="638">And somebody gave him 500 Latien. </sentence><sentence id="639">So it was not enough for  him, so he was always urging, "More, more money, more (?)." </sentence><sentence id="640">And between we heard that the train is moving, "Whoo," that it wants to move. </sentence><sentence id="641">I don't know what happened, but it happened. </sentence><sentence id="642">I was there, very near. </sentence><sentence id="643">Somebody took a wire on his neck, we called it a Satirian tie, and the German was ready, he couldn't make a noise or something, and the wagon was open. </sentence><sentence id="644">So it was the way for us to escape. </sentence><sentence id="645">And so the people, the boys and the older people, started to jump. </sentence><sentence id="646">And of course I have done the same. </sentence><sentence id="647">I was lying a short time until the train passed away, and then I stand up and near to me a second man that came to me, "Where we go?" </sentence><sentence id="648">I told him, "I don't know. </sentence><sentence id="649">I don't know where I 18 am." </sentence><sentence id="650">But I told him, or he told me, first, far, we have to go from the railway road because it's dangerous to stay here. </sentence><sentence id="651">So... that, doggies. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="907">Q: Would you continue your story. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="909">A: And, as I mentioned before, I was not sure if Mr. Borlinsky, or what was his name? </sentence><sentence id="910">He will come back with the money or not. </sentence><sentence id="911">So I decided to go away without money but with my, on my legs and healthy. </sentence><sentence id="912">And the next way, my way was to go to the forest where Mr.Hichug was the boss and where we had the bunk, to my friends, and to arrive there and to try to jump on a plane, not on a plane, but on a train, to try to come backeto, not to Czechoslovakia, but to Slovakia. </sentence><sentence id="913">I was sure that if I will come back I could stay alive in Slovakia because I had some good friends and I could have Christian papers and it would be not a problem for me to stay there. </sentence><sentence id="914">But as I came in the bunker to Mr. Hichug, and to this bunker, to my cousin and two other boys, they told me they tried, it's impossible because on some places where the train is breaking and going slower that you can jump on the train, it's impossible to go in, because the Germans are very, they are, they have special guards on these places. .. </sentence><sentence id="915">So I talked to this Mr. Hichug and he told me that maybe it would be good for you and for Edek, it was these Polish people, to make some contacts here in this part, in direction Grodava in this big forest. </sentence><sentence id="916">I heard that there are some Soviet 23 soldiers and they are living in these forests and maybe you could go to them. </sentence><sentence id="917">So why only me and this Edek? </sentence><sentence id="918">Because the other people, they're too, I would say, too Jewish. </sentence><sentence id="919">And so I decided with Edek that we will go. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="932">Q: What do you mean by "too Jewish"? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="934">A: You have to know that the Polish people, and even some Ukraine people, they don't like Jews. </sentence><sentence id="935">They have been, I would not say the whole nation, but many of them have been very big anti-Semites. </sentence><sentence id="936">And by the word Jew, sometimes they wouldn't help you, and not only help you, but even they, it has been many cases. </sentence><sentence id="937">I could speak about the actual cases. </sentence><sentence id="938">That a family, take a Jewish family, and in the first 100 meters of the forest they lull them and took away what they have. </sentence><sentence id="939">It happens, such things. </sentence><sentence id="940">So I went with Edek and we came to Gerotine, and to a family. </sentence><sentence id="941">And the next night we met two Russian soldiers, not partisan this time, and we spoke to them. </sentence><sentence id="942">Ah, so and so, but have you weapon, have you this? </sentence><sentence id="943">No, we haven't. " </sentence><sentence id="944">Have you been a soldier?" </sentence><sentence id="945">I told yes, I was a soldier. </sentence><sentence id="946">I was in an officer's school. " </sentence><sentence id="947">So come with me, come with us." </sentence><sentence id="948">And so they took us to their group. </sentence><sentence id="949">It wasn't a real group of organized partisans. </sentence><sentence id="950">I say it was a group of people who want to live, and the only one .. way how to come through was to have a gun and to fight. </sentence><sentence id="951">And because my situation was the same I didn't went to them for a reason that I will fight again Germans, becauss it, what can do I alone against the Germans. </sentence><sentence id="952">But I wanted to live. </sentence><sentence id="953">And to stay in 24 2 this bunk in the wintertime, it was not very good because first of all the snow on the bunk wasn't so constant-like around. </sentence><sentence id="954">The second, if you are going here and there you will leave, yes. </sentence><sentence id="955">So I saw that even Mr. Hichug wasn't happy that we are on his territory. </sentence><sentence id="956">I mean, this Mr. Hichug, he was the boss about the forest. </sentence><sentence id="957">So I decided to stay with them. </sentence><sentence id="958">I told them that I am from Czechoslovakia and so, but only the truth, because I knew that they have been so afraid, as I was, because their  1 life was not guaranteed. </sentence><sentence id="959">So we went together. </sentence><sentence id="960">They have certain places in the forest where they have their bunkers and what they have done, they have built some good connections with certain families. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="988">Q: Did these soldiers know you were Jewish at this time? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="990">A: I didn't tell them, they didn't ask. </sentence><sentence id="991">They didn't know. </sentence><sentence id="992">I, maybe that, yes. </sentence><sentence id="993">But according what I spoke to them it was about 20 people or so, I know that in name only, not in the family name, but only on Peorta, Avon, Volodya, Rishar, and so. </sentence><sentence id="994">One man, I mean, Peorta Dugi. </sentence><sentence id="995">He was a very tall.man. </sentence><sentence id="996">He was working like a commandant. </sentence><sentence id="997">But he was not in a shot that he was a lieutenant or something like this. </sentence><sentence id="998">He was the strongest and he was maybe clever enough. </sentence><sentence id="999">He knew something about how to move irregular. </sentence><sentence id="1000">And he was quite good in preparing, preparing material for destructions. </sentence><sentence id="1001">And this was very important. </sentence><sentence id="1002">And then, as I told, as I mentioned, they had to many families very 25 good connections to Polish people and Togram people. </sentence><sentence id="1003">And these connections was made on the fact that if they had something from the Germans so they divided it with the people around, because they had been very poor. </sentence><sentence id="1004">And except of this, they need weapons. </sentence><sentence id="1005">The Poles, I know why, but this time I couldn't understand, because it was a big danger for them. </sentence><sentence id="1006">And so, if this group decided to do something it was not because they get some orders from higher commandant oW so. </sentence><sentence id="1007">Only to get everything what they need for their, for our living and then to show the Germans that somebody is there, is here, who can do something against them. </sentence><sentence id="1008">It was very good. </sentence><sentence id="1009">I personally had very good, also very good connections to some Polish families. </sentence><sentence id="1010">I, from the day as we came to Poland I learned Polish. </sentence><sentence id="1011">I read newspapers. </sentence><sentence id="1012">I read books to learn the language. </sentence><sentence id="1013">Because I know that the language can help me very much if I have to live between them, because such a possibility was here. </sentence><sentence id="1014">But this winter was really a very, very strong winter, "42, "43. </sentence><sentence id="1015">Outside it was sometimes 25, 30 degree celsius. </sentence><sentence id="1016">I don't know how much, but it's more, it's hundred, I don't know... </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1044">Q: Below zero. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1046">A: Below zero, yes. </sentence><sentence id="1047">And we have been unable .. to live so. </sentence><sentence id="1048">So some of this group went to Polish families and they have been hidden and so I told them that even I have the possibility to move and promised that in the Spring we will come back. </sentence><sentence id="1049">And I come back to this bunker, to Mr. Hichug, but my 26 friends haven't been there. </sentence><sentence id="1050">They have been in another bunker, in a stable. </sentence><sentence id="1051">In such a house where in the summertime the horses have been, the horses which were working in the woods. </sentence><sentence id="1052">And so, as I came there, we decided to go back to the ghetto. </sentence><sentence id="1053">It was not a decision, but I thought, "I am going back." </sentence><sentence id="1054">And we send, Mr. Hichug arranged us, that somebody went to Minziret and was going around the ghetto to look if there is alive, or who is there, and so, and he came back and told us yes, he saw people in the ghetto and the gates were not closed, so that the Jewish people who stay in the ghetto can move free. </sentence><sentence id="1055">So I decided to go back. </sentence><sentence id="1056">I came into the ghetto, but it was the end of February, middle of February. </sentence><sentence id="1057">And I met some people who I knew, even from our transport. </sentence><sentence id="1058">It was a boy from the next village, Freddie. </sentence><sentence id="1059">I don't remember his other name. </sentence><sentence id="1060">And then the second one, Joseph. </sentence><sentence id="1061">And later came my cousin, and to this ghetto,  2 Victor. </sentence><sentence id="1062">It was good, because we hadn't been outside, but we haven't a place where to live because all these barracks have been full with people sick, and typhus was very strong. </sentence><sentence id="1063">And my cousin died on typhus on this place. </sentence><sentence id="1064">After the Spring, it was coming. </sentence><sentence id="1065">So, and we were working in the houses where before have been Jewish houses, and some bring all what it was in the houses left. </sentence><sentence id="1066">The commandant of this works was a German gendarme. </sentence><sentence id="1067">He was, I wouldn't say that he was good, but he was very correct. </sentence><sentence id="1068">A very simple man, very correct and I wouldn't say that he was very lucky, what happened to part of people like

Polish money or some jewelry. </sentence><sentence id="1071">Because we have to go through all the pieces of cloth. </sentence><sentence id="1072">And, of course, we were working something, even of our own invoice, but not very much. </sentence><sentence id="1073">And in the middle of, it could be spring. </sentence><sentence id="1074">It was spring, it was warm. </sentence><sentence id="1075">Maybe April or so. </sentence><sentence id="1076">One of our Czechoslovak, from our transport, was in, he was a tailor. </sentence><sentence id="1077">And, you know, "Kraviats, kraviats."
