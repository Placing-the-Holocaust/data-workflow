<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="5837">A: So in fact, we used to walk it after the war. </sentence><sentence id="5838">Because Buchenwald is in the mountains, and this is below the mountain. </sentence><sentence id="5839">So from there, we were there, I don't know, from January until April. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="5843">Q: So you were in Buchenwald for all that time? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="5845">A: Oh, yes, and we were in what is called a children's barracks. </sentence><sentence id="5846">It had three -- I think they had three or four barracks where they kept just children. </sentence><sentence id="5847">And I guess, there was a whole story behind it, because the -- also Germans, since the 1930s, were -- they were prisoners. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="5851">Q: Yes. </sentence><sentence id="5852">In Buchenwald, it had had a lot of German political prisoners. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="5878">Q: Okay. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="5880">A: And to my knowledge, they had Germans with guns roaming the prison. </sentence><sentence id="5881">So I guess, the Germans feared a lot that the prisoners, whether it was the Germans or Russian prisoners, I don't know, but I know there were Germans. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="5884">Q: Okay. </sentence><sentence id="5885">But when you are saying Germans, are you talking about German political prisoners or -- </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="5886">A: German political prisoners that smuggled in arms. </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="5887">Q: Oh, I see what you are saying. </sentence><sentence id="5888">They were working in the ammunitions factory. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="6055">A: Right. </sentence><sentence id="6056">So we looked in there, and I saw the tanks, the Germans running and Germans jumping off the towers. </sentence><sentence id="6057">And it was just like a movie scene of some sort. </sentence><sentence id="6058">So this is what I saw through that window. </sentence><sentence id="6059">And I was kind of -- you know, because they were shooting into the barracks. </sentence><sentence id="6060">So we got to the ground on the floor, and we just waited it out, you know. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="6067">Q: Were there any revenge killings? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="6069">A: Yes. </sentence><sentence id="6070">They had, some of the people, I don't know what rank they were, what capacity they were, the Germans, they took them in to where they held the prisoners, the Buchenwald prisoners, you know, that they tortured them there. </sentence><sentence id="6071">And they took the Germans, and they gave us two hours for people to go in and beat them up. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="6086">Q: Yeah. </sentence><sentence id="6087">What did I want to ask you? </sentence><sentence id="6088">Now, there is a famous photograph of, I believe it is Eisenhower. </sentence><sentence id="6089">I'm not exactly sure. </sentence><sentence id="6090">But when he comes and he sees what has happened at Buchenwald, he is so appalled that he orders the townspeople of Weimar to come and be forced to look at -- </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="6091">A: Right. </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="6092">Q: -- what was going on in the camp. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="6100">Q: Okay. </sentence><sentence id="6101">Can you tell me about that? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="6104">A: About that, I cannot tell you very much. </sentence><sentence id="6105">But you know, because first of all, the army kept away the prisoners from these people that they brought in. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="6108">Q: Oh, so you saw them at a distance? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="6110">A: We saw them in the distance. </sentence><sentence id="6111">We couldn't get so close to them, because of the fact that, you know, revenge would have taken place. </sentence><sentence id="6112">And in the U.S., don't take revenge on other people, you know, even, you know, they come into a town, and they don't kill other people. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="6116">Q: Yeah. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="6118">A: Either they keep them prisoners or whatever. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="6119">  Interview with Jacques Ribons 127 </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="6120">Q: So in other words, the reason why the prisoners were kept away from the townspeople was because to prevent any kind of violence happening? </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="6121">A: Well, you couldn't help some violence. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="6123">Q: Right. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="6125">A: Because the prison -- the wires were all torn down. </sentence><sentence id="6126">You could go out through the wires anywhere you wanted to go. </sentence><sentence id="6127">I used to go to the villages and ask for things to eat, you know, in the beginning. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="6131">Q: And did they give them to you? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="6133">A: Oh, yes. </sentence><sentence id="6134">Oh, yes. </sentence><sentence id="6135">I think they had so much fear in them, that it was beyond belief. </sentence><sentence id="6136">You know, a guy nearby Buchenwald was a mayor of this particular town. </sentence><sentence id="6137">He was made mayor right after the Germans moved away and the Allieds came in, the Allied Forces. </sentence><sentence id="6138">I don't know who installed him as mayor, but he was the mayor. </sentence><sentence id="6139">I walked into the mayor's house, and I asked him, I would like to have a bike. </sentence><sentence id="6140">He says, no problem. </sentence><sentence id="6141">He gave me an address, and I went up there and tried to get the bike. </sentence><sentence id="6142">And of course, the bikes were all hidden. </sentence><sentence id="6143">You couldn't find them. </sentence><sentence id="6144">So you know, the idea is that the -- the reason I'm saying that, that the Germans had so much fear of being beaten up or being killed. </sentence><sentence id="6145">And in fact, some of them were. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="6159">Q: Yeah. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="6161">A: By the Russian prisoners, you know, the ones that were older, not the youngsters, you know. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="6167">A: No. </sentence><sentence id="6168">They didn't have it. </sentence><sentence id="6169">It was all empty. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="6170">   Interview with Jacques Ribons 128 </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="6171">Q: Okay. </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="6172">A: All the barns were empty. </sentence><sentence id="6173">Everything was empty. </sentence><sentence id="6174">You know, so | didn't get a bike. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="6178">Q: So but it means that by the time that the Americans got -- they were entrenched there, you were able to move out of the camp? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="6180">A: Oh, absolutely. </sentence><sentence id="6181">Somehow or another, we got right through the fence. </sentence><sentence id="6182">The fence was torn apart, and we just walked out. </sentence><sentence id="6183">And we went to the nearby towns. </sentence><sentence id="6184">I went a couple of times to Weimar. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="6190">Q: What was it like? </sentence><sentence id="6191">Did you still wear your prisoner's uniform? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="6194">A: We didn't have anything else, really. </sentence><sentence id="6195">Just a prisoner's uniform. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="6198">Q: How did people behave? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="6200">A: Fear. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="6202">Q: Okay. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="6204">A: Some of them were beaten up by others, by the prisoners. </sentence><sentence id="6205">So, you know, I was a kid incapable of doing anything, too weak. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="6208">Q: Yeah. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="6210">A: So. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="6212">Q: But you saw it in their eyes? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="6214">A: Oh, yes. </sentence><sentence id="6215">I saw it, saw them being beaten up, and they were beaten up when they brought the Germans in. </sentence><sentence id="6216">I don't know whether it was soldiers or civilians that were brought in, and kept them where they used to torture the prisoners. </sentence><sentence id="6217">They kept them there. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="6218">And they used to let them in at, let's say, 3:00 in the afternoon for a half hour to beat the hell out of them, you know. </sentence><sentence id="6219">But you know. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="6220">   Interview with Jacques Ribons 129 </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="6221">Q: But were these civilians that were brought in there? </sentence><sentence id="6222">A.

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="6229">Q: But what I'm trying to get at is, they weren't former guards that you could recognize? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="6231">A: No. </sentence><sentence id="6232">No. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="6235">Q: Okay. </sentence><sentence id="6236">The reason they were brought in is because they happened to be German, not because they happened to have been a particularly cruel guard? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="6239">A: They had some too. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="6241">Q: Oh, yeah. </sentence><sentence id="6242">I'm sure. </sentence></p></dialogue>
