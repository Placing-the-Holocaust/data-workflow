<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="5283">A: So in fact, we used to walk it after the war. </sentence><sentence id="5284">Because Buchenwald is in the mountains, and this is below the mountain. </sentence><sentence id="5285">So from there, we were there, I don't know, from January until April. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="5289">Q: So you were in Buchenwald for all that time? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="5291">A: Oh, yes, and we were in what is called a children's barracks. </sentence><sentence id="5292">It had three -- I think they had three or four barracks where they kept just children. </sentence><sentence id="5293">And I guess, there was a whole story behind it, because the -- also Germans, since the 1930s, were -- they were prisoners. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="5297">Q: Yes. </sentence><sentence id="5298">In Buchenwald, it had had a lot of German political prisoners. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="5330">A: And to my knowledge, they had Germans with guns roaming the prison. </sentence><sentence id="5331">So I guess, the Germans feared a lot that the prisoners, whether it was the Germans or Russian prisoners, I don't know, but I know there were Germans. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="5567">A: About that, I cannot tell you very much. </sentence><sentence id="5568">But you know, because first of all, the army kept away the prisoners from these people that they brought in. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="5571">Q: Oh, so you saw them at a distance? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="5573">A: We saw them in the distance. </sentence><sentence id="5574">We couldn't get so close to them, because of the fact that, you know, revenge would have taken place. </sentence><sentence id="5575">And in the U.S., don't take revenge on other people, you know, even, you know, they come into a town, and they don't kill other people. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="5579">Q: Yeah. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="5581">A: Either they keep them prisoners or whatever. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="5582"> This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="5583">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="5584"> Interview with Jacques Ribons 127 </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="5585">Q: So in other words, the reason why the prisoners were kept away from the townspeople was because to prevent any kind of violence happening? </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="5586">A: Well, you couldn't help some violence. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="5588">Q: Right. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="5596">Q: And did they give them to you? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="5598">A: Oh, yes. </sentence><sentence id="5599">Oh, yes. </sentence><sentence id="5600">I think they had so much fear in them, that it was beyond belief. </sentence><sentence id="5601">You know, a guy nearby Buchenwald was a mayor of this particular town. </sentence><sentence id="5602">He was made mayor right after the Germans moved away and the Allieds came in, the Allied Forces. </sentence><sentence id="5603">I don't know who installed him as mayor, but he was the mayor. </sentence><sentence id="5604">I walked into the mayor's house, and I asked him, I would like to have a bike. </sentence><sentence id="5605">He says, no problem. </sentence><sentence id="5606">He gave me an address, and I went up there and tried to get the bike. </sentence><sentence id="5607">And of course, the bikes were all hidden. </sentence><sentence id="5608">You couldn't find them. </sentence><sentence id="5609">So you know, the idea is that the -- the reason I'm saying that, that the Germans had so much fear of being beaten up or being killed. </sentence><sentence id="5610">And in fact, some of them were. </sentence></p></dialogue>
