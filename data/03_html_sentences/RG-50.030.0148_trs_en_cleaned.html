<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="581">A: It was terrible and worse yet in other families, but as far as I and we were concerned, I was still employed by the congregation. </sentence><sentence id="582">I got my monthly check and we could make a living. </sentence><sentence id="583">However, my mother remained at the time still in that village where I was born. </sentence><sentence id="584">My father has died already, so I brought her up to...to Budapest and she lived for a very short while in our house and later on, she lived...my brother became a student at the Rabbinical Seminary at the University because that was...uh...the Seminary student had to finish college as well. </sentence><sentence id="585">They had to get a degree from the university. </sentence><sentence id="586">So in order to save him from labor camp when he came up, I made sure that he is...he will be there as a student of the Rabbinical...of the Rabbinical...the Rabbinical...uh...Seminary. </sentence><sentence id="587">It was no problem because he had a tremendous amount of Hebrew knowledge. </sentence><sentence id="588">And...uh...in...uh...1939, 40, even the beginning of 41, if we wanted to get something good, it had to be sent to us from Novi Sad. </sentence><sentence id="589">For instance, we...we needed some meat for Passover, so my in-laws sent with a cert....by a certain man, who was the superintendent of our buildings in Novi Sad, they sent up...I don't know...geese and whatever we needed. </sentence><sentence id="590">Uh...Jews...later after the second law again the Jews couldn't go out to the store at any time during the day and buy anything. </sentence><sentence id="591">They had a certain hour or two...I don't remember exactly...during the day when they could go out. </sentence><sentence id="592">And of course when they...when they could go out everything was gone. </sentence><sentence id="593">It was a very, very hard life with a lot of things missing. </sentence><sentence id="594">We were very lucky because my in-laws who lived in Yugo...in Yugo...again that was formerly Yugoslavia was Hungary again. </sentence><sentence id="595">They helped us out with many things. </sentence><sentence id="596">Now, as far as within the family, everything was fine because we had the...the benefit of the big congregation and everyone knew...uh...who we are and didn't bother us too much. </sentence><sentence id="597">However, when it came to...uh...being a Jew it didn't make any difference when the...when it was handled by the Nazis, the Hungarian Nazis. </sentence><sentence id="598">And so... </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="617">Q: What does that mean? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="619">A: It means that when the hack and cross, the...the Hungarian Nazis, you know, came because they were members of...of their...their organization, and they wanted you to show them where you are born and then you have the right to be here and you are a Hungarian citizen. </sentence><sentence id="620">Even if you were a Hungarian citizen, it didn't mean a thing because the laws covered...covered already everything what could destroy Jewish life or Jews in general. </sentence><sentence id="621">Now, when a family cannot go out and cannot live their own lives for...for...this is against the law, that's a terrible, terrible thing. </sentence><sentence id="622">I did one more thing in Budapest which I probably have never mentioned, but I will mention it now. </sentence><sentence id="623">This Mr. Epler, who was the Secretary General of the congregation, after the first Jewish law, after the first law against the Jew....when that was passed, he asked me if I could help out in the congregation and organize a district in the 7th district, which didn't exist before. </sentence><sentence id="624">People were taken up or rather thrown out from their own homes and they were moved together with other people, so there was a big problem. </sentence><sentence id="625">One family was kosher, kosher; the other wasn't. </sentence><sentence id="626">One family had old  3 people; the other had the young people and children. </sentence><sentence id="627">But they were moved together in apartments, and other apartments were taken away because there were some districts where the Jews couldn't live at all, and these Jews had to be placed where this was still a possibility for them to live. </sentence><sentence id="628">Now, I organized the 7th inner district at the time, and made sure that we know who is a Jew, who is not a Jew, who keeps a kosher home; who doesn't; and so and so that they forced getting together of these families in one apartment instead of three or four was let's say a little bit easier done than it could have been done if this information wouldn't have been available. </sentence><sentence id="629">And I was the secretary of that 6th...7th district for quite awhile (drinking water) so that we had a complete listing of the Jews who lived around us, about...Yeah, and this, of course, was already done and allowed to be done by the Germans and the Hungarian Nazis because this was preparatory to the ghetto so that the Jews would be together already. </sentence><sentence id="630">And this was done. </sentence><sentence id="631">Now what is your next question? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="646">Q: What happened to you as the years progressed? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="648">A: As the years progressed, 1940...Yeah, all the time, starting from 1938, either I was home for 4 weeks and then called back to the labor camp and was there for 2 months let's say. </sentence><sentence id="649">And I had the congregation force their way through their influences that I was allowed again to come home for let's say the month of the...of the High Holy Days or any holiday or Pesach or Shuef. </sentence><sentence id="650">So I came home and I stayed home for...for the time I was allowed to stay home...to stay home. </sentence><sentence id="651">And the winter months as a rule were taken more easy than the summer months. </sentence><sentence id="652">Summer months we almost constantly were in camp and for the winter months, sometimes we were allowed to...uh...g0 home and we lived there. </sentence><sentence id="653">Now what happened for instance, I can tell you one interesting thing about 1941 if we have time. </sentence><sentence id="654">In 1941, my sister-in-law who lived in Novi Sad, came for a visit to Budapest. </sentence><sentence id="655">And at the time our son, Emmy...Manny, was a very small child. </sentence><sentence id="656">He was born in 1936, and this sister-in-law, who loved him with all her heart, she told my wife, her sister, "Look, the child has a cold. </sentence><sentence id="657">He's coughing and all that. </sentence><sentence id="658">Novi Sad is still about a 100 kilometer south. </sentence><sentence id="659">I will take him down. </sentence><sentence id="660">Maybe his cough with subside easier there." </sentence><sentence id="661">So we went with her and...uh...I made arrangements because there were two chief cantors in Temple that mv colleasue who was with me will take  4 Danube River, and they were shot into the River. </sentence><sentence id="662">They were shot and fell into the River. </sentence><sentence id="663">Now, this went on for a long time. </sentence><sentence id="664">We saw trucks arriving there with ___ and Jewish people and they were all put into a line. </sentence><sentence id="665">I think a line of two and there was always a gendarme or a policeman who was told and informed by the government that all these people who are being...who are being taken here are being taken here because they are the enemies of Hungary. </sentence><sentence id="666">The really...the newly occu...back occupied Hungary because you know that was Yugoslavia. </sentence><sentence id="667">It was Hungary, then Yugoslavia, then the Hungarians occupied it again. </sentence><sentence id="668">So when our next came, before us was standing the owner of the house...uh... where my sister- in-law lived. </sentence><sentence id="669">When our next came, the policeman came over. </sentence><sentence id="670">I was holding Manny in my coat, in my fur coat because he...he had fever, and...uh...he took a look at me and said...uh..."What are you doing here? </sentence><sentence id="671">Chief Cantor, what are you doing here? </sentence><sentence id="672">You are not a Czechnik?" </sentence><sentence id="673">Czechnik meant the...the people who hated Hungary. </sentence><sentence id="674">The serp people and others who hated Hungary. </sentence><sentence id="675">You are no Czechnik. </sentence><sentence id="676">And he was all terribly excited, and ran over to the Lieutenant who was there was in charge and told him, "The...the Chief Cantor from the _____ is here. </sentence><sentence id="677">He's...he's not a cheknik. </sentence><sentence id="678">He's...I know him, and I "m there many times." </sentence><sentence id="679">Namely, as I told you before, the Temple was a very narrow street and because people were pouring out and would have been in danger, endangered each other, so he was...he and other 10 people were there and he was in charge of that group of policeman. </sentence><sentence id="680">So he knew me very well. </sentence><sentence id="681">And this while he was running back and forth, and at the third or fourth try, the lieutenant told him, "Put him aside. </sentence><sentence id="682">Stand him...let him stand aside." </sentence><sentence id="683">This saved our lives because Hortee (pause - drinking water) Hortee then called off the killing, and this is when it stopped at our . </sentence><sentence id="684">So if anyone will tell me this story, I wouldn't believe it, but it's true. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="764">A: Now, my family became part of...of this Bergen Belsen, the Kosner group as they called it...uh...because my brother and I were very active in Zionistic work and the people knew that so whoever was in charge of this Kosner group they said...though I wasn't home at the time...I was probably in the Ukrainian at the time already...they said, "Though (that's my Hungarian name) isn't home, we cannot forget...uh...Ella and...and their...their son, Emmy, and they...they were engaged and my brother-in-law's still there as a Rabbinical student he was not taken into...into labor camp. </sentence><sentence id="765">So he was extremely active. </sentence><sentence id="766">He probably had something to do with it to...to bring it to the attention of the people. </sentence></p></dialogue>
