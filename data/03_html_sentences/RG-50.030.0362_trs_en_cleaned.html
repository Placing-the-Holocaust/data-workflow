<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3">A: I'm Henry Cohen. </sentence><sentence id="4">I was born in Manhattan, 73 years ago, I'll be 74 in June, and I think I was born on Henry Street in lower Manhattan, the lower East Side. </sentence><sentence id="5">And I don't know whether I was named after the street or whether the street was named after me. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="9">Q: Tell us about your parents. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="11">A: My parents had a checkered career. </sentence><sentence id="12">They were both immigrants, they arrived from different communities in Lithuania in approximately 1907. </sentence><sentence id="13">My father was married at the time he arrived. </sentence><sentence id="14">And he and my mother met and they fell in love. </sentence><sentence id="15">And eventually they were married. </sentence><sentence id="16">But a lot of sturm und drang! </sentence><sentence id="17">over many years. </sentence><sentence id="18">And so I, I, I was born in 1922, I have an older brother, 1919, he's 75, yeah, 75 going on 76 and I have a younger sister who will be 68 and from my father's first liaison, I had an older half-sister and an older half-brother. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="27">Q: What do you know about the towns -- the villages where your parents came from and why did they want to come here? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="29">A: Well, my father was born to a baker, and was himself a baker at a very young age. </sentence><sentence id="30">His mother died when he was very young. </sentence><sentence id="31">I've written a piece on this, incidentally, called "A Century of Time." </sentence><sentence id="32">And his father remarried a woman who had two small children. </sentence><sentence id="33">My father, as a six or seven year old, recalled waking up to noise in the middle of the night and seeing, some feet away in the kitchen area, by candlelight, his stepmother feeding her children. </sentence><sentence id="34">He would recall as a youngster, in that age group, six, seven, eight, taking rolls and bread from his father's bakery in the winter and putting it under his coat and running to the edge of town and trading with the Lithuanian farmers for milk and cheese. </sentence><sentence id="35">So it was that kind of poverty. </sentence><sentence id="36">He turned against his father, I guess partly because of that, partly because of the growing spirit of enlightenment, enlightenment that was spreading in the 19th century. </sentence><sentence id="37">And he became an anarchist, and by 15 or 16 he was living in another town, owning a bakery of his own, hiding inside the bakery arms of the anarchist movement -- and may have played some role in the Russian Revolution of 1905. </sentence><sentence id="38">Anyway, to escape that life and that situation, and probably the Russian draft, he fled to the United States, leaving behind a wife and one or two children. </sentence><sentence id="39">My mother came from another town, which, before she was born, had a population of about four or five thousand, but  http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection there was apparently a big fire, which she had no memory of. </sentence><sentence id="40">I picked this up at the Museum of the Diaspora in Israel. </sentence><sentence id="41">The population of the town declined by half -- 25, 3,000 people. </sentence><sentence id="42">And she was a child of very old parents who had previous marriages. </sentence><sentence id="43">So, at the time she was born, her mother was 50 and her father was 65. </sentence><sentence id="44">And, thus, by the time she was 15, her mother was 65 and her father was 80, and that was a family of butchers. </sentence><sentence id="45">And so, her mother and father decided to turn over their little butcher shop to a, an older sister who was married to a butcher, and in return for room for their stay, being taken care of in their old age. </sentence><sentence id="46">And the son-in-law, husband of sis-- my mother's older sister, said he could take care of the parents, but he couldn't take care of young Sadie, age 15. </sentence><sentence id="47">So she was sent to America. </sentence><sentence id="48">So, it's a story of great poverty, the background. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="70">Q: Can you tell us both of their names? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="72">A: What? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="74">Q: Can you tell us both of their names? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="76"> A Yeah, my mother's name was Sadie Sheftel, I think it was Shayne Rochel Sheftel, was the family name. </sentence><sentence id="77">And my father's name was Avram, Abe, and, I think, I can't quite sort out the grandparent's names. </sentence><sentence id="78">Chana Leah was his mother briefly, until she died. </sentence><sentence id="79">His father's name was Israel Feivel. </sentence><sentence id="80">My mother's father's name was, I had it and I lost it. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="86">Q: You'll remember it. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="88">A: Okay. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="90">Q: And the names of the towns? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="92">A: My mother came from Ivye and my father came from Drozgenik which was a sort of a small spa. </sentence><sentence id="93">Interestingly enough, I've not been able to find material on Drozgenik in the encyclopedia, the Jewish encyclopedia, which has Ivye. </sentence><sentence id="94">And I, someone at the New York Public Library gave me some alternative names to try to trace through Lithuanian sources. </sentence><sentence id="95">Because for some reason, the Jewish sources don't have it. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="100">Q: What did your parents do here? </sentence><sentence id="101">When you were little, how did they make a living? </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="123">Q: And they spoke Lithuanian to each other? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="125">A: No, they spoke Yiddish, I think. </sentence><sentence id="126">They may have spoken Lithuanian, but I never heard it. </sentence><sentence id="127">Yeah, it was Yiddish all the way. </sentence><sentence id="128">And -- but as a result of this upbringing, this parentage, we grew up in a secular household. </sentence><sentence id="129">I was not bar mitzvahed, my brother was not bar mitzvahed. </sentence><sentence id="130">We had a very strong Jewish/Yiddish education through Workman's Circle schools. </sentence><sentence id="131">And my brother even today prides himself that he doesn't read the English version of the Forward, he buys the Yiddish version of the Forward? </sentence><sentence id="132">and reads that. </sentence><sentence id="133">And I went through the Workman's Circle elementary schools, high school, and even into their sem- the seminary for several years. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="143">Q: Tell us what that is. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="145">A: Well, the elementary school was somewhere in the neighborhood. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="147">Q: No, I mean the Workman's Circle. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="149">A: Workman's Circle was a fraternal organization that was linked to the Jewish socialist movement, the Bund". </sentence><sentence id="150">And so, in, particularly at the high school level, when I was going, I was taught by very prominent, famous Jewish literary people, scholars. </sentence><sentence id="151">It was in that sense a terrific education and I was taught all the Yiddish classic writers. </sentence><sentence id="152">Mendele,* Peretz,deg Sholom Aleichem, Ash", poets, but not taught Hebrew. </sentence><sentence id="153">And it was an anti- Zionist education because the Socialists out of the 19th century were universalists. </sentence><sentence id="154">Anti- stateism, stateists. </sentence><sentence id="155">And I -- when I went into the Army in 1944, I was trained for the infantry, went to Europe, fought in the infantry, the whole German campaign. </sentence><sentence id="156">After the war ended in Europe, I got myself transferred to military government and it was at that time in the summer of 1945, that I began hearing about the Holocaust and reading about  http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection it. </sentence><sentence id="157">And suddenly realizing that the political perspective that I had been taught in this Socialist system had really given me an empty political perspective for what was needed after the war. </sentence><sentence id="158">And so I sat down as a young person of 23, and I wrote a letter to one of the senior people at the Workman's Circle complaining about it, and protesting against it, and declaring that I would never set foot into Workman's Circle activity again. </sentence><sentence id="159">Because I felt I had been misguided, politically. </sentence><sentence id="160">And just as a minor passing note, by pure coincidence, in the last month or so, the Forward had a controversy going between the old Socialists and some references in the Forward to Jabotinsky", who was a right wing Zionist, the Socialists regarded him as a Fascist, so you get these articles and letters to the editor carrying on this old struggle with Jabotinsky. </sentence><sentence id="161">So, I decided to sit down and write a letter to the Forward telling the story that I've just told you. </sentence><sentence id="162">And referring, by saying that the problem isn't the Socialist and Jabotinsky, the problem centers on the anti, the Socialist anti-Zionist poison in general, against Ben Gurion(r) and Labor and Mapai? </sentence><sentence id="163">and kibbutzim. </sentence><sentence id="164">So they printed it as the lead letter and the headline was "Socialist Anti-Zionism -- Zionist Poison." </sentence><sentence id="165">So, I'm waiting for the responses to come in from the Socialists now. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="184">Q: What, in what way had they misguided you? </sentence><sentence id="185">What did you start learning about or realizing after the war that you felt you had been misguided on? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="188">A: They had trained, they had trained the Jewish side of me, the Yiddish side of me and then not provided me with a coherent political platform for that cultural education. </sentence><sentence id="189">They were anti-stateist. </sentence><sentence id="190">They used to write diatribes against Theodor Herzl!deg and Weizman!"! </sentence><sentence id="191">and that group also. </sentence><sentence id="192">So, here we were in Europe immediately after the end of the war where it was clear that the survivors would have to go to a state and the only ones who were organizing to take them in were the Zionists from Palestine. </sentence><sentence id="193">They were the ones who were organizing the underground routes to bring them to European ports and transferring them to ships and sneaking them into Palestine. </sentence><sentence id="194">America was not open, the anti-- there were no anti-- there were no refugee immigration laws at the time. </sentence><sentence id="195">So, in that sense, the other thing I point out in my letter is that is a result of coming to grips with this six months later, after I went into UNRRA, I could greet the Chief Rabbi of Palestine with a feeling of love and no mixed feelings, even though I'm not a religious person. </sentence><sentence id="196"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection I could go into a mass meeting of 2,000 people and hear Ben Gurion and be exhilarated. </sentence><sentence id="197">And I could deal with a Hasidic rabbi who was in my camp on a fellowship basis and what this opened up to me, finally, by virtue of my rebellion against the Socialists, was my all inclusive Jewish quality. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="209">Q: Just a little bit back because I think we need a few details about your time in the military. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="211">How did you go into it? </sentence><sentence id="212">Where did you go at first? </sentence><sentence id="213">What did you see and how did that affect you? </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="214">A: Okay. </sentence><sentence id="215">There was period after I got my baccalaureate, well actually, I moved very quickly from my baccalaureate into my masters program of city planning, so I got a deferment or two. </sentence><sentence id="216">But a friend of mine and I were exploring because we knew eventually we'd have to go in. </sentence><sentence id="217">And I remember us going to a naval recruiting station, oh like 1943, let's say. </sentence><sentence id="218">And the fellow across the desk is saying to us, "Do you like a good fight?" </sentence><sentence id="219">And we're; "uh, huh, uh," and, and then he's talking that they need people for LST, for landing ship tanks, you know, to run the boats. </sentence><sentence id="220">And we leave the building and one of us says to the other, "You know, I prefer terra firma, the firmer the better." </sentence><sentence id="221">So, independently of one another we were eventually mustered, not mustered, but taken in and within a month of my getting my master's degree, I was in the Army and in training and then six months later I was in Europe. </sentence><sentence id="222">I arrived at the beaches in France, moved to Belgium. </sentence><sentence id="223">What? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="234">Q: The year? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="236">A: 1944, then, September. </sentence><sentence id="237">And within weeks, transferred to, I was a replacement, transferred to the ninth Division at the Belgian boarder -- Hiirtgen Forest. </sentence><sentence id="238">And overnight the Hiirtgen Forest had some very special qualities; it was a tall forest and what the Germans were doing was shelling and the shells would hit the tops of the trees and detonate and the shrapnel would come down on you. </sentence><sentence id="239">And one-third of the group that I came in, either left in one day, dead or wounded. </sentence><sentence id="240">So, that was my initiation into combat. </sentence><sentence id="241">But in any event, I guess it was probably by October began the onslaught against Germany. </sentence><sentence id="242">And I was with the ninth Infantry Division. </sentence><sentence id="243">Which it turned out, the irony is, that they were the occupying division of the area in which the DP camp I went later, was in. </sentence><sentence id="244">My battalion, my regiment, were my primary adversaries. </sentence><sentence id="245">And life is very peculiar and funny in some ways. </sentence><sentence id="246">Anyway, so I was in battle for Aachen, Germany which is closest to the French border. </sentence><sentence id="247">I crossed the Ruhr River, Diiren. </sentence><sentence id="248">I was in the Battle of the Bulge. </sentence><sentence id="249">We then moved into the Rhine when that was over. </sentence><sentence id="250">And we were in Bad Godesburg which is just south of Bonn. </sentence><sentence id="251">Home to many governmental, German governmental offices. </sentence><sentence id="252">And one night, at four in the morning, five in the morning, word comes through that we've, the American forces have captured the Remagen bridge and they have sent people over it and we are put onto trucks, and by 11 o'clock in the morning we're down at the site and we're crossing the bridge under direct fire from the This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="253">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="254"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection other hills. </sentence><sentence id="255">Like the Palisades in New Jersey, crossing George Washington, under direct fire, you could see the tracer bullets as you're running your way across the bridge. </sentence><sentence id="256">And we establish a beach head on the other side. </sentence><sentence id="257">Now, just to step back a bit, because I've since been back there and also a friend of mine in New York, was in the public relations unit of the division that took the bridge originally. </sentence><sentence id="258">And it's an interesting story about the difference between the American forces and the German forces. </sentence><sentence id="259">By that point in the war, Hitler was trying to run the war, removing decision making from his commanders. </sentence><sentence id="260">In our case, what happened, was that a scouting group from one of the American divisions, moving through the woods, bypassing the city of Remagen, came to the heights there above the river, they look out and they see the bridge is still standing. </sentence><sentence id="261">It was the only bridge still standing. </sentence><sentence id="262">And they get word back to the battalion commanders, to the regimental commanders, to the division commanders, and to the Army group and then to General Bradley!" , </sentence><sentence id="263">General Bradley reaches Eisenhower at dinner that evening and says to him, "Shall -- which battle plan -- shall I stay with the battle plan that we're on, or shall I start changing things, because of this discovery of the bridge standing?" </sentence><sentence id="264">And Ike says, "Forget the old battle plan, pour the troops across." </sentence><sentence id="265">Now, that was the flexibility in decision making by able people. </sentence><sentence id="266">And so, Bradley starts giving the signal, "Pour it on, get" -- he mobilizes all the different divisions under him, "let's pour it on." </sentence><sentence id="267">And that shortened the war by two or three months. </sentence><sentence id="268">And so -- and I've since, incidentally, read historical criticism of the Battle of the Hiirtgen Forest -- basically, as an infantry private, I adored my commanders. </sentence><sentence id="269">I adored Bradley. </sentence><sentence id="270">I adored Eisenhower. </sentence><sentence id="271">I thought they were the greatest in the world. </sentence><sentence id="272">And, and anyway, I fought all the way to Leipzig. </sentence><sentence id="273">We could have moved on to Berlin. </sentence><sentence id="274">But, as a result of the Yalta agreement, we didn't. </sentence><sentence id="275">And I, I feel great about having been a soldier. </sentence><sentence id="276">I feel lucky that I survived it, that I was never wounded. </sentence><sentence id="277">It's all luck, there's nothing else but luck that makes a difference between wounded, dead and a standing soldier. </sentence><sentence id="278">I been, you know, battle after battle. </sentence><sentence id="279">I should, also, as an interlude here, indicate that there came a time in early April when we're moving towards the Ruhr Valley, that I got a pass, a three day pass to go to Paris. </sentence><sentence id="280">That was part of the rotation scheme. </sentence><sentence id="281">Letting different soldiers take a few days from the front line. </sentence><sentence id="282">And I went to Paris in April of 1945, a month as it turned out, before the war ended. </sentence><sentence id="283">And I'm walking -- I'm choking up as I'm telling you this story -- I'm walking along the Champs-Elysees, and word spread that Roosevelt had died. </sentence><sentence id="284">Again, you know, I believe all the things that the Holocaust people are saying about Roosevelt's inaction about the Holocaust, but, nevertheless, he was my Commander in Chief, and a soldier needs confidence that he's being well led, and so it was a very moving evening when word came through that he died. </sentence><sentence id="285">And then two days later I was back at the front. </sentence><sentence id="286">Yeah. </sentence><sentence id="287">Anyway, then because of my  http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection prior education and settlement house experience, I succeeded in getting myself transferred to military government. </sentence><sentence id="288">There I was promoted to Technician Fifth Grade. </sentence><sentence id="289">And [had terrific relationships with the military government, I don't know who. </sentence><sentence id="290">We were in, in a county, incidentally, Landkreis!, </sentence><sentence id="291">at Ginzburg, which was between Ulm and Augsberg, and it happened to be the city, I didn't notice at the, time, from which the Mengele family"* comes. </sentence><sentence id="292">I didn't know this. </sentence><sentence id="293">And as part of my duties for a few months, I set up a hospital for German women who were presumed to have venereal disease. </sentence><sentence id="294">And it was in response to the American soldiers who were, came down with venereal disease and they'd have to give the doctors the probable source of their particular encounter. </sentence><sentence id="295">And you'd get a name, and I was the chosen one. </sentence><sentence id="296">I set up the hospital and then I would drive to the particular community and try to identify the woman. </sentence><sentence id="297">I might meet with the local mayor or police chief or whoever, "Who's Daisy around here?" </sentence><sentence id="298">And I'd bring her in. </sentence><sentence id="299">And all the way she would complain, she's "eine anstindige Frau,!*" </sentence><sentence id="300">she's a respectable woman, and so on. </sentence><sentence id="301">And then I'd bring them in, go on the ward. </sentence><sentence id="302">We had a group of nuns taking care of them. </sentence><sentence id="303">They were tested. </sentence><sentence id="304">Then by three days later they weren't giving me any argument that they were respectable women. </sentence><sentence id="305">And, I remember once, a woman, who we finally discharged, came into the colonel or the chief of the group, wanting a letter that she was a her husband was coming back from the Luftwaffe"(r), she wanted some letter attesting to her this and that. </sentence><sentence id="306">And the major, colonel, calls me in and tells me about it and I says, "Look, all you can do is give her a letter." </sentence><sentence id="307">End of Tape #1  http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection Tape #2 </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="384">Q: Just finish that last story about the hospital with the German woman, the one, what your supervisor said about the letter. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="386">A: Yeah. </sentence><sentence id="387">Incidentally, I noticed in my material here that I, I had a memo in my material that I've just looked at, I haven't even read it word for word. </sentence><sentence id="388">Which is my inspecting a -- some hospital facility somewhere in this county we were in, which was a hospital for Jewish displaced persons. </sentence><sentence id="389">I have absolutely no recall about it. </sentence><sentence id="390">If you had asked me had you had any prior contact with Jewish DP's, I would have said "no." </sentence><sentence id="391">Because I've been asked that question before, but it appears, so I have like a five or six page memo of an inspection of this hospital. </sentence><sentence id="392">And I've just done an essay for class about an inspection I made of Harlem hospital in 1961. </sentence><sentence id="393">It's a subliminal yearning I have. </sentence><sentence id="394">Anyway, so, anyway, that county experience was a very interesting experience. </sentence><sentence id="395">And, but then, I had earlier somehow, since when I was trying to transfer to military government, I put in at a number of places, so I was called to serve at Supreme Headquarters in Frankfurt military government. </sentence><sentence id="396">They had higher authority in the contact, so they overruled my local commander and I went to Frankfurt and there, because of my combination of German and Yiddish -- two years of German in college, and Yiddish -- I was used as a translator of German documents into English. </sentence><sentence id="397">And then that must have lasted a month or so and I suddenly was told to go to Wetzlar north of Frankfurt to supervise the military government printing plant. </sentence><sentence id="398">That was printing military government documents. </sentence><sentence id="399">It was an old German printing force and I was there overseeing it. </sentence><sentence id="400">And in any event, during the, let's say, May or June period to October, I discovered probably some exchanges of correspondence that the head worker, the executive director of the settlement house that I had lived in for a year and a half while going to graduate school, was in Germany, and with UNRRA and he was in Munich. </sentence><sentence id="401">So, occasionally, once a month, I don't remember, on a weekend, I would travel from where I was to Munich, which wasn't far, and I'd spend a day with him. </sentence><sentence id="402">And then, in November, I learned that he was leaving Germany for, the States. </sentence><sentence id="403">He was going into the State Department Office of Refugee Affairs and so, we rendezvoused in Wiesbaden one weekend, which was zone headquarters for UNRRA, and it was over that weekend, and his name is Dick Winslow, Richard Winslow. </sentence><sentence id="404">He later, a year later, two years later, became the Secretary General to the Unite States Mission to the United Nations, right after it was formed. </sentence><sentence id="405">A very able fellow. </sentence><sentence id="406">Anyway, over this weekend, he said, "What the hell is someone like you doing supervising the operation of a printing plant, when there would be so much more important things for you to be doing given your background and your interests?" </sentence><sentence id="407">This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="408">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="409"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection You see, at the settlement house. </sentence><sentence id="410">my, one of my major assignments during the year and a half I was there, you had to do something in exchange for room and board, it was the South End House, was the second oldest settlement house in the country. </sentence><sentence id="411">It had been founded in 19 --1892 or 1893. </sentence><sentence id="412">He had to prepare a 50th annual report. </sentence><sentence id="413">He turned that assignment over to me. </sentence><sentence id="414">I went into all the historical files and books and reports and this and everything. </sentence><sentence id="415">I did the draft of the 50th annual report. </sentence><sentence id="416">This is how he and I became so close. </sentence><sentence id="417">Then he did some revision and upgrading and this and that, and it was printed. </sentence><sentence id="418">And then I did other things in the settlement house community, I did a term paper for my master's program on city planning, on the South End planning board. </sentence><sentence id="419">A history of that and what it did. </sentence><sentence id="420">So, he had a pretty good sense of my intellectual and practical interests of experience and then the following morning he brought me into zone headquarters and Gertrude Richland(ph) was there from the Eastern Division. </sentence><sentence id="421">A
