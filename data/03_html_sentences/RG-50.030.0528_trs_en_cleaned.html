<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="194">Q: Right. </sentence><sentence id="195">Do you remember wi -- in your childhood, was it a very religious family, in spite of the fact that your father wasn't raised that way, but because of [indecipherable] </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="196">A: My father adjusted to -- I would -- I would have to put it that way, my father did a good job adjusting to -- to my mother's orientation, religious orientation. </sentence><sentence id="197">And she did keep a kosher household. </sentence><sentence id="198">And that would take me to -- to the comment that kosher, I -- later in my career I became very much -- I became very knowledgeable along that line and th -- kosher can be -- can be many things. </sentence><sentence id="199">Some people keep kosher inside their home, while not paying very much attention to the law of kashrut, if you will, on the -- on the outside. </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="200">Q: Right. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="215">A: And the reason I emphasize that is because I -- la-later on in my career I became a caterer and I took over a catering business, which had been known as a kosher caterer. </sentence><sentence id="216">I changed that somewhat in branching out to a more secular orientation, I did -- but when doing something in the -- in the -- in the synagogue where lifestyle or lifetime events took place, I had to work with a mashgiach under -- under religious supervision, per se. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="247">Q: Mm-hm. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="531">A: Well, I think that it was a -- a policy by most parents to avoid involving children in -- in the pressure or in the tension that -- that existed at the time. </sentence><sentence id="532">And so the details of the -- of what went on is -- is not foremost in my memory. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="900">A: -- and the entire events that took place supported that idea that we were at our dest -- point of destination. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="902">Q: Right. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="904">A: The people stood on the deck, on top deck, looked down at the -- at the ocean, at the water and from the shore of -- of Havana, little boats with family members who had preceded the Saint Louis, they came to greet their relatives on -- on board. </sentence><sentence id="905">And ma -- I had an uncle and an aunt and my cousin, who left Germany two weeks prior to the Saint Louis on a ship called the Iberia. </sentence><sentence id="906">And that ship carried 250 passengers. </sentence><sentence id="907">And their life and their future turned out to be completely different than -- than ours, which was named the voyage of the damned. </sentence><sentence id="908">They were far from damned because they -- </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="909">Q: They disembarked? </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="910">A: -- lived -- they lived -- they disembarked, they lived a year in Havana and waited for their -- their quota. </sentence><sentence id="911">America had a quota system for new immigrants and when their number came up, they immigrated to the United States in a perfectly legal manner. </sentence><sentence id="912">And so they stayed just shortly here in Havana, and then -- then moved the -- the 90 miles to the shores of the United States. </sentence><sentence id="913">And their life then turned -- my cousin joined the army, and he became an American soldier. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="919">Q: Right. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="921">A: And my uncle, who had been in the jewelry business in Germany, he became a representative for a watch company. </sentence><sentence id="922">They lived in a small town in Beaumont, Texas -- Beaumont, Texas, and -- and later on they moved to New York. </sentence><sentence id="923">And my cousin, who had been under the G.I.

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="929">Q: So what was that like, that sort of suspension in Havana on the Saint Louis -- </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="930">A: Yeah. </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="931">Q: -- where -- where you couldn't get off, although there's -- there's one suicide, right? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="933">A: Well, that was -- that was a dramatic turning point. </sentence><sentence id="934">To begin with there was the hope, the persistent hope that if we don't get off the ship today, due to some administrative technicality, we would be -- we would be allowed to get off tomorrow. </sentence><sentence id="935">It -- it should be -- I should not fail to mention that the Hapag-America line, the Hamburg-America line, the shipping company did compel the passengers to pay for a return ticket, because we did not have authentic visas, as the - - the entry permit is known --is -- is known today. </sentence><sentence id="936">We did not have a -- a resident visa, we had a landing permit. </sentence><sentence id="937">And -- which was sold by a Minister of Immigration. </sentence><sentence id="938">And that, in the political arena, resulted in a jealous confrontation between various segments in the Cuban government, and the ultimate rejection of -- of the -- of the passengers to disembark. </sentence><sentence id="939">And so when then went past another day, and the American Jewish organizations used their -- tried to use their influence to somehow have Franklin Delano Roosevelt, F.D.R. as he was known, to -- to admit the passengers, which he failed to do, had he known that two-thirds of the passengers would end up    in gas an-and g -- be gassed in -- in the death camps of Poland and Auschwitz and Majdanek and Treblinka and so on, he may have -- in my view, he may have had -- taken a different sort of action. </sentence><sentence id="940">As it was, he -- he refused. </sentence><sentence id="941">In fact he marked a note with the comment, no action. </sentence><sentence id="942">He turned back every effort to allow these people to disembark. </sentence><sentence id="943">He and his administration sent the 937 victims to -- for most of them, to their death. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="956">Q: Mm-hm. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="958">A: And the ship ultimately appealed to Canada, to -- to every country in the world for asylum and the response throughout the world was the same, in th -- terms of not allowing these people into their respective countries. </sentence><sentence id="959">And this is precisely the reason that the Saint Louis became a -- a world event. </sentence><sentence id="960">Not in the same way as the Titanic, because the Titanic was sunk by an iceberg and the Saint Louis was sent back to Europe for an uncertain fate of their passengers by reason of politics and racial -- racial confrontation and discrimination. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="964">Q: There's a -- a report that the children wrote a letter to Eleanor Roosevelt from the ship. </sentence><sentence id="965">Were - - were you part of that, or you didn't know -- </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="966">A: Not that at -- not that I, in all honesty, not that I remember -- </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="967">Q: Uh-huh. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="976">A: Yes, I met her personally, which was -- since you mentioned that, and had you interviewed me at that time, or had you pushed the clock -- were we able to push the clock back -- </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="977">Q: Right. </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="978">A: -- a number of years, I probably -- I may have just asked her that question. </sentence><sentence id="979">But I did not speak to her about the Saint Louis, but I met her. </sentence><sentence id="980">And I met her and she had an apartment in the Park Sheraton Hotel in New York City. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="984">Q: Right. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="986">A: And she stayed in the towers, and during my stay in -- which is probably going to come here and we're going to probably going to touch on that, in switzer -- we ended up in Switzerland ultimately. </sentence><sentence id="987">Not being able to do -- to disembark in Cuba, the ship going back to Europe, we ended up ultimately by -- by way off other events, we ended up in Switzerland and I attended -- somewhere in time I attended hotel school. </sentence><sentence id="988">And having had this hotel experience, I went to the Park Sheraton Hotel in search of a position. </sentence><sentence id="989">And the general manager told me that it is the policy of the hotel to promote people from within the hotel, from within ranks of the hotel, and then -- then he asked his assistant, the assistant manager, he asked him, he says, how did you start here, to refresh his memory. </sentence><sentence id="990">So he said well, I started as an elevator operator. </sentence><sentence id="991">And this resulted in my working at the Park Sheraton Hotel as an elevator operator, and my passenger in that -- in -- in my -- </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="992">Q: Was Eleanor -- </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="993">A: -- was Eleanor Roosevelt, because she lived on top of the 25" floor and I had a job to take the elevator from the 25" to the 30 floor, consequently I saw her every day. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="995">Q: So did -- you never told her you had been on the Saint Louis? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="997">A: No. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1016">A: Well, in Havana one man jumped overboard. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1018">Q: Right. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1020">A: He lost his head, he lo -- he despaired, and in desperation he jumped overboard, cut his wrists. </sentence><sentence id="1021">So you can imagine that panic ensued. </sentence><sentence id="1022">When -- when it became apparent that we could not disembark, that the ship may ha -- may have to go back to Europe, back to Germany. </sentence><sentence id="1023">Some people already had been in concentration camps and the feeling was one of utter panic. </sentence><sentence id="1024">And the return voyage was very -- even -- even I as a young child realized the tension that existed. </sentence><sentence id="1025">They wanted to capture the bridge -- and when I say bridge, I'm not talking about a card game, I'm talking about th-the -- the place where th-the command of the ship took place, where the captain and -- and his first and second officers and the instruments were located, that guided the ship to its destination. </sentence><sentence id="1026">And the ship was a -- was on course for Europe. </sentence><sentence id="1027">And organizations were still --    on a daily basis there were announcements that came over the ship radio that this and this occurred, this and this happened, and hope was given to -- to the passengers that they would find a country that would ultimately admit them. </sentence><sentence id="1028">And so it was that just shortly be -- they had even planned to scuttle, if that's the right word, to run the ship aground in the English channel, and thus set the ship on fire to -- to save -- to prevent people from having to return to Germany, and perhaps find -- find England receptive to -- to take these people in. </sentence><sentence id="1029">And it wasn't necessary to do that because shortly before entering the North Sea, German territorial waters, four countries -- four countries accepted the -- gave asylum to 200 and some of the passengers. </sentence><sentence id="1030">And those four countries were, Belgium, Holland, France and England. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2755">Q: So how long were you in this business? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2757">A: In this business I was until the major change occurred in 1975 when we moved to Atlanta, Georgia. </sentence><sentence id="2758">And th -- what happened is that the acts that I had mentioned in the Empire room, Tony Bennett, Johnny Mathis, Dinah Shore and the Pointer Sisters, they all -- and Liza Minelli and all of these people had a salary of approximately six to 7,000 dollars. </sentence><sentence id="2759">Steve Lawrence and Eydie Gorme was another, and Ed Sullivan. </sentence><sentence id="2760">These were the days th-that -- Jack Benny and George Burns -- not only is that time gone, like -- like gone with the wind, but it has disappeared and so - - and -- an-and it ex -- it precisely happened at a time when the salaries of these e-entertainers went sky high. </sentence><sentence id="2761">And the Empire -- and then it became a matter of -- strictly of economics. </sentence><sentence id="2762">The Empire room had 500 seats and the cover charge, meaning the -- meaning the cost of simply getting a table to sit down, it did not even cover a drink or anything to eat, that way the cover charge was a so-called entry ticket, if you will. </sentence><sentence id="2763">And the cover charge went from five dollars to 15 dollars per person. </sentence><sentence id="2764">And then it went to 25 dollars. </sentence><sentence id="2765">At the same time the salaries from 7,000 dollars went to 35,000 dollars. </sentence><sentence id="2766">So high that at one point it got to -- it became a reality that Barbra Streisand got one million dollars to appear in the room for one week. </sentence><sentence id="2767">And it was logical that the hotel could not sustain, even though the -- the nightclub was not designed to make money, it was mainly designed to attract conventions and people to fill the rooms. </sentence><sentence id="2768">That was the idea, to fill the rooms. </sentence><sentence id="2769">But those salaries were unsupportable, so the only place that you could have that kind of entertainment would end up to be Las Vegas, where the profit and the money came from the gambling tables. </sentence><sentence id="2770">And in 1975, the Empire room closed. </sentence><sentence id="2771">It -- it -- and it became just a banquet facility, and the nightclub as such, as it was known, no longer existed. </sentence><sentence id="2772">And -- and the only place that you could have the kind of entertainment would be in a facility where three or four thousand people would cor -- would congregate, would sit. </sentence><sentence id="2773">And that was Las Vegas and a place in New Jersey and vary -- some venues. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2792">Q: So what -- what did you do in Atlanta? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2794">A: In Atlanta I worked through my connections at that time in the hotel industry. </sentence><sentence id="2795">I came close to the management of the Fairmont Hotel company, which was based at the time in San Francisco, in Denver and in New Orleans. </sentence><sentence id="2796">And they had a t -- a hotel in -- in Atlanta. </sentence><sentence id="2797">But that was in 1975,    and Atlanta had not as yet become what you would like to call an international city. </sentence><sentence id="2798">And they were not used to -- and the -- they were not used to those prices. </sentence><sentence id="2799">And so when I said that I -- first hand experience, I -- I came to manage the Venetian Room, which was the nightclub in the Fairmont Hotel. </sentence><sentence id="2800">And Tony Bennett appeared there and -- and well, and a number of other entertainers. </sentence><sentence id="2801">And when the phone rang for someone to make reservations, they would say, well how much does it cost to get in? </sentence><sentence id="2802">So I would say, well the cover charge is 15 dollars. </sentence><sentence id="2803">And the response on the other end would be, and what do you get for that? </sentence><sentence id="2804">And without trying to -- without -- trying to avoid to sound sarcastic, I would say well, you get a table, and you get to sit down. </sentence><sentence id="2805">But how else -- what else would you say? </sentence><sentence id="2806">Th-That was the logical answer. </sentence><sentence id="2807">And consequently the entertainment of that -- that caliber of entertainment again went the way they did it in New York. </sentence><sentence id="2808">And so Richard Swig, who was owner of the hotel decided that Atlanta -- the only thing that would work in Atlanta would be western entertainment. </sentence><sentence id="2809">And so they brought in Loretta Lynn and a couple of other -- and Alison Krauss, some people with a [indecipherable] with a reputation in the area of western music. </sentence><sentence id="2810">And so you had a lot of -- I don't want to use the term -- | -- I think that to say rednecks, you know, would probably not take -- take too well, so let's say country folk, or whatever you will. </sentence><sentence id="2811">But they -- the western music in -- in that -- that kind of caliber of western music didn't do it either. </sentence><sentence id="2812">And del -- later on, a number of years later, Atlanta got very fine restaurants and it built tremendous hotels and what was expensive at tha -- at that time turned out to be cheap because prices went up and -- and Atlanta grew to be an international city, and they built a new airport and it is what it is today, you know, a big city. </sentence></p></dialogue>
