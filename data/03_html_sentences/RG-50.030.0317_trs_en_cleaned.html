<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="5">A: Yes. </sentence><sentence id="6">I was born in 1920, the 30th of April in Poland. </sentence><sentence id="7">Then we lived there for a while. </sentence><sentence id="8">Q. What was your name at birth?A. Ava Mueller. </sentence><sentence id="9">And I remember that one of the German Gestapo people when I came to concentration camp asked me, you could not be Jewish because my name is Mueller, and I said maybe I'm not, but it didn't help me too much. </sentence><sentence id="10">It shows you -- and even Jewish language is so very similar to the German, so many names, so many words are the same. </sentence><sentence id="11">Q. What is your name now?A. My name now is Ava Dorfman. </sentence><sentence id="12">That is my husband of 39 years, and I lost him in 1988, on July 3rd, suddenly, very suddenly. </sentence><sentence id="13">Q. You were born in ? </sentence><sentence id="14">A. Yes. </sentence><sentence id="15">Q. Did you stay there for very long?A. I suppose we stayed until a certain age. </sentence><sentence id="16">I think I went to public school, already to Parochial at that time. </sentence><sentence id="17">There was a church with a parochial school near our house. </sentence><sentence id="18">I attended there. </sentence><sentence id="19">Then my mother --.Q. Excuse me. </sentence><sentence id="20">Was that unusual for a Jewish person to attend that school?A. There were only two or three Jewish people in the area where I lived, so, we were really very removed from the Jewish section of . </sentence><sentence id="21">Then, my mother had family in Vienna, so a portion of my life I spend there, and I lived on Liechtenstein Strauss in Vienna. </sentence><sentence id="22">Then, my father's family lived in , and my mother felt that I and my sister Ruzia who was 2 1/2 years older than I, that we should somehow be closer to the family, to know our grandparents. </sentence><sentence id="23">She did not have too much family in Poland or in Vienna of her close, and then we moved back to , where my grandparents own a building, four story, and my grandfather had a restaurant, and they lived in the lower level, and then on the second floor, my mother, Ruzia and I, you see when I was six months old I lost my father, so I actually never knew him. </sentence><sentence id="24">There was just a study where there was a drawing, and that drawing was my father. </sentence><sentence id="25">There were pictures that my mother always showed. </sentence><sentence id="26">He was 27 years of age and developed a severe case of kidney problems. </sentence><sentence id="27">He just got his degree in civil engineering. </sentence><sentence id="28">My mother was only 25, and they looked forward but he didn't survive. </sentence><sentence id="29">So, between the draw and the cemetery that my grandmother took us always, that was what I know of father. </sentence><sentence id="30">I didn't envy anyone that they may have had more material things, but I envy everyone who was able to sit on the father's lap or get a kiss from a father. </sentence><sentence id="31">That somehow I missed always. </sentence><sentence id="32">Q. What do you remember about your mother?A. My mother was very pretty, very educated. </sentence><sentence id="33">She spoke five languages. </sentence><sentence id="34">We were just -- when we grow up we were like sisters, but when she was sometimes saying, I'm only 28 years of age, I said "Well, you're so old." </sentence><sentence id="35">But we all do that, and she worked in the brewery, which was very big offices, as an interpreter and also as a executive secretary to a director named Rightman. </sentence><sentence id="36">He was Jewish, and then I understand from another friend, who is a gynecologist that the other director's son, Shal, was his name, is someplace in the United States, and then I was befriended, maybe she was my best friend was Shisko. </sentence><sentence id="37">They were Czechoslovakian decent, and she and I went together in school, and as I will tell you later on, she played a major role in my life. </sentence><sentence id="38">And my mother worked there, and so it was a necessary that we were with the grandparents together and then above us was another aunt. </sentence><sentence id="39">She had four children. </sentence><sentence id="40">Marguerita was so pretty. </sentence><sentence id="41">They all perished. </sentence><sentence id="42">Then there was another aunt who was childless, and then she was just like a mother. </sentence><sentence id="43">She was battling a cancer in her larynx and that was the time really that she wanted to see that we would be married so she could see the weddings. </sentence><sentence id="44">I think that's what prompted one time whatever I will tell you about. </sentence><sentence id="45">What I would like to say that it is so hard sometimes to comprehend when people speak of six million, and also the fact that one million and a half were innocent children, does not say that we all were not just innocent, justly paid just because we were Jewish. </sentence><sentence id="46">The fact that everyone of the six million was a person with loved ones, with friends, with dreams for the future, and then they had to face death by whatever means those murderers had for them. </sentence><sentence id="47">They had a great many of them. </sentence><sentence id="48">Then, since you spoke with me and I really tried to search my mind. </sentence><sentence id="49">I must have really, like excavating the back memories from my brain, and reach so many gruesome stories, that I tried very hard to suppress. </sentence><sentence id="50">I know that lots of Holocaust survivors share those gruesome stories with their children. </sentence><sentence id="51">I don't know what effect that had on them, but before I got married in the United States, I decided if I ever have a family, I would like to establish as a nearly normal life as it can be. </sentence><sentence id="52">I didn't want my children to be sorry for their mother. </sentence><sentence id="53">I didn't want them to have the feeling that they are different from the other children, so I really was very evasive about it. </sentence><sentence id="54">The only thing at night, I had very bad dreams, as my husband was telling me. </sentence><sentence id="55">I sometimes screamed or just said don't let them take me. </sentence><sentence id="56">So I shared lots of things with my husband, and not until the children were in high school and there were many documentaries shown on T.V. and the newspapers and they always asked, "Mom do you know anything about it? </sentence><sentence id="57">Have you been there?" </sentence><sentence id="58">And then little by little I would just tell them, not very much. </sentence><sentence id="59">I have been asked by so many organizations to speak about my past. </sentence><sentence id="60">I refused it. </sentence><sentence id="61">The only time I spoke was the Lutheran Church, and that was only because that the minister there felt that everybody who is not Lutheran is going to go to hell and of course, I just thought I'd tell them what hell really was. </sentence><sentence id="62">That's the only place I spoke. </sentence><sentence id="63">But, I feel right now that even my children encourage me that I should give testimony. </sentence><sentence id="64">Just like my son called me yesterday and he said, "Good luck Mom. </sentence><sentence id="65">I think you owe to the younger generation, because it should never be forgotten what happened." </sentence><sentence id="66">I personally being so attuned to the anti-semitism which is going right now on, not only in Germany, France or England, but in the United States. </sentence><sentence id="67">I'm scared for the future generation because just like I hope that the Holocaust in Washington Museum or any other Museums or Memorials which were erected in memory of the six million will be able to educate the people what hatred and bigotry can do, and what they have done even to homosexuals and lesbians. </sentence><sentence id="68">They tortured them, and it was just because they had other sex preferences. </sentence><sentence id="69">We should let the people live for what they are, and therefore I feel that I consented to it. </sentence><sentence id="70">But I have to tell you that the last two weeks, I weighed all together 99 pounds, and I'm pretty sure I'm down to maybe 80. </sentence><sentence id="71">I can hardly eat or sleep. </sentence><sentence id="72">It's hard for me to sleep. </sentence><sentence id="73">There comes something that one son knows about and the other son still doesn't. </sentence><sentence id="74">When I was in Vienna I met many people, but one in particular was a medical student. </sentence><sentence id="75">He was like five and half or six years older than I. He visited us when we went back to Poland. </sentence><sentence id="76">Then, as I mentioned, my aunt who was childless, she was very eager to have a wedding, especially at that time, the rumors what was going on in Germany, because I think had in 1932 that Hitler started the revolution already in Germany, and at one point I heard my family speaking, oh he's just a maniac. </sentence><sentence id="77">They don't let him succeed. </sentence><sentence id="78">They will stop him. </sentence><sentence id="79">But how wrong they were. </sentence><sentence id="80">So, at one point, my aunt entertained that maybe we will get married. </sentence><sentence id="81">His family was not very well to do and neither was mine. </sentence><sentence id="82">He found a position in . </sentence><sentence id="83">was near which was a port, and in September of "39 the German invaded or bombed . </sentence><sentence id="84">This is the time that my marriage was of seven months only. </sentence><sentence id="85">That's why I do not have any recollection. </sentence><sentence id="86">We hardly knew each other as a married couple. </sentence><sentence id="87">Q. How long did you know him before getting married?A. I think around four years. </sentence><sentence id="88">Q. What was his name?A. Edmond Spritzer (ph). </sentence><sentence id="89">When the German started to bomb , and they finally marched in from , they start to round up the Jewish young men, able bodied, and that would happen with Mungio, and since then, I never saw him. </sentence><sentence id="90">I never had a trace of it neither. </sentence><sentence id="91">I have met any of his family members of his family. </sentence><sentence id="92">My cousin, who lives now in England, her son is by the way a member of the Parliament from Wales. </sentence><sentence id="93">They did not stay with Judaism, and he was born as a Episcopalian, but I don't blame them. </sentence><sentence id="94">There were many times that I didn't know what to do. </sentence><sentence id="95">If I were to have a family, I would not want them to be exposed to what I went through. </sentence><sentence id="96">She and her mother were visiting , and my mother by the way was visiting me, and the panic was so great because it was on the Baltic, _ It was a resort also. </sentence><sentence id="97">Everybody tried to get inland, and also reach their homes. </sentence><sentence id="98">What vividly stayed in my mind after searching my memory that I pushed my mother in through a window because the train was so jammed that she can go and also in some way was able to place her mother and then she and I stayed a while there. </sentence><sentence id="99">We didn't have any possessions there, but when it start to be very bad, she was married around three years to Doctor and they were located where he practiced, and she and I decided that maybe we ought to go to her home. </sentence><sentence id="100">That progressed so quickly. </sentence><sentence id="101">They started to bomb the trains, and we were just having the hardest time to go to Warsaw which was by plane maybe an hour and a half. </sentence><sentence id="102">It took us four days to go to Warsaw. </sentence><sentence id="103">When we came there, her husband , Said, look they are already progressing here. </sentence><sentence id="104">They are vandalizing, even the Polish people vandalizing Jewish homes. </sentence><sentence id="105">I think it would be wise if you and Ava start to make your way to . </sentence><sentence id="106">That's where her parents lived and my mother and Ruzia, and her father was a very prominent oral surgeon, Doctor Katzner. </sentence><sentence id="107">It took us twelve days, ten or twelve days. </sentence><sentence id="108">Everytime the train was bombed, we had to jump, no matter how high the train was into the embarkment. </sentence><sentence id="109">We were bleeding all over. </sentence><sentence id="110">Our clothes were torn. </sentence><sentence id="111">We didn't have food. </sentence><sentence id="112">But when we stopped, there happened to be a little town. </sentence><sentence id="113">The people came out and said, what is going on. </sentence><sentence id="114">Tell us where they are, and brought some food out to us. </sentence><sentence id="115">When we find, as you know at that time the Germans invaded Poland there was the agreement between the foreign minister of Germany and who was the foreign minister from Stalin's, from Russia, from the Bog River east of the Bog River the Russians will invade that portion of Poland. </sentence><sentence id="116">That of course was thiscamp__----.~- So when we made our way to , she was financially better situated so they lived in a completely different area, and I lived on the front area. </sentence><sentence id="117">As a matter of fact, when we were in Warsaw, they took only possession, a and it was lucky. </sentence><sentence id="118">That was the only thing we could cover ourselves at night, because we didn't have anything else. </sentence><sentence id="119">I did not make a contact with her until after the war. </sentence><sentence id="120">I did not know what happened to her. </sentence><sentence id="121">If you are interested I will tell you about it, but when I reach , my mother quickly put me into the basement because I don't remember if there were passports, or were they some types of documents that they had to be identified by because the Russians went from one apartment or house to another to take a survey as to how many people are there. </sentence><sentence id="122">So, Mother was afraid that they will arrest me because I was the newcomer and they were already there. </sentence><sentence id="123">So, through the contacts of my sister's husband, who was . </sentence><sentence id="124">She was already married, he was a mathematician and he was working, help the Russians, and he was able to get some papers. </sentence><sentence id="125">I don't know what they said. </sentence><sentence id="126">I know that I was able to come out. </sentence><sentence id="127">That time, the Russians confiscated lots of factories and took us to work, but I didn't feel good. </sentence><sentence id="128">I felt that I was lightheaded. </sentence><sentence id="129">I was sick to my stomach and did not know maybe malnutrition or whatever and Poland and that time was already socialized medicine. </sentence><sentence id="130">I went to see a doctor and found out that I was two or three months pregnant. </sentence><sentence id="131">I don't even remember. </sentence><sentence id="132">To this day, I don't know how the pregnancy was not interrupted from jumping so many times. </sentence><sentence id="133">Sometimes we had to jump every fifteen minutes because the train was so terribly bombed, and I just was pregnant. </sentence><sentence id="134">My grandparents were still alive at that time. </sentence><sentence id="135">My grandfather in particular was religious. </sentence><sentence id="136">My mother was very much for aborting the child, but my grandfather felt no. </sentence><sentence id="137">So, I still was working, not too much food to begin with, and my sister was working, but she was still living with her husband, more near which was more of a Jewish section. </sentence><sentence id="138">She played beautifully piano, and her desire was one time to become maybe a pianist. </sentence><sentence id="139">I don't remember if she already had her son, Gaynish, but I know when the German came he was around a year and half out, so I will have to calculated it back. </sentence><sentence id="140">Everything is just like a bad dream. </sentence><sentence id="141">However, we were working, and I think I worked until my eight months, very hard because they did not let us stop. </sentence><sentence id="142">I don't recall what we were doing, but I do recall that there was like a quota. </sentence><sentence id="143">If you didn't make so many pieces in one hour, they will push you to a very bad job, sometimes cleaning the worst toilets that you can imagine. </sentence><sentence id="144">So I was very, very pressed, and not feeling well. </sentence><sentence id="145">I was rushed out to a hospital to deliver, and she was a beautiful -- her name was Lydia. </sentence><sentence id="146">She was like 2 1/2 months old and everybody thought she looked like an angle, but somehow, due to the milk, there was not a formula or anything. </sentence><sentence id="147">Nothing was sterilized, she developed dysentery, like a very bad case of diarrhea, and the doctor hospitalized her. </sentence><sentence id="148">I went every day to the hospital after work, and they showed me through a window because they felt it was a communicable disease. </sentence><sentence id="149">But one    day I came and they didn't show her and they say she's dead. </sentence><sentence id="150">That was I think she was only three months or three and a half months old. </sentence><sentence id="151">That took lots and lots of maneuvering really to get the body out so we can bury her near my father, so she wouldn't be alone. </sentence><sentence id="152">That was the end of that. </sentence><sentence id="153">But the Russian was not very easy to live under either. </sentence><sentence id="154">They just unannounced would knock on the door, came and took whatever they liked. </sentence><sentence id="155">My mother had some nice china and they wanted it so it was not even would you give me. </sentence><sentence id="156">I remember being just so attached to the drawing that that was my father and never knew him, but from the pictures sometimes he stood at the foot of my bed and I could visualize him and I was a fan of his that he had a very nice and of other literary writers and philosophers like Hiner Shuller, a man, and I thought one day I will have it in my home. </sentence><sentence id="157">Well, it stayed there until the Germans came, but then they raped also some people-- the Russians. </sentence><sentence id="158">They also came and tortured you that tomorrow they come and they emptied out, but mostly they were like and when they find our watches they just have like five watches on one hand and the other, they never had those things. </sentence><sentence id="159">Or they took a nightgown from the women and just wear it as a dress. </sentence><sentence id="160">They were very primitive. </sentence><sentence id="161">My mother felt that they interfere a lot in the war of and when we heard that eventually maybe the Germans come, my mother said, "It couldn't be worse." </sentence><sentence id="162">But once again, she was wrong. </sentence><sentence id="163">At least we were alive. </sentence><sentence id="164">Now, I spoke to a friend of mine who was very young when he left Poland. </sentence><sentence id="165">He's an orthopedist in our town, and I spoke to Andy Solenski, and I said, for some reason as a matter of fact the night before I came here, I said Andy for some reason I feel that the Germans attacked Russia and forced themselves into our territory that there was in 1939 -- excuse me in 1941 that it was in June, because I remember that was my sister's birthday, and my mother baked a cake and asked and the little boy who was already alive, to come and stay with me. </sentence><sentence id="166">That same night we heard shots and commotion and we run to the window and we saw the Russian soldiers running with mattresses under their arm and we knew something is brewing, and that's how the Russians went out, because the Germans came in. </sentence><sentence id="167">Then, the other set of problems started. </sentence><sentence id="168">We were in our apartment still and I failed to say that my grandparents had a very hard time when the Russians were there. </sentence><sentence id="169">When they got drunk they came to the restaurant and sometimes with the bottles of liquor stayed and everything they would just push everything on the floor and just destroy it. </sentence><sentence id="170">They took it very hard that they could not operate and support the whole family. </sentence><sentence id="171">My grandmother took very ill and within one week of each other, they passed away. </sentence><sentence id="172">My uncle who was my father's brother, , his daughter is my cousin who lives in Paris, Nira, and is married to a non-Jewish, but non-believer really, a Parisian artist. </sentence><sentence id="173">She has a son Stephen and his wife Marie-Noell and they visited Mitchell and I here last year, and he continued to operate the restaurant and we still lived in that house the whole family together. </sentence><sentence id="174">But then they established a Ghetto and they start to line up the people and we had to leave everything behind, and my that I somehow thought I was going to have that from my father, and we moved and I don't remember the street. </sentence><sentence id="175">There was a big building with lots of stories, three or four stories. </sentence><sentence id="176">We moved to an apartment where one and a half rooms, two families lived. </sentence><sentence id="177">My mother and I. Ruzia was still there, and another family with three children. </sentence><sentence id="178">It was very hard. </sentence><sentence id="179">But when the Russians left, &gt;&gt; who were very religious. </sentence><sentence id="180">The father had a beard. </sentence><sentence id="181">The mother had a . </sentence><sentence id="182">Idon't know what it is in English. </sentence><sentence id="183">A wig? </sentence><sentence id="184">Isee. </sentence><sentence id="185">They had a daughter who also by coincidence her name was Rose. </sentence><sentence id="186">Now, today, I think it is multiple sclerosis. </sentence><sentence id="187">She was unable to walk. </sentence><sentence id="188">She was bedridden, and the father of Zigmund encouraged Zigmund that still going back to the Russian occupation, encouraged the boys, there was Zigmund and two brothers. </sentence><sentence id="189">One of them now a year ago established contact with me , who by the way told me he saw my sister's husband Zigmund after the war in Russia. </sentence><sentence id="190">He encouraged him to make his way to Israel, but he knew he left my sister and a little child, and he told him he's going to try to reach ; Evidently he never did, because cannot put traces or find him, and never reached us. </sentence><sentence id="191">Whatever, we were not there to begin with. </sentence><sentence id="192">Then his father encouraged us to come and live in their house because they had a little house, like four rooms. </sentence><sentence id="193">And it was once again, very hard to get milk or bread or anything and he was going courageously out trying to get something for his grandson. </sentence><sentence id="194">One time when he left he never came back, so when asked me what happened to my father, the only estimate I could say that they caught him or shoot him. </sentence><sentence id="195">I don't know. </sentence><sentence id="196">Then the mother did not know what to do with her daughter Rose, and I think she lost her mind. </sentence><sentence id="197">She was just going around the streets and screaming, and they must have shot her because she never came back, and here I was with Mom, myself, and then Ruzia was at that time, and Zigmund was already in the Russian Army and when the Russians were moving away when the Germans came, they followed the Russian army and that's why he felt then it would be better to have the German people come. </sentence><sentence id="198">We had both of the atrocities, and before we moved in with this other family, when I said that we lived in that building that had few stories, it's hard to believe how many people jumped to their death from third or fourth floor. </sentence><sentence id="199">I remember one prominent doctor who did it with his wife together because they didn't want to face what can happen to them. </sentence><sentence id="200">Q. Was this when the Germans came?A. Yes. </sentence><sentence id="201">Q. Did you see them?A. Yes. </sentence><sentence id="202">So, that's why when you asked me to do that, after 50 years, which is a half century, to really delve into my memory things that I try so hard to suppress, it was very hard for me. </sentence><sentence id="203">Then, we didn't have any money, and we didn't have any means to support ourselves and there was already the Germans. </sentence><sentence id="204">I was wearing an arm band with the Star of David and J, Judea. </sentence><sentence id="205">I took off my arm band. </sentence><sentence id="206">I was very blonde, long hair, they say blue eyes. </sentence><sentence id="207">I always thought I have green eyes, and I went to the other side to the brewery, and tried to bring beer, bottles of beer. </sentence><sentence id="208">It was very small, but I still feel that my wrists were very very affected by it. </sentence><sentence id="209">I had surgery here and carpal tunnel, and I just went back and forth and sold the beer to the people who had money. </sentence><sentence id="210">Mama was able to get a bushel of flour and make something to eat for us. </sentence><sentence id="211">Then the Germans took over the factories the same that the Russians had, and we start to work there again. </sentence><sentence id="212">But Ruzia was designed to clean the streets, so she came a few times. </sentence><sentence id="213">She was so delicate, so very pretty, and she said as long as the child is here, and we took care as best we can. </sentence><sentence id="214">Mother didn't work anymore, and the brewery was taken over by the Germans. </sentence><sentence id="215">One day she just didn't come. </sentence><sentence id="216">One day just like the next day maybe came a Polish man. </sentence><sentence id="217">He was a conductor of a trolley, and he knocked on the door and he asked for Ava and I said I am Ava, and he said that my sister is going to be taken to Auschwitz and she's so hungry. </sentence><sentence id="218">She would like to have a piece of bread. </sentence><sentence id="219">I asked him where they are going to march the whole group of people, and he told me. </sentence><sentence id="220">I took my armband off and went on the other side and stayed there while they were walking. </sentence><sentence id="221">The men looked like skeletons and they even picked up anything that was on the street. </sentence><sentence id="222">Sometimes I wonder if it was even something from animals, everything. </sentence><sentence id="223">I saw Ruzia and I just run out and I don't know, there was a Ukrainian or some German Gestapo took my arm and they said and I said no, I'm Polish. </sentence><sentence id="224">I throwed the bread to her and she said please take care of Gaynosh. </sentence><sentence id="225">I never saw her again. </sentence><sentence id="226">Then usually the German people used the young Jewish boy as the hatcher man. </sentence><sentence id="227">They were always the ones to select somebody or to take them somewhere and I know then from before or from school or something that we did together and at that time when it started to be so bad and one time I worked at the factory and there were different rooms and then I heard screaming like agony screaming, and I opened the door and there was a girl -- I don't know if she was 16 or 17, and she was profusely bleeding like you would think somebody had menstrual bleeding. </sentence><sentence id="228">She said, they raped me with the foot of the stool. </sentence><sentence id="229">Then I heard other screaming and then a Polish superintendent of that factory came over and grabbed me by the hand and he pulled me down to the basement and that's how I got acquainted with the basement. </sentence><sentence id="230">Then, at that time, I know I have to do something with Mom and Gaynosh. </sentence><sentence id="231">I asked -- see in the Ghetto there was like a you have to go through a gate where there were Germans and Ukrainians and the Jewish who were sort of going back and forth, the young men. </sentence><sentence id="232">At that time, I asked then if there was any possibility that I can get Gaynosh out of the Ghetto. </sentence><sentence id="233">They said how, and I said we just put something in his mouth and see and I spoke with that Sishko, that from brewery, the director, and I was such a close friend with her, went together with her to school. </sentence><sentence id="234">I told her that I would like to Gaynosh to her aunt who was without children. </sentence><sentence id="235">Maybe she will raise him. </sentence><sentence id="236">She said let me talk. </sentence><sentence id="237">Then when I came for the beer and she said try it. </sentence><sentence id="238">I told her what day that would be and so with the armband -- you know there is like a wagon that you sit higher up and when you take the seat there is like a compartment and the baby was around here and maybe in three months over a year I remember and just prior to the gate I stuffed a little hanky in his mouth and then they stopped us and they said and I said I have to testify because I saw some Jewish people doing something wrong and they take me to headquarter. </sentence><sentence id="239">When we reach the other side, they couldn't go near the brewery, but they left me off and I held a shawl over my head and the baby and somebody from the back stopped me and I said "yeah," and he said where are you going and I said home with my baby. </sentence><sentence id="240">Who are you, I say 1am Polish. </sentence><sentence id="241">What is your religion? </sentence><sentence id="242">I said catholic. </sentence><sentence id="243">That's what I don't know so many things I was able to get away. </sentence><sentence id="244">I don't know how. </sentence><sentence id="245">I placed the baby at that time with them with the understanding that after the war somehow somewhere I will get the baby. </sentence><sentence id="246">Can I retreat?When I was in the house of , | had the baby and my mother and oh, by the way one time they come in the Germans and that one that was bedridden and just took her out like a piece of garbage, and she was gone, which was a blessing. </sentence><sentence id="247">Really, I could not lift her every day there was only me and Mom. </sentence><sentence id="248">There was no real life for her, but in this house I didn't know it, but the neighbors who lived there for so many years, they know each other. </sentence><sentence id="249">One time a Jewish family came and said, you know there is a door in the floor going to the cellar. </sentence><sentence id="250">It was flush with the floor, but there were steps going down where evidently they pickled something for the winter, whatever. </sentence><sentence id="251">It was like storage room. </sentence><sentence id="252">Could we hide? </sentence><sentence id="253">Well, they said if they catch us, we're all going to be dead. </sentence><sentence id="254">Well, it got so bad that they started to round up people and take them out to the concentration camp, I had 15 people in that cellar including my mom and Gaynosh. </sentence><sentence id="255">That was before. </sentence><sentence id="256">There was a bed and I seen him sitting there. </sentence><sentence id="257">They came, not only that they came, 15 people, but there three children in the age of five to maybe nine and I was so afraid that they may cry or say something loud. </sentence><sentence id="258">So, I was upstairs and four or five Gestapo men say , everybody , and I said in German, there is nobody here, just me and my child. </sentence><sentence id="259">He said you go here you go there and they stuck the top on the thing and for me to tell them downstairs to sit quiet, I said, but there is no one here, but there is no one here. </sentence><sentence id="260">There was silence and then when the Gestapo grabbed Gaynosh and I said please don't do nothing to him and the other one said, let him sit we come some other time. </sentence><sentence id="261">Then he said are you sure you're Jewish. </sentence><sentence id="262">I said maybe not, but it didn't help me too much, but then he threw an apple, I thought he was going to kill the child, that was a good gesture, and some candies and they left. </sentence><sentence id="263">I asked once again, what a miracle. </sentence><sentence id="264">Then when I took out Gaynosh, I placed my mother with a neighbor that we used to live way back where my grandfather's house was. </sentence><sentence id="265">We didn't have much, but mama had such small little diamond earrings that evidently my father gave her when they were married. </sentence><sentence id="266">Don't forget that Ruzia was 2 and a half years older so they had some time together. </sentence><sentence id="267">I think her two rings and she wanted me to take it so I can survive. </sentence><sentence id="268">They say no, I want you to have that. </sentence><sentence id="269">Maybe at one time they will ask you to do that so they can buy food. </sentence><sentence id="270">So we made like a pouch in her dress that she had. </sentence><sentence id="271">We couldn't take too much with us. </sentence><sentence id="272">There were only two dresses that each one of us had and we sewed it underneath and that was what I left her. </sentence><sentence id="273">My heart was somehow easier because I took care of that. </sentence><sentence id="274">Then, that didn't give me too much time to really do something for myself. </sentence><sentence id="275">We were just taken in big cattle wagons in the concentration camps. </sentence><sentence id="276">So, I found myself there towards the end of "41, 42, and what one saw in that concentration camp, it's really better to repress that. </sentence><sentence id="277">One time, of course they had I think it was recreation for them. </sentence><sentence id="278">Every time at night which were just bunk beds, no pillows, no sheets, no nothing, you just lie there, and roll calls. </sentence><sentence id="279">When it was snowing or raining or thundering that you put your feet like that and sit with your head down and then they would with the rifles would point out you go to your right, you go to your left, you go to your right. </sentence><sentence id="280">You never know which one side is better. </sentence><sentence id="281">Then one of them was to be just get away in some means. </sentence><sentence id="282">Sometimes they called it twice a night and then you had to get up at 5:00 to go to work. </sentence><sentence id="283">Then they would give you soup which you could find nothing in it. </sentence><sentence id="284">One time they put us there to -- let me say, when you came there, they shaved everyone. </sentence><sentence id="285">Q. This is 2 A. Yanosko, Limberg. </sentence><sentence id="286">They shaved us and then you hear this screaming because they asked everybody to open their mouths and they have like gold crowns, they just knocked it out, which was terribly painful. </sentence><sentence id="287">They just undress us. </sentence><sentence id="288">Men, women, children. </sentence><sentence id="289">It was almost unhuman. </sentence><sentence id="290">Then they pushed us to different barracks and when evening or at night when they built a fire and there like a which was like a heap and then they put a big fire and while we were sitting there, you could see the fire. </sentence><sentence id="291">It was not a recreational fire, it was quite a large area and the flames were going up and with their rifles they were pointing to people giving them instructions to dress, to undress, whatever there was, one gown you were wearing and to throw himself on the burning. </sentence><sentence id="292">There was a mother and a daughter sitting near me. </sentence><sentence id="293">I don't think the daughter maybe was 14 or 15 years of age. </sentence><sentence id="294">He pointed out only to the mother and when the mother was still undressing, the daughter quickly got up and undressed and followed her, and many others perished the same way. </sentence><sentence id="295">Sometimes they would take us out and they would have those vicious dogs and when they found out that somebody was a rabbi, I remember one was a priest even who tried to hide the Jewish children, and pushed the dogs and you could see how the flesh was coming off these people. </sentence><sentence id="296">Sometimes they hang the people and the Jewish boys who were in control. </sentence><sentence id="297">I don't know if they could say no, sometimes I feel, and they were hanging there for us to see and then the Gestapo would say, you are the next. </sentence><sentence id="298">Just torturing, torturing us. </sentence><sentence id="299">One time in the roll call order were young people and the older people were sitting and the Ukrainian took -- her name was Bosha, took her out and we thought maybe he was going to save her, but when she came back she said he raped me and then he came and shot her. </sentence><sentence id="300">I had all her blood, you could everything from her brain. </sentence><sentence id="301">He shot her right here in the head. </sentence><sentence id="302">How can you have a very normal life when you think of that. </sentence><sentence id="303">One time I was selected to well asked to go and sort the clothing of the people who they still round up from different places. </sentence><sentence id="304">That was the only time that I had done that. </sentence><sentence id="305">That was the time that I found my mother's dress. </sentence><sentence id="306">I found the pouch. </sentence><sentence id="307">Of course there was nothing in it and I asked everybody if they came across Sabina Mueller and I looked at everybody who marched out to work. </sentence><sentence id="308">So, I don't know if they found her where she was hiding or if she was there and I never saw her because when I talked to my cousin in Paris, she was like 15 years younger than I, Mira said before I went to Auschwitz I was in Limberg and never saw her. </sentence><sentence id="309">It was a big camp. </sentence><sentence id="310">At that time there was a Gestapo man who we know that he is sadist. </sentence><sentence id="311">He was choking people, especially young girls. </sentence><sentence id="312">One time he selected me to work in his house to clean his house. </sentence><sentence id="313">His house was like a stone away from the door that rifles and Gestapo and everyone was watching when the people are going out, but the women were not going out anymore. </sentence><sentence id="314">So, one time, around that time, we were selected to help the men dig trenches, and they said, this is not deep enough. </sentence><sentence id="315">The men were like skeletons, no food nothing. </sentence><sentence id="316">Then once again, right, left, right left. </sentence><sentence id="317">Then they put the men facing the trenches and then the music played, famous and the . </sentence><sentence id="318">That's how they buried the people or tortured them and the squadron shot the people, sometimes not enough to kill them and then they order to bury them. </sentence><sentence id="319">And you can hear the voices, help me help me and they were just buried alive. </sentence><sentence id="320">That time, I made up my mind if they shoot me that's okay. </sentence><sentence id="321">I spoke to the young man that you used to go with women and men out to the factory to work. </sentence><sentence id="322">His name was Jacob. </sentence><sentence id="323">I said, you're coming to that house where I work for that Gestapo. </sentence><sentence id="324">He never talked to me, he just said pointing that's not clean enough, but he never did anything to me. </sentence><sentence id="325">He never gave me food neither. </sentence><sentence id="326">But, this Jacob used to come and bring some cans of milk, which we didn't have it. </sentence><sentence id="327">I said do you think you can dream up a pair of pants. </sentence><sentence id="328">I would like to escape. </sentence><sentence id="329">I have a nephew. </sentence><sentence id="330">I have to take care of him. </sentence><sentence id="331">I promised my sister. </sentence><sentence id="332">He said gosh I don't know how I can do it. </sentence><sentence id="333">I said you bring that in a basket. </sentence><sentence id="334">Everybody is taller than you Ava. </sentence><sentence id="335">I said I will round it up, don't worry. </sentence><sentence id="336">If they shoot me, they shoot me. </sentence><sentence id="337">I have nothing to lose. </sentence><sentence id="338">And one day he did it. </sentence><sentence id="339">He said 5:00 you have to drop into that row of people and just walk. </sentence><sentence id="340">Of course I did not look very much like a man, and maybe my walk was funny, but we were almost to get into the trolley when they start, "halt, halt" and they recognize. </sentence><sentence id="341">I jumped into the trolley and the conductor refused to stop. </sentence><sentence id="342">He saw that I was escaping and he went. </sentence><sentence id="343">Later on I have learned that he was shot because he come minus one, that Jacob. </sentence><sentence id="344">He was shot. </sentence><sentence id="345">It was also hard for me to live with that he somehow did it for me and he was not able to survive. </sentence><sentence id="346">That time they went to that factory where I sometimes went to the basement where the women work before, remember I befriended myself with that superintendent. </sentence><sentence id="347">I went in that basement all alone. </sentence><sentence id="348">I heard the voices. </sentence><sentence id="349">I bet they were rats. </sentence><sentence id="350">I was so scared, but my head was shaved. </sentence><sentence id="351">I couldn't go out, and I stayed there until they left that building, which was around 4:00 and I knew there was a telephone in some room. </sentence><sentence id="352">I quickly wanted to call Sishka and I said I escaped. </sentence><sentence id="353">She said My God, am I going to take you. </sentence><sentence id="354">You're going to have to wait. </sentence><sentence id="355">I don't want to tell my mother. </sentence><sentence id="356">Maybe Stashu, her brother, will somehow pick you up and bring some clothing. </sentence><sentence id="357">Then I heard steps, and my heart stopped and that was the superintendent. </sentence><sentence id="358">He said what are you doing? </sentence><sentence id="359">I said I escaped, can you help me and he said my wife is not going to do that. </sentence><sentence id="360">Let me talk to her. </sentence><sentence id="361">He talked to her and she said here is soup. </sentence><sentence id="362">Eat the soup and go. </sentence><sentence id="363">Where would I go? </sentence><sentence id="364">Go back to the cellar. </sentence><sentence id="365">Let me just use your phone and I can tell her where I am. </sentence><sentence id="366">She did that, gave me a scarf so I can cover my head and then sometime it was very, very dark that they came and I jumped into there. </sentence><sentence id="367">They couldn't take me to their home. </sentence><sentence id="368">They placed me in a shack and they brought me some food. </sentence><sentence id="369">I think I stayed there for almost three and a half weeks, until my hair grew to something like you have, so I can go out. </sentence><sentence id="370">Sometime very late at night they would let me take a shower and that was a blessing. </sentence><sentence id="371">End of Tape 1 Tape 2 Q. Before we go on, I want to go back a little bit. </sentence><sentence id="372">A. All right. </sentence><sentence id="373">Q. When you saw those people committing suicide, jumping out of -- did you ever think to yourself that you wanted to commit suicide?A. Not then. </sentence><sentence id="374">Not then. </sentence><sentence id="375">Suicide no. </sentence><sentence id="376">I just didn't care. </sentence><sentence id="377">When my mother and Gaynosh were taken there was a time when I didn't care. </sentence><sentence id="378">Only when I found mother's clothing and I knew that she was no longer alive, then I had that great desire to fulfill my promise to my sister. </sentence><sentence id="379">Because when they took her to Auschwitz and I threw that bread if she caught it or not I will never know, and shear miracle that that Ukrainian or German let go of my arm and didn't pull me together through that marching group, I felt, I have to fulfill my promise to her. </sentence><sentence id="380">Suicide no, I'm just not geared to it. </sentence><sentence id="381">Q. Were you afraid of being raped? </sentence><sentence id="382">A. Yes, that I was. </sentence><sentence id="383">And by a very great miracle, even later on when I was in Vienna, where I will tell you from the point when I enlisted remind me to tell you about a very close call to rape and I will touch on that. </sentence><sentence id="384">I'm trying to do it sequence as possible. </sentence><sentence id="385">Have you have any other questions?Q. Yes. </sentence><sentence id="386">When you were escaping -- A. From the concentration camp?Q. From the concentration camp, but I want to ask you both about the escaping about taking your mother out, about taking Gaynosh out. </sentence><sentence id="387">It seems very brave to think about going outside and taking the chance?A. It was not so brave. </sentence><sentence id="388">There was really guts and the will to do that. </sentence><sentence id="389">I was bringing really income to the family by going everyday out to the brewery, taking my armband. </sentence><sentence id="390">Good, I was blonde and blue eyes as they say, but nevertheless it was going out, facing -- it was like two different cities. </sentence><sentence id="391">Ghetto was all Jewish the other side was not. </sentence><sentence id="392">That was taking a chance. </sentence><sentence id="393">Walking through the streets and seeing them marching and looking at you and pretend that you are just hah-hah and you just smiling good day. </sentence><sentence id="394">That was brave. </sentence><sentence id="395">But then when they took my mother out, I didn't do it by myself because there I have the help once again of the Jewish boys who also took mother out to Gestapo headquarters and then she was going out to our area where we lived. </sentence><sentence id="396">That was brave because where my father lived, we were known there. </sentence><sentence id="397">Where my grandfather lived, we were known there. </sentence><sentence id="398">She was there I don't know how long, but it must have been at least to that year that I found it unless they kept the clothing that long, but that was in the beginning of 1943.Q. How did you go out everyday, through the gate?A. No, through the other street that was just a hole and I was just making my way out because there was no wire in the Ghetto. </sentence><sentence id="399">There were just streets. </sentence><sentence id="400">If you knew the area you could just try to get out, and that's how I went almost every day. </sentence><sentence id="401">Q. Were you afraid? </sentence><sentence id="402">A. Yes, yes. </sentence><sentence id="403">Because I wanted to go back. </sentence><sentence id="404">As said, my cousin from England, my mother always said Ava is so brave. </sentence><sentence id="405">That was under good circumstances. </sentence><sentence id="406">Until today, I am the do gooder, always for other people. </sentence><sentence id="407">I do it today, too. </sentence><sentence id="408">I think that's my nature, but then my mother was a widow. </sentence><sentence id="409">We didn't have money, and she was working, and she was very active in an orphanage house. </sentence><sentence id="410">Her name was on the orphanage house, so every time when she was saying to us, to both of us, if you feel that you are deprived, just look at the children who are much worse off, and then you see how lucky you are. </sentence><sentence id="411">Then, I said, well, how lucky we are. </sentence><sentence id="412">But then I did the same thing with my children when they didn't eat, I would just say, see you don't finish, people in Europe would give anything for crumbs, and Mitchell was always joking and he said, mother, pack the crumbs and send them. </sentence><sentence id="413">But both of them grew up to be very charitable. </sentence><sentence id="414">I remember we were in New York and walking through the streets there was a man without feet and a beggar and Mitchell said can I have my advance 25 cent allowance. </sentence><sentence id="415">I'll pay you back, and then he went and gave to the man. </sentence><sentence id="416">You live by example. </sentence><sentence id="417">You live by example, and therefore I feel that the children, whether it be German or Polish or Lithuanian, they don't grow up with prejudices. </sentence><sentence id="418">They're taught. </sentence><sentence id="419">They're taught, therefore, I feel that really the United States Holocaust in Washington or any other museums are memorials that were erected in the memory of this six million will somehow educate the people and let them know what hatred and bigotry can do. </sentence><sentence id="420">Not only to a group of Jewish people, but it could be an individual what they have done to the homosexuals or lesbians or to any other group. </sentence><sentence id="421">One day they may turn because they are catholics, but I think I always think that Hitler couldn't do those atrocities by himself. </sentence><sentence id="422">He got the masses to follow him. </sentence><sentence id="423">That is the tragedy. </sentence><sentence id="424">How blindly people follow. </sentence><sentence id="425">One, it be crazy or irrational and do what is absolutely against any principle to being a human being. </sentence><sentence id="426">This is what is hard to understand for me. </sentence><sentence id="427">Do you have any other questions. </sentence><sentence id="428">Maybe I didn't make myself clear. </sentence><sentence id="429">Q. I'm interest to hear a little bit again about your escape from camp on the trolley. </sentence><sentence id="430">I don't quite understand how you got away. </sentence><sentence id="431">A. Well, when you asked me before did I care or was I scared or did I have any reason or would I like to live. </sentence><sentence id="432">That was the time that I felt that I would like to fulfill my promise to my sister Ruzia. </sentence><sentence id="433">I had a desire to escape, and in that time, no, I wasn't scared. </sentence><sentence id="434">If they would have shot me in my own heart I know I placed Gaynosh and I placed my mother. </sentence><sentence id="435">I didn't know what their fate was going to be at the end, but at that time I felt good. </sentence><sentence id="436">When I was working for that Gestapo who was that sadist cleaning his house, and then I had to go to the barracks. </sentence><sentence id="437">I didn't stay, but I came there almost at 4:00 to his house. </sentence><sentence id="438">4:00 in the morning, without any food, and when I spoke to that Jacob and I told him just drop me off some pants. </sentence><sentence id="439">I cannot go in a dress or skirt because there was just that outfit. </sentence><sentence id="440">When he brought that, he said you will have to fall in at 5:00 and march with the men, but you are so short they're going to spot you. </sentence><sentence id="441">I said don't worry, if they shoot me, they shoot me. </sentence><sentence id="442">Don't worry. </sentence><sentence id="443">Just give me a chance. </sentence><sentence id="444">There was a big gate, and there were dogs and people with rifles to shoot when they didn't like somebody. </sentence><sentence id="445">Maybe somebody looked very fragile and they didn't let them go. </sentence><sentence id="446">They just pulled them out and shot them right there. </sentence><sentence id="447">This we saw too. </sentence><sentence id="448">Then everybody tried to stand up straight so they still with their last breath of their strength could go out. </sentence><sentence id="449">I marched in and tried being short to get closer and closer to the first, second row and then just outside the gate was the trolley that took them to the factory. </sentence><sentence id="450">Then, when I started to walk faster and faster, someone of them spotted me, and they started to "halt, halt, stop, stop, stop." </sentence><sentence id="451">Nobody stopped. </sentence><sentence id="452">They were marching and I quickly tun into the trolley and said to the conductor. </sentence><sentence id="453">I'm escaping and I'm not even Jewish, I'm Polish and I'm trying to escape because they took me by mistake, because I didn't know what the Polish person was thinking of the whole story neither. </sentence><sentence id="454">So, I said they shaved my head and I have to go and find my family. </sentence><sentence id="455">When they came almost very close to the trolley all the men were there and he took off and they were shooting and he said, I don't stop, I go. </sentence><sentence id="456">He said in Polish , we go. </sentence><sentence id="457">But unfortunately later on I know that they shot that Jewish younger man, that Jacob because first of all they know that a woman was in his group, and also that he came minus one. </sentence><sentence id="458">So, I lived for a while with that guilt too, and when you start to think about it, which I don't want to think about it, you have a very guilty feeling. </sentence><sentence id="459">Even now that we were in the beginning, well, it still didn't come to the marriage, so I'll tell you that later. </sentence><sentence id="460">If you have any questions going back, I'll continue. </sentence><sentence id="461">Q. Go ahead continue on when you were hiding. </sentence><sentence id="462">A.

id="599">He didn't want to speak in front of Shiltz. </sentence><sentence id="600">That makes me a little easier and I said how do you want to talk to me? </sentence><sentence id="601">Mr. Shiltz said use my office. </sentence><sentence id="602">I thought they're wired and they're just going to just -- so he pried again and he said my mother saw you and she really almost fell in love with you.

id="606">You see, I'm half Jewish, but I cannot tell them because I am with the and I said well I'm Polish so that doesn't go together, and I have a Polish boyfriend, and he said, well, he cannot help you, but I can. </sentence><sentence id="607">I said, well, maybe sometime in the future. </sentence><sentence id="608">He come once again, and I was in the hands of Mr. Shiltz who said you ought to

happy. </sentence><sentence id="611">I said no I don't need anything. </sentence><sentence id="612">So, one day he came and he told Mr. Shiltz. </sentence><sentence id="613">He didn't ask me, but he asked Mr. Shiltz if he could take me overnight to -- he named her name, I remember only her name was Elli and she was in the . </sentence><sentence id="614">I don't remember the street. </sentence><sentence id="615">She owned a shoe store and a most beautiful apartment and a very known husband of a , and she was a Nazi. </sentence><sentence id="616">He asked Shiltz that he would like to take me for a date there to a party. </sentence><sentence id="617">Then I found out that she took over the Jewish families, the store, the shoe store and all his apartment with beautiful things, with paintings that maybe you see in Louvre, and a big bust of Adolph Hitler. </sentence><sentence id="618">Then came some other young soldiers that they came from Poland, SS men to the party, and Eric was there too. </sentence><sentence id="619">This young man who was maybe half drunk he was telling the group something that would amuse them. </sentence><sentence id="620">I just came from near Limberg where we tied each child to a branch of the tree and put it aflame. </sentence><sentence id="621">And he said, why don't you laugh. </sentence><sentence id="622">I don't know. </sentence><sentence id="623">I don't find it funny. </sentence><sentence id="624">They are human beings. </sentence><sentence id="625">But they were Jewish. </sentence><sentence id="626">I said, oh, not to get myself into trouble, and Eric looked at me and he said, well I have some plans to take to show her a little bit around because she can not really go as a Polish girl. </sentence><sentence id="627">He must have seen something on my face, and I don't know if Ellie knew something or not, but she always felt that I'm her . </sentence><sentence id="628">She took to me. </sentence><sentence id="629">One time she came to Shiltz, Heil Hitler, she wants to take me to the Gestapo. </sentence><sentence id="630">Remember marching up those big headquarters, all those steps up with all those swastikas and I went there and she said could you say Heil Hitler and I said Ellie don't ask me to do that. </sentence><sentence id="631">I'm Polish. </sentence><sentence id="632">And she said, "I'll protect you." </sentence><sentence id="633">And she introduced me my . </sentence><sentence id="634">But she didn't use Rutkofska. </sentence><sentence id="635">My , So I didn't have to add that. </sentence><sentence id="636">Then when it was very bad and the Germans were really retreating and there was lots of being in the basement, shooting, and the Russians came in from the other side, she had to go to to run away, and she said the only thing, stay in my apartment but be sure that you take care of the bust of Adolph Hitler. </sentence><sentence id="637">Well, that was the first thing that went through the window. </sentence><sentence id="638">Then I took all the people that I know, Polish, Jewish and asked them to come to the shoe store and take as many shoes as they can, and that was my revenge. </sentence><sentence id="639">At least to her. </sentence><sentence id="640">I never saw Eric or anyone. </sentence><sentence id="641">But you spoke about the rape, but when the Russians came into that part, which later on they retreat on the other side of the Danube, I was living with a family, a German family who were Ellie's friends. </sentence><sentence id="642">He was a piano player, blind, very nice family, and his wife was Maria. </sentence><sentence id="643">They took me, so when the officer of the Russians came, they caught me in that building and asked to bring it down. </sentence><sentence id="644">This person laying down on the table and he said, "I'm going to have intercourse with you." </sentence><sentence id="645">And somebody went quickly upstairs to I think his name was Paul, that blind man I lived with. </sentence><sentence id="646">I don't remember the last name, and he came blind with a stick and he said, let my sister go. </sentence><sentence id="647">That's how close I was to it. </sentence><sentence id="648">Just because he was blind, I think, that that's what really took that person back. </sentence><sentence id="649">Q. This was a Russian soldier?A. A Russian officer. </sentence><sentence id="650">Then I understand that many people in that building worried, and then we heard that the American soldiers came on that side and I came down walked on the street and there was an American soldier and I didn't speak English an I said American and he said yes. </sentence><sentence id="651">Name? </sentence><sentence id="652">And he said Orbanik. </sentence><sentence id="653">I said are you Polish? </sentence><sentence id="654">He said, yes, no speak it. </sentence><sentence id="655">Never even tried to find him, but then I don't know with that United Jewish restitution who came with the packages and everything like for the Jewish people or was it that what was that?Joint Distribution, that's what it was. </sentence><sentence id="656">So, Icame. </sentence><sentence id="657">I didn't have any food, nothing too much, and I said, I'm Jewish and I would like to register and they said, but you don't look Jewish. </sentence><sentence id="658">I said, are we going to do in reverse now. </sentence><sentence id="659">Hitler thought I do, and you say I don't. </sentence><sentence id="660">He said, well, everybody would like to be Jewish to be a package. </sentence><sentence id="661">I said, that is unbelievable. </sentence><sentence id="662">Then there was near the river and there was not far away from the , | was walking along and that person that they showed you, the picture she was much older than I. I remember only she was coming to a mutual relative, and she was walking with a man and didn't pay attention. </sentence><sentence id="663">I only heard her saying Oh, that girl looks like Sabina's daughter. </sentence><sentence id="664">My mother's name was Sabine. </sentence><sentence id="665">We turned around and she said, oh, maybe that is. </sentence><sentence id="666">So, I said, who are you. </sentence><sentence id="667">She said are you Ava or Ruzia? </sentence><sentence id="668">I said, that's my sister Ruzia, I'm Ava. </sentence><sentence id="669">She said I'm and I had to recall when I met her she had always that beautiful hair growing all round. </sentence><sentence id="670">She was the first one to tell me where my mother was hiding. </sentence><sentence id="671">She came across in another hiding place with my mom, but then she was very good financially off so she was able to go to a safer place and she never saw my mother again. </sentence><sentence id="672">So, she said, I hope you're getting food and I told her what happened. </sentence><sentence id="673">So, she said, , it must be like some name, let me go with you to the joint distribution and let me be a witness and I have that paper if you want to say Anna and I forgot his first name. </sentence><sentence id="674">They married eventually. </sentence><sentence id="675">He was in film industry and they made a statement that I didn't know how to write -- read Jewish. </sentence><sentence id="676">They asked me to read that Iam Jewish and I got a package with eggs and milk, and I broke out because I didn't have anything for so many years and to this day I cannot have eggs because I break out. </sentence><sentence id="677">I just can have egg beater when they came out. </sentence><sentence id="678">That's how it was that history. </sentence><sentence id="679">So after I didn't have to work anymore in Shiltz office, I start to enlist with to somehow finish my education in the business administration and I met a Valerie. </sentence><sentence id="680">Her father was a veterinarian and we made very good friends, and that was still before they recognized me that I'm Jewish, because that happened in 1944, almost the war was over. </sentence><sentence id="681">No, no, no, that happened in 1946, after the war was already over. </sentence><sentence id="682">She invited me to her home to introduce me to her parents. </sentence><sentence id="683">They were very nice to me. </sentence><sentence id="684">They asked me to live with them. </sentence><sentence id="685">Then, in one Sunday dinner came Victor who was a dentist and he started to just ask me out. </sentence><sentence id="686">Polish, that's what they talked. </sentence><sentence id="687">They were very happy that we're going. </sentence><sentence id="688">They liked me, but they said that they were . </sentence><sentence id="689">You know, when you lived in Prussia which was one time occupied by Germans. </sentence><sentence id="690">So, they had to go into Army, to the military of Germany, but you were no the SS were you?

tennis. </sentence><sentence id="746">I was jumping, but he played tennis. </sentence><sentence id="747">Then, what attracted me was that so many other people wanted to take me out to Waldorf Austoria or something and I was wondering what they would like to have in return for it, but Milt said we can have a hamburger or a hot dog and he always went like that because he was wearing a jacket from Maury, from his older brother. </sentence><sentence id="748">I just thought that's nice. </sentence><sentence id="749">Then I met him in 1948, very vaguely. </sentence><sentence id="750">That's what I wanted to tell you. </sentence><sentence id="751">Out of 35,000 people I was selected to be on a caravan of hope to bring my story and also there were two Israeli officers. </sentence><sentence id="752">I think I sent you a clipping, Joan, of it. </sentence><sentence id="753">At that time I spoke of it worse than I speak now. </sentence><sentence id="754">I had developed laryngitis and in our caravan of hope, we stopped in Utica, which is really near where I live since 1954 when I came with my husband at that time. </sentence><sentence id="755">The people were very nice. </sentence><sentence id="756">They tried to . </sentence><sentence id="757">Inever knew what that is, but they were very friendly and I spot that. </sentence><sentence id="758">That was in 1948, memories it was very hard to remember everything, and I even forgot that I was in Springfield. </sentence><sentence id="759">When I sent you the clippings I said I was looking for some papers, and by coincident I had the clippings from Springfield Massachusetts. </sentence><sentence id="760">Joan, if I wouldn't see my picture in that article, I cannot recall that I was in Springfield Massachusetts. </sentence><sentence id="761">No way. </sentence><sentence id="762">I remember I was in Syracuse University because over there they once again, pretty girl with blue eyes and I always thought I had green eyes, said now Ava Gardner will speak to us. </sentence><sentence id="763">Of course I don't know who is Ava Gardner. </sentence><sentence id="764">I didn't see any movies, and I waited and they started to laugh. </sentence><sentence id="765">It's me. </sentence><sentence id="766">So, right now, before I came here. </sentence><sentence id="767">I tried to contact the Utica Observer Dispatch, which is a newspaper, and they told me that if it's "48 or "49 it would be on microfilm in the public library, which I got the clipping that I showed you. </sentence><sentence id="768">Then I called the library and the University of Syracuse, and they send me a clipping which I showed you. </sentence><sentence id="769">They were one of the soldiers of the officers was the nephew of the President to the Israeli state of , and the other one lost both legs because I think that was the time that Israel gained independence in 1948 or "49. </sentence><sentence id="770">So, at that time I went on the caravan of Hope and the other place that stayed out in my mind. </sentence><sentence id="771">I had always that same blouse that you have the picture. </sentence><sentence id="772">I did not acquire anything else, and we went to Atlanta. </sentence><sentence id="773">I don't remember Atlanta but I remember the hotel that we stayed. </sentence><sentence id="774">There was also a big philanthropist from Rochester , who when we got married, put carpet in our house because he remember me from the Caravan of Hope. </sentence><sentence id="775">He still lives in Rochester. </sentence><sentence id="776">He's a great contributor to Israel. </sentence><sentence id="777">At that time I asked the elevator girl because that was the only category I could afford to have maybe what she wears. </sentence><sentence id="778">If after work she can take me and I can get another blouse because I still have to go further. </sentence><sentence id="779">She said I can't go with you. </sentence><sentence id="780">I said is it because I'm Jewish. </sentence><sentence id="781">I said why. </sentence><sentence id="782">She said, because I cannot ride in the same bus that you are. </sentence><sentence id="783">I said why not? </sentence><sentence id="784">She said, because I'm black. </sentence><sentence id="785">At that time I think, I'd like to go back, because there couldn't be anything worse at the time to go from one oppression and find that I came to a country that is free and have that. </sentence><sentence id="786">Who's next I said to myself. </sentence><sentence id="787">That made a very big impression on me and that's how I know I was in Atlanta. </sentence><sentence id="788">But nothing of that sort happened in Springfield Massachusetts. </sentence><sentence id="789">Q. What was the Caravan of Hope?A. Caravan of Hope was primary to bring to the attention what happened with the Jewish people and speaking about my , my experiences and for the Israeli soldiers or officers to raise money for the UGA because a portion would be to save the children who came from Holocaust or other displaced families, and to raise money on all the stops. </sentence><sentence id="790">Then after I came from Caravan of Hope, my husband at that time was just courting me, asked me if we can see each other again. </sentence><sentence id="791">He's a very fine person, never never speaking about himself. </sentence><sentence id="792">That's when I met his doctor McKenzie and he was just in the last year of radiology, a resident, a doctor came in and he asked Doctor McKenzie to look over the pictures, the x-rays and he said whatever Doctor Dorfman will say, that is the diagnosis, which I highly thought of. </sentence><sentence id="793">He asked me to go to a dinner to his family. </sentence><sentence id="794">I told him, he asked me if eventually we can marry, and I said if your family wouldn't like me, I wouldn't marry you, because I really need a family. </sentence><sentence id="795">I meant it. </sentence><sentence id="796">So, we went there. </sentence><sentence id="797">It was a nice apartment. </sentence><sentence id="798">The father worked at 70 years of age because he was a self taught person to design dresses. </sentence><sentence id="799">They called him back at that age because he was so good, and he always said to Mama, you wear this dress funny when I come home. </sentence><sentence id="800">It was a wonderful family, but when I came there once again, long hair I heard her brother, Uncle Abe saying, nice girl, too bad she isn't Jewish. </sentence><sentence id="801">That followed me all the time. </sentence><sentence id="802">So, I opened the door, and I said, but she is. </sentence><sentence id="803">He was just so happy about it. </sentence><sentence id="804">Then in 1949, Christmas day, a Professor , who still lives in New York City, who was the Chief of Radiology, lent us the car and we went to Atlantic City, which was so called. </sentence><sentence id="805">Then he took a position in Des Moines Iowa and that's where my both boys were born in a Methodist Hospital, and we had the circumcision right there in the hospital because the family was so far away that nobody came for it. </sentence><sentence id="806">Then, my husband really wanted to be closer to the family and at that time -- I enjoyed Des Moines. </sentence><sentence id="807">There was a beautiful synagogue, a Reform, and there was evening sermons were very nice and educational. </sentence><sentence id="808">They spoke about everything and about the Holocaust, but then he was offered a position in New York City, which he didn't want to be in a big city not to raise the children there. </sentence><sentence id="809">Then there was a position in Rome, New York. </sentence><sentence id="810">We didn't know that Rome was horrible at that time. </sentence><sentence id="811">I couldn't believe that I lived there. </sentence><sentence id="812">Then my cousin came from Paris she said this is a slow death. </sentence><sentence id="813">Why are you living here. </sentence><sentence id="814">We don't even have a movie. </sentence><sentence id="815">We have to travel 20 miles to a movie. </sentence><sentence id="816">But a close knit family, and if you are part of the society or the community then you grow closer. </sentence><sentence id="817">My husband was chosen among 14 other radiologist one of them Jerry Segal, who is in Utica right now, and is glad that he didn't take it, because there is very anti-semitic, a restricted golf club, and my husband never delved into what is going on, so when they proposed to him, he said fine I like to play golf but then when he found out that we would be the only ones, he felt very bad. </sentence><sentence id="818">Later we learned that three voices were against only because he was Jewish and the vice president of the , Charlie Getty, who is a very good friend of ours, said I will have to resign. </sentence><sentence id="819">Because if we can't have a fine person like Milt, we should be lucky that he wants to join. </sentence><sentence id="820">This is how I joined the Club, which I was the only one but at that time Rabbi, who is now living in Maryland, Rabbi Weimer said maybe there will be opening. </sentence><sentence id="821">But they until today they think Milt is Jewish and I'm not. </sentence><sentence id="822">And Joan, I don't want to talk about it. </sentence><sentence id="823">I feel that I'm still having problems with it because one time I was asked what I am and then when I was Jewish that was no good. </sentence><sentence id="824">When I was non- Jewish that was no good, so when they asked me I just said I believe that I do things other human beings and that is the greatest religion what you can do, serve the fellow man. </sentence><sentence id="825">So, lots of people think that I married Milt that he's Jewish, I'm not Jewish and I don't try one way or the other way to correct it. </sentence><sentence id="826">It's immaterial to me. </sentence><sentence id="827">Both my children were bar mitzvah, went to the Hebrew school, and Gary right now I have two sons. </sentence><sentence id="828">One is Gary, one is Mitchell. </sentence><sentence id="829">They are also two years apart. </sentence><sentence id="830">Both born in May. </sentence><sentence id="831">Gary is a professor of Radiology where he is lecturing at the Medical School at Brown and is chief of the department and that's also recently president of the Cardiovascular Society for the whole United States and spoke recently in Sweden. </sentence><sentence id="832">But above everything, very good son. </sentence><sentence id="833">Mitchell is in New York. </sentence><sentence id="834">He's with the New York State Mental Health and he is a psychologist. </sentence><sentence id="835">He got his masters and hopes one day to get his doctorate degree. </sentence><sentence id="836">However, once again tragedy struck and we have been married 39 years and children start to make preparation for our 40th wedding anniversary and on the fourth of July 1988, Gary and his family we pick them up at the Syracuse Airport with their little daughter who was 2 1/2 or three years old and we went to our house. </sentence><sentence id="837">We had a wonderful Saturday, that same day. </sentence><sentence id="838">I had some people for dessert in the evening, and my husband said, well it's late but we don't have to get up next morning, Sunday, so early. </sentence><sentence id="839">He never woke up. </sentence><sentence id="840">I found him sitting in his chair gone. </sentence><sentence id="841">End of Tape 2 Tape 3 Q. Ava you were talking about the loss of your husband and how important he was to you. </sentence><sentence id="842">A. Well, he was not only a husband, he was a true friend and I didn't speak about my experiences but only with Milt. </sentence><sentence id="843">He was a very kind and understanding person. </sentence><sentence id="844">I know that the patients former patients of his are still saying when Doctor Dorfman was here they must have thrown away the mold, how the saying goes. </sentence><sentence id="845">There isn't a kinder person that you can feel like at home especially when you have radiology. </sentence><sentence id="846">You go into that big machine you need somebody. </sentence><sentence id="847">At night evidently I had very bad dreams and sometimes I'd say don't let them take me. </sentence><sentence id="848">I had to explain to him what I meant. </sentence><sentence id="849">But one time I think when Gary was around 17 or 18, he was just to graduate from high school, my husband was taken to the hospital with a heart attack. </sentence><sentence id="850">That was the only one. </sentence><sentence id="851">He was on very minimal medications and everything was wonderful. </sentence><sentence id="852">As a matter of fact, that fourth of July when the children came to visit us, Gary could not come very often because he is so busy. </sentence><sentence id="853">It was only because ten days later we were supposed to go to Alaska where I was taking a group of Senior citizens, and he and Doctor Brown who is on the picture with with me and his wife were supposed to go together. </sentence><sentence id="854">Gary persuaded me that I should take the trip in that short time because I didn't sit shiva. </sentence><sentence id="855">There was only one night and they were laughing and making jokes, the man that supposed to get you out of --- I just couldn't stand it. </sentence><sentence id="856">I just said no. </sentence><sentence id="857">Mitchell had to go back to work and Gary stayed with me and then went on the bus with me to Syracuse until he placed me on that plane. </sentence><sentence id="858">Of course I don't remember anything about Alaska. </sentence><sentence id="859">I cried and cried and Doctor Brown tried to give me some sedative and I'm anti-mediation so I just suffer without being calmed down. </sentence><sentence id="860">Every time they said you have to eat something and I didn't. </sentence><sentence id="861">That's the time I lost 17 pounds which I never regained. </sentence><sentence id="862">It was a shock, just a shock because we were together and on Sunday just to find him just --- I took his head and I said, we call each other babe, not Milt or Ava was not known and everybody called him -- my cousin writes letters "how is baby?" </sentence><sentence id="863">So, I said babe you can take and I stopped because he was cold, and the friend of ours who is the publisher of the paper he still says he remembers when I said "He's so cold, he's so cold." </sentence><sentence id="864">I was in shock. </sentence><sentence id="865">They didn't know if I'm going to get out, but they used to have a friendly poker game every Friday in the Sentinel which is our newspaper. </sentence><sentence id="866">When Milt died, they never resumed it. </sentence><sentence id="867">George Waters and Shirley said, George doesn't face anyone without Milt. </sentence><sentence id="868">He was very recognized professionally. </sentence><sentence id="869">He was president of the whole Society, not only locally but for the New York State. </sentence><sentence id="870">He was a very good , was a wonderful husband and friend, and a wonderful father. </sentence><sentence id="871">When you read the clippings, which maybe I left you, he did volunteer radiology for the DDSO, which deals with the mental retardation and they provided a portrait of my husband. </sentence><sentence id="872">He looks exactly like the write up that Gary put for his obituary in the medical journal. </sentence><sentence id="873">It was a whole dedication with lots of friends invited and the mayor of our city, Carl Ilemberg said that he doesn't know in his history of serving everywhere he comes from Rochester that two people in the same family would be honored because there was the dedication and the whole radiology department and the DDSO is Doctor Milton Dorfman. </sentence><sentence id="874">And of course, as you know, I think I mentioned one time to you Joan initially when we spoke like a year ago, that when I saw the mistreating in the concentration camp of the elderly in particular no mercy, and I was so close to my grandfather and grandmother, I said to God, whoever he was at that time, that when I survived the concentration camp I will do something for the elderly and for the children, and I left you the write up. </sentence><sentence id="875">You'll see that I single handedly I was able to try to get and through singly handed just raise 45,000 as a third of the whole payment for the land for the building, and then Governor Rockefeller was then the governor and they asked me to speak about the aged. </sentence><sentence id="876">I don't know if you ever heard of Monsignor Faye. </sentence><sentence id="877">He said for every President, Kennedy, Johnson and then Nixon as a member on the Committee on the Aging in Washington to the President. </sentence><sentence id="878">I know Monsignor when he was Father Faye and when they called me for the Catholic charities in Utica that Rockefeller was going to speak, could I come and speak on the aged because I was sort of a pioneer in that area. </sentence><sentence id="879">I said not with Monsignor Faye. </sentence><sentence id="880">He's too knowledgeable and so I came and he met me in the White House. </sentence><sentence id="881">I was delegate to the White House conference on aging and I met him there. </sentence><sentence id="882">As a matter of fact, when we had the 25th anniversary of the Senior Citizen's Council and the movement in the room I called the University where he is the President of the third world, and I said I would like to speak with Monsignor Faye, and he said who shall I say is calling, and I said he would not know me, but I would like to speak with me. </sentence><sentence id="883">So, he came to the telephone and he never said Monsignor, he said Father Faye and I said Monsignor you would not remember me he said "Hello Ava." </sentence><sentence id="884">He said it there was 400 people which is a big beautiful place and he said how can we forget Ava. </sentence><sentence id="885">Then, just by the Senate and the Congress they proclaimed the whole day Ava Dorfman. </sentence><sentence id="886">I told Sheri Bolet who is the Congressman you have to give me at 8:00 in the evening the day is almost over. </sentence><sentence id="887">I hope -- the one thing I will say that God helped me to fulfill my promise, because I started just calling a meeting of the retirees from the manufacturing from cable and I'll call and and it grew to 3,200 where I was 17 years the president and that was the time when my children were 5 and 7. </sentence><sentence id="888">I drug them everywhere and every senior citizen was their grandma and grandpa. </sentence><sentence id="889">As a matter of fact, when I came one time to New York and Mitchell was already after college before he got his masters, I said, Marie will be coming, Mother don't let her call me Mitchey. </sentence><sentence id="890">Surely enough she did. </sentence><sentence id="891">But I didn't give up lots of times that they could have spent with the children, but I didn't play cards. </sentence><sentence id="892">I didn't go anywhere in the evening. </sentence><sentence id="893">I stayed at home. </sentence><sentence id="894">When they were in school and before they come to school we almost met because I tried to divide my time. </sentence><sentence id="895">At the beginning my husband was the chief of the Radiology at Rome Hospital and then opened his own practice, so he was very busy. </sentence><sentence id="896">As a matter of fact, my husband was very understanding and any honors that were bestowed on me I always felt that he had to have a better part in it because not many husbands would see that on Saturday and Sunday I cleaned the house and ironed because I didn't have the time to do it. </sentence><sentence id="897">There were others, United Way, Polio, Mother's March and for the children I established a speech therapy where the children from parochial schools and public schools and the deaf school were coming and raised the money to pay the speech therapist. </sentence><sentence id="898">But it comes back to you. </sentence><sentence id="899">One time my car was stolen and I had to call the Triple A and Mr. came and said Mrs. Dorfman we'll have to take that car to the shop and recharge the battery. </sentence><sentence id="900">I said how will I get there. </sentence><sentence id="901">Oh, I'll get a ride. </sentence><sentence id="902">I'll come there. </sentence><sentence id="903">It was more than the Triple A pays and I aid how much I owe you. </sentence><sentence id="904">He says nothing. </sentence><sentence id="905">He shows me a picture, like a newspaper picture of a girl and he said you paid a lot. </sentence><sentence id="906">I said, how did I. Jackie was in your speech therapy and she was stuttering and having a clef palate and you sent her to Kim Janet in Hunter New York. </sentence><sentence id="907">You have done wonders because she is now graduating from college. </sentence><sentence id="908">So, there is you don't ask for rewards but whatever you do good to people it comes back and I feel if my children, and I see them living by that example, and when I sometimes used to say to Gary how come you're getting so late for dinner. </sentence><sentence id="909">Well, mother it would make you feel good. </sentence><sentence id="910">I went to the ward where they are really forgotten elderly people and I just thought I'd see what they are doing. </sentence><sentence id="911">I was happy. </sentence><sentence id="912">I was happy. </sentence><sentence id="913">My husband was also very active. </sentence><sentence id="914">He was the first chairman, president of the . </sentence><sentence id="915">He tried to be active, and most of all was very kind to the human race, and that is very important. </sentence><sentence id="916">His parents, when they printed the invitation for our wedding, they said the wedding of our children, the wedding of our children and my father -- which I called him papa, was very nice when the neighbors asked him how is your daughter-in- law and he said I don't have daughter-in-law, I have a daughter. </sentence><sentence id="917">So, but now that Milt is gone, I'm taking a candle and going to the Temple when I get the announcement that there is the and I feel that they were close to me. </sentence><sentence id="918">There is still one sister, Blanche. </sentence><sentence id="919">Her husband was a doctor in New York City and he died of cancer. </sentence><sentence id="920">I do come together. </sentence><sentence id="921">She came to the funeral. </sentence><sentence id="922">And another son, another brother died so it's really Blanche only who is alive. </sentence><sentence id="923">I don't know what to tell you else. </sentence><sentence id="924">Q. I have just a couple of questions from before. </sentence><sentence id="925">You mentioned that there was a particular roll call at the Yunaski camp with this little child?A. Yes. </sentence><sentence id="926">You see in the summer time when they called us out again sitting on that hot summer day, they put buckets of water just for us to see but not to give us. </sentence><sentence id="927">We were so dry we couldn't get anything. </sentence><sentence id="928">But they brought more people in from different areas and among them was a child who was just crawling and the child doesn't know anything so she or he crawled to that bucket and put his hands in and that SS or Gestapo, they're all the same, had a whip with leather fringes, and he kicked the child -- no kicked the bucket and the water just was out and I said, now that you've had your fun, can have the child have some water. </sentence><sentence id="929">He once again thought that that was very brave and Jews wouldn't do that. </sentence><sentence id="930">Am I not Jewish and I said no, I'm not. </sentence><sentence id="931">However, they put the other bucket and the child crawled again and he kicked the child in such a way that we couldn't even look around because we couldn't turn our heads. </sentence><sentence id="932">Then he came and struck me over my face and I had a big scar here. </sentence><sentence id="933">Now, I had the surgery I never know but everything happened on that side. </sentence><sentence id="934">It was not the strap but what he did. </sentence><sentence id="935">That is what I would always remember. </sentence><sentence id="936">There were many other incidents too numerous to mention. </sentence><sentence id="937">I mean the hanging of the people or putting dogs, vicious dogs and seeing the flesh taking of the people. </sentence><sentence id="938">I don't know. </sentence><sentence id="939">It was 20th century and the German people were supposed to be so civilized. </sentence><sentence id="940">Where is the civilization taking us. </sentence><sentence id="941">Q. One last story. </sentence><sentence id="942">When you were waiting to come to this country, you were waiting for a ship called the Lillymarlane?A. From . </sentence><sentence id="943">At that time there was a strike an they could not move the boat at that time from Brenehauffer and other friend who came together at that time, Anna Novak, her husband was an attorney and he passed away and she married a Doctor Heller, not the same Heller, and he's with the Northwestern Medical School. </sentence><sentence id="944">So is her son in the same place, and Henry her husband then said -- no they came and told us we have to clean the toilets because that's where our buildings, our bunk beds because I remember that Anna and Henry were there, I was here. </sentence><sentence id="945">They came and once again Germans clean the toilets and Henry went. </sentence><sentence id="946">He was an attorney. </sentence><sentence id="947">He went and cleaned for Anna too. </sentence><sentence id="948">I said I wouldn't do that, and the German looked at me and said yes you would and I said No I won't. </sentence><sentence id="949">Henry pleaded with me in Polish, you are so close to a new life, don't be stubborn, go clean. </sentence><sentence id="950">I wouldn't. </sentence><sentence id="951">I just wouldn't. </sentence><sentence id="952">So, they took me to an office where there was other military person just with a shirt not with that straps and I told him that I had to succumb to anything they wanted. </sentence><sentence id="953">After the war I don't feel like I want to do that. </sentence><sentence id="954">He said, he looked at me, he sat there and looked at me and he said but don't you want to go to America and start a new life. </sentence><sentence id="955">I said yes, but that doesn't mean that i have to clean the toilets. </sentence><sentence id="956">He said I'm from Austria. </sentence><sentence id="957">They were not very much better, but I told him that I lived there and he said, well, why don't you don that for me. </sentence><sentence id="958">I said I wouldn't do that for you. </sentence><sentence id="959">I wouldn't do it for me. </sentence><sentence id="960">He said, well it seems like you are determined. </sentence><sentence id="961">I will tell them that I have a different job for you. </sentence><sentence id="962">I don't know what I did and Henry said she won once again. </sentence><sentence id="963">Well, won or not won, it was degrading to me after the war that they had to do once again that dirty job. </sentence><sentence id="964">But, as they said when I came here it was not so easy neither because the cousin of my mother had an aunt from his wife's side. </sentence><sentence id="965">We never knew and he was on vacation when I came. </sentence><sentence id="966">He came in July and he was with the children Sadell and Julius and he asked me to be with that aunt. </sentence><sentence id="967">Very uneducated and she had a daughter Molly and Molly came in and asked me how the dress looks on her. </sentence><sentence id="968">I was always and I said not so good. </sentence><sentence id="969">They didn't know that in the United States you always say oh nice lovely and she felt that that was very offensive to her. </sentence><sentence id="970">At one point she said, hatred did not do that to the Jews in the United States so it must have been that God wanted it this way. </sentence><sentence id="971">Well, that was the end. </sentence><sentence id="972">I just took my things and found out that the Doctor Heller from Vienna and Rudy were in the United States, and then they asked me come and live with them. </sentence><sentence id="973">From there when I started to work at Wall Street with the Polish bank I lived with a Jewish family. </sentence><sentence id="974">That's what I want to tell you about, Ann Remler, Zigmund's sister. </sentence><sentence id="975">I lived on Ocean Avenue and I wore, -- I don't remember her husband's name but she was Sophie and they were very nice. </sentence><sentence id="976">They had two boys and friends came and played. </sentence><sentence id="977">At that time I made a promise to my sister's father --in-law. </sentence><sentence id="978">He had a daughter who studied medicine in Vienna and I only know that she married an American medical student. </sentence><sentence id="979">I know that she was Anna Silver, but I didn't know who she married. </sentence><sentence id="980">So when I was -- that was before I married my husband, but we were seeing each other. </sentence><sentence id="981">I went to the New York Times and spoke to a then reporter who was very known, Charlie Grutzner, told him that I'm looking for Anna Sabol who married an American, at that time student and they're married and they live right here. </sentence><sentence id="982">They are in psychiatry maybe. </sentence><sentence id="983">So, in Bellview Hospital some other doctor said, Anna I think they are searching for you. </sentence><sentence id="984">She said
