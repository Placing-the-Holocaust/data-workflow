Atlanta. </sentence><sentence id="842">But nothing of that sort happened in Springfield Massachusetts. </sentence><sentence id="843">Q. What was the Caravan of Hope?A. Caravan of Hope was primary to bring to the attention what happened with the Jewish people and speaking about my , my experiences and for the Israeli soldiers or officers to raise money for the UGA because a portion would be to save the children who came from Holocaust or other displaced families, and to raise money on all the stops. </sentence><sentence id="844">Then after I came from Caravan of Hope, my husband at that time was just courting me, asked me if we can see each other again. </sentence><sentence id="845">He's a very fine person, never never speaking about himself.

in a big city not to raise the children there. </sentence><sentence id="865">Then there was a position in Rome, New York. </sentence><sentence id="866">We didn't know that Rome was horrible at that time. </sentence><sentence id="867">I couldn't believe that I lived there. </sentence><sentence id="868">Then my cousin came from Paris she said this is a slow death. </sentence><sentence id="869">Why

Utica right now, and is glad that he didn't take it, because there is very anti-semitic, a restricted golf club, and my husband never delved into what is going on, so when they proposed to him, he said fine I like to play golf but then when he found out that we would be the only ones, he felt very bad. </sentence><sentence id="874">Later we learned that three voices were against only because he was Jewish and the vice president of the , Charlie Getty, who is a very good friend of ours, said I will have to resign. </sentence><sentence id="875">Because if we can't have a fine person like Milt, we should be lucky that he wants to join. </sentence><sentence id="876">This is how I joined the Club, which I was the only one but at that time Rabbi, who is now living in Maryland, Rabbi Weimer said maybe there will be opening. </sentence><sentence id="877">But they until today they think Milt is Jewish and I'm not. </sentence><sentence id="878">And Joan, I don't want to talk about it. </sentence><sentence id="879">I feel that I'm still having problems with it because one time I was asked what I am and then when I was Jewish that was no good. </sentence><sentence id="880">When I was non- Jewish that was no good, so when they asked me I just said I believe that I do things other human beings and that is the greatest religion what you can do, serve the fellow man. </sentence><sentence id="881">So, lots of people think that I married Milt that he's Jewish, I'm not Jewish and I don't try one way or the other way to correct it. </sentence><sentence id="882">It's immaterial to me. </sentence><sentence id="883">Both my children were bar mitzvah, went to the Hebrew school, and Gary right now I have two sons. </sentence><sentence id="884">One is Gary, one is
