<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="47">A: In a little suburb town of The Hague called Scheveningen, which was a fishing town, but it was a really an adjunct town of The Hague, and eventually my parents moved to The Hague in 1940. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="49">Q: Uh-huh. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="51"> A So -- but it was a little -- known for its fishing fleet, in fact, and in the war, the name Scheveningen was the shibboleth term by the Germans and the Dutch, because the Germans couldn't pronounce the sra sound of the guttural ch of Dutch, and they said S- Shravening -- Shaveningen. </sentence><sentence id="52">So when the soldiers who were dressed in Dutch uniforms, German soldiers, the early stage of the war, were asked whether you're, you know, friend or foe, and say Scheveningen vischenschuit, they said Scheveningense vischenschuit and they were shot. </sentence><sentence id="53">So that's the part of the town, anyway, it's a small town. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="57">Q: Sin -- since you were such a young person during this period, having been born in 1935, it would be good if we could try to distinguish between what you actually remember, when we talk about the experiences, and what you were -- what you were told, so we can get an idea what your memory is versus what you're remembering from other people's, if you think we can do that. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="71">Q: Right. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="73">A: [indecipherable], as -- what I've heard, which I have seen confirmed, in fact, what I have -- things have re -- recors -- subsequently confirmed in writing, so I guess I attributed it to my recall as well. </sentence><sentence id="74">And what I've read, and heard, and talked with my brother and sister, or others. </sentence><sentence id="75">But as I've mentioned to you, otherwise, my recall is spotty, and more in the sense of mental imprints, like [indecipherable]. </sentence><sentence id="76">Some absolute I recall, I -- I fix in my mind to this day I could see certain pictures, and I don't have a running -- </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="91">Q: Right. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="93">A: But I know episodes, and episodes kind of tell my story in the context of the Holocaust, or Shoah. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="95">Q: Right. </sentence><sentence id="96">Let's get a sense of your -- your family before we get into your particular tale. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="99">A: Mm-hm. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="101">Q: Who was your dad, and what did he do? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="103">A: Right. </sentence><sentence id="104">My father was born in Poland, Przemysl, established Jewish little community, and he moved to western Europe, I believe first to Germany, then to Holland, in the 20's, before he was married, in fact.[indecipherable] long time settler, and was another refugee coming from eastern Europe, or from Germany to Holland, lived there for many years. </sentence><sentence id="105">He was not a citizen ever, he was stateless, he was Polish nationality. </sentence><sentence id="106">But for Holland he was called stateless, but Polish nationality, I believe. </sentence><sentence id="107">My mother came originally from Zborow, which people think wer -- was Hungary, could be Ukraine, cause the countries this -- have shifted management over time, and was raised in Switzerland. </sentence><sentence id="108">At a very young age she moved to Switzerland. </sentence><sentence id="109">Her parents were -- grandparents, parents were one of the early settlers of the east European families who moved to Zurich. </sentence><sentence id="110">Again, that family, that group of families, I was told, could not move to Zurich, didn't have the right to move to Zurich, they moved outside of Zurich, to -- they had a lot of restrictions. </sentence><sentence id="111">And my parents were married in the early 20's -- in 22, and the wedding had to be held in Frankfurt, because a large number of members of the family couldn't receive visas to go to Zurich, where the -- typically, the bride's family town would be the wedding. </sentence><sentence id="112">I have the wedding picture of that wedding with me, which is a nice memento. </sentence><sentence id="113">That also has a Shoah story about it in fact. </sentence><sentence id="114">But anyhow, my father lived in Holland, and he was a postage stamp dealer, had a postage stamp store, had a wholesaler type of business, and had the store and lived origin -- he originally lived in Amsterdam with my older brothers were born in Amsterdam, and then moved to Scheveningen, and he had a store in one of the main streets. </sentence><sentence id="115">So he was a middle class person, nothing, no -- not an activist, not a Socialist, not a pervert, or what have you, and belonged to the east European community in Scheveningen. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="129">Q: Ca-Can you explain what it means to own a postage store, that's not stamp collecting, or is it? </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="135">A: Stamp collecting, or providing postage stamps to other stamp s -- th -- used to be many more small stores in Europe, to this day there are more than United States, who -- that specialized in particular items, so there -- now, also there are few postage stamp stores in the United States, most probably have s -- some Bethesda. </sentence><sentence id="136">But that was the job, to collect stamps from the other countries, and organize them by country, and know the dates, and the value, and they sell them to dealers, or to customers. </sentence><sentence id="137">So, postage stamps. </sentence><sentence id="138">He had his own, apparently a very personal, good postage stamp collection as well, which he gave over to someone, acquaintance or a friend, we don't know exactly who, before the war. </sentence><sentence id="139">It never returned after the war. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="145">Q: Do you have any recollection of going into the store? </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="155">Q: Right. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="157">A: Whatever that meant, as a child, but oh -- but I-I see them around, I mean postage stamps were very popular, much more than today -- </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="185">A: -- was born in 20 si -- 1926, and Aron -- Erik, was born in 1924. </sentence><sentence id="186">So they were substantially older than I wa-was. </sentence><sentence id="187">As a child there's a big difference, obviously. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="191">Q: So during this period before the war, between -- before the war comes to the Netherlands, between deg35 and "40, what is your memory of that household? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="193">A: It was a household that was living, I would call middle class life, going to do certain activities, like with fam -- family oriented activities, and Scheveningen was a resort town, so there were a lot of visitors, and to this day it's still a resort town, the beach, and -- so it was an active household. </sentence><sentence id="194">I don't know much about the social life of my family, so I can't relate to that. </sentence><sentence id="195">But so I know from the child [indecipherable] I do recall two personal incidents which are interesting in their own right, but the fact that I recall them, but also the interesting feature is that both of these little child events -- childhood events where I was actually was saved, kind of -- that's all I recall. </sentence><sentence id="196">The first one was I was lost in the beach. </sentence><sentence id="197">So the family went to the beach, that's [indecipherable] a kind of standard activity, it was probably on a Sunday, and I was lost, that's not unusual. </sentence><sentence id="198">And the police picked me up, and I do recall that I was sitting on the policeman's lap, with a policeman's cap on my head, waiting [indecipherable] was apparently relaxed enough, till they found -- till I was found, I think my brother came to pick me up, and then reunited with the family, so I was saved. </sentence><sentence id="199">That was what -- what -- what do we do. </sentence><sentence id="200">Second episode which I recall, was I took a walk with my sister [indecipherable] or Leah, and walked through a -- most probably a shortcut through a park, and was hit by a wooden swing, that time the swings were wood, and I was apparently unconscious. </sentence><sentence id="201">I had a sort of a scar right over here. </sentence><sentence id="202">They tell me that had it been a m -- centimeter or two above, I would have been brain dead, centimeter below, I'd have been blind, because I had a big, heavy impact. </sentence><sentence id="203">I had stitches. </sentence><sentence id="204">Those days you had stitches with like staples, I remember that. </sentence><sentence id="205">And I remember the gift coming home to soothe my return, was a wind-up crocodile, which I wound up and I played on the dining room table, back and forth. </sentence><sentence id="206">So these are kind of vignettes which I recall, but they kind of illustrate I'd led a child's normal, quotation mark, child's life in a home environment. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="222">Q: Do you remember your parents at tha -- i-i-in that period when you were [indecipherable] </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="226">Q: Right. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="228">A: I was the baby of the family, and I don't remember any story or event that kind of left a mark with me, but I knew my -- my mother was a housewife, and remember cleaning the house, and taking care of the household events. </sentence><sentence id="229">The hou -- I mean, the household, as far as I recall, I have heard was kind of gran -- rather normal. </sentence><sentence id="230">We had a lot of visitors, I do recall people coming by, and we confirmed -- subsequently I met certain people, relatives [indecipherable] I visited when I was a little child with my parents, and down the line. </sentence><sentence id="231">And that was a kind of -- it was a f -- a close link to families. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="236">Q: Right. </sentence><sentence id="237">Was it a religious household? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="240">A: Yes, was a religious household. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="242">Q: I see. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="248">Q: Was that -- </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="250">A: -- attending -- </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="252">Q: Was that unusual in Holland, or -- </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="254">A: No. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="256">Q: -- not so much? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="258">A: Not really, no. </sentence><sentence id="259">First of all, Holland has two or three communities, the more -- can't say native, but more Spanish, Portuguese Dutch are oriented, people had a number of generations. </sentence><sentence id="260">They had their own synagogues, and own community. </sentence><sentence id="261">Then there were the east European Jews who came in, who were not always well accepted and integrated. </sentence><sentence id="262">But in Europe in general, there was much more traditional conduct by people affiliated with synagogues, and went. </sentence><sentence id="263">My parents were fully observant, a kosher home, and active in Zionist organizations. </sentence><sentence id="264">My brother -- my older brothers, Josef and Aron belonged to what later became Brei Akiva, but precursor of those that were active in that, and I do kind of have memories on Shabbat afternoons, they were leaving to their groups. </sentence><sentence id="265">All I really remember of my two older brothers in a mental, visua -- visual image, is two lanky, tall boys with berets -- common people used to wear berets, and weeker pants, which were rolled up at the bottom a little bit, leaving, coming and going. </sentence><sentence id="266">But they were kind of active in youth organizations. </sentence><sentence id="267">So it wasn't, again, in the broader sense, that description were a normal family, as people would have liked to live, and were not allowed to live. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="278">Q: D-Do you recall your little friends that you had during that period [indecipherable] family and your -- </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="280">A: I do not recall friends at all -- </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="282">Q: Uh-huh. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="284">A: -- in fact, I mean, in part because we had a sizeable family and had two children -- my bro -- siblings were close enough in age, I suppose. </sentence><sentence id="285">So I do not recall from before the war, anyone by name, or so. </sentence><sentence id="286">That's a -- whether I had it, I just don't know, I mean, never discussed that with my brother or sister at all. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="290">Q: Did you go to a nur -- was there something [indecipherable] to a nursery school, or -- </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="292">A: No, I do recall starting school in 1942. </sentence><sentence id="293">I was only half a year in school. </sentence><sentence id="294">We went to what's called then a public Jewish school, it could -- what's called nowadays day schools, most probably. </sentence><sentence id="295">They were Jewish schools, and this was bef -- my brother went before that -- I had to go, cause at the time already when I was going to school, I had to be enrolled in a Jewish school, it wouldn't -- now the Nazis did not allow -- </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="300">Q: So that was late already. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="302">A: Late already. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="304">Q: Yeah. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="306">A: But I do remember for going to school, and in kind of the courtyard, singing, playing, and I was supposed to be a good boy, called in Dutch, witte boontje -- bon -- boontje, that was a white bean, that's description of being in -- a goody-goody boy, or so. </sentence><sentence id="307">But the school period was a very tense period. </sentence><sentence id="308">People -- there was all kinds of talk going on already around the house and in the school, murmurings. </sentence><sentence id="309">What it meant, I had no idea. </sentence><sentence id="310">I knew that something was brewing. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="318">A: That was deg42. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="320">Q: But you didn't know what. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="322">A: No, but there was something unusual, was nothing -- it was like something was involving -- and I sensed, I di -- I do recall sensing -- to the school year was both disrupted obviously, I was -- it couldn't last very long, several months only, but it was not a normal school experience, because the people in the classes were eventually in doubt. </sentence><sentence id="323">People came, and people left. </sentence><sentence id="324">And I si -- this I -- this I did sense, that was an indifferent -- not -- not that I had been in school for many years, so as what I did go to a pre-school, I don't recall. </sentence><sentence id="325">But it was not a stable environment, and this I had sensed right away, both at home, where there were murmurings, and most [indecipherable] parents whisper amongst themselves something, you know, something that's serious. </sentence><sentence id="326">What exactly it was, I don't recall. </sentence><sentence id="327">Was as bes -- I -- and was probably children brought into discussions. </sentence><sentence id="328">And of course I was too young, because I was a child. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="336">Q: Do you have a recollection of 1940, when the Nazis occupied? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="338"> A No. </sentence><sentence id="339">No, no, no. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="342">Q: So you don't -- </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="344">A: No, wa -- w -- </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="346">Q: Is -- is there a transition for you at all? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="348">A: The big transition really was when I was in school and I felt that -- I mean, for it -- I think it was big discussion which school I should go to, whether I should start y -- with school. </sentence><sentence id="349">I re -- kind of there was general discussion, I was on -- certainly going to go to school. </sentence><sentence id="350">Because that already in -- was -- was probably the fall, I assume school began in the fall like over here, was come to the end of our freedom, because people -- there were deportations, and there were round-ups and there were sh -- transports taking place, so there was some discussion whether or not I should start school. </sentence><sentence id="351">In retrospect it appears that my family, my parents were almost, I think, you know, how to deal with the family situation of how to -- not escape, but wh -- w -- to find means t -- how to survive. </sentence><sentence id="352">So if they have to -- if I hid -- if they would place me in hiding, or what have you, then you don't start school, necessarily. </sentence><sentence id="353">But anyway, I did go to school, and that school environment, I sensed there was something in the air, what I don't -- couldn't specify. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="361">Q: But the kids didn't talk with each other, that you remember? </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="373">Q: Right. </sentence><sentence id="374">So you never saw anything that made you frightened, or -- </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="401">A: I don't know how far hi -- how hi-high it would went, right, then because an -- a -- a child in general is left out for these sort of discussions, and the youngest, I was a young child, was not -- was not a party. </sentence><sentence id="402">I was -- I was almost six and a half, seven, right? </sentence><sentence id="403">So I was [indecipherable] a party to these discussions. </sentence><sentence id="404">I don't really know how much my brother -- my brother I think even more. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="462">Q: Okay. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="464">A: So [indecipherable] say it was -- that's why th -- you say whether or not I would go to school was [indecipherable] issue, cause by 42, in the fall of "42, later developments with Dutch Jewry oc-occurred already, deportations, shipments, round-ups. </sentence><sentence id="465">We were not last, but we were not first, either. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="468">Q: Okay, so -- </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="470">A: So the family planned to [indecipherable] our situation, and what wa -- was happening -- what happened was that my mother and two older brothers, Erik and Josef -- Aron and Josef, they went to one location, my sister to another, and my brother and myself to another. </sentence><sentence id="471">And bro -- those locations were strange in retrospect, but made sense at the time. </sentence><sentence id="472">There was a notion that certain people are less likely to be rounded up, or perhaps even immune, exempt. </sentence><sentence id="473">So if you stay, even with Jewish families that have that character about them, you are protected. </sentence><sentence id="474">So the notion was that my mother and her brothers, who were of working age, they were put into a -- a mental asylum, because the thought was that they don't need -- they're not going to be prom -- people at -- either accepted or believed the case that there were the people being shipped for work. </sentence><sentence id="475">So, they're not going to take people who have mental problems, they" ll leave them alone, spend your energies elsewhere. </sentence><sentence id="476">My sister was placed in another type of home, and initially with, I believe in her case, a pregnant woman, who again they thought wouldn't be taken, or a woman who had just given birth. </sentence><sentence id="477">That was sort of conventional wisdom at that time, and so we were separated from our parent, and the parent itself -- my father stayed at home. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="486">Q: Your father at home, your mother in another place, where is the [indecipherable] </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="488">A: My -- my fa -- my -- my mother and my two older brothers in another place, and my sister in one place, and my brother and I in another place. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="490">Q: And where were you then? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="492">A: With my brother. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="498">Q: And what were you told about -- I mean, it's very odd for a little child to be separated like that. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="500">A: Yes, I'll see you later, you know, we'll come back. </sentence><sentence id="501">Now, what is interesting is that people had -- ma -- see I -- the reason my father stayed at home apparently, was to kind of settle affairs, his belongings, and who knows what, and come -- and contact with family outside of Holland, I believe, which eventually materialized somewhat for that, and to make arrangements for everybody. </sentence><sentence id="502">So, not clear whether our arrangements were temporary or permanent. </sentence><sentence id="503">My parents were the ones who were making those decisions, and I was obviously not privy to those at all. </sentence><sentence id="504">So they have a sense of being in diff -- sure, things were different, but whether it's permanent or temporary, I had no sense of that at all. </sentence><sentence id="505">And my brother was there, so maybe that acted as a sense of stability for me. </sentence><sentence id="506">And the days went. </sentence><sentence id="507">There also was a conventional wisdom, which was [indecipherable] based on fact, that round-ups took place late afternoon, evening. </sentence><sentence id="508">So in the morning, my father, he went to synagogue, and we went to synagogue too, we met my father every morning at synagogue. </sentence><sentence id="509">So that respect, things were normal. </sentence><sentence id="510">So we met, and he patted me, chatted me, kissed me or s -- what, and it was a daily event. </sentence><sentence id="511">And my last image of my father is sitting on his lap, he with his tefillin on, and next day I came he wasn't there. </sentence><sentence id="512">So then we knew that he was deported. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="557">Q: Isee. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="559">A: Because again, the view was that the orphanage is a safe haven. </sentence><sentence id="560">They aren't going to take little children, little orphans. </sentence><sentence id="561">And meanwhile my mother and two brothers were rounded up, my father was rounded up and they move -- they were shipped to Westerbork in the end of January. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="598">A: They were sent out of west -- out of Westerbork on the 18" of January. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="600">Q: Huh, and -- and when did you find that out, that wh -- that was the transport? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="602">A: Well, through the red -- subsequently, in recent years, I've tried to trace down through the Red Cross, that -- curious to find out what -- </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="604">Q: Right. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="606">A: -- formally happened, any documentation. </sentence><sentence id="607">Took a long time, oddly enough. </sentence><sentence id="608">It's very strange that the record keeping was so uneven. </sentence><sentence id="609">After the war -- I mean, now moving -- </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="614">Q: Yes. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="616">A: -- on to a different subject matter, after the war, people tried to find out what happened to their relatives. </sentence><sentence id="617">And in our case, we were more ot less told by relatives and others, that our parents were deported and sent to Auschwitz and that was the als -- we had no documentation for that. </sentence><sentence id="618">As a child I did not pursue it very much, but later on as an adult, I tried to pursue it, especially when I read about that the Red Cross had tracing of a sort. </sentence><sentence id="619">And the first few answers was -- is all we know is that they were deported to Auschwitz, we don't know when, where. </sentence><sentence id="620">Later on they gave us a date, but no formal document confirmation. </sentence><sentence id="621">In year 2001, I got a Red Cross notification with documentation. </sentence><sentence id="622">Now, it turns out that in the Dutch registry, in the -- the government has a regis -- gazettes of a sort, they had ready -- in 1951 printed names of the fate of various people, and they send us a copy of those 1951 items, but nobody who we addressed -- now, had we known that it was in the registry, I would have gone to the Dutch registry, but no one ever hinted that it is available. </sentence><sentence id="623">So the first time I actually had confirmation of my parents death and departure dates, which initially came really out, that was in year 2000. </sentence><sentence id="624">A long time. </sentence><sentence id="625">And in fact, the Yahrzeit celebration -- commemoration, not celebration, commemoration of deceased, was an unknown item for us, we had no idea which day to commemorate. </sentence><sentence id="626">So -- you may be aware that the rabbinate in Israel selected one date of the year for those people that did not know when their immediate families were killed, or died. </sentence><sentence id="627">And they selected the 10" of Tevet, but -- so we observe that day as our Yahrzeit day. </sentence><sentence id="628">So the f -- took us till ni -- year 2000 to find a actual date, which turned out to be the 15" of Shavuot, so -- </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="643">Q: And did Westerbork have deportation lists, or they didn't? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="645">A: Did they have -- I -- yeah, I'm sure they had, but -- there's just what happened after the war, a lot of people made confusion, a lot of people made efforts, di -- they hit a roadblock, and they kind of called it quits, or so, and nobody came notifying us. </sentence><sentence id="646">I mean, this is a problem, it's a two sided way, be -- those who knew, didn't know us, and we didn't know who knew, okay? </sentence><sentence id="647">So you ask me how do I know the dates, now it's in black and white and confirmed, and it's from lists -- a big list in the Dutch registry. </sentence><sentence id="648">I have a copy of the registry here with me. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="653">Q: Now, did your mother arrange for the three of you to go to an orphanage? </sentence><sentence id="654">Do you kno -- do you know how that was arranged at all? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="657">A: I believe it was probably through my father. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="659">Q: Isee. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="661">A: Cause he -- th-they were picked up and -- in beginning of January, I believe, the first week or so, and then they were -- must have been a week or so in Westerbork, and so we were -- was probably more through my father. </sentence><sentence id="662">The -- these -- there were a lot of ad hoc arrangements during that period. </sentence><sentence id="663">Some were planned, and some were, you know, you had to improvise, and as -- when one option kind of reached it's end of contini -- continue, like me being in these private homes, where people thought was safe, they found a next tier. </sentence><sentence id="664">So we lasted another month in these different places, compared to my parents and my brothers. </sentence><sentence id="665">And then you ask me, you know, did I know what was happening to me, the answer is no. </sentence><sentence id="666">I was, know, placed. </sentence><sentence id="667">I was with people. </sentence><sentence id="668">I was most probably being fed, and taken care of, and that took care of me. </sentence><sentence id="669">I did know that i -- used to go to the synagogue in the morning, routine, that stopped. </sentence><sentence id="670">And my brother knew more, he knew that -- what it meant. </sentence><sentence id="671">That once he didn't see us, that he'd been dep -- rounded up and being deported. </sentence><sentence id="672">So it must have -- </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="685">Q: And he -- he didn't tell you? </sentence><sentence id="686">Do you remember -- any recollection? </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="699">A: Yes? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="701">Q: Being in this different place -- </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="705">Q: -- this woman's home -- </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="707">A: Yeah, right. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="709">Q: -- and seeing your father every day, would give you the sense of -- </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="711">A: Of some normalcy, also, right -- </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="713">Q: Some normalcy, right. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="715">A: Exactly right. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="717">Q: And then it stops. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="719">A: Yes. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="721">Q: And now you're in an orphanage. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="723">A: Yes. </sentence><sentence id="724">With other children. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="727">Q: With other children. </sentence><sentence id="728">Do you feel -- you don't feel insecure? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="731">A: I apparently don -- </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="733">Q: You don't remember? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="735">A: I don't remember. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="737">Q: Yeah. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="739">A: But again, you can keep in mind, if you rec -- reconstruct, if you're among a lot of children, suddenly, you are busy, you play, you eat, and you're taken care of, and you start forgetting. </sentence><sentence id="740">It's like, you know, little children with babysitters, when the mother's -- parents go on vacation, may cry beginning, and subsequently settle down, and -- not that it was so nor -- I'm -- not that it was all shipped away. </sentence><sentence id="741">I don't recall being shipped away. </sentence><sentence id="742">But that was circumstances. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="747">Q: Right. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="749">A: So I did not attribute it to, you know, imminent danger, or -- except my parents no longer were visible with me, I'd -- I -- my mother had less contact, because while I was coming to the synagogue in the morning, was my father. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="751">Q: Not your mother. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="753">A: Not my mother. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="755">Q: I see. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="757">A: And not my older brothers. </sentence><sentence id="758">So definitely I must have sensed things were different, but whether that is permanent, or whether that is dangerous, or [indecipherable] I don't think a child could catch it immediately, because nothing terrible was happening to me. </sentence><sentence id="759">I wasn't being beaten up, or on the street, or something of this sort. </sentence><sentence id="760">So I mean, I was under somebody's supervision and auspices, and that's how I -- I took it, I suppose. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="765">Q: Do you know whether this was a Jewish orphanage? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="767">A: Yes. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="769">Q: It was a Jewish orphanage? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="771">A: I believe it -- </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="773">Q: So all the kids were Jewish? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="775">A: -- I believe it -- I believe it was a Jewish orphanage. </sentence><sentence id="776">I believe so. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="779">Q: Yeah. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="781">A: But again, based on this assumption, that certain categories of people are going to be bypassed for the round-ups -- the round-ups notion obviously came very known in the Jewish community. </sentence><sentence id="782">People's friends and relatives were being picked up, and people swen -- started going into hiding, or escaping, or what have you. </sentence><sentence id="783">Some tried to make provisions. </sentence><sentence id="784">Then they tried to find ways which regarded what are -- where could we or our children be safe? </sentence><sentence id="785">And the idea of splitting up families was not a illogical step, that if some people can't make it, other could make it. </sentence><sentence id="786">And very often, you can't have a place for seven people, you can have a place for two or three. </sentence><sentence id="787">So you had to split up on practical grounds. </sentence><sentence id="788">So, did it hit me that something was affecting me, you know, lifetime orsat, I doubt it, it was kind of incremental, another step or so. </sentence><sentence id="789">But di -- bottom line was, you know, I was separated from my parents at that age, and that was it. </sentence><sentence id="790">And then separated from my brothers and mother, and that was it. </sentence><sentence id="791">And I was with my little -- older brother, few years older, and a little older sister, and that we were together. </sentence><sentence id="792">And then I followed what was -- not instructed, where I was told to go, where to go, and move, and I moved along with the -- the flow. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="805">Q: And you were a good kid. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="807">A: Apparently. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="809">Q: Yeah. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="811">A: Okay. </sentence><sentence id="812">But in February when we were rounded up, I do recall the round-up part in particular. </sentence><sentence id="813">We put on the train, and it was a round-up place in Amsterdam, the Schouwburg, I think it's called. </sentence><sentence id="814">Schombu -- Schomb -- Schouwburg, it used to be a theater. </sentence><sentence id="815">That became the round-up place for all the Jews in Amsterdam. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="851">Q: Right. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="853">A: It was probably as -- out -- they didn't have institutions in the cities, it was probably in the outskirt, someplace. </sentence><sentence id="854">And -- but the round-ups don't -- they took the collected people and assembled them, and they brought them all to Amsterdam. </sentence><sentence id="855">That was the collection point. </sentence><sentence id="856">And then f -- </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="891">A: When we arrived in Westerbork, we would have designated to go the next shipment, but - - like everybody else, it wasn't exceptional. </sentence><sentence id="892">It turned out our good fortune was there was a scarlet fever epidemic in Westerbork, a certain barracks, so they put the camp in quarantine, they wanted to protect the German soldiers, they don't want to get sick. </sentence><sentence id="893">So this int -- this -- they halted the shipments for a week or so. </sentence><sentence id="894">That week was critical for us, because while we were there, during that quarantine, a very good friend of our family's in Amsterdam, Mrs. DeYoung, informed, by telegram most probably, Westerbork authorities, the Jewish people, or the council people who worked there, that documents from our family in Switzerland, with Honduran passports, and also, I think, Palestine visas were made available for us and our parents and brothers. </sentence><sentence id="895">Unfortunately for them it came too late. </sentence><sentence id="896">But that week of window saved us, because then we put in different category of person, because we had Central American passports, and they treated that a little separate, and the Palestine visa part, they also had some benefit for awhile, because they wanted to exchange German prisoners for British citizens or what have you, and it put us into a different classification of detainee, and then we were in this new category, and we were put into different grouping. </sentence><sentence id="897">But without that week of scarlet fever, I wouldn't be talking to you. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="905">Q: You would have been sent immediately on the train -- </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="907">A: Yes, we -- the norm -- right. </sentence><sentence id="908">The reason why -- we wouldn't be any different than anybody else. </sentence><sentence id="909">That was the pattern, people came, and left. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="913">Q: Now, did you know, cause you're now a little bit older, you're eight -- </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="915">A: Yes. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="917">Q: Right? </sentence><sentence id="918">Or seven and a half? </sentence><sentence id="919">Seven. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="923">A: Seven. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="925">Q: Seven. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="927">A: Seven. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="929">Q: Were you told -- this scarlet fever quarantine -- </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="931">A: We were -- no, n-no, we were told -- </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="933">Q: No. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="935">A: No, but we -- I was told about the papers, something. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="937">Q: You were told that? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="939">A: Yes, yes, yes. </sentence><sentence id="940">The other thing which I was told, I -- again, is our parents, from the train send a postcard. </sentence><sentence id="941">That was very standard to drop postcards, and if they were lucky, other citizens would pick it up and put it into the mail. </sentence><sentence id="942">And was given to my brother, he -- my brother became the oldest person of the family, and I was told my brother had had a postcard from my parents, from what -- what it meant, I didn't know, but it was now wishing us well, take care, and in fact gave us the name of a relative in Switzerland if you need help. </sentence><sentence id="943">And at the end of the postcard our brothers wrote in Hebrew [indecipherable] see you. </sentence><sentence id="944">So I -- this I recall, my brother telling me walking somewhere in Westerbork, and telling pos -- not that -- I don't know, he tells more later, but the -- that we got a postcard from our parents on the train, wherever it is. </sentence><sentence id="945">Whatever that meant for me, I don't know how to re-interpret it, but that little bit of information was given to us, but then we put into a new category of people -- not that we knew that we were different there [indecipherable] cause we didn't have the sense of this timetable which we know now. </sentence><sentence id="946">People didn't know, necessarily -- </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="955">Q: Right. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="957">A: -- that -- came very rapidly. </sentence><sentence id="958">Now, moving people arrived, stayed, were registered, and then they were shipped out to death camps. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="961">Q: How do you picture Westerbork in your mind? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="963">A: Small barracks, little wooden barracks, I recall, and we were put under the guidance of a S-s -- orphanage equivalent, a per -- one family was designated to take care of children who were separated from their parents, or lost their parents, or what have you. </sentence><sentence id="964">And we put in that group, a man named Birnbaum, Mr. Birnbaum, originally from Germany apparently, and that was his task. </sentence><sentence id="965">He had a number of children as well, so I became friendly with his child, or he'd like me to play with his child, so I hung around his house more than the standard barracks most of the day. </sentence><sentence id="966">And I kind of took care of us, collectively. </sentence><sentence id="967">But that status helped us, because we not put on lists. </sentence><sentence id="968">There is one episode my brother related to me, which I obviously was not aware of. </sentence><sentence id="969">They didn't always trust those documents, [indecipherable] they were -- were suspicious, and the fact came from Switzerland helped a little bit, but they called my brother in, and was asking him what do you know about Honduras? </sentence><sentence id="970">Do you speak Honduran [indecipherable] knows what. </sentence><sentence id="971">So he was called in, and he was primed by someone, I think a Dutch lawyer, what he should say. </sentence><sentence id="972">And he was told that his mother's in Switzerland, to kind of confirm it, the source came -- that came from his mother, rather than relatives. </sentence><sentence id="973">She was Swiss born, somehow. </sentence><sentence id="974">Was -- lived in Switzerland many years, and apparently -- he told me recently again, that he was called in, and they asked him this question, you know, how'd you get these things? </sentence><sentence id="975">My mother's in Switzerland. </sentence><sentence id="976">And they accepted, asked what -- where's your father, and he didn't -- wasn't given any prompting for that, so he somehow answered, he's dead, and they let him go. </sentence><sentence id="977">But again, I mean, those are kind of intermediate steps where our status was even being questioned, and had they determined that it was a fake, it wasn't -- we weren't really, you know, Honduran citizens, or whatever, the passports were not -- we then would have been shipped, that interval. </sentence><sentence id="978">So we spent the year in Westerbork among children. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="996">Q: So you lived in a barrack with children? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="998">A: Lived in a barrack with children, yes. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1000">Q: Do you remember the food? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1002">A: Very little. </sentence><sentence id="1003">Was a s -- I remember a little more the food about Terezin -- </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1006">Q: Uh-huh. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1008">A: -- than the food in Westerbork, but there was food. </sentence><sentence id="1009">I was, I think, not preoccupied with no -- being, again with -- in a group of children, that -- wa -- which probably helped me in various stages, that eventually yeah, you played, and you spend your time, and wha -- wa-was fed, and that was it. </sentence><sentence id="1010">My brother was a little more advanced, so he most probably had to kind of keep his ears out what's happening, and he was therefore more perceptive. </sentence><sentence id="1011">But I was not drawn into that orbit at that stage of the game. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1016">Q: Did you notice children coming and going -- </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1018">A: Coming and go -- yes, yes, yes, yes, I noticed that there. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1020">Q: But that didn't necessarily affect you, because -- </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1022">A: No, because I was there, you see, and as long as I stayed next morning there -- I didn't -- I mean, it's -- again, under the circumstances, my age, had no reason for me to think about the instability of the situation. </sentence><sentence id="1023">I mean, as an adult, you think my gosh, you know, look what happened, were you scared, were you -- there's no -- no reason. </sentence><sentence id="1024">I mean, the saving feature was that I hung around with children, cause I was a child, and I was placed with -- in a children's home, effectively. </sentence><sentence id="1025">He was the guardian of a number of children, lots of them. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1031">Q: This Birnbaum? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1033">A: Birnbaum. </sentence><sentence id="1034">And I was even better off, I was put in close contact with his own children. </sentence><sentence id="1035">So I was playing and maybe eating at his table, who knows what? </sentence><sentence id="1036">There were family units in these camp situations, so that kept a little sense of normalcy. </sentence><sentence id="1037">Not having my parents somehow did not hit me during that period. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1043">Q: Was there something like a school? </sentence><sentence id="1044">Did you have classes at some point? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1047">A: They have both there and in Terezin, they had little groups of study groups to keep people entertained and educated a little bit, and teaching, you know, Jewish subject matter, holidays, songs, and both -- some songs, in fact I do recall the music to this day. </sentence><sentence id="1048">And -- </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1051">Q: Really? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1053">A: Yes. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1055">Q: Wh-What -- what do you recall? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1057">A: There was a round music in fact, Sim Shalom, with the prayer. </sentence><sentence id="1058">It was a round. [ </sentence><sentence id="1059">sings a few lines]. </sentence><sentence id="1060">And we sang that, okay? </sentence><sentence id="1061">And another one, Shomer Yisrael. </sentence><sentence id="1062">Now, they're interesting in retrospect, those two songs, which also in Terezin, the -- exactly the same songs were taught, I recall, is quite remarkable, because both of them are the prayers of hope. </sentence><sentence id="1063">We didn't know the translation as much, but the teachers kind of were injecting hope on this place, peace on Israel. </sentence><sentence id="1064">Another one is God is the watcher of the remnant of Israel. </sentence><sentence id="1065">So, those two songs I remember to this day, but I didn't have -- it turns out that -- that people used to sing them subsequently too, so I don't know what I would -- </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1075">Q: Isee. </sentence><sentence id="1076">Sing a little bit of the second song? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1079">A: [sings a few lines of Shomer Yisrael] It was a choir rounding song, or so. </sentence><sentence id="1080">And -- so we had instructions, we had learning in both Terezin and ams -- and Westerbork. </sentence><sentence id="1081">Westerbork I remember more concreteness that I know the loft where we went up, the third floor of the caserne, third tier, not [indecipherable] floor, had three layers. </sentence><sentence id="1082">We went up, and we did our little studying, whatever it had to study, you know, instruction, the stories, holidays, about Israel, Palestine. </sentence><sentence id="1083">And there was a watchman in front of the door watching, because we're not allowed to have formal classes, and the watchman in [indecipherable] I remember the watchman, and whenever the SS guards, or their equivalent came by to inspect the place, we got the warning, and we started playing cards, or games, or what have you. </sentence><sentence id="1084">Very, very similar to the story about Chanukah, where people -- one reason why people played dreidl, because they -- because at that time also, people were prohibited to study the Torah, and with guards coming by, and then people improvised games. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1092">Q: Mm-hm. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1094">A: And so we went through that in 1943 and "44. </sentence><sentence id="1095">But there was instruction, but not formal. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1098">Q: Could you read? </sentence><sentence id="1099">Did you have some instruction [indecipherable] </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1102">A: I had some instruction, well I had very little formal education -- </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1104">Q: Yeah. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1106">A: -- with three months or so, at best, in Holland, I -- yes, I learned how to read, maybe even before at home, I don't recall where. </sentence><sentence id="1107">But I remember I read Dutch. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1110">Q: Yes. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1112">A: And my vocabulary obviously was limited. </sentence><sentence id="1113">Was -- didn't develop, I didn't have more -- I spoke Dutch among the Dutch people in Westerbork, obviously Dutch. </sentence><sentence id="1114">And in Terezin also. </sentence><sentence id="1115">But I didn't read books in the normal sense of the term. </sentence><sentence id="1116">But there was instruction. </sentence><sentence id="1117">People spent again, their time. </sentence><sentence id="1118">They devot -- there were former teachers who were idle, so they had some to do, and people took on responsibility to keep the kids occupied, and study with them. </sentence><sentence id="1119">So that was familiar things, but not when it came back after the war I had handicap when [indecipherable] do some arithmetic or anything of this sort. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1128">Q: Right. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1130">A: I didn't have the same background as other children. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1132">Q: I -- [read that the weather in Westerbork was horrible. </sentence><sentence id="1133">Do you have any recollection if that's true? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1136">A: Yeah, well, the weather was raw. </sentence><sentence id="1137">Dutch weather is not, you know, the most comfortable weather except in the spr -- summertime or so. </sentence><sentence id="1138">It's a variation of British weather, wet, cold. </sentence><sentence id="1139">I can recall episodes of cold -- periods, but not as a personal suffering part, that it was ca -- always cold, always ya -- again, in retrospect I just don't recall how we survived both the deprivation and weather conditions, both in Westerbork, and Terezin, which is even colder, because we didn't come with, you know, baggage of clothing. </sentence><sentence id="1140">Must have had some bags, and as we moved up in age, we grew. </sentence><sentence id="1141">Now, I may have taken my brother's clothing, but [indecipherable] my brother get? </sentence><sentence id="1142">Now, we didn't grow that much. </sentence><sentence id="1143">We were stunted in our growth, most probably, but we still grew. </sentence><sentence id="1144">So the question mark still is, where did we get our clothing? </sentence><sentence id="1145">We may have gotten it from other people who left, and the children's home may well have supplied us. </sentence><sentence id="1146">But we didn't certainly have our own wardrobe to take care of us, particularly in cold weather. </sentence><sentence id="1147">So every so often I do reflect, how did we manage in cold weather in general, with limited clothing, and not having our own clothing, nobody -- no parents, nobody to provide. </sentence><sentence id="1148">But I -- I sp -- I assume that these people like Mr. Birnbaum, and subsequently in Theresienstadt the woman who took care of us, kind of assembled material, and that there -- that was part of their job, to make sure the children under their charge have clothing. </sentence><sentence id="1149">And where they got it from was probably from people who had to -- we-were transported and left, and then it redistributed. </sentence><sentence id="1150">So I don't know how bitter the cold was for me personally. </sentence><sentence id="1151">But it -- I do know it was drab. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1169">Q: Were you also limited where you could walk? </sentence><sentence id="1170">Could you just stay around where this barrack was? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1173">A: Well, here again see, I in some sense was a beneficiary of being a young child. </sentence><sentence id="1174">I had no reason to parade in the large areas like most norm [indecipherable] and I was in this Birnbaum family, in their -- and was probably nu -- wherever I slept in the barracks, in the morning go to the Birnbaum's. </sentence><sentence id="1175">So that was my routine, so no reason for me to wonder. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1179">Q: Right. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1181">A: So the restrictions that existed most probably did not impair me, because there was no need for me to wander around. </sentence><sentence id="1182">So that respect, being young was a blessing. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1185">Q: And were you required to have a Jewish star on your clothes as well, do you remember? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1187">A: Yes, yes. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1189">Q: You did? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1191">A: Yes, yes, yes. </sentence><sentence id="1192">But that did not necessarily, you know, impact me dramatically because that we had -- that [indecipherable] was on my sweater, and I wa -- it was cold you wore a sweater, you wore that with the yode star on it. </sentence><sentence id="1193">So again, in looking back on it, being a sm-small child, or a very young aged little boy protected me, gave me my own little area of protection, that I did not face a lot of the other things which I would have faced four years later. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1197">Q: Right. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1199">A: My brother had more exposure, both in Westerbork and in Terezin, because as you move up the ladder of age, you get -- you're drawn into these other restrictions. </sentence><sentence id="1200">So I can't say that I felt, you know, restricted or inhibited, like most children in today's environment most probably wouldn't feel restricted if they cannot cross the street. </sentence><sentence id="1201">You know, if you ask them 20 years later, did you feel dil -- were you a prisoner of your neighborhood? </sentence><sentence id="1202">I don't think they would express it in these terms. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1207">Q: That makes sense. </sentence><sentence id="1208">We're going to have to change the tape right now. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="1211"> End of Tape #2    Tape #3 </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1214">Q: Okay. </sentence><sentence id="1215">Is there anything else that you would remember from Westerbork before you get sent to Terezin? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="1218"> A Not much ta -- of detail, kind of that could mention -- that I have mentioned. </sentence><sentence id="1219">I [indecipherable] come back subsequently. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1222">Q: Right, okay. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="1224"> A No, I think that's -- the time passed, and then we were -- </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1226">Q: Now, you're a year -- </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1228">A: A year, we -- </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1230">Q: At Westerbork -- </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1232">A: -- yes. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1234">Q: -- from what, February -- </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1236">A: February to February. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1238">Q: -- fe -- February. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1240">A: Right. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1242">Q: So in February deg44 -- </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1244">A: "44 </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1246">Q: Now, does somebody come and tell you tomorrow you're going to go to another place? </sentence><sentence id="1247">I mean, how -- </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1250">A: Not to me, Leo. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1252">Q: Not to you? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1254">A: Not to me, again. </sentence><sentence id="1255">I was -- I don't feel bad being left out. </sentence><sentence id="1256">No, but we were told that ending up in west -- in Terezin -- see, in Theresienstadt-stadt, as you know, was a place where they -- that st -- sent people -- a s-second holding place, holding pattern. </sentence><sentence id="1257">Primarily people who had certain privileges stay -- privileged status, and our status kind of held, and therefore Westerbork was a place to -- transits, spot to get people out, and so we were there in some sense too long, we didn't belong in Westerbork because we're not transit people, and we were not transit to get transported, so they moved them to a new place, which -- Theresienstadt, which was designed for our kinds of people, all kinds of privileged people. </sentence><sentence id="1258">I had no idea that I was privileged obviously, but that settled in later. </sentence><sentence id="1259">But -- so I had no sense that that's a new regime, you know, for me. </sentence><sentence id="1260">But my brother and sister were there, of course, must -- that must have been very reassuring, to have my brother and sister with me on an ongoing basis. </sentence><sentence id="1261">That was my anchor of family stability, and the rest was activities throughout the day, or evening. </sentence><sentence id="1262">So when I was -- when we were going to Terezin, we were put under the auspices of a social worker from Amsterdam, also was being shipped there with her husband, her name was Malka Weinmann, and her husband Paul Weinmann, who -- they placed some children under their responsibility. </sentence><sentence id="1263">And we ended up in the train, which again I do remember the physical feature of the train, it was a compar -- a European compartment train, was probably third class, but it was not the cattle train, which people unfortunately were subjected to as well. </sentence><sentence id="1264">Was a commercial type of train with compartment, and we sat there, my brother, my sister, myself, the two Weinmanns, two elderly people, Rosens, elderly people, and another girl Alicia Farber, who was separated from her parents, so she was all alone as well. </sentence><sentence id="1265">And we had this train trip to another place. </sentence><sentence id="1266">And in the train, I was -- was probably playing on the floor, with whatever we had over there, and Miss Malka Pollaczek had a suitcase which I opened up, as a curious child would ordinarily do, and I played with whatever she had over there, I inspected it. </sentence><sentence id="1267">And it was a big t-tin can there, and I asked her what is this all about, what is this for? </sentence><sentence id="1268">And so she tells me, we'll use that at happy occasion. </sentence><sentence id="1269">Turns out it was used for a happy occasion, subsequently for my brother's Bar Mitzvah, close to -- to the following year. </sentence><sentence id="1270">But that -- that scene of the train ride I remember like a photograph, sitting there, and we moved onto -- from Westerbork to Theresienstadt. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1289">Q: Do you know how long it took? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1291">A: Several days, I believe. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1293">Q: And did they wein -- the Weinmanns have food that they brought with them, so that you could eat? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1295">A: They brought some food, yes. </sentence><sentence id="1296">They brought some food and provisions. </sentence><sentence id="1297">And I assume -- I assume now that we also had our little bags -- people allowed to bring along one suitcase, or some bag or so. </sentence><sentence id="1298">So whatever we had -- what it was inside our bag, I have no clue, nor does my brother really remember. </sentence><sentence id="1299">I asked him. </sentence><sentence id="1300">But people had their belongings. </sentence><sentence id="1301">And when we came to Theresienstadt, we were placed with the Dutch population. </sentence><sentence id="1302">They was s- segmented, they compartmentalized the people. </sentence><sentence id="1303">Sometimes different groups met all across th-the borders, in some sense, but we were among the Dutch. </sentence><sentence id="1304">That again, in retrospect most probably helped because again, Dutch language was the language we sp - - Lheard, and people spoke. </sentence><sentence id="1305">Not that we knew people -- I don't think we knew many people over there, but some -- turned out we had some relatives of my mother as well, whom we dealt with, my brother more than I. And we were put under -- she became our guardian, Malka Pollaczek. </sentence><sentence id="1306">And she, in fact, was put in charge of the children's home in Terezin as well, which came to my advantage later. </sentence><sentence id="1307">The Dutch compound, we were put in the caserne, that -- not -- not barracks, barracks were flat, usually, and caserne was pretty impressive stone buildings with courtyards, and surrounding were -- originally were made for quarters for soldiers. </sentence><sentence id="1308">And they used it for the people who were put into Theresienstadt, in detention purposes, and they multiplied the number of people in the -- those casernes were multiples of what the soldiers were in, was very crowded. </sentence><sentence id="1309">Had three tiers, beds -- three bunk beds. </sentence><sentence id="1310">And men were separated from the women. </sentence><sentence id="1311">And I now went with my brother, and my sister was -- what -- was accessible, I went to visit my sister. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1330">Q: She was in a different place? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1332">A: Also in the same Hamborg caserne, that's where the Dutch were. </sentence><sentence id="1333">And they were [indecipherable] pretty impressive stone structures. </sentence><sentence id="1334">And in that respect you look at it now, it looks like, you know with the courtyard, with kind of tiered, round hallways. </sentence><sentence id="1335">But all of that was very crowded, and not very, you know attractive. </sentence><sentence id="1336">But people always say that Terezin is an attractive place compared with the other concentration camps, and they're absolutely correct in that respect, but it's not a place recommend for a vacation. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1342">Q: Right. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1344">A: Or for a pleasant journey. </sentence><sentence id="1345">It was -- had it's own drabness all the time, of the stench and the physical environment. </sentence><sentence id="1346">So again, I do see a visi -- a vision of a -- of the scene of brown wooden bunk beds, three tiers, and lots of people, and crowded, and noisy. </sentence><sentence id="1347">But it was not a calm environment. </sentence><sentence id="1348">Bedbugs, lice on the beds, killing at night was an activity, you know to s-swipe them, do away with them. </sentence><sentence id="1349">And then had get -- got a new routine in Terezin. </sentence><sentence id="1350">Now, Terezin I remember a little bit more, because I was older, so I have more mental images of Terezin. </sentence><sentence id="1351">In ret -- in comparison to everything else, it was spacious. </sentence><sentence id="1352">Was -- okay? </sentence><sentence id="1353">Because you had these big courtyards, and then from caserne to caserne there was another walkway, and when you moved down from there -- there I did walk outside of the caserne for a reason I'll tell you in a minute. </sentence><sentence id="1354">So you had a sense of not being totally confined to one building, or one narrow area. </sentence><sentence id="1355">And that kind of tri -- helped the physical benefit from being that -- not [indecipherable] confined. </sentence><sentence id="1356">But it wa -- once you're in the barracks, it was very crowded. </sentence><sentence id="1357">But I was basically confined to that quarters for line-up, for soup, for the meals, and for daily activity. </sentence><sentence id="1358">And the learning study group I mentioned before, the study group was up in that loft, up to the left, if I recall correctly, where we -- I went on a basis. </sentence><sentence id="1359">So I didn't, again, wander around much till later in Terezin. </sentence><sentence id="1360">And a lot of the parts of Terezin I never stepped across, because I had no business to be there. </sentence><sentence id="1361">I may not even allowed to be there for all I know. </sentence><sentence id="1362">So you stuck where you belonged, and where I had some reason to be. </sentence><sentence id="1363">And my reasons to be, to go to visit my sister, or go to the study place, the first stage of my stay there. </sentence><sentence id="1364">And spent the time there. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1386">Q: Let me go back for a moment. </sentence><sentence id="1387">Do you remember your arrival in Theresienstadt? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1390">A: Yes, yes. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1392">Q: What was that like? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1394">A: We had to walk a long distance from the train. </sentence><sentence id="1395">Later, I think they extended the train tracks, because when -- eventually right outside of Hamborg caserne, there was a fence, and the train tracks that was visible to my -- later on I saw people come and go, those [indecipherable] my activities during the day. </sentence><sentence id="1396">But I don't think in our time we got that close. </sentence><sentence id="1397">We had to walk, I think a half an hour [indecipherable] what. </sentence><sentence id="1398">But there was a parade of people marching, and I followed the crowd, and I moved along, and my legs held up, and that was it. </sentence><sentence id="1399">So it didn't leave as an impression of a torturous rite. </sentence><sentence id="1400">I don't know what id -- had no idea what I was in for. </sentence><sentence id="1401">See, adults in all likelihood have more uncertainties and more concerns for -- they knew who they left behind, what they left behind, rumors, all of that. </sentence><sentence id="1402">So they're walking with a different attitude that I -- | was a child again, not -- be -- being protected and being ignorant helped. </sentence><sentence id="1403">So I walked. </sentence><sentence id="1404">But I did not, you know, find that, you know, gruesome or onerous. </sentence><sentence id="1405">I may have been tired, as a child, but moved along, you know. </sentence><sentence id="1406">I was prodded along, and that was it. </sentence><sentence id="1407">So I -- that part, in some sense | skipped easier than settling into the place. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1422">Q: Was there a registration process at -- </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1424">A: There was a registration process, which I don't recall being involved, maybe Miss Malka Pollaczek took care of, maybe my brother took care of it. </sentence><sentence id="1425">Vaguely I recall something, standing on lines. </sentence><sentence id="1426">Lot of line standing in Terezin in general. </sentence><sentence id="1427">Lining for food, was a line always. </sentence><sentence id="1428">Morning line-up sometimes. </sentence><sentence id="1429">Evening I think also. </sentence><sentence id="1430">So there were lines, so -- but at the -- the registration p -- part, again I -- I -- being a child, you -- I take it for granted you stand in line, or you do it, what you were told to do, so -- so it never left a big impact on me, or impression, as other people find that -- was very cold when we arrived in February. </sentence><sentence id="1431">And again, as I mentioned, for how we survived overall cold with inadequate clothing, in all likelihood, pretty impressive. </sentence><sentence id="1432">Course I went -- we visited in 1996, Terezin, was also February, by chance, and was bitter, bitter cold with a winter jacket, and with gloves and a scarf. </sentence><sentence id="1433">And tell my wife that not see how I could have done that so many years before, but I did. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1444">Q: Right, right. </sentence><sentence id="1445">Did you see any brutality when you first arrived? </sentence><sentence id="1446">Were people screaming? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1450">A: No, no, no, no, no -- </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1452">Q: Nothing. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1454">A: I don't recall anything like that. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1456">Q: So while it was crowded, it was not a hysterical scene to you. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1458">A: I don't -- I didn't -- I don't recall any of that, I mean I don't know whether there was or there wasn't. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1460">Q: Right. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1462">A: So, I mean I can't be a witness for that. </sentence><sentence id="1463">I more recall was the daily routine. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1466">Q: Mm-hm. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="1468"> A The food line-up, I recall. </sentence><sentence id="1469">All of us had a ration card for the month, and each of us had a little metal bowl and a spoon. </sentence><sentence id="1470">How I, as a young child in 1944, held onto that without losing it -- I believe I didn't lose it, I still wonder. </sentence><sentence id="1471">Because nowadays a lot of school kids can't keep their lunch card for one day, or other tickets, or so, and that mu -- mean -- it was [indecipherable] my survival. </sentence><sentence id="1472">In order to get food you need the bowl, you need the card. </sentence><sentence id="1473">And I never lost the card. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1480">Q: Where -- where would you put the bowl? </sentence><sentence id="1481">Did you tie it on a belt or something, or you don't know? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1484">A: Carried it with me, or put it back in the barrack when I wa -- was through. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1486">Q: Uh-huh. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1488">A: But I have again these images of walking around at the -- at the serving time, with a spoon and a bowl, and lining up. </sentence><sentence id="1489">And there was a strategy of where to line up, and when to line up, because the main meal often contained like a barley soup. </sentence><sentence id="1490">And if you came early you got the water, if you came at the end you got nothing. </sentence><sentence id="1491">If you want to get water and barley, which had the most substance, you had to be positioned in the right time of your line-up, the people positioned themselves, and I recall always people jockeying for position where to go, partly because of what you get. </sentence><sentence id="1492">And I was part of that jockeying. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1498">Q: And you knew that? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1500">A: I sensed it, yeah, I knew this, I knew that, I was [indecipherable] to become -- after awhile I become streetwise. </sentence><sentence id="1501">And I was again told -- but that was part of my job, to be there on time, at the right time, the right place to get a better serving. </sentence><sentence id="1502">There were times I came late. </sentence><sentence id="1503">There were times I came too early. </sentence><sentence id="1504">But every can't be in the middle, obviously. </sentence><sentence id="1505">But that whole -- not tension, that whole -- at -- at -- attention, too, and focus on getting your food or so, became part of your daily routine. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1512">Q: Right. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1514">A: You know, have your bowl and have your food and have your line-up. </sentence><sentence id="1515">Like it was a time consuming affair through three times -- </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1518">Q: And what -- what did this ration card look like? </sentence><sentence id="1519">Did y -- did someone cl -- clip off -- </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1522">A: Clipped off a piece -- I think they were -- </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1524">Q: They clipped off a piece? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1526">A: Yes, piece of paper I think that little sections to -- </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1530">A: -- to clip [indecipherable] make it 90 little coupons, and took -- each day took three. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1532">Q: And did you get the soup outside, or inside? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1534">A: Outside, outside. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1536">Q: It was outside -- </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1538">A: In the courtyard. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1540">Q: -- and you ate -- and you ate outside. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1542">A: I think ate outside, and sometimes inside. </sentence><sentence id="1543">But they out -- the courtyard was it -- a place where again, you saw [indecipherable] one photograph, that was the kind of scene you could remember. </sentence><sentence id="1544">All Jewish people in -- interned people who were there, with coats and the star on their jackets were serving the food, and then [indecipherable] people who knew who you were, you know? </sentence><sentence id="1545">And it was a daily routine. </sentence><sentence id="1546">The food wasn't very much food to eat. </sentence><sentence id="1547">With black bread, with cok -- grain coffee called ersatz coffee, which kids got too. </sentence><sentence id="1548">The barley soup, several times a week there was horsemeat, and vegetables. </sentence><sentence id="1549">Now, one vegetable which lasted for me after the war, as well as a -- we called a [indecipherable] initially, is a -- something which young people don't know, now we call them green beans, but they were used to call string beans. </sentence><sentence id="1550">Now, string beans had a lot of strings in the one they served. </sentence><sentence id="1551">You ate, and you had your mouth, basically you had the feel of those greens, whatever you got, and then the mouth full of these strings, which you couldn't chew, you couldn't digest, and you spit them out, or so [indecipherable].That was my concept of eating string beans. </sentence><sentence id="1552">So after the war, when it was served, I couldn't eat them for awhile. </sentence><sentence id="1553">Because they also, still in 40's, they still had some strings, not as much string or so. </sentence><sentence id="1554">So that was the kind of food, was not very wholesome, but it kept me going. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1569">Q: Were you hungry? </sentence><sentence id="1570">Do you remember being -- feeling hungry? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1573">A: I don't recall feeling hungry, but was pretty standardized meal, no, you know, special features. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1575">Q: Right. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1577">A: Pretty routine, but you went -- that was, again, became the norm, and you -- you took what you got and you went on line in order to get your food, that was -- you came every day, you ate this, and -- </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1579">Q: Right. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1581">A: -- your rations were adequate enough to keep going. </sentence><sentence id="1582">I wasn't working, so I was kind of, you know, wandering around most of the day. </sentence><sentence id="1583">And -- but the -- the food item was an important part of the day. </sentence><sentence id="1584">And having protect your bowl and your ration coupon was an occupation, apparently. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1589">Q: Did your brother work? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1591">A: My brother did -- </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1593">Q: Was he old enough? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1595">A: -- he was old enough, he was put in some work activity, like messenger. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1597">Q: Really? </sentence><sentence id="1598">Uh-huh. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1601">A: He served as a messenger. </sentence><sentence id="1602">Deliver internal -- they had -- see, Terezin was organized as a functioning concentration camp with certain activities, with some semblances of normalcy, and the -- again, the Jewish council had to administer a law from the detail, not the [indecipherable] principles, and people were assigned work, and were assigned to do certain activities. </sentence><sentence id="1603">So my brother did work as a messenger, kept him busy, but I basically wandered around the camp. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1607">Q: Your sister, too? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1609">A: My sister a little less, I think also -- she also did. </sentence><sentence id="1610">My recollection is that, you know, I played soccer with a tin can, that was my toy, kick the tin can. </sentence><sentence id="1611">That was really my outdoor activity. </sentence><sentence id="1612">This woman, Malka Pollaczek -- Malka -- married [indecipherable] Pollaczek, Malka Weinmann was moved to administer a children's home in relatively nice quarters, in fact, was one very attractive building that they converted to a home for children, and she was the administrator for it. </sentence><sentence id="1613">And after she moved to that place, she found the means to bring me to that place as well if I wanted to, or -- or so. </sentence><sentence id="1614">Of course it was a little better condition, better food they served, lard as part a supplement of the food. </sentence><sentence id="1615">Where there was [indecipherable] only for children, as we were, loose children at the children's home. </sentence><sentence id="1616">And given that we ate kosher, we -- I remember we had a discussion, my brother, my sister and I, whether I should go to that home and -- because the attraction was eating lard. </sentence><sentence id="1617">And so first of all, I -- I di -- wasn't eager to separate anyhow, but that [indecipherable] she approached and she thinks it's good for me, I'll be better off, nicer physical environment and better food, that [indecipherable] my interest, so we consulted a rabbi, the rabbi said yes, go ahead, under the circumstances. </sentence><sentence id="1618">Go there and eat there, because you have a better chance of survival. </sentence><sentence id="1619">So in answer to your question, whether the food was ample, it really was a consideration for me to get better food, with my interest, or so. </sentence><sentence id="1620">So I moved to the children's home quarters, and -- but I did go visit my brothers. </sentence><sentence id="1621">That was further away from Hamborg caserne, so I had to cross over one -- a big courtyard to get from here to there, and I wandered during the day, whenever I felt like, or [indecipherable] it is. </sentence><sentence id="1622">So I had had more space than before, and I did wi -- as a functional walk, I didn't explore the town, or so. </sentence><sentence id="1623">So life moved on, and -- </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1639">Q: Can I ask you something? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1641">A: Sure. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1643">Q: Since you were religious -- </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1645">A: Yes. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1647">Q: -- and as a kid you understood that -- </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1649">A: Mm-hm. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1651">Q: Did it bother you to have the non-kosher food, I mean that it star -- </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1653">A: Yes, yes -- </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1655">Q: -- it both -- it bothered you when you were -- didn't -- </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1657">A: -- but yes [indecipherable] consideration -- we -- many people who were in these camps, although the food was not prepared under kosher auspices, ate what they could eat, which was not -- definitively not kosher like. </sentence><sentence id="1658">Pig meat if they had given it, or horsemeat, or this sort. </sentence><sentence id="1659">So -- and all I could do then, eat the horsemeat. </sentence><sentence id="1660">I mean, the soup may have had horsemeat content in there, but it's -- now a lard was definitively food from -- not to be eaten, and this we knew, I was raised that way, so it became a issue. </sentence><sentence id="1661">That's why I had to - - we had to debate it, or discuss it. </sentence><sentence id="1662">And I remember that discussion [indecipherable] no, of what should we do, and then we consulted the local rabbi over there, and [indecipherable] rabbis there who gave me a ruling that it's permissible, and I should go, and it's in my interest to do so. </sentence><sentence id="1663">So I knew enough about that as well, my brothers knew more -- my brother knew more, my sister knew more. </sentence><sentence id="1664">So it became a legitimate discussion issue, but -- </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1673">Q: Maybe I didn't ask the question in a way that was understandable. </sentence><sentence id="1674">I meant when you actually ate there. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1677">A: Oh. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1679">Q: Did that bother you, or did you say since they said it was okay -- </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1681">A: After awhile -- no, after awhile -- but no, after awhile it was okay, yes. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1683">Q: -- after it was okay -- it was okay. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1685">A: Yes, I don't think I had a great abhorrence. </sentence><sentence id="1686">And most probably kids don't really know what they're eating anyhow, once it's served. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1689">Q: Right. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1691">A: No, the issue was the underlying principle. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1693">Q: Yes. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1973">Q: Right, right. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="1975"> A -- or so. </sentence><sentence id="1976">We were a threesome, okay? </sentence><sentence id="1977">And related to each other. </sentence><sentence id="1978">One illustration, which in fact is under, quote, dispute amongst us, and both stories may well be correct, by the way, because what we each remember is something different. </sentence><sentence id="1979">For -- my recollection of the story is that for Passover, for Pessach, for the Seder time, we knew that Passover is coming around, cause we're taught in the group, we -- Leo and I --that's -- I recall, my brother confirms that after I recall it, saved our potato rations, and we ground it up somehow, and gave it to her to make matzoh. </sentence><sentence id="1980">She does not recall that. </sentence><sentence id="1981">She recalls something different, that Leo and I saved our potato rations and made a birthday cake for her. </sentence><sentence id="1982">And I say both may well be right. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1991">Q: Right. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1993">A: Okay, we don't know. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="1997"> A Or two different times even, or so. </sentence><sentence id="1998">But that's the kind we -- and we dealt with each other as a li -- if you ask me as a illustration, well, we came -- she was -- kind of took care of the household things. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2001">Q: Leah did. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2011">Q: Isee. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2013">A: -- common name, mean, as a family, people know Lily. </sentence><sentence id="2014">But so we had ongoing, you know, relationships, and contact. </sentence><sentence id="2015">And most probably played whatever children play. </sentence><sentence id="2016">But she again had her tasks, and my brother had his tasks, and I was separated from them. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2021">Q: Mm-hm. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2033">A: The mere fact that I gravitated to them -- </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2035">Q: Towards them. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2037">A: -- yes, obviously is the case, that I felt that was the know, -- I belonged with them -- </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2039">Q: Right. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2041">A: -- and they could answer my questions, or deal with me, or whatever concerns I may have had, don't recall the individual point, but I do recall walking regularly from the children's home, which is separate building, to the caserne, and looking for them, and getting -- moving with them. </sentence><sentence id="2042">So where that was, know, a stabilizing feature for me, or not, in the likely, yes. </sentence><sentence id="2043">But as a child I certainly don't recall that I was looking for, you know, a place where I had to be safe, and only with them or anybody else. </sentence><sentence id="2044">Somehow I managed to roam the streets, keep busy, the day passes, get my food, and do my things what I had to do, and keep out of trouble, whatever that meant, and function. </sentence><sentence id="2045">That was my -- that was my daily routine. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2052">Q: Right. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2054">A: And I did that day by day, with some guidance, with some supervision. </sentence><sentence id="2055">But I don't think it's as structured, as organized as people would like to see in retrospect -- </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2058">Q: Right. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2060">A: -- that it was all orchestrated. </sentence><sentence id="2061">That's how it worked out. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2064">Q: Now, how were your clothes washed, if they were washed? </sentence><sentence id="2065">Do you -- do you know? </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2072">A: Must -- things must have torn. </sentence><sentence id="2073">Again, the whole clothing for all of us -- </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2076">Q: Yeah. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2078">A: -- is not clear. </sentence><sentence id="2079">I say -- I may have been the beneficiary again of my brothers, but how my brother kept clothing, how I got it, he doesn't know either. </sentence><sentence id="2080">But it happened. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2084">Q: Right. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2086">A: And they -- they were washed, and the total clothing collection, which was probably very meager, and I don't recall what I wore, I don't recall the colors or patterns, or of this sort. </sentence><sentence id="2087">Left no impression that I didn't have or did have. </sentence><sentence id="2088">I wa -- I was taken care of because I was dressed. </sentence><sentence id="2089">I wasn't walking around naked, or no -- barefoot. </sentence><sentence id="2090">And again, Malka Weinmann may well have supervised that part for me too. </sentence><sentence id="2091">So, in broad sense, my needs were taken care of. </sentence><sentence id="2092">As know, to survive to function. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2100">Q: Did you wash, did you take baths? </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2132">Q: And bathrooms? </sentence><sentence id="2133">Were there latrines? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2136">A: There were latrines, and public long -- long line bathrooms or so. </sentence><sentence id="2137">Again, all these things don't leave any impression on me, because it became routine. </sentence><sentence id="2138">Whatever facilities were there, I made use of. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2142">Q: You just [indecipherable] </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2144">A: Right. </sentence><sentence id="2145">Whether they were foul compared to what could have been, obviously. </sentence><sentence id="2146">But pose -- mean -- remember, for a little child in "44, the last time I had normal bathroom facilities, was go back in end of "42, beginning of 43, it's a long time. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2639">Q: Did anything change radically in -- in those few months before the liberation? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2641">A: Well yes, there was much more movement of trains, and so much more activity. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2643">Q: You mean in and out? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2645">A: In and out, yeah, right. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2647">Q: Uh-huh. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2649">A: And towards the end of the war -- and I lose -- I'd -- nobody -- I mean, I still didn't know the calendar date, whether was mar -- February, March, to me it was the winter, who knows, but I don't associate with particular months or dates. </sentence><sentence id="2650">But towards the end, since I hung around that fence at the -- near th -- near the railroad, watching the railroad tracks on one side, and the movement of activity on the other side, there were ki -- more and more people were standing around, and they were kind of coming instant war reporting commentators, because by the sound of where certain cannons went off, or airplanes were flying, they were able to tell, or the -- they thought they could tell whether it's the allied forces or whether they were the Germans. </sentence><sentence id="2651">And as a standee next to that fence, I was kind of coming -- hearing about, know, the forces against the Nazis are coming closer to here. </sentence><sentence id="2652">And that came -- gave momentum as the days increased, whether -- was -- must have been April I assume, or so, but I can tell. </sentence><sentence id="2653">Also we saw German trucks moving out different kind of German soldiers, w-we had [indecipherable] with the German soldiers, but there was more movement of people [indecipherable] going and -- and kind of what you found out after that they were regrouping and escaping. </sentence><sentence id="2654">And more people were hanging around that fence rather than working, wherever they was doing. </sentence><sentence id="2655">So there was a very different atmosphere towards the end of the war than before. </sentence><sentence id="2656">That was the most noticeable part, and this -- listening to these comments of -- they're coming, they're not, they're further away, closer by, and judging of a sort, I got a sense that -- wh -- since I then knew right -- it was a war, everything else, that this war is now reaching a different stage. </sentence><sentence id="2657">So that was very much in the atmosphere, in the air, and the conversation, and I was there listening -- </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2668">Q: Right. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2670">A: -- and absorbing, and most probably even parroting what was happening. </sentence><sentence id="2671">Different kinds of transports came the end, I think the Danes and the Hungarians came pretty late in the game. </sentence><sentence id="2672">And -- kind of -- so new people, you never heard -- you -- heard before. </sentence><sentence id="2673">The Danes came very late. </sentence><sentence id="2674">So new languages, but the -- and they were different appearance, too. </sentence><sentence id="2675">Now, turns out that Theresienstadt also got a whole group of people from the death marches, were -- ended up in Theresienstadt, but they never ended up to our place, they ended up in -- that's why people ask me about, do you ever meet those people, no. </sentence><sentence id="2676">Matter of fact, I know now some people who says they were in Theresienstadt at liberation. </sentence><sentence id="2677">And their description of what they saw was very different than what I lived. </sentence><sentence id="2678">But they lived in the small compound, away from where we were anyhow -- not that -- not [indecipherable] I've seen everybody, but I would have [indecipherable] I seen coming in, I would have seen very different type of person coming in, straggling in, decimated people. </sentence><sentence id="2679">We didn't see those people, although we were liberated the same day -- </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2690">Q: Same day. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2692">A: -- or so. </sentence><sentence id="2693">So anyway, the momentum that's -- the scene was changing, the war scene was changing was evident, and was part of the discussion. </sentence><sentence id="2694">And that I do recall being there, participating, absorbing. </sentence><sentence id="2695">On again, on a daily, incremental basis. </sentence><sentence id="2696">By the end of it, you know what was happening. </sentence><sentence id="2697">And I recall the final days or so where the troops of the German Nazis were leaving, and for good luck threw hand grenades over the fence for us, for now a gift to us, who ducked and moved on. </sentence><sentence id="2698">But that's already before we got it, that's a good sign, because they're good-bye, and good riddance. </sentence><sentence id="2699">So that was the approach towards the end of the war which changed the mood. </sentence><sentence id="2700">I think a lot of people -- and again I capture that indirectly being -- being there. </sentence><sentence id="2701">Right, I know exactly the details of what was happening. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2712">Q: I -- I just -- as you were talking I realized that I didn't -- I didn't ask you when did you realize there was a war going on? </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2730">Q: And -- </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2732">A: But part of it see, as I grew older and stood in that fence, that fence was a -- a part of my activity. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2734">Q: Right. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2736">A: Right? </sentence><sentence id="2737">And that's y-you hear people talking. </sentence><sentence id="2738">You overhear, so at -- at 44, when I was eight plus, I was kind of understanding a little bit more about war, sides, Nazis, Germany, others. </sentence><sentence id="2739">People in -- when they lined up, and they had different -- [indecipherable] I overheard conversations, but I was part of it, eventually starts some [indecipherable] so I understood there was a war, and the Jews were targets and victims, because obviously we were -- most of them were Jews, okay? </sentence><sentence id="2740">And I hung around s -- the synagogues, so -- </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2746">Q: You hear a lot. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2748">A: You hear -- hear this kind of s-story. </sentence><sentence id="2749">Whether I knew all the sophisticated details -- </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2752">Q: Right. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2754">A: -- or not -- that's irrelevant, but I knew there was a war, and I knew things were now suddenly being changed. </sentence><sentence id="2755">One side was losing, one side is gaining. </sentence><sentence id="2756">What it meant being, you know, who da -- who decides where -- obviously I was not fully in command of that, whether it was allied troops, or even the names of it, but that -- but there was a -- the Nazis, or the Germans, basically, versus other people, and that there's a battle going on, and you know, you heard these reports about the airplanes flying, and sounds of bangs and booms, and people interpreting all of that, I -- I started ab-absorbing that, over time. </sentence><sentence id="2757">It wasn't a one day event either, remember -- </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2762">Q: Right. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2764">A: -- it was several weeks of time. </sentence><sentence id="2765">And I -- again, the fact there were more people at the fence than before, I didn't know why, but it was a changed feature a-as well. </sentence><sentence id="2766">So that's how I kind of participated in the approach of liberation. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2770">Q: When you started learning more, realizing that there's a war, and hearing the guns, and somebody saying that the Nazis are doing things to the Jews -- wh -- however you heard it, did you start getting afraid then, or -- </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2772">A: No, it came in a good time, because it was th -- </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2774">Q: Because it was at the end? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2776">A: It was the end, and people are saying we're winning, or you know, we're going to be freed. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2778">Q: I see. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2780">A: So -- </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2782">Q: So no -- no time for fear. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2784">A: Well, not no time for fear, just not -- was again, was n-not the highlight of what I was kind of taking in. </sentence><sentence id="2785">I was taking in about some war, and one side is going to lose, and these guys are going to get it, and they're leaving, walking away -- way -- when people saw these trucks, or whatever it was, with [indecipherable] German soldiers running, the commentary was they're surrendering, they're escaping, they're doing something. </sentence><sentence id="2786">Well, then you sense that these people, the bad people are going out of your life, you know? </sentence><sentence id="2787">It was not that dif -- kind of fear more than had it occurred in "43, or "44, when it was the [indecipherable] </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2792">Q: Now, is there a period of time between when the Germans leave, and the Russians come, when it's just all of you inmates in Terezin? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2794">A: There was a short period, but again, only -- </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2796">Q: Not in -- </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2798">A: Not -- not -- again, it wasn't identified to me as a new period of, know, freedom or so. </sentence><sentence id="2799">I only sensed it by the number of people at that fence. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2802">Q: Isee. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2804">A: That was growing, growing, more people were there. </sentence><sentence id="2805">People hanging around. </sentence><sentence id="2806">And you hear this [indecipherable] you know, we being -- going to be freed. </sentence><sentence id="2807">You understood what was happening, that end was coming. </sentence><sentence id="2808">And then, see these mass, you know, departures, it also was consistent. </sentence><sentence id="2809">So now the people -- question of when will [indecipherable] people most probably listen to some kind of radio or other features, then they -- that's -- word spread amongst each other. </sentence><sentence id="2810">I was obviously not party to that. </sentence><sentence id="2811">And -- but it sounded more real that what other people were talking about, and I kind of integrated that into my absorption, whatever I was thinking. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2820">Q: Right. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2822">A: You have to re-recollect that when I child hears things, it is not all as logical as what's being presented, or as totally comprehensible. </sentence><sentence id="2823">But they ab -- do absorb a change of tone, a change of discussion topics, and that's what I was capturing. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2836">A: As far as I'm aware, the same. </sentence><sentence id="2837">Not aware of any change. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2840">Q: Any change in that way. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2842">A: No, no. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2844">Q: Do you remember the Russians when they came? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2846">A: Oh yes. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2848">Q: What was it like? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2850">A: First of all, they came and obviously jubilant, you know. </sentence><sentence id="2851">Was a -- and the people themselves were kind of very excited and they handed out ci-cigarettes to people, and chocolates to people, I think to us, to kids, and in that respect they were very, quote, kind, and a breath of fresh air. </sentence><sentence id="2852">Right? </sentence><sentence id="2853">Soldiers who were friendly rather than soldiers who were guarding people who -- and people embraced them, and touched them, it was a different - - you saw that some whatever it was, new -- liberators, but that's what -- that's what they left the impression. </sentence><sentence id="2854">In that respect they were most pr -- most probably very good. </sentence><sentence id="2855">I did know, and I can see that image too, of rampaging through the barrack to the caserne of the -- you know, where people were crowded, and ripping off watches of women. </sentence><sentence id="2856">I saw that scene, apparently they also pillaged and raped, which I obviously did not see -- or not obviously, but I just didn't see, or didn't know what's happening. </sentence><sentence id="2857">That's later, but the grabbing off watches of people who somehow managed to retain them during the war period is -- was very kind of shocking to me. </sentence><sentence id="2858">But they di -- transformed very quickly, the role of the being behind the fences versus being free, and more movement. </sentence><sentence id="2859">I think the fence came down, or -- but we still had a fence, I remember was the -- suddenly you saw the German soldiers, whoever the -- whoever was in charge of the control mechanism in Theresienstadt were now being required to go with wheelbarrows and picking things up, and fixing things up, and breaking things down, and they were being beaten by some former German people who ta -- trying to put -- change their roles in order to get more privileges, and that was going on and people were cheering on and pointing out, you know, hit them harder, etcetera, this sort, get even with them. </sentence><sentence id="2860">So the -- again, that was a very different atmosphere what you saw before. </sentence><sentence id="2861">So that's the Russians kind of influence, a very quick turnaround of the ones who were doing the Nazi work before, and now they became -- and we [indecipherable] was a little surprising to see these other naz -- Nazis, or Germans, and Germans beating up their compatriots, or so, and with full vigor, I mean, just reversed direction. </sentence><sentence id="2862">But that -- the transition from being occupied versus being liberated, and the change took [indecipherable] very, very quickly. </sentence><sentence id="2863">And very noticeable, and to -- very quick. </sentence><sentence id="2864">Now in May, the eighth, ninth, we were liberated, and by June already we were out. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2880">Q: Really? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2882">A: Now, a lot of people didn't make it to later. </sentence><sentence id="2883">There was a typhus epidemic, and again is a quarantine, but the most typhus epidemic took place in that other quarter where these other people who were in the death marches who made it, barely made it, ended up. </sentence><sentence id="2884">I don't know whether in our particular compound, they did it by caserne to caserne, I don't know what -- we were allowed to leave in June. </sentence><sentence id="2885">Again, some people say you couldn't have left in June because there was a general quarantine. </sentence><sentence id="2886">Well, I know I left in June, you know, I mean -- </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2892">Q: Right. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2894">A: I don't care what the historian books say on that. </sentence><sentence id="2895">People verif -- generalize from the generic fact, and apply it to everybody. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2898">Q: Right. </sentence><sentence id="2899">So where did you all go? </sentence><sentence id="2900">And -- and who -- was it Leo who made the decision </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2904">A: No, no, no, no, no, no, what happened was after the war, there was a very st -- quick effort to identify, locate people who survived. </sentence><sentence id="2905">And whoever did this, might -- the Russians, or others, made a list of the survivors in tha -- in Theresienstadt, and people from different localities contacted the authorities somewhere, that was designated, maybe Red Cross [indecipherable] I don't recall, obviously. </sentence><sentence id="2906">And we had relatives who survived the war in Holland, who were in hiding during the war, in the broadest [indecipherable] were kind of somewhat distant, but in the context of the time they very close to my family, partly they're -- they were raised in the old country, very close in the same courtyard, effectively, so they were like very close cousins, brother, sister type relationship. </sentence><sentence id="2907">Anyhow, that relative knew that, you know, who was -- who were the Dutch relatives they had, and went around finding out in Westerbork most probably, with the Dutch authorities, where are the S-Sigmann family, my parents, my brothers and my sister and myself. </sentence><sentence id="2908">And eventually they found out that the only ones who are surviving from their records was us three. </sentence><sentence id="2909">And they got in touch with the Theresienstadt people, who went and got in touch with Malka Weinmann, and through us, and saying, oh, yo- you will come back, you have a place to go -- the people who were released from these camps had a -- a place to go. </sentence><sentence id="2910">We had a place to go because somebody was claiming us. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2918">Q: Right. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2920">A: Had we not had that we would have been again, rerouted somewhere to a displaced persons camp, or hang around later in Theresienstadt, I don't know what would have happened. </sentence><sentence id="2921">But since we had a relative who was putting a claim us and offered t-to come to them, we went with Malka Pollaczek, who also had a brother, and Alicia Farber, whose parents survived. </sentence><sentence id="2922">So she was reunited with her parents, so her parents were claiming her. </sentence><sentence id="2923">So we all went back on the train from Terezin to the American section, you know, Czechoslovakia kind of was split into different regions whoever liberated them. </sentence><sentence id="2924">One half was the Russians, one half was the Americans or the French, I think. </sentence><sentence id="2925">And we took a train from Terezin to Pilsen, and maybe took a plane from Pilsen to Amsterdam, I think a French plane, was probably a army transport plane. </sentence><sentence id="2926">And we stayed a few days or so with Malka Weinmann, because we were close to her. </sentence><sentence id="2927">And you ask what attachment, that was probably -- I -- we sensed that. </sentence><sentence id="2928">And well, a very different life suddenly, you know, plates, and tables, and food that we never had eaten before. </sentence><sentence id="2929">White bread was served, we thought it was cake, we refused to eat it as bread. </sentence><sentence id="2930">I had a tin can of anchovy paste, I don't know whether you know what anchovy paste is, it was in a tin -- a tin little thing like toothpaste, imported [indecipherable] foods never crossed my lips. </sentence><sentence id="2931">Spent a few days over there, till they discussed with -- how to get us to these relatives, the Bergers, who themselves spent the war years separated from their children, daughter and son. </sentence><sentence id="2932">The daughter, son and parents were in three different locations, and they were -- </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2947">Q: And they all survived? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2949">A: They survived, yes, they survived. </sentence><sentence id="2950">And then I rejoined living with them after, for one year or so, till other family members elsewhere in the world started looking for the Sigmann family, and locating us, and discovered we were the only survivors. </sentence><sentence id="2951">So we spent a year with the Bergers, and were a year in -- from June to July, or June of ni -- June to June, from "45 to "46, and being -- lived in Amsterdam. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2955">Q: And how was that for you? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2957">A: Again, they were very caring, and very warm, and very attentive to us, but they themselves had to reconstruct their lives, because they had a major interruption in their life. </sentence><sentence id="2958">So we took in the scene of reconstituting life, but was really more normal from what people were used to. </sentence><sentence id="2959">I mean, s-sitting at a table with the family rather than in a compound. </sentence><sentence id="2960">Cooking, baking, washing. </sentence><sentence id="2961">You know, th-this family, the Bergers, they were hidden by some nurses, single women who had worked in Indonesia before, and | think they lived at Amsterdam. </sentence><sentence id="2962">And they lived behind a partition wall for several years. </sentence><sentence id="2963">Couldn't go out in daytime. </sentence><sentence id="2964">Didn't know where their daughter and son was -- were. </sentence><sentence id="2965">Their daughter was too old to be hidden, but too young to be hidden, too, so she had had a quote, an Aryan appearance, so she worked for somebody in the outskirts of Amsterdam as a open house help, au pair. </sentence><sentence id="2966">It's -- her name is Miriam. </sentence><sentence id="2967">And she was there, and -- very interesting story is that we -- we -- once we came back, and told us their -- their tale, and each one has his own tale of escape and saving. </sentence><sentence id="2968">But this girl, Miriam, mus-must have been around 16 maybe, by the end of the war, was in -- publicly hidden, and the people were very devout, Calvinist, or [indecipherable] most people did not e -- travel -- or com -- can't do anything on a Sunday. </sentence><sentence id="2969">That when they later on came to visit us, visit us on Saturday in fact, apologized that we came on the sebbe -- Sabbath. </sentence><sentence id="2970">But they were very devout, they were very close to the family, but they were very good people, too. </sentence><sentence id="2971">They -- in order to -- they kept the fact that she was Jewish in hiding, or public hiding from their own children, so they couldn't say very much, but they read the scriptures, and how the very devout Christians, and they tried to read the Scriptures associated with the holidays, to keep this girl informed about purink and how do the calendar, or what have you, but sh -- Passover, and Easter, often overlap, so they read this -- the -- the portion she told us about, it was kind of -- and they're very nice people. </sentence><sentence id="2972">We met them after they came, they were very close. </sentence><sentence id="2973">But kind of seeing how people were coming out of the war, and what they went through, was both interesting, and it was very common. </sentence><sentence id="2974">Their son, who was a tall fellow, was in hiding in a little attic, in a little town up in -- in the country, again didn't see daylight, public daylight for several years. </sentence><sentence id="2975">And he was an artist and he made wooden pins for the underground, emblems. </sentence><sentence id="2976">I believe that's how he spent his time. </sentence><sentence id="2977">And so the reconstituting of life in Amsterdam was -- we were part of it, but we [indecipherable] we were visiting. </sentence><sentence id="2978">These Bergers are interesting people because they used to have a restaurant, kosher restaurant in Amsterdam, a very elegant one apparently, before the war, and they had pretty elegant dishes, and cutlery, but after the war their apartment was gone, all their belongings were gone. </sentence><sentence id="2979">They couldn't -- they knew who they gave it, they couldn't get it back, even because they survived. </sentence><sentence id="2980">People denied, apparently that they had received anything. </sentence><sentence id="2981">They had to start from scratch, in very small quarters, we lived in very, very small quarters. </sentence><sentence id="2982">There was no shower or bathtub in the house. </sentence><sentence id="2983">We had a little metal bathtub that we -- I was a little boy, I was able to use, other people used most probably too, and we went to public baths. </sentence><sentence id="2984">This was the life. </sentence><sentence id="2985">But for them it was a -- happy to survive, but was a big setback of their lifestyle to what they had to live through, and remember that. </sentence><sentence id="2986">Of course they would -- had the restaurant before, they're still -- so they're getting the old customers coming back, come and eat. </sentence><sentence id="2987">Some widowers, or single people, lost their family. </sentence><sentence id="2988">So they used to come in the evening and se -- were served things. </sentence><sentence id="2989">Whether they paid or not, I don't know. </sentence><sentence id="2990">But they kind of resumed the sort of role [indecipherable] that was their past life, and lot of war stories were coming around the table. </sentence><sentence id="2991">You know, sort of hearing these things, the -- we were kind of a special case, now we had one experience, people had very different experience. </sentence><sentence id="2992">The hiding, some survived, but only, you know, one person. </sentence><sentence id="2993">And some people were traumatized, and completely troubled. </sentence><sentence id="2994">And I remember one man, he used to come to visit [indecipherable] Berger to talk or his despair -- despair. </sentence><sentence id="2995">And I remember he was a very sad person, and he really -- when that man came in in the evening, we would kind of shoot out of the room, the small quarters. </sentence><sentence id="2996">And a month or so later we learned he committed suicide. </sentence><sentence id="2997">So those kind of things, you k -- that was the ac -- different things were going on in Amsterdam, it was -- it was not a normal return to life, again. </sentence><sentence id="2998">These people, the Bergers, at this restaurant, also kept kosher, obviously. </sentence><sentence id="2999">And basically ate dairy, because they didn't have any dishes and cutlery for meat, and moreover, meat was very scarce anyhow, because that time the only meat you could get, kosher meat was in cans, preserved. </sentence><sentence id="3000">But because of their hospitality reputation, and restaurant reputation, the soldiers in the Jewish brigade, who passed through Holland from Canada, or from England, stopped in ou -- those who kept kosher, stayed in their house, or ate in their house. </sentence><sentence id="3001">But they brought their rations over to the Bergers, so the only time we ate meat was to eat those rations the first time, after many years eating meat. </sentence><sentence id="3002">But didn't have enough cutlery, or -- and no plates. </sentence><sentence id="3003">So the cans were warmed up on the stove, and we passed around the can and this cutlery in order to eat. </sentence><sentence id="3004">That's the kind of -- for them it must have been a terribly painful contrast after being a elegant restaurant with all the trappings of a restaurant, having to serve their own in this way. </sentence><sentence id="3005">But they made -- they made the transition, we'll open up another restaurant a number of years. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3106">A: But after the war, when you hear other stories of -- people's life stories of losing a husband, a wife, children, then I realized that -- where I fit it in, that I also lost parents. </sentence><sentence id="3107">I was part of the group of people who went through the war, some went through in hiding, be -- people in groups, some were in hiding. </sentence><sentence id="3108">Some were in this camp, some were in that camp, some were in convents. </sentence><sentence id="3109">And I was in two camps, and some people lost -- or didn't lose, and I lost. </sentence><sentence id="3110">So eventually I fit it in to my category, and -- but that was a pretty dynamic -- I use the word dynamic selectively, seeing people were really -- had to re- establish themself, that some people could make it. </sentence><sentence id="3111">And also it was very much evident people want get out of Europe as -- or Holland as fast as possible, many people, they -- the first opportunity to get out, and especially the children. </sentence><sentence id="3112">They sh -- </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3161">A: Right, but for different reasons than what was occurring. </sentence><sentence id="3162">Th -- when I say people who were eager to leave were the older people [indecipherable] not sure, take these two children of my relatives, Bergers, Miriam and Manfred, they got out as fast, but they wanted to leave right away, I mean they were -- imagine not being with their parents for several years, and May, June they see them, and they wanted to get out, on -- go to Palestine. </sentence><sentence id="3163">The parents did not -- were not encouraging that right away, but reluctantly they yielded, so right after the high holidays, they left on the illegal transport, where they were put in Cypress, they ga -- had a long journey. </sentence><sentence id="3164">But -- so that age bracket and above, there was a much greater personal decision to leave Europe, or leave Netherlands. </sentence><sentence id="3165">They both went to Palestine. </sentence><sentence id="3166">One of them there right now. </sentence><sentence id="3167">The tragedy was that the brother ended up in Palestine. </sentence><sentence id="3168">When the state was established, he was in the army, and he was killed by a convoy in the protection of Jerusalem during the War of Independence. </sentence><sentence id="3169">Was just -- had just become engaged to a beautiful Yemenite girl, and so now that's -- the family had to absorb that loss after being spared the other hurdles of the war, ended up a victim in Palestine - Israel. </sentence><sentence id="3170">Parents not fully revere -- recovered from that wound, whereas the war wounds were healing, that wound kind of was pretty difficult for them to deal with. </sentence><sentence id="3171">But other people also were leaving. </sentence><sentence id="3172">And in contrast to the pre-war, which I don't recall too much, Westerbork or Terezin, there I did have friends. </sentence><sentence id="3173">I visited homes like in more normal circumstances. </sentence><sentence id="3174">But again, it was somewhat temporary, because people I dealt with, they moved out to other countries suddenly, okay? </sentence><sentence id="3175">And myself also left. </sentence><sentence id="3176">But it was a different -- but I do know the names of people who were there. </sentence><sentence id="3177">We joined the youth organization, I think it was the precursor of Bnei Akiva. </sentence><sentence id="3178">My brother was older, he was allowed to join, I tagged along with him, and given that was much choice, not too many other children around, they let me come. </sentence><sentence id="3179">And we went to hikes and activities. </sentence><sentence id="3180">So we had a little more normal type of event, of youth organizations that obviously you didn't have before, and some of the names of the people from that period I still know by name. </sentence><sentence id="3181">And I've discovered recently one is in t -- married, you know, with families in Toronto, and one lives in Israel, and one here, one no longer lives. </sentence><sentence id="3182">But that kind of life became more normalized. </sentence><sentence id="3183">I went to school in Amsterdam, Jewish school, and es -- had special studies, Jewish studies in either synagogue, with people. </sentence><sentence id="3184">So it kind of -- but even those teachers started leaving. </sentence><sentence id="3185">We had the teacher, and the middle of the year they went to England. </sentence><sentence id="3186">Of course, it was not a -- people weren't on the firm ground, or so. </sentence><sentence id="3187">So we -- I -- when I left, it was not unnatural for me to leave, because that's what other people were doing for all kinds of reasons, which I may not have been fully aware. </sentence><sentence id="3188">But it was not my decision, of sorts, because my other relatives, who were closer in relative ranking that the Bergers, my father's brother lived the United States, and they were also related to the Bergers so they were in touch, wanted us to join him. </sentence><sentence id="3189">And my mother's sister in Zurich wanted us to join them. </sentence><sentence id="3190">So we were wanted, but we were kind of being pulled in two different directions. </sentence><sentence id="3191">And the decision was that the two boys would go to New York, and the girl would go to Zurich. </sentence><sentence id="3192">Whether that's wi -- wise decision or not is not for me to say. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3230">Q: Ah, I see. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3232">A: I mean, both had a loo -- a genuine eagerness to want to absorb us, and you know, take care of us as children without parents. </sentence><sentence id="3233">And they decided, not to divide the spoils, but they thought that boys would be better off in education, particularly Jewish education in United States, and the girl would fit in better in Switzerland. </sentence><sentence id="3234">My aunt had a -- uncle had a dress store, an elegant dress store, and she could perhaps work her way into that. </sentence><sentence id="3235">But anyway, we were split, which my sister to this day finds horrendous. </sentence><sentence id="3236">And she found it very surprising that it was proposed and implemented. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3244">A: It was difficult, yes, yes. </sentence><sentence id="3245">And especially those were days where na -- ba -- people didn't have telephone conversations, you know, you wrote to each other, kept in touch that way. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3272">Q: [indecipherable] but this was not someone close that you -- </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3274">A: We hadn't dealt with them in years, obviously. </sentence><sentence id="3275">And the United States family, all I knew was my father's brother, my uncle. </sentence><sentence id="3276">But I had never seen him. </sentence><sentence id="3277">I don't think my brother saw him either. </sentence><sentence id="3278">And they were again, far away, the United States was far, far away. </sentence><sentence id="3279">So that was a new change in our life status of being separated, moved away from Holland, and a new stage of our life had to begin. </sentence><sentence id="3280">But again, the intentions certainly were well- intentioned. </sentence><sentence id="3281">Whether is was appropriate under the circumstances, but that set the course for our lives, and with the ca -- impl -- consequence. </sentence><sentence id="3282">My sister married somebody from Switzerland, we ended up in United States. </sentence><sentence id="3283">And were raised over there by my uncle and aunt, who were very generous to absorb two more children in a household of six children. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3350">A: It still was large, I mean, and totally appreciative obviously that I had a home. </sentence><sentence id="3351">Because otherwise, you know, that's a big problem after the war, people were homeless. </sentence><sentence id="3352">Some people had, you know, lost their parents, and their siblings, or what have you, and nowhere to go. </sentence><sentence id="3353">And their immediate, or s -- distant relatives were also killed during the war, so I was relatively better off. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3395">Q: Course. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3397">A: Or so -- so, y -- generally even in Holland after the war, there were all kinds of new ec -- experiences or so, about food, or otherwise. </sentence><sentence id="3398">I remember with my bo -- my uncle from Switzerland, who took us out and treated us to vanilla ice cream. </sentence><sentence id="3399">And the pungency of that vanilla taste is still in my mouth, I mean, I just -- it's very different today, doesn't have the same intensity of taste, but it was a very strong taste, a flavor which I never had, or don't recall, I may have had it when I was five or six. </sentence><sentence id="3400">But from five to six to nine was a long time. </sentence><sentence id="3401">So those things kind of, you know, were all sensations that we experienced. </sentence><sentence id="3402">There was an ho -- another interesting thing was I was saying of -- people were kind of coming out of the woodwork in some sense. </sentence><sentence id="3403">The people who were in hiding got out right away, from the camps. </sentence><sentence id="3404">Those who had a place to go had right away -- some straggled in, depends where they were kept, in which camp. </sentence><sentence id="3405">So it was an ongoing process of people coming, and eventually people leaving. </sentence><sentence id="3406">Was a lot of young people, particularly children had to be taken out of convents or hiding places, and was a big battle sometimes, you know, older sisters f -- survived. [ </sentence><sentence id="3407">indecipherable] little sister was in the convent in Belgium, went through the effort, identified everything [indecipherable] and that little girl refused to come. </sentence><sentence id="3408">Again, in this Berger household we had a lot of traffic, but people -- there was a home, people came across. </sentence><sentence id="3409">So I in some sense absorbed more of that than I would have otherwise. </sentence><sentence id="3410">And I remember those two sisters finally successful in getting out, this whole discussion of getting their little sister out, finally getting their sister out, and the sister rebellious, she wants to go back to the sisters in Belgium, rather than the sisters in Holland. </sentence><sentence id="3411">And I think eventually she had -- had -- had to yield it, they got -- bring her back. </sentence><sentence id="3412">You know, the chief rabbi of Israel, Rabbi Herzog went through country to country, also through Holland, trying to save those children, invoking his position in dealing with the clergy, and the church. </sentence><sentence id="3413">And had very great difficult time, I remember him there with his top hat, and making, you know, talking about his experiences. </sentence><sentence id="3414">That was an event. </sentence><sentence id="3415">So, it was -- th-the post-war reconstitution was very much an activity of the country, of the Jewish community. </sentence><sentence id="3416">And therefore was a lot of activity and movement, and was not a -- you know, a stable community, were never -- never really became stable, because Holland as you know, lost a very high proportion of it's Jewish population. </sentence><sentence id="3417">Underestimated the people talk about [indecipherable]. </sentence><sentence id="3418">The interesting little side story, my relative, my uncle -- I call him uncle, he was a Berger, had a brother in Palestine, who was a -- a shoe store. </sentence><sentence id="3419">And one day he sent a crate of Yaffa oranges to him. </sentence><sentence id="3420">And that was a communion celebration, they handed out these oranges as prizes to people, and everybody took those -- an orange for their entire family. </sentence><sentence id="3421">And there was the biggest gift they could ever dream of after going through the war, of getting something from Palestine, a Yaffa orange. </sentence><sentence id="3422">So, I remember we got one too, and it was something, you know, unique. </sentence><sentence id="3423">So a lot of feelings were going on in the country, which today people have much less -- they take a lot of things for granted. </sentence><sentence id="3424">Every -- every -- ev -- all these events became events rather than, you know, part of a routine life. </sentence><sentence id="3425">So it was, in some sense, quote, exciting. </sentence><sentence id="3426">Because things were really appearing, and I was -- as I was getting older, I was a -- absorbing these things much more than anything before [indecipherable] certainly I was a little boy, but already approaching 10 - 11, to move on there. </sentence><sentence id="3427">So carry back interesting memories of the year in Holland. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="4057">A: Well, it's -- definitely the war experience is engraved into me. </sentence><sentence id="4058">I mean, I know, I went through the war, I know I lost my parents and two brothers. </sentence><sentence id="4059">So I'm very sensitized to the Shoah and what happened, part because I lived through it, in my own way. </sentence><sentence id="4060">I was not as directly affected like some other people went through hell. </sentence><sentence id="4061">I did not have, you know, my -- any numbers carved into me. </sentence><sentence id="4062">And I was not beaten up physically, or so, but I certainly am a victim of not -- of having had a lost childhood. </sentence><sentence id="4063">I mean that never -- right? </sentence><sentence id="4064">I knew I was different, but [indecipherable] and the younger ages when I came United States, I knew I was not the same everybody else. </sentence><sentence id="4065">Other people had parents, other people had normal memories, I had no pictures of my childhood, I had very few concrete episodes, no family vacations, except for I went back, you know, to the beach story, but -- so I -- I know I was different, and I was at a young age is especially more sensitive. </sentence><sentence id="4066">Once you get married and have children, you join another category of life. </sentence><sentence id="4067">| was more with a similar group, but the issue where you come from, whether it was raised, or -- know, specifically, or underlying, people talk about experiences which I could never talk about. </sentence><sentence id="4068">Or show pictures, or something of this sort, so that respect it affected me, or so, over time I th -- I'm sure that my sensitivities about the world events or so, must have some roots in my experience as well. </sentence><sentence id="4069">I don't want to link everything who I am, I do -- I don't want to sou -- I never wanted to, I don't intend to psychoanalyze myself, of you know, my behavior or good deeds, or bad deeds, or good habits or bad habits are attributed to the war, and I don't feel that I have to glean who I am, or attribute who I am to the war experience. </sentence><sentence id="4070">I am who I am with that being part of me, but it's -- certainly it's a very central part of my memory of -- or so, though fortunately, since 1945, many other events have happened, I mean good events have happened, that they have receded, okay, proportionately of my life, I have the good life. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="4130">A: Not oddly, I think, just different circumstances. </sentence><sentence id="4131">And my uncle was much more tight lipped about family in general, or -- not to [indecipherable] re us. </sentence><sentence id="4132">In part I also think that he -- that's more speculation than fact, but I feel that maybe even fact, he I think felt somewhat guilty that he did not do more to get my parents out, whether it would be more encouraging or physical action. </sentence><sentence id="4133">He himself had come to the United States in "41 or so, so there were some years involved. </sentence><sentence id="4134">I have no idea -- I have no clue how much contact they had. </sentence><sentence id="4135">He told us [indecipherable] was very -- always a very -- my -- my father was the older brother, and he always told about his respect and, you know, esteem for him, only to talk to him as a younger brother. </sentence><sentence id="4136">But he never talked about details of background. </sentence><sentence id="4137">But he never talked about his own -- to his own children either, too much. </sentence><sentence id="4138">So when I speak to my cousins, his children are so now about -- because they also regret they never pumped him for information just in the family tree.

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="4155">Q: Right. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="4157">A: How they lived, how they celebrated, how they did things. </sentence><sentence id="4158">My brother knows a little bit more, my sister knows bits and pieces, I know very little. </sentence><sentence id="4159">That's certainly a blank compared to other children. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="4163">Q: Right, right. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="4165">A: Wa -- so again, that -- it's understandably I was a very little boy, right, so I don't recall where -- and my sister mentions to me that for my father's 40" birthday he got a electric shaver. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="4167">Q: And you wouldn't know, right. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="4169">A: I wouldn't know, right? </sentence><sentence id="4170">That was a big deal in Holland to get an electric shaver, because people used to use shaving paste -- </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="4177">Q: Let me ask you an odd -- something of an odd question. </sentence><sentence id="4178">When you mentioned the postcard, and your brother telling you of the postcard, something happened to you. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="4181">A: I choked up a little more, right? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="4183">Q: Yeah. </sentence><sentence id="4184">What is it, i-is that symbol of the loss for you, do you think, or s -- </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="4187">A: In part it's a symbol of the loss, obviously, but also is the content. </sentence><sentence id="4188">I mean, for parents to write a farewell note to parent -- to the children is not normal, and for a brother to end up saying [indecipherable] which means I will see you again, and never materialized, is a painful message to receive, but never follow through. </sentence><sentence id="4189">So more emotions may be evoked from that than describing that they went on a train, and they open up a -- a suitcase in the camp. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="4193">Q: Right, right. </sentence><sentence id="4194">Okay. </sentence><sentence id="4195">Is there anything else you'd like to mention that I have not asked? </sentence><sentence id="4196">I'm sure there's -- </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="4207">A: -- was -- meant for me, what I -- what little part I played as one individual, and -- well, in some sense our families are like mic-microcosm of one type of -- </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="4211">A: -- Holocaust story, you know. </sentence><sentence id="4212">And the implications of it all are serious, you know, let's talk about millions of people. </sentence><sentence id="4213">Here's a very, you know, quote, normal family that was split apart. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="4217">Q: Right. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="4219">A: To the extent that I have four children and a family and grandchildren, my two brothers would had equal families, and never experienced any personal fulfillment in this regard, and my parents never saw grandchildren, | did. </sentence><sentence id="4220">So all the human relationships, and all the human events, were kind of disrupted. </sentence><sentence id="4221">I had a disjointed childhood at best. </sentence><sentence id="4222">My brother had consequences of it, my sister are similar, you know, so this is just one family to, quote, just one family, and there's plenty of damage, and I repeat again, I did not [indecipherable] go through the personal horrors of people who go through Auschwitz, or ber -- Buchenwald, and tell horrible stories, you know, on a personal basis or so. </sentence><sentence id="4223">But that's just a kind of little composite story of one family and how it spreads, what happened to us, and how one takes it. </sentence></p></dialogue>
