<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="139">Q: Why was it so important? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="141">A: It was important because I wanted to be one of them, because I felt so persecuted as a Jew that I felt that - I just wanted - at that time, when I was a kid - don't forget, that that was at the time when I was nine, eight, ten, you know - I wanted to be one of them at that time. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="147">A: Actually, I felt it because I noticed that we had - in our town, there was a lot of religious Jews. </sentence><sentence id="148">Most of the Jewish people that lived in Wierzbnik were religious, and I always saw Polacks, throwing stones at them, talking to them in a way that it was ridiculing them, and so - I, personally, since I was just a child at the time, I didn't feel it, and being with the Polish girls, you know, associating with them, I didn't feel it, but I saw it on the outside, and that's why maybe I wanted to be one of them. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="151">Q: Did you yourself feel uncomfortable with the very Orthodox Jews? </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="152">A: To a point, because they - they couldn't speak Polish. </sentence><sentence id="153">I mean, they spoke Polish with an accent. </sentence><sentence id="154">They spoke mostly, among themselves, they spoke Yiddish, and being so very religious, they had a certain mannerism that distinguished them for the other people. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="158">They were dressed differently. </sentence><sentence id="159">They acted differently. </sentence><sentence id="160">They spoke differently. </sentence><sentence id="161">So, but I identified with them, but sometimes I felt a little bit uncomfortable with them. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="188">Q: Was that an ordinary thing? </sentence><sentence id="189">Why did that happen? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="192">A: No, because I was a good student and we had what they call Gymnasium, which was a high school in Starachowice, but it wasn't one of the best. </sentence><sentence id="193">In Radom, there was - there was one of the best girls" school, but it was almost impossible to get in for the Jews. </sentence><sentence id="194">At first, we had numerus klausus (ph), which meant one Jewish girl for 45 students in a class would be accepted, and then in the later years it was numerus nolus (ph), which means none of the Jewish girls could be accepted. </sentence><sentence id="195">So, I was lucky. </sentence><sentence id="196">You have to pass a competitive exam, and you had to really be very, very good to be accepted. </sentence><sentence id="197">So, my mother tried - she sent me there and I passed the exam, and at the end of the year, she found out that I was accepted. </sentence><sentence id="198">So, for her it was the biggest achievement that she could ever achieve at the time which - and I went to that school there and I lived on my own. </sentence><sentence id="199">Like, I had relatives, but my mother placed me in a - like she rented a room, with like there were kids there my age. </sentence><sentence id="200">So, she rented a room with a family, and that's where I stayed. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="210">Q: Did that scare you to go away? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="212">A: At first it did. </sentence><sentence id="213">As a matter of fact, I cried for a long time before I went there, and when I found myself there, I also felt a little bit strange, but soon I got used to it, and I got to know all the people my age and a year older or a year younger, because they were several schools in Radom. </sentence><sentence id="214">It was a big city with 100,000 people there. </sentence><sentence id="215">They had several different schools. </sentence><sentence id="216">They even had a Jewish high school, called Pzhiachu Wierze (ph), which meant  "friends of knowledge", if I were to translate it exactly. </sentence><sentence id="217">So, there were a lot of Jewish kids that were educated in Starachowice, Wierzbnik. </sentence><sentence id="218">The religious people didn't send the girls to high school because of the fact that they had to go to school on Shabbat. </sentence><sentence id="219">You know, because we had six days of school. </sentence><sentence id="220">So, the parents wouldn't let them do that. </sentence><sentence id="221">So, they had a lot of other schools that were connected with the religious movement. </sentence><sentence id="222">But in Radom, the parents were a little bit - I mean, it was a bigger city, and there was a lot of young people that were going to those different schools, and the schools were much better than in Wierzbnik. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="234">Q: Was it kind of exciting to be in a much larger city? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="236">A: Well, once I got to know the people my age, I felt very good there. </sentence><sentence id="237">As a matter of fact, until today, I have a lot of friends from Radom. </sentence><sentence id="238">And, as a matter of fact, my husband made a party for them all like at the cottage a year before he died. </sentence><sentence id="239">There was fifty of us. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="256">A: Yes, that's true. [ </sentence><sentence id="257">Laughs.] </sentence><sentence id="258">It was -talking about home, when he counted, he counted in German, because he was educated in German. </sentence><sentence id="259">I count - no matter what language I speak - if I have to count, I count in Polish. </sentence><sentence id="260">My husband, no matter what language he spoke, he would count in Yiddish. </sentence><sentence id="261">And since you are talking about languages.... </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="268">Q: How do you account for that? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="270">A: I think you - like I was used to speaking - we spoke Polish at home. </sentence><sentence id="271">So, I was used to speaking Polish all the time, and because I suppose that I got used to counting. </sentence><sentence id="272">I think it's very normal. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="276">Q: Did you write home a great deal? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="278">A: Well, I did write home. </sentence><sentence id="279">Every week my mother would send me home-baking and stuff like that, a parcel, and then, whoever would travel to Radom, she would send something for me. </sentence><sentence id="280">So, when this person came I wrote a letter to my parents. </sentence><sentence id="281">We didn't have a telephone at all. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="286">Q: Did you write to your sisters? </sentence><sentence id="287">Or does the one letter count? </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="288">A: One letter. </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="289">Q: Did they write to you? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="291">A: No. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="293">Q: No? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="295">A: No, because we were, you know, for every holy day, I went home. </sentence><sentence id="296">As a matter of fact, the month of September, since Radom was about sixty kilometers away from Wierzbnik, it was a two hour ride on the train because I had to change trains half way. </sentence><sentence id="297">So, at the beginning, I didn't want to go back to Radom because when I was at home it felt so good to be at home. </sentence><sentence id="298">So, the first month, I was traveling every day to Radom and back. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="303">Q: Every day? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="305">A: Every day to get home. </sentence><sentence id="306">But then, then later when the days became shorter, I stayed there. </sentence><sentence id="307">But I had a very, very good life in Radom because, as a say, I had lots of friends there. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1036">Q: deg33 or 737? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1038">A: No, he lost his - the government job in "33, and then he started working in the same capacity for private enterprise, which wasn't the same, and the reason why they let him go because they didn't want to pay his pension, or because he was Jewish, they didn't want to pay his pension. </sentence><sentence id="1039">So, my parents went - they struggled but we lived normally like any other, because the Jewish people - the Jewish population, especially the religious ones, they were tradesmen, small businessmen. </sentence><sentence id="1040">They were all poor, like, they weren't rich people. </sentence><sentence id="1041">So, although we were quite - we lived quite modestly, we weren't any different than any other people. </sentence><sentence id="1042">I remember, my mother learned a trade but it was, you know, I don't really remember exactly what - my father was also selling something. </sentence><sentence id="1043">I couldn't tell you really exactly what they did during the war. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1110">A: But, you know, I cried my eyes out, and, again, the people that I knew in Radom, the Jewish people that were sending their kids to high school there because it was expensive, well-to-do people. </sentence><sentence id="1111">So, at that time, it wasn't nice to be - you had to be rich. </sentence><sentence id="1112">You wouldn't admit that you weren't. </sentence><sentence id="1113">So, let's say my mother was sending me home baking on Friday. </sentence><sentence id="1114">Every Friday she would send me a parcel with someone who was going that way. </sentence><sentence id="1115">And my girlfriends loved my mother's baking. </sentence><sentence id="1116">And this was for the whole week for me to eat!Because I didn't, you know, it wasn't that she was, she says, "Oh, today is Friday! </sentence><sentence id="1117">Let's go to Hania. </sentence><sentence id="1118">She has her mother's cake!" </sentence><sentence id="1119">And those kids, they didn't miss anything. </sentence><sentence id="1120">You know, they were rich kids. </sentence><sentence id="1121">They ate all my cakes. </sentence><sentence id="1122">My mother would buy me fruits like oranges that were extremely expensive, but for me, maybe one orange, maybe a few grapes. </sentence><sentence id="1123">You know, she would do the best she could. </sentence><sentence id="1124">And they ate everything and I didn't have what to eat for the whole week. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1141">Q: Hania, I want to take us back to your life in Radom, because I think it's important for us to get a sense of what it meant for you to be that independent, and how different it was for you to be home than for your other sisters to be home. </sentence><sentence id="1142">So, let's talk a little about what your life was like during that time and some incidences that happened to you. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1145">A: Well, I lived in - my mother used to rent a room for me in a friend's place or whatever and I lived there for the 10 months; for the vacation I went home. </sentence><sentence id="1146">And she did the best she could. </sentence><sentence id="1147">She washed my laundry every week. </sentence><sentence id="1148">I sent her my laundry to be washed at home because I didn't have the facilities. </sentence><sentence id="1149">And every week she would send me the home baking and the best she could, she could afford to buy at the time: some fruits that were imported that were so expensive that only the sick ones would get them sometimes. </sentence><sentence id="1150">And I was very good at school, so I had no problem there. </sentence><sentence id="1151">I always had straight A's. </sentence><sentence id="1152">My parents were very proud of me; they were always bragging. </sentence><sentence id="1153">And I also tutored French, and I was paid for those lessons, so this was my spending money. </sentence><sentence id="1154">We could go to a movie or for ice cream, like, we were going in groups, but it was expensive, so I could afford to pay for it because I was making some money there. </sentence><sentence id="1155">And for holidays, I usually used to come home, but for the Yom Kippur and the Rosh Hashana, I not always could because it was the beginning of school and I didn't want to miss - don't forget, I was the only Jewish girl in our class, so I couldn't afford to miss a week of school at the very beginning. </sentence><sentence id="1156">So, I remember, one year I was living with the professor, the professor's family, and for the holidays, I also had an aunt living, an aunt and uncle in Radom. </sentence><sentence id="1157">My uncle was the brother of my father, but I didn't live with them. </sentence><sentence id="1158">I lived with this family. </sentence><sentence id="1159">And the lady of the house asked me what am I going to do for the holidays. </sentence><sentence id="1160">So, I couldn't say "nothing" because I didn't want to be invited by them, because it is a family holiday and they had their family. </sentence><sentence id="1161">So, she says, "What are you going to do?" </sentence><sentence id="1162">So, I said to her, "My aunt invited me for dinner." </sentence><sentence id="1163">So she said, "Oh, that's good." </sentence><sentence id="1164">So when they sat at the table, I went out  2 on the street, and you know, that was - all the smells were so, I mean, so inviting everywhere. </sentence><sentence id="1165">And I wasn't invited to my aunt's for the holidays. </sentence><sentence id="1166">I was walking the streets until I got tired, and I sat down on a stone somewhere near the road and started crying. </sentence><sentence id="1167">I cried myself to death. </sentence><sentence id="1168">I was so hungry and I was thinking of the house and I was envious of my sisters being there, you know, with the whole family and eating well and all. </sentence><sentence id="1169">So, I really felt very bad and I couldn't go home until they finished the dinner because I went to my aunt's officially, so when I came home, and they were already - I heard the dishes being washed and put away - and I went to bed. </sentence><sentence id="1170">I was so hungry. </sentence><sentence id="1171">I was so hungry, so I cried all night. </sentence><sentence id="1172">That's how I remember one of the incidents of being independent. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1201">Q: And why, were you not close with your aunt? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1203">A: No, my aunt was very envious that I was - from the beginning, when I was accepted, when my mother brought me to Radom and when I passed the exam and the results were being, like, "til the end of the summer, the results were unknown. </sentence><sentence id="1204">So, my aunt says to my mother, "What do you expect? </sentence><sentence id="1205">You come from a small town there, and you come from Wierzbnik, that they'1l accept you with open arms? </sentence><sentence id="1206">First of all, she has to pass as the best exam because she's Jewish. </sentence><sentence id="1207">Secondly, what do you expect? </sentence><sentence id="1208">They have in Radom a lot of people that they know, and they're prominent people, that they'1l accept you?" </sentence><sentence id="1209">And she says, "The hair will grow on my wrist if she would be accepted." </sentence><sentence id="1210">So, anyway, towards the end, my mother registered - at the same time, she registered me at the Jewish gymnasium. </sentence><sentence id="1211">And when she came to look at the results, she went by herself because she was sure that I won't be accepted. </sentence><sentence id="1212">So, she went there and, sure enough, I was accep- my name was there, so she fainted. </sentence><sentence id="1213">And then my aunt and the whole family wanted to be sure that this is true, they all went to see whether it's true. </sentence><sentence id="1214">But that wasn't the only - I talked to her many times. </sentence><sentence id="1215">We had many conversations because she was in America. </sentence><sentence id="1216">And she knows that she did me wrong. </sentence><sentence id="1217">But she had two sons and she says that she didn't want me to live in her house because the sons were my age, and that was her explanation. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1233">Q: So, you sometimes made decisions...? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1235">A: No. </sentence><sentence id="1236">I mean, I had to make decisions the way I could. </sentence><sentence id="1237">I was just a kid. </sentence><sentence id="1238">I couldn't call my parents; we didn't have a telephone. </sentence><sentence id="1239">I remember it one time, I was sick, and I was living in another place where, like, I had a girlfriend in the family, so they accepted me, and I shared her room. </sentence><sentence id="1240">And I got sick, so my landlady called my mother to come and pick me up because, I mean, she wasn't ready to look after a sick child. </sentence><sentence id="1241">So, my mother came and picked me up and took me home for a week or two until I recovered and I came back. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1249">Q: And I understand that the packages she would send you... </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1263">Q: So, where would you then eat breakfast and lunch? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1265">A: In my room, but you know, like, it wasn't like - I would have a bagel and cheese or something. </sentence><sentence id="1266">And I remember I had a tremendous appetite, and one day my father came to visit me. </sentence><sentence id="1267">And on the way from the train, he stopped to buy bagels - not bagels, I think rolls, kaiser rolls - and cheese, because I really liked the yellow cheese. </sentence><sentence id="1268">So, he bought six rolls for me to have for the week or whatever. </sentence><sentence id="1269">And I remember, he never forgot to mention it that I had all six rolls at one time.

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1277">Q: So, you really had a big appetite! </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1279">A: Tremendous, because I grew very fast. </sentence><sentence id="1280">When I came to Radom, I was the smallest one in my class, but when I was thirteen years old, I grew twelve centimeters. </sentence><sentence id="1281">I was the tallest one in my class. </sentence><sentence id="1282">And from there on, when we carried the insignia of the school, the tallest used to get it, I used to be the one. </sentence></p></dialogue>

to such a degree that once he told the Ukrainians, "No one touches my Jews. </sentence><sentence id="1792">Only I have the right to touch my Jews." </sentence><sentence id="1793">So, he wasn't so bad, and as a matter of fact, he was there for a long time. </sentence><sentence id="1794">I don't know why he was later let go. </sentence><sentence id="1795">He  2 went to Ostrowiec, which was a camp not far from us, and they tell me that he was horrible there. </sentence><sentence id="1796">So, I don't know. </sentence><sentence id="1797">He was the only German that I could say a good word about because the others were all murderers and, I mean, I'll tell you stories unbelievable stories. </sentence><sentence id="1798">Then we had - then we had in camp, above Vaschek (ph), Vaschek (ph) was in camp all the time. </sentence><sentence id="1799">Then there was a guy by the name of Meyer (ph) who was overseeing all the camps, but he would only come for an hour. </sentence><sentence id="1800">He would talk with Vaschek (ph).You know, they would walk and talk. </sentence><sentence id="1801">He wasn't yet - I mean, he wasn't good, but he wasn't yet as bad as the top man was called Altov (ph). </sentence><sentence id="1802">He was the most horrible killer that one, I mean, he was - he was killing Jews and when he arrived into the camp, he wanted everybody to freeze in the place where - if you walked you had to stand up. </sentence><sentence id="1803">He jumped over fences. </sentence><sentence id="1804">He killed from all kinds of situations, like he would sit down, he would jump, he would kill people that appeared on his way, and we will just make a note then at the office that is deceased. </sentence><sentence id="1805">He was the worst of them, and apparently I heard that he was from a family because there was as I said called Altov (ph), apparently in Germany a very famous circus. </sentence><sentence id="1806">So, he must have been an acrobat, because the way he behaved, I mean, only an acrobat could kill people from all positions like him. </sentence><sentence id="1807">Everybody was so scared of him that I didn't even look in his - I don't even - I don't remember his face because when he came to the office and asked for Vaschek (ph), I would pretend that - I was afraid to look up. </sentence><sentence id="1808">So, that was the worst. </sentence><sentence id="1809">Then, in the factories we had - we had people. </sentence><sentence id="1810">Okay. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1862">Q: Can I ask you a question about somebody like Altov (ph)? </sentence><sentence id="1863">How did you - how did you make sense then or how do you make sense now of this kind of brutality? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1866">A: I think that he was not accepted by the Germans because I think - he didn't have a uniform, he didn't have an SS, most likely because we found out later, whether it's true or not, we met his mother in Auschwitz and she was a gypsy. </sentence><sentence id="1867">Whether this was the same Mrs. Altov (ph), but if must have been because I talked personally with her. </sentence><sentence id="1868">When I heard that she was an Altov (ph), I went and I talked to her. </sentence><sentence id="1869">And the way she described him, it must have been her son, and she says she was a gypsy and they were in the circus business. </sentence><sentence id="1870">So, I can't tell you, but he wasn't an SS man. </sentence><sentence id="1871">Everybody was afraid of him. </sentence><sentence id="1872">The Judenrat was afraid of him. </sentence><sentence id="1873">They were hardly talking to him, and I'm telling you, I mean I would freeze. </sentence><sentence id="1874">I put my eyes down, I so was afraid, and I kept my shoulders up because I was afraid that he would shoot me in a minute. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1884">Q: But, the Germans didn't stop him. </sentence><sentence id="1885">They didn't care that he was doing this. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1888">A: They didn't care. </sentence><sentence id="1889">He was the worst and he was - his title was Stumfiihrer (ph). </sentence><sentence id="1890">Then we had - and Meyer (ph) died, I think, yes, he died. </sentence><sentence id="1891">So, he was replaced by a guy called Colditz (ph). </sentence><sentence id="1892">He was very fat man. </sentence><sentence id="1893">He was also screaming. </sentence><sentence id="1894">He was almost as bad as Altov (ph). </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1902">Q: On the Judenrat. </sentence><sentence id="1903"> 3 </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1906">A: No, no, he was almost as bad as Altov (ph) by his behavior like when he was coming they'd he also demanded to freeze, people to freeze, and then they were the people, the Sicherheit Polizei, which was the, like - I don't know how to say encavudei (ph) in Russian, how do Sicherheit Polizei (ph), they were... </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1908">Q: Intelligence police? </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1914">Q: Maybe security police. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1916">A: That's right, Sicherheit (ph). </sentence><sentence id="1917">And, I'll tell you stories about him, what he did to people, because I'll give specific stories about him, horrible man, horrible. </sentence><sentence id="1918">Then there was Kashmider (ph), and who was in charge of, like - the Germans were - the Germans soldiers, the German officials who were wearing uniforms were in charge of the place where the Jews worked. </sentence><sentence id="1919">So, they would come and look around and change workers and stuff like that. </sentence><sentence id="1920">Those were the people that accepted all sorts of bribes, you know, to take somebody to work or to change his job, you know, what it was. </sentence><sentence id="1921">So, they used to come to the, for conferences, to the Judenrat, but it wasn't a conference. </sentence><sentence id="1922">They had to be prepared with bribes. </sentence><sentence id="1923">There was another one. </sentence><sentence id="1924">I think I gave you all the names already. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1934">Q: Can I ask you something? </sentence><sentence id="1935">I think most people assume that Judenrat was a function inside a ghetto, as opposed to a labor camp. </sentence><sentence id="1936">Was this camp somehow in between being a labor camp and a ghetto? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1940">A: No, that was the labor camp, and those people were - maybe the Judenrat was the same people who were in the ghetto. </sentence><sentence id="1941">The same as they took me and my father because we were in Arbeitsamt, maybe that's why we got into the office. </sentence><sentence id="1942">Otherwise, I mean, I don't know how we could get into the office if they didn't see us writing there and keeping records. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1946">Q: Was you in somewhat of a privileged position because of the job? </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1954">Q: So, whatever... </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1956">A: I slept in the same barrack, and I wasn't in any privileged position at - they never spoke to me, nobody except for my boss, that Vaschek (ph). </sentence><sentence id="1957">He was the only one that talked to me; otherwise, nobody else talked to me ever. </sentence><sentence id="1958"> 4 </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1962">Q: Did you actually have conversations with Vaschek (ph)? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1964">A: No, because he had such a foul mouth, I was afraid to, I mean, I wasn't afraid of him, but I just couldn't take the way he - I mean, he didn't mistreat me, but he called me all sorts of names, but it wasn't only to me. </sentence><sentence id="1965">He did that to everybody. </sentence><sentence id="1966">But that was only words. </sentence><sentence id="1967">That's why I say he had heart, because sometimes there were a few cases when I was saved because of him, because he sent me to the factory to work, to type letters, and type lists where they had - when they had some kind of action. </sentence><sentence id="1968">I only think like that because on two occasions, I was sent to the factory during selection, and the first time I thought I was lucky, but the second time, I thought maybe Vaschek (ph) did that. </sentence><sentence id="1969">Although he talked to me so badly, but I didn't care. </sentence><sentence id="1970">It was a good job. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1978">Q: So, how regularly were there selections? </sentence><sentence id="1979">Was it regular or was it just...? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1982">A: No, only sometimes, and the selections were only when people were sick. </sentence><sentence id="1983">So, I'll tell you those stories separately because it was very important how they were treating it. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1986">Q: So, you're now in this - are you with Renia or with your father? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1988">A: No, my father and Krysia were in - on Majowka, and Renia and I were there for awhile, and then later - I don't - this I don't remember exactly how it happened, because they brought all the people from Majowka to Strzelnica and then from Strzelnica to Majowka. </sentence><sentence id="1989">You know, it was, I don't remember exactly what time and when, but Strzelnica was the bigger camp, the bigger camp, but then later we were all moved to Majowka. </sentence><sentence id="1990">At first, because for a time I was with my father and Krysia, and for a time I was away from them. </sentence><sentence id="1991">I don't really remember when it was, what year it was, because I'm sure that Krysia must have been - they must have taken them from Strzelnica to Majowka maybe first and then to - they made one camp at a certain time, maybe for repairs or for other things, I couldn't tell you. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1996">Q: But, when you went to Majowka, is Majowka larger than 500 people or was it was still only 500 people? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1998">A: Five hundred people, but maybe they - maybe they enlarged it meanwhile, because, you know, later on they were taking us, towards the end - towards the end, we were taken to another camp altogether. </sentence><sentence id="1999">They were building a special camp for us, just to get rid of us, because it was near a train line. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2030">A: I suppose they had - there was no camps before, so they must have made them specially when we were in ghettos, because there were no camps there before. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2134">A: A few people. </sentence><sentence id="2135">I would say that at least half of them, because don't forget that we had shift work, that some people were going to work at night, in the evening, I don't know whether we had three shifts, I think. </sentence><sentence id="2136">So, they were getting food at the factory or on the premises, but this Salka Perinsweic (ph) was, she was one of the inmates as | call it. </sentence><sentence id="2137">She was in charge of the kitchen. </sentence><sentence id="2138">That was her job. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2180">A: I would go very early because the first shift, if the shift was going, I had to give them the work list. </sentence><sentence id="2181">I had to prepare it for them. </sentence><sentence id="2182">So, if they went to work at seven o'clock, I had to be there, and I worked until the last shift would go to work and Vaschek (ph) - before Vaschek (ph) would go home and put all the records under the lock and key. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2186">Q: Did you make up the work lists or did Vaschek (ph) tell you who would be on it? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2188">A: No, I was told either by the policemen or like, I was, if there was any changes. </sentence><sentence id="2189">If the list was the same, I didn't have to change it. </sentence><sentence id="2190">I just - because I got reports that would say, "This was transferred to here." </sentence><sentence id="2191">So, I knew that the next day, I'd have to put this name on another list. </sentence><sentence id="2192">And I had to adjust the cards, as well. </sentence><sentence id="2193">I had to write on it, let's say if she worked, if he worked in Department A, as an example, I'm just saying. </sentence><sentence id="2194">So, if he was changed to C, I had to put it on his card too. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2202">Q: So, everybody in the camp had a kind of identity card. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2218">Q: Now, did you type these lists? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2220">A: First, we didn't have like a typewriter in camp at first. </sentence><sentence id="2221">So, if he wanted typed lists or something, he would send me to the factory, Vaschek (ph) would. </sentence><sentence id="2222">But, if - but I had a very good handwriting, very legible, I remember, and that's why he took me to his place, because he could read so easily my writing, and I was doing it all by hand. </sentence><sentence id="2223">Later on, I remember, I don't know when, he brought a typewriter, an old typewriter, to the office. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2228">Q: Did you...? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2230">A: I didn't know how to type, but I pretended. </sentence><sentence id="2231">I said, "With two fingers, I type so fast." </sentence><sentence id="2232">I learned so fast. </sentence><sentence id="2233">I never learned how to type. </sentence><sentence id="2234">So, when he asked me if I could type, I had to say yes. </sentence><sentence id="2235">I mean, otherwise he" ll take somebody else to the office. </sentence><sentence id="2236">That was a good job. </sentence><sentence id="2237">So, I typed with my fingers and I learned to type so fast that I was faster than the others - to such a degree that, in my office later, when I worked for ourselves, I took typing classes and I could never learn because I was much faster with two fingers, the way I learned in camp. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2246">Q: And did you print when you were not using the typewriter or did you handwrite? </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3199">A: Because everything happened the same time. </sentence><sentence id="3200">So, maybe I'll start with Tobah (ph) because maybe it will be shorter. </sentence><sentence id="3201">I don't know that much about her, but about my husband's escape and the way that he bought the gun and stuff like that, it might be a little longer. </sentence><sentence id="3202">So, Tobah (ph) - one day Becker, who was the Sicherheit Deist, came in a car with another German soldiers and they came and asked for Tobah (ph), and they took her out of the camp. </sentence><sentence id="3203">We didn't know why. </sentence><sentence id="3204">Then, she came back. </sentence><sentence id="3205">We didn't know why. </sentence><sentence id="3206">Then, a few days later, he came for Tobah (ph) again. </sentence><sentence id="3207">Took her himself already. </sentence><sentence id="3208">He took her out again. </sentence><sentence id="3209">He was very polite. </sentence><sentence id="3210">I remember because I was near the office, like they brought her to the office, and you know, I could look through the window and see. </sentence><sentence id="3211">He opened the door for her, like if she was - like a girl, and he took her out and he brought her back the same day. </sentence><sentence id="3212">The third time, he took her out - I don't know if it was a few days or a week or two later - he took her out and he never brought her back. </sentence><sentence id="3213">Now, that day, he was ordered - her father was ordered to, to dig a grave, and of course, it was like, they called him to work. </sentence><sentence id="3214">He didn't know it was going to be for him. </sentence><sentence id="3215">So, he started digging but he was an older man. </sentence><sentence id="3216">It took him a little time. </sentence><sentence id="3217">So, Schrodt came out of his office, and he  5 took the gun and killed him on the spot. </sentence><sentence id="3218">The grave wasn't dug exactly - like, the grave was half-finished and he called other workers to cover him. </sentence><sentence id="3219">And she never came back. </sentence><sentence id="3220">Then we found out, because they were from Opatow - it was about, I would say, about 40 kilometers away from Wierzbnik. </sentence><sentence id="3221">Apparently, they had money - money or some goods or some jewelry. </sentence><sentence id="3222">I don't know. </sentence><sentence id="3223">She must have showed it to them, and after they got whatever they wanted, you know, the money, they just killed her. </sentence><sentence id="3224">I didn't know what happened to her because they didn't bring her to camp, but I was talking to the professor about her because he had - he had her - heard the story and his records. </sentence><sentence id="3225">He told me that he asked, whether he asked himself or whether one of those people that he - that he was talking to told him that she was - the grave was found later in the woods very close to where she lived - where they lived, where they found the treasures. </sentence><sentence id="3226">So, this was Tobjah Weisblum (ph) that's how she perished, and her father, for money. </sentence><sentence id="3227">Not only because they were Jews, but because they had money. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3257">Q: Why did they kill the father, do you think, at the moment? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3259">A: Because I suppose they decided they didn't want to have any witnesses because nobody knew why Tobjah Weisblum (ph) was taken out, nobody knew, and she never told anybody. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3261">Q: But the father knew? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3263">A: The father probably didn't knew. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3265">Q: Didn't know? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3267">A: Didn't know what for they are taking her out. </sentence><sentence id="3268">Because he was - when he was digging the grave, it was an older man as I say, he never suspected that that was for him, but Schrodt killed him even before he finished. </sentence><sentence id="3269">Like, he just killed him in front, like during the daytime, when everybody looked on. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3273">Q: Did you see that killing? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3275">A: No, I wasn't near the grave then. </sentence><sentence id="3276">No, but of course, I was the one that wrote down "deceased". </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3283">Q: Hania, before we go onto the next story, I'm just wondering if you have a sense if there was different treatment of men and women. </sentence><sentence id="3284">Was there anything about the women's part of the camp that was different then the men? </sentence><sentence id="3285">Were women afraid of being mistreated as women, not just being brutalized, but sexually? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3289">A: Actually, it would be - to them, it would be a sacrilege to talk to - not to talk to associate with any Jewish girl, because the Jews were not people. </sentence><sentence id="3290">They were animals. </sentence><sentence id="3291">So, you are talking about the people in the camp, the people that lived in camp or the Germans. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3307">Q: So, they wouldn't be necessarily... </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3309">A: Well, they were - maybe they treated the women a little bit better, but I don't think. </sentence><sentence id="3310">When I say "better", we have nothing to do with them, but maybe they wouldn't push us or hit us or whatever, but I don't think the Ukrainians would dare, or whether they would dare or whether the Jewish girls would go with Ukrainians. </sentence><sentence id="3311">I don't think so. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3315">Q: Were women able to be in contact with men in the camp? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3317">A: To a certain point. </sentence><sentence id="3318">As a matter of fact, certain names maybe I should mention, it must have been Mr. Billenswiec had a - because his wife was there, too - and everybody knew that he had a lover there, a woman from Lodz, but that was - everybody knew about it, and - because see the camp, the camp had separate barracks for women and separate for men. </sentence><sentence id="3319">So, if they met together it must have been during the day sometime, so the barrack was open for everybody to see. </sentence><sentence id="3320">It wasn't that they had separate rooms or anything, because we had - it was like a cot underneath and another one above. </sentence><sentence id="3321">It was good for two people, but like people were saying, "Oh, this one or that one," but that was about the inmates. </sentence><sentence id="3322">But you know people, I think that people behaved a little better in camps. </sentence><sentence id="3323">What I meant - I mean, there was nowhere to go, you had to do it - if you wanted to do it, everybody could watch. </sentence><sentence id="3324">I don't know how many people got into a barrack. </sentence><sentence id="3325">I was asked the same question by the historian. </sentence><sentence id="3326">So I said, at night, the women were separated because, you know, there was no movement from one barrack to another, but during the day, maybe. </sentence><sentence id="3327"> 7 </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3397">Q: Shall we talk about the escape and the plans for the escape? </sentence><sentence id="3398">This is from 1943. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3401">A: Yes. </sentence><sentence id="3402">So, what happened - the conditions were worse and worse and, you know, when things were happening, a group of people decided that we have to make an uprising and to liberate the camp. </sentence><sentence id="3403">It was an idea that we didn't know how to achieve it, but we knew one thing: that we have to get arms, some kinds of guns and stuff like that. </sentence><sentence id="3404">And this was very secretive. </sentence><sentence id="3405">All the policemen knew about it, because they were young and strong  8 people, and some people, but you know, some people that belonged to the group or was told about it, but not everybody knew about the preparations or the intentions because we were afraid that we could be denounced and killed. </sentence><sentence id="3406">So, anyway, we decided - everything was secret - and we decided that Adrian was the best one to acquire - he volunteered because he was very good at schmoozing and talking people into it. </sentence><sentence id="3407">So, we decided he's going to buy guns. </sentence><sentence id="3408">We would collect whatever we can from the Ukrainians because when they were going home, they had to give their guns away and they went to get the guns when they came back to work. </sentence><sentence id="3409">They didn't keep the guns with them. </sentence><sentence id="3410">So, when they - that they were supposed to steal - the first gun was purchased, and my husband had it. </sentence><sentence id="3411">He was the one to purchase this gun. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3423">Q: Where did he...? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3425">A: Where did he keep it? </sentence><sentence id="3426">I don't know. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3429">Q: No, where did it get it from? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3431">A: From a Ukrainian, a guard, bought it. </sentence><sentence id="3432">They paid for it through the nose with the collected, whatever we could collect. </sentence><sentence id="3433">And he talked to one Ukrainian, and this Ukrainian agreed that he would be selling guns for such and such a price. </sentence><sentence id="3434">I don't remember what it was, whether it was in gold or whether it was in money or whether it was in other things. </sentence><sentence id="3435">When I say other things, some people were, in Wierzbnik, like if we left a lot of things - valuables - not only gold and silver, but other valuables like blankets and furniture and all this. </sentence><sentence id="3436">So, you know, we could tell the Ukrainian go to such and such, and we have the, let's say, two watches or something. </sentence><sentence id="3437">Take the two watches and bring me a gun. </sentence><sentence id="3438">I don't remember exactly how he got the first gun because that's as far as he got, the first gun. </sentence><sentence id="3439">On the second try, they caught the Ukrainian, when he was stealing. </sentence><sentence id="3440">Instead of taking one gun with him or whatever, they caught him stealing - they found two guns in his possession when he - whatever. </sentence><sentence id="3441">So, of course, they investigated and they interrogated him and he said, "He doesn't know the name, but there is one of the policemen." </sentence><sentence id="3442">So, they lined up the policemen, all twelve of them, and the Ukrainian came in and of course he sold it to Adrian, so he went there and he showed, "This is the policeman that bought from me the gun." </sentence><sentence id="3443">Right away, Becker came in and he started interrogating my husband, and my husband said, Adrian, he says, "I never bought from him a gun. </sentence><sentence id="3444">I don't know him. </sentence><sentence id="3445">I didn't - I never saw him." </sentence><sentence id="3446">But, of course, they didn't believe him. </sentence><sentence id="3447">He was interrogated and we had such a bunker, a small bunker that was made out of concrete. </sentence><sentence id="3448">They put him there for a while, and then Judenrat went to Becker, and Becker came in and he said that he is lying, that Adrian is lying, because the Ukrainian didn't have any problems finding him, and he's going to be condemned to death. </sentence><sentence id="3449">So, the Judenrat decided that - Becker you can buy him. </sentence><sentence id="3450">This is the guy who took out , so, he says, "Okay, if  9 he showed that this is the guy that bought from him the gun." </sentence><sentence id="3451">So, they agreed. </sentence><sentence id="3452">They put him in this bunker, and he had to dig his own grave, and Becker, not Becker, the other, the Baumgarten read, he read, you know, he read to him the order, that because he bought the gun from the Ukrainian and because he is key of an uprising, he's condemned to death. </sentence><sentence id="3453">He said it in the name of Adolf Hitler, and whatever it is, and so he read this to him, and this was the first time that a grave was dug up and they had no body, because they kept him there and then when he got his money, they wanted a kilo of gold. </sentence><sentence id="3454">A kilo of gold, but we didn't have gold, so everybody, if they hid some ring or whatever, even teeth they were putting in their head, and what happened, they went to Becker and this Baumgarten to say, "Now, you can start the investigation." </sentence><sentence id="3455">So, in order for him not to be able to escape, they took him out of the bunker, took two Ukrainians, they covered his head - like, they put him on a bench, took off his clothes, put a sack, you know, like a sack hat you put potatoes in or sugar or whatever with holes in it? </sentence><sentence id="3456">They put it over the head. </sentence><sentence id="3457">They took two rubber sticks or whatever and they had such whips - whatever you call it - and they told him that he would get now a hundred whips and he has to count. </sentence><sentence id="3458">So, you know, one, two, three... Adrian said after the twentieth whip, his body was numb. </sentence><sentence id="3459">He says he couldn't even feel anything. </sentence><sentence id="3460">He didn't care. </sentence><sentence id="3461">So, anyway, after they did that, they put him back into the police barrack there, because they figured that after his body was black and blue and red and bloody. </sentence><sentence id="3462">But he was a very strong boy, and don't forget that in 1943 he was nineteen. </sentence><sentence id="3463">So, I mean, he was a young, strong boy. </sentence><sentence id="3464">They put him in the barrack and they said, "This is only so that he can't escape or can't do anything." </sentence><sentence id="3465">So, they took him from the bunker because he couldn't breathe there, and they put him in the barrack, and the next day they called in appel. </sentence><sentence id="3466">Everybody had to go to the - everybody had to an appel so that they could tell them that what happens if - everybody will be shot who will take part, that if things like this, if people want to escape, if anybody escapes they will kill ten people for each one that escapes, and in addition, they are not going to - because somebody - they didn't say it anymore that Adrian bought the gun - somebody bought the gun for a certain purpose. </sentence><sentence id="3467">They didn't know about the gun that already existed. </sentence><sentence id="3468">They were talking about the gun that they caught the Ukrainian with, you know?There must be a reason why they wanted the gun, and while they were doing it, the guys that were thinking of escaping, of the uprising, they decided that when they visited Adrian later, when he was so sick, that they had to escape at the first opportunity. </sentence><sentence id="3469">So, when everybody was standing at the appel and they were saying that, the policemen were moving because they were always helping to round up people. </sentence><sentence id="3470">So, they went to Adrian's room. </sentence><sentence id="3471">They took him out. </sentence><sentence id="3472">They had some shears, and they decided, because the Ukrainians were also watching us inside - not outside, the only Ukrainian that was okay was kept, was on the gate. </sentence><sentence id="3473">But they decided to cut - there was ten of them, ten young people. </sentence><sentence id="3474">I don't know how many policemen, but I think about two or three policemen. </sentence><sentence id="3475">The rest were young boys that were always in contact to do the uprising. </sentence><sentence id="3476">So, while they were talking and we were watched by the Ukrainians and the policemen moving around, they cut the barbed wire and my husband, like Adrian was at the time, you can imagine, after he got those lashes the night before or the day before. </sentence><sentence id="3477">They jumped over the fence and started running. </sentence><sentence id="3478">They had to run quickly over the road because on the other side of the road there were forests and the Germans usually, like, all they wanted is to get to the  0 forest as fast as they could. </sentence><sentence id="3479">But meanwhile Schrodt, the guy that was watching, he started shooting. </sentence><sentence id="3480">So, immediately they took all the Ukrainians and Schrodt was in charge. </sentence><sentence id="3481">He had a motorcycle and he started running after them. </sentence><sentence id="3482">But until they found they were a little bit further. </sentence><sentence id="3483">So, anyway they managed to go to the forest and the Ukrainians and Schrodt came back and Schrodt said to Vaschek (ph), like they said, "I am telling you, the young Wilczek (ph) ," which in German means the younger Wilczek (ph) I killed  1 specialized because when the Germans were up there, if they heard anybody in the river, they were shooting them right away. </sentence><sentence id="3484">So, that was a very - the two Jewish boys that were accepted, Freumik (ph) and Adrian, they were doing those jobs, and now, they had different encounters with the Germans looking for them, but the Germans were always afraid to go straight to the forest. </sentence><sentence id="3485">They had people that were in the village, Polish villages that were telling them about the movement of the Germans and where they were going, and whether they were coming, what happened here and there. </sentence><sentence id="3486">So, they had contact with the world. </sentence><sentence id="3487">They had enough to eat there. </sentence><sentence id="3488">I mean, not that they were given special - like Adrian says, they would bring them a glop of pork, you know, the fat, and they would just eat half a pound to a pound of it, no bread or anything because it depends on what they had and brought in, and he says, "You wouldn't believe what I could eat - this pure fat." </sentence><sentence id="3489">And, they could really eat the pound of fat without anything. </sentence><sentence id="3490">So, they weren't really hungry. </sentence><sentence id="3491">They slept in the woods, and they were doing the mine work. </sentence><sentence id="3492">That was their work. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3558">A: I will tell you about the others. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3560">Q: But, I wanted to ask you, there was no question about whether these guys were Jewish, or they said they were not Jewish? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3562">A: No, they didn't say. </sentence><sentence id="3563">And, they knew that they were Jewish, and to such a point they said that they are happy that Adrian had the name Wilczek (ph) which means "little wolf" because everybody in the partisan group had a nickname and the nickname was an animal. </sentence><sentence id="3564">Do you know what I mean? </sentence><sentence id="3565">Like, he was called a cat, a dog, whatever. </sentence><sentence id="3566">So, he had - his name "little wolf" was suitable, but they knew that they were Jewish. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3572">Q: Tell me something, Adrian's physical condition then... Did anybody take care of him? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3574">A: And, you know what? </sentence><sentence id="3575">That's what I'm going to say. </sentence><sentence id="3576">At first, they let him rest because they told them what happened. </sentence><sentence id="3577">So, those were the Russians, mostly Russians there. </sentence><sentence id="3578">Anyway, one day, he got so sick, he got delirious, so they said they had to move for whatever reason, and they told him that they can't take him because he couldn't walk. </sentence><sentence id="3579">So, he asked them to kill him. </sentence><sentence id="3580">He said, "Maybe if you kill me because I..." But they couldn't kill him. </sentence><sentence id="3581">So, they gave him, like, they gave him a gun. </sentence><sentence id="3582">They covered him up. </sentence><sentence id="3583">They gave him all the food they had, and they left him there. </sentence><sentence id="3584">They kissed him and they said, "We are very sorry," because they left him there to die because he was so sick. </sentence><sentence id="3585">So some people were going by the woods and they found him and they took him - some Polacks, most of them were collaborating with the partisans. </sentence><sentence id="3586">They were the people that were saying where the Germans are. </sentence><sentence id="3587">So, they took him home and they, and it took him ten days and he was better. </sentence><sentence id="3588">So, he decided to go back to his group. </sentence><sentence id="3589">When he went to his - before he went out, he contacted one of those people that they were in contact with, and he said, "T'm sorry to tell you that somebody denounced the group, the Russian group. </sentence><sentence id="3590">The  2 Germans came in while they were asleep in there, and...and one of the - where they kept horses or cows or whatever - one of those buildings, they put it afire and everybody got killed. </sentence><sentence id="3591">So, he felt so bad, but, I mean, he couldn't believe it. </sentence><sentence id="3592">So, he went...he went back to the woods, after he felt better, and he decided he'll wait for another group. </sentence><sentence id="3593">I'll tell you more about the others that were left, the eight that were left, but I have to finish this story first. </sentence><sentence id="3594">So... </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3708">Q: So, when you all were thinking about this separately - because clearly you're not supposed to have conversations because it's too dangerous, right? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3710">A: No, it's too dangerous, and I'll tell you, I couldn't take a part in the running away, anyway, because they told us that if someone runs away, first the family and then ten other people and there were cases where they killed ten people for one. </sentence><sentence id="3711">If one escaped, they would round up ten people and kill them - shot them. </sentence></p></dialogue>

</sentence><sentence id="3816">I'm Jewish." </sentence><sentence id="3817">So, the guy says in Jewish to him, "Why didn't you tell me that before?" </sentence><sentence id="3818">So, anyway, he was saved, but now this guy from the Anazed that killed so many Jews on his ways, tried to - since Adrian was already there, like the Russian and him were already such friends, and so, he tried to say that he was also good to the Jews because he saved him, but he wasn't. </sentence><sentence id="3819">So, Adrian says, "I am the first Jew that he saved." </sentence><sentence id="3820">Because he told him, when he accepted him, ""You are the first Jew that I met in my life that I'll save you - that I'm going to save your life." </sentence><sentence id="3821">So, he repeated it. </sentence><sentence id="3822">I mean, he just said it. </sentence><sentence id="3823">I don't know what happened to them. </sentence><sentence id="3824">I don't think that anything happened to them. </sentence><sentence id="3825">Adrian was right away made, like, he was a lieutenant right away. </sentence><sentence id="3826">They put all the stars on him, and then when he came home, he worked for the -  7 like, he was - he worked in the army as a lieutenant. </sentence><sentence id="3827">Now, I'll go back to Salik Anulevicz (ph) and the others. </sentence><sentence id="3828">When this - when they took the two of them - the two of them - the two guys Freumik (ph) and Adrian, they were very much concerned what happened to the other guys, but they never found out. </sentence><sentence id="3829">Only after the war, they found out what happened. </sentence><sentence id="3830">Salik started his story. </sentence><sentence id="3831">When they took them and went away, there was eight of them left. </sentence><sentence id="3832">So, Armia Kryowa, which was the home army, which wasn't killing the Jews, but they were - they were doing everything possible to make their life miserable, went by and they see eight people, and the people - they all told them what happened. </sentence><sentence id="3833">They told them, "We run away from this Jewish camp in..." And not all of them spoke because the - Hassidic Jews that spoke Yiddish at home, they had a very big accent. </sentence><sentence id="3834">You could right away notice that they were not - I mean, you couldn't tell them you are Polish. </sentence><sentence id="3835">They all knew that they were Jewish. </sentence><sentence id="3836">So, they said, they, so, there was eight of them - they - they were anti- Semitic, but they said, "We are not going to kill you, but what we are going to do..."

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="4100">A: Yeah, there was another - then later, it was another try of running after them. </sentence><sentence id="4101">They were already, how should I say, energized by their running away. </sentence><sentence id="4102">And one night people went - they started running - people started running to the barbed wires, cutting the barbed  0 wires. </sentence><sentence id="4103">And when I say a lot, I don't know how many, but I would say maybe a hundred people got killed by the Germans, because they started shooting, the Ukrainians and the Germans, everybody, because they were much more ready to combat all those people after the escape than before, because before it never happened, and - and those - I'm sure that Chris and Renia must have told you the story, how those people were moaning. </sentence><sentence id="4104">They were lying there. </sentence><sentence id="4105">They didn't kill them, and they - they were crying and shouting and screaming, all those people, because they tried to escape. </sentence><sentence id="4106">We didn't try to escape because somehow I didn't see - I mean, where would we go? </sentence><sentence id="4107">There was nowhere for us to go. </sentence><sentence id="4108">If we could run away and be accepted by someone and live with someone or have some kind of a connection, but we didn't. </sentence><sentence id="4109">And we were afraid that if one of us would run away, the whole family would suffer, would be killed, and we didn't - we couldn't leave the father there, and we couldn't leave Renia. </sentence><sentence id="4110">I mean, where can you take Renia? </sentence><sentence id="4111">I'm telling you, she was a sickly - always sick, always, every Tuesday and Thursday like this - it's a Jewish expression - she had either a cold or she was sneezing. </sentence><sentence id="4112">She was always sick. </sentence><sentence id="4113">So, we didn't but people did. </sentence><sentence id="4114">That was after what happened to the ten, like after they run away, there was immediately the rest of them wanted to run away, too. </sentence><sentence id="4115">Because they figured if they could do it, but they run away under special circumstances, and those people started at night. </sentence><sentence id="4116">So, they were just shot like - there were so many dead people. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="4134">Q: Actually, neither Chris nor Renia told me about this. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="4144">A: No, nothing. </sentence><sentence id="4145">They were just running to the barbed wires and tried to escape the way the others because, you know, they saw what happened that the wires were cut and they run away, so they just blindly - they had nowhere to go. </sentence><sentence id="4146">And all the guards were on alert, the Germans would come. </sentence><sentence id="4147">I mean, Becker with his troops would come right away. </sentence><sentence id="4148">I don't know. </sentence><sentence id="4149">That wasn't heroic; that was stupid. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="4188">Q: Did you try to convince people not to do it? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="4190">A: No, because I didn't believe anybody would do it. </sentence><sentence id="4191">We all thought about running away all the time. </sentence><sentence id="4192">That was - that was our aim, to run away from this horrible camp, but you know when the time came to run away, we were too - too - too scared to because we were afraid. </sentence><sentence id="4193">We couldn't take our father out. </sentence><sentence id="4194">We couldn't take Renia out. </sentence><sentence id="4195">And we are afraid that they would be killed. </sentence><sentence id="4196">So, we didn't even try. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="4204">Q: You talked about roll call when they were going to do selections at times. </sentence><sentence id="4205">Did you have roll call every day? </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="4216">A: We didn't have roll call. </sentence><sentence id="4217">They would call all the people - they had an announcement, and they - and they, you know, the policemen then the Ukrainians said to come out and the  USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0411 WP Jewish policemen would round us up - round us up and tell us that there's going to be a lecture, or whatever you call it, that we have to go and listen to it. </sentence><sentence id="4218">That was the time when Adrian and his nine friends ran away. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="4222">Q: So, how would you know - how would they count how many people there were? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="4224">A: They were counting, but the policemen would, you know, don't forget when they started counting, they knew how much we have to have, and the Germans were very gullible. </sentence><sentence id="4225">Like, I told them, let's say that to talk, as an example, was 1,479, as an example. </sentence><sentence id="4226">So, I would tell the policeman that we have 1,479 people. </sentence><sentence id="4227">So, they would come and report how many people - people were taken from each barrack when he was rounding them up. </sentence><sentence id="4228">They were writing down - he's there. </sentence><sentence id="4229">So, they - they made a count that should agree with 1,479, and I remember Altov (ph) saying "Shtumpt!" </sentence><sentence id="4230">Because he didn't know that we fabricated those numbers because all the numbers he started counting together, not saying the amount that I just told you was a fictitious amount. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="4238">Q: So, you would make up a number? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="4240">A: I knew the number because they would come - a policeman would come to me and say, "How much do we need?" </sentence><sentence id="4241">Like this, I'd say, "1,479." </sentence><sentence id="4242">I'm just inventing the number. </sentence><sentence id="4243">Okay, so everyone knew. </sentence><sentence id="4244">So, the first one, let's say came first and then the last one said, "How much do I need?" </sentence><sentence id="4245">You know, I mean, to give the number, and then they counted it together, and then Altov (ph) would come and start counting, "Barrack 3 has so many. </sentence><sentence id="4246">Shtumpt (ph)!" </sentence><sentence id="4247">but meanwhile there were who knows how many missing? </sentence><sentence id="4248">But, we had to do it. </sentence><sentence id="4249">I mean, we had to do it, and if they find out, I mean they didn't find us out, but if they did. </sentence><sentence id="4250">So, we would have had to suffer the consequences, but I mean, that was the only thing that we could do. </sentence><sentence id="4251">and Irinst (ph), that's Adrian's sister's husband, got killed because they found one person in the barrack. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="4264">Q: That's what I was going to ask. </sentence><sentence id="4265">This could be very dangerous if you... </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="4272">Q: Would that affect food distribution because, if saying there were X number, but there were more...? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="4274">A: I don't think so because when they delivered to the kitchen - I wasn't in charge of it, so I really don't know. </sentence><sentence id="4275">I remember that Sal Kabiren's (ph) wife was in charge of it. </sentence><sentence id="4276">So, she - she - but, the Judenrat most likely was ordering or whatever. </sentence><sentence id="4277">I know - I really don't know how it worked, whether they ordered it, whether they sent at random so much of this and so much of this. </sentence><sentence id="4278">I couldn't tell you. </sentence><sentence id="4279"> 3 </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="5053">Q: To go out. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="5055">A: First of all, we had a very bad experience because the guards that took us before they took us to change our dresses and everything, we went very close by a crematorium, or if that wasn't a crematorium, we were told it was a crematorium. </sentence><sentence id="5056">So, I remember having a bottle of whiskey that this Frenchman - I forgot to tell you that the Frenchman left in Auschwitz, he says, "If they take you to the crematorium..." So, we had this bottle of whiskey. </sentence><sentence id="5057">I never drank in my life, but all the girls - I told the girls, so when they German soldiers stopped us in front of the crematorium, or he called this crematorium, so we took this bottle and every girl had a taste. </sentence><sentence id="5058">Not a taste of it, but you know, like we were thinking that we're going to die now so let's just be merry. </sentence><sentence id="5059">We never drank in our lifetimes, but the whole bottle went. </sentence><sentence id="5060">Like, as far as it went from us, and then they took us to the place where they cut our hair, and after that he stayed with us there for a few minutes to scare us or to whatever - to whatever, and then they took us to the place where we had to leave everything we had, to put on the uniform or whatever you call it, a dress  5 with stripes, and they cut our hair. </sentence><sentence id="5061">This is another story how I suffered the most out of all of three of us. </sentence><sentence id="5062">And, then we went to the barrack. </sentence><sentence id="5063">So, I'Il tell you maybe how they first brought us in and told us to take all our clothes off and they put nothing else, we had no brassiere, this I remember - because I was so - it felt so strange to just have the dress on - and they gave us the dress. </sentence><sentence id="5064">The dress was too short on me, so there was a small girl that I don't know who, we changed dresses to fit us. </sentence><sentence id="5065">Because we were all very skinny, but nobody was as tall as I. They were mostly smaller people. </sentence><sentence id="5066">So, there were just a few long dresses. </sentence><sentence id="5067">I was glad that somebody exchanged with me the dress. </sentence><sentence id="5068">Then, they cut our hair to here. </sentence><sentence id="5069">They checked our hair for lice. </sentence><sentence id="5070">They put this stuff in, disinfectant or whatever you call it, in our hair and on our bodies before they gave us the dresses, and I remember, they took away my shoes. </sentence><sentence id="5071">So, they gave us such wooden shoes - wooden shoes - and this was a case where the wooden shoes - we were already in dresses and men from another camp were distributing the shoes, and the guy says, "Take it, take it." </sentence><sentence id="5072">To me like, in Polish we have - like in English you say "you" it means everything, but do you understand French or German? </sentence><sentence id="5073">So, they say "vous" or "tu" or in German they said - they say, because here you say "you", in Polish also you never talk to a lady by calling her "Dou"(ph), you caller her "Vu" like, and the guy says, "Take those, take those." </sentence><sentence id="5074">Well I just said, "How dare you calling me "dou"?" </sentence><sentence id="5075">Okay, it was so stupid. </sentence><sentence id="5076">And, then so anyway I put those dresses - I couldn't walk in them, and then they put us five people in a row to march to the barracks. </sentence><sentence id="5077">So, we were five, and so - Krysia, Renia and I were three and there was three others. </sentence><sentence id="5078">They didn't want to part and we didn't want to part. </sentence><sentence id="5079">So, this woman goes, she says, "What's the commotion? </sentence><sentence id="5080">The couple there." </sentence><sentence id="5081">You know, I just came to a new camp. </sentence><sentence id="5082">I didn't like the way guy says to me "Dou," and here she screams at me. </sentence><sentence id="5083">I wasn't really used to it because you know nobody really mistreated me when I worked before, and she says, "Go to the back." </sentence><sentence id="5084">I say, "I'm not going to the back." </sentence><sentence id="5085">She says - I say, "Those are my two sisters." </sentence><sentence id="5086">She didn't even want to hear. </sentence><sentence id="5087">She took me by the hair, grabbed me by the hair, to the German man there that was cutting the hair, and she says, "Make a cross on her head." </sentence><sentence id="5088">So, you know, she was mad that I talked back to her. </sentence><sentence id="5089">So, first he made the cross, and then he felt sorry for me and he shaved my head, but I was the only one with a really shaved head of hair. </sentence><sentence id="5090">You know, like, I didn't have anything on my head - just - I don't know whether I looked like a boy or whatever. </sentence><sentence id="5091">Anyway, finally we just didn't want to be parted and I didn't care what she says. </sentence><sentence id="5092">She couldn't kill me, like I was daring. </sentence><sentence id="5093">I said, "I'm not going, they are my two sisters. </sentence><sentence id="5094">I'm going with them." </sentence><sentence id="5095">So, she got mad. </sentence><sentence id="5096">She pushed us. </sentence><sentence id="5097">Anyway, we're together. </sentence><sentence id="5098">I didn't want to part from them, because if I went to the back or whatever, I mean, it wasn't the next row - we would have never been together. </sentence><sentence id="5099">When we came to the barrack... </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="5163">A: Oh, but you know, when did I get it there? </sentence><sentence id="5164">When did I get the tattoo? </sentence><sentence id="5165">After we had the shower, after we had the shower, and we got the dress, we went there and we got the tattoo. </sentence><sentence id="5166">Before we went to the barrack - so, I must have had already my hair - I must have had my hair cut short already. </sentence><sentence id="5167">I - I was already with shaven head. </sentence><sentence id="5168">I was the only one. </sentence><sentence id="5169">Everybody had had hair to here because, you know, when we went to - they wouldn't have touched us. </sentence><sentence id="5170">This is my logic now - they wouldn't have touched us before they disinfected us. </sentence><sentence id="5171">Don't forget when we were - when we went under the shower, we shed our clothes and we got whatever clothes to put on. </sentence><sentence id="5172">We were already, like, we were already clean. </sentence><sentence id="5173">It was after the wash. </sentence><sentence id="5174">They sprayed such a horrible thing on us. </sentence><sentence id="5175">It smelled horrible, and it was stinging us because it was against - I don't know against what - a disinfectant. </sentence><sentence id="5176">So, I'm positive that they wouldn't have touched our hair if we didn't go through disinfection before. </sentence><sentence id="5177">That's my logic now; I don't remember the sequence. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="5315">A: Now I'll tell you the story. </sentence><sentence id="5316">I, myself - okay, we came in. </sentence><sentence id="5317">They gave us a barrack, three rows of bunks, bigger bunks than we had, but I would say six - five to six people slept. </sentence><sentence id="5318">We had to sleep like sardines. </sentence><sentence id="5319">One this way, one this way, one this way, because - and they were boards, just boards, because in camp in Starachowice, we had straw underneath. </sentence><sentence id="5320">Here, you know, like it was a straw sack with straw inside. </sentence><sentence id="5321">So, it wasn't so bad. </sentence><sentence id="5322">This was on the bare thing and we - there wasn't enough room to sleep one way. </sentence><sentence id="5323">We had to have the heads one way... But now I'm going back, because when we arrived, there was a little window similar enough to the windows without bars, but similar to the window in the train that I told you, a small just to let some light in. </sentence><sentence id="5324">So, 1, you know, I'm tall, so I stood there and I see - I see there's a man there, and I looked at - I looked, it was myself, but I didn't know. </sentence><sentence id="5325">So, I say, "Man!" </sentence><sentence id="5326">I looked out this way. </sentence><sentence id="5327">I don't see any man, but then I looked in the mirror, and there's a man there. </sentence><sentence id="5328">So, I started moving my head. </sentence><sentence id="5329">I realized that's me. </sentence><sentence id="5330">I didn't recognize myself. </sentence><sentence id="5331">I would never believe. </sentence><sentence id="5332">I was very skinny at the time and very tall, and my head looked like a pin drop, like with the hair, you know, my head was very small by comparison. </sentence><sentence id="5333">Like, I couldn't recognize myself, and it was funny because one day I was walking the streets and, you know, the men was coming - were coming to do the toilets in the ladies" - the ladies didn't clean - it wasn't a toilet - how do you call it when there are only holes? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="5353">Q: The latrine. </sentence><sentence id="5354"> 9 </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="5357">A: The latrines. </sentence><sentence id="5358">The men were coming to clean the latrine and one of our guys, a boy from Germany - I remember his name, Lothar - he was picked to clean the toilets. </sentence><sentence id="5359">So, he came in and he saw me. </sentence><sentence id="5360">He was so happy. </sentence><sentence id="5361">He comes, he says, "Tell Hania that your father is alive." </sentence><sentence id="5362">I looked at him and I was so vain, I didn't tell him for a minute that I was Hania, because I didn't want anybody to know that I looked like that. </sentence><sentence id="5363">He didn't - I don't know - I don't know. </sentence><sentence id="5364">I didn't ask him, but I came home and I said, "I'm so glad he didn't recognize me." </sentence><sentence id="5365">Like, people are stupid. </sentence><sentence id="5366">I mean, I'm talking about myself. </sentence><sentence id="5367">So, then we went into the barrack. </sentence><sentence id="5368">The barrack was run by four people. </sentence><sentence id="5369">There was the Lager Alteste, which was responsible for the barrack. </sentence><sentence id="5370">There were two thousand people going in one barrack, you can imagine how many people. </sentence><sentence id="5371">So, there was the Lager Alteste. </sentence><sentence id="5372">She was a Czechoslovakian girl. </sentence><sentence id="5373">Her name was Yolichka (ph). </sentence><sentence id="5374">Then there was a Shreiberin who had a job like I had. </sentence><sentence id="5375">She kept records who went to work, and she was doing all the office work. </sentence><sentence id="5376">Her name was Felicia Berlant (ph). </sentence><sentence id="5377">She's still alive. </sentence><sentence id="5378">She saved our lives. </sentence><sentence id="5379">She was the Shreiberin. </sentence><sentence id="5380">Then there were two Steuben Alteste. </sentence><sentence id="5381">The barrack was divided in four and each Steuben Alteste which was responsible for this part - for like two parts of the barrack on this side, and two parts of the barrack on that side. </sentence><sentence id="5382">She kept, she kept, she made us clean the places where you slept. </sentence><sentence id="5383">She made us responsible for, responsible for cleanliness, that's all, and order in the places. </sentence><sentence id="5384">When we arrived, this Yolichka (ph) spoke Czech to us, but we understood. </sentence><sentence id="5385">This Fela Berlant (ph), she got the job because she could scream the most and she had a language similar to Vaschek (ph). </sentence><sentence id="5386">So, when we arrived and we didn't stay straight she says, "You..." - I have to translate it because - "Quiet, you whores from Starachowice." </sentence><sentence id="5387">She didn't call us any other - not that she was bad. </sentence><sentence id="5388">She saved our lives and many other people. </sentence><sentence id="5389">She was a good woman, but otherwise she wouldn't have had the job if she didn't speak like that. </sentence><sentence id="5390">She called us names of all sorts. </sentence><sentence id="5391">And when we arrived, and we got the job, we were working outside the camp, outside the camp, and we were cutting bulrushes in wetland. </sentence><sentence id="5392">So, we stood always in cold water, wetland, cutting, and those - we had those knives that the Germans gave us at the place of work already, that we had to cut, but it was so woody, like it was so hard. </sentence><sentence id="5393">It was the hardest job I ever had. </sentence><sentence id="5394">My hands were bleeding because the bulrushes when they grow for such a long time, they become woody, and to cut it with a knife it's very hard. </sentence><sentence id="5395">He had - he had german shepherds, like he took us to work. </sentence><sentence id="5396">We cut it. </sentence><sentence id="5397">We were cutting those bushes, two german shepherds - like, I don't know how many of the guards were there that took us, but two huge german shepherds and as a matter of fact, the first day he taught me a lesson. </sentence><sentence id="5398">Of course, I was picked because I was tall again. </sentence><sentence id="5399">So, he wanted to show us that if - because we were outside the camp and the reason why they were cutting those bushes because they wanted to clean up the barbed wire walls in order, if somebody wanted to run away and hide there or if there was a partisan attack or some attack, so they could hide in those bulrushes. </sentence><sentence id="5400">So, we had to cut them. </sentence><sentence id="5401">So, he wanted to show us what would happen to everybody - to anybody that intends to run away. </sentence><sentence id="5402">So, he called his dog and he told him to - he told him to start biting my dress, and he must have told him in German, because he didn't touch me. </sentence><sentence id="5403">He just tear my dress to pieces, and of course, I froze because I am afraid of dogs, like especially touch, you know, the mean dogs that bark so, and the teeth were so bad, and he stopped at him at a certain time and started again. </sentence><sentence id="5404">So, the dog didn't bite me, but he bit, like, my dress was in shreds. </sentence><sentence id="5405">I got another  0 dress from Fela when I went back. </sentence><sentence id="5406">But, that was a time when I was really scared, very scared, because I thought the dog was going to kill me. </sentence><sentence id="5407">So, I just stood there, and so we worked there for three months. </sentence><sentence id="5408">After three months... </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="5461">Q: Let me ask you something. </sentence><sentence id="5462">Did you take your shoes off, the wooden shoes? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="5465">A: Yeah, no, I - I didn't have any other shoes. </sentence><sentence id="5466">I had to wear the wooden shoes. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="5469">Q: So, you wore the wooden shoes in the marshes? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="5471">A: In the marshes - no, in the marshes we took off the shoes. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="5473">Q: So, you were barefoot? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="5475">A: And, as a matter of fact, we even washed our dresses as much because we didn't get them so often, maybe every two weeks or so. </sentence><sentence id="5476">We didn't go to showers every day, you know, the showers - I'll tell you a story about, a separate story, but when I came home Fela gave me right away another dress. </sentence><sentence id="5477">So, that was okay. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="5481">Q: One second - how are we doing? </sentence><sentence id="5482">Okay let's change the tape. </sentence><sentence id="5483">You had showers there? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="5487">A: Not showers, we went every week they took us to such a place where they were - once a week we went... End of Tape #10  1 Tape #11 </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="5490">Q: Okay. </sentence><sentence id="5491">We were talking about the marshes and the dog, but you were also beginning to talk about the fact that you had, not exactly showers, but you could wash. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="5494">A: Yeah, we were going to - I don't - in Birkenau, in another section, where they had a place where most likely they were taking the inmates - I call them inmates - regularly, once a week or once every ten days, whatever time, you know, and we were going to those things to have showers. </sentence><sentence id="5495">So, I don't know how often I did that, I don't remember, but I think once a week or once every ten days. </sentence><sentence id="5496">When we arrived there, we undressed, they took our clothes, they put it through the same function, like they gave us - okay, what they had to do to put this stuff to disinfect all the dresses. </sentence><sentence id="5497">So, they gave us - they took another bunch that they already disinfected from another group, and they gave it to us, and we had a new dress, but each time it was a new old dress. </sentence><sentence id="5498">Each time, I had to fight to get the longest, but I was very lucky. </sentence><sentence id="5499">The girls always cooperated with me because otherwise they would have to have a dress like this. </sentence><sentence id="5500">So, that was the procedure. </sentence><sentence id="5501">So, whenever we went there, German soldiers would come - like, we would be - I mean, this wasn't in the plan, but I think that was the character that they wanted to do it - they would come to the room where we were, and they would take a hose with cold water, put it on the highest tension, and they would just not only tease the girls, but they would come and they would just try to spray you with this - with all the force in your private parts. </sentence><sentence id="5502">If you screamed or you danced, they did worse to you. </sentence><sentence id="5503">So, we knew that we had to stand still. </sentence><sentence id="5504">We had to disregard it. </sentence><sentence id="5505">We had to say nothing, just stand there and pretend that it doesn't happen to you. </sentence><sentence id="5506">So, that - so, we weren't looking forward to the showers so much because we had to suffer, and nobody - I'm sure that it wasn't like, it wasn't meant to be like that, but they did it. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="5520">Q: Do you remember which barrack you were in? </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="6111">Q: What did you hear and what did you read? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="6113">A: That's what it is - I read all the orders. </sentence><sentence id="6114">I knew that the war is being lost. </sentence><sentence id="6115">I knew - I read all those - the letters that he gathered. </sentence><sentence id="6116">That's how we ran away. </sentence><sentence id="6117">Renia was cleaning another room. </sentence><sentence id="6118">I would go back to Krysia - how she fed us. </sentence><sentence id="6119">She was marvelous, but I'Il go back to this portion. </sentence><sentence id="6120">I'1l just talk now about this situation here. </sentence><sentence id="6121">So, I read everything and then, the Russians were already so close that he got orders that on such and such a date to let everybody go except the guards, because they weren't sending the Jews anymore to work, because they had to go out of the camp. </sentence><sentence id="6122">So, that - we had the - like, we were Poles, but we took off our triangles because then the people that work outside had white crosses across the back with the paint. </sentence><sentence id="6123">Like, whatever - if you worked outside, you had the white cross painted like this right across the back. </sentence><sentence id="6124">So, Krysia and I, we came to a conclusion that she works in the kitchen, she gets some flour and water, and she'll be able to make the crosses, new crosses, on our clothes, because we - we had clothes there. </sentence><sentence id="6125">We were also distributed some clothes for us because it was a small camp. </sentence><sentence id="6126">It wasn't a big camp. </sentence><sentence id="6127">We were all girls. </sentence><sentence id="6128">And this, we decided that we are going to run away, but we had to have a strategy. </sentence><sentence id="6129">We had a Jewish girl from Lublin. </sentence><sentence id="6130">She was blonde and had blue eyes, and she spoke perfect German. </sentence><sentence id="6131">She was one of us working in the barracks because there were either ten or twelve of us working the barracks. </sentence><sentence id="6132">I don't remember. </sentence><sentence id="6133">Since she could speak so well German, we decided that she's going to steal the kapo's - you know, kapos were wearing a black cape, a black cape what covered whatever - they didn't wear uniforms, just a black cape with a hood. </sentence><sentence id="6134">So, she stole this hood from her, and then Krysia - we decided that what we can do to take the crosses off, all we had to do is this, is to just crumbled the - like we had to wear the crosses inside, but in order to get outside, to run away from camp - I knew exactly because my boss didn't come to work that day. </sentence><sentence id="6135">I don't know whether he came later or so, because it was ten days before the end of the war - ten  01 or twelve days before the end of the war. </sentence><sentence id="6136">So, in the morning, we got up this Helena was her name - she put on the cape, we made sure that there was no sign of the cross, and she - we came to the gate. </sentence><sentence id="6137">She told the post that she registers with him ten people going to work outside, whatever - she knew what to say, where outside, and he says - he showed us to go. </sentence><sentence id="6138">We went to the road, and all - from there on, we didn't have to worry because all the Germans were running towards west. </sentence><sentence id="6139">They were afraid. </sentence><sentence id="6140">The Russians were very close, so the Germans were leaving their homes and everything marching, running away from the Russians. </sentence><sentence id="6141">They were afraid. </sentence><sentence id="6142">So, we were in the group. </sentence><sentence id="6143">Nobody noticed us. </sentence><sentence id="6144">Nobody bothered us, but we didn't have what to eat and we didn't know what to do. </sentence><sentence id="6145">But, we run away. </sentence><sentence id="6146">We're out of the camp. </sentence><sentence id="6147">As a matter of fact, one girl from Radom that I suggested that she goes with us, she didn't want to go because she had - somebody gave her spreads - some sardines, a box of sardines. </sentence><sentence id="6148">She had it with someone. </sentence><sentence id="6149">She didn't want to leave it, or she didn't - she didn't want to give it to her, and she didn't want - because she wanted to eat it, she didn't want to run away. </sentence><sentence id="6150">So, they went to another camp from there, you know, after - the Russians were - they must have gotten orders to go more west, but we were already free. </sentence><sentence id="6151">So, we - that was it. </sentence><sentence id="6152">Those were the camps. </sentence><sentence id="6153">Now, Krysia - she worked in the kitchen so, she stuck, you know, she cooked and she - she was sending to us - she was working on the second floor and so, we - we used to go under - stand under the kitchen and have our metal thing with the handle. </sentence><sentence id="6154">She would push down a string. </sentence><sentence id="6155">We would put the string on the handle. </sentence><sentence id="6156">She roped it, and she would take - because there was meat, like horse meat, but we didn't get it; the Germans - the Germans got it. </sentence><sentence id="6157">We only got the soup. </sentence><sentence id="6158">So, she would take a tongue or whatever, you know, she had there a big piece - a big piece of meat she would send it back. </sentence><sentence id="6159">We would take it and divide among all the girls. </sentence><sentence id="6160">So, everybody had something, not only something to eat, but we were not used to such - so rich food. </sentence><sentence id="6161">It was tremendous. </sentence><sentence id="6162">One day she tells me this story. </sentence><sentence id="6163">She worked there. </sentence><sentence id="6164">She stole a pound of butter. </sentence><sentence id="6165">It was, you know, one of those pounds in foil, and she says she didn't know what to do with it because, I mean, the Germans was - her boss, the German cook, was watching her. </sentence><sentence id="6166">So, she put it in her pants so that she could take the butter to take to us, and when she started working and cleaning up, the butter started dripping, and she got so scared she almost died. </sentence><sentence id="6167">She - but anyway, she managed somehow to bring the butter - the butter to feed us. </sentence><sentence id="6168">So, we really in Retzow we didn't have a bad day, because she was supplying all the food. </sentence><sentence id="6169">She was stealing it, but she was supplying all the food and nobody - all the girls that knew, they noticed that I went out to get whatever, they were already waiting. </sentence><sentence id="6170">I mean everybody was hungry. </sentence><sentence id="6171">So, that was also lucky. </sentence><sentence id="6172">We were lucky there. </sentence><sentence id="6173">But, this is all about Retzow. </sentence><sentence id="6174">There's very - we don't have much to say about it because we weren't there too long. </sentence></p></dialogue>
