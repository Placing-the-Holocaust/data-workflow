<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="139">Q: Why was it so important? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="141">A: It was important because I wanted to be one of them, because I felt so persecuted as a Jew that I felt that - I just wanted - at that time, when I was a kid - don't forget, that that was at the time when I was nine, eight, ten, you know - I wanted to be one of them at that time. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="147">A: Actually, I felt it because I noticed that we had - in our town, there was a lot of religious Jews. </sentence><sentence id="148">Most of the Jewish people that lived in Wierzbnik were religious, and I always saw Polacks, throwing stones at them, talking to them in a way that it was ridiculing them, and so - I, personally, since I was just a child at the time, I didn't feel it, and being with the Polish girls, you know, associating with them, I didn't feel it, but I saw it on the outside, and that's why maybe I wanted to be one of them. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="151">Q: Did you yourself feel uncomfortable with the very Orthodox Jews? </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="152">A: To a point, because they - they couldn't speak Polish. </sentence><sentence id="153">I mean, they spoke Polish with an accent. </sentence><sentence id="154">They spoke mostly, among themselves, they spoke Yiddish, and being so very religious, they had a certain mannerism that distinguished them for the other people. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="158">They were dressed differently. </sentence><sentence id="159">They acted differently. </sentence><sentence id="160">They spoke differently. </sentence><sentence id="161">So, but I identified with them, but sometimes I felt a little bit uncomfortable with them. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="188">Q: Was that an ordinary thing? </sentence><sentence id="189">Why did that happen? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="192">A: No, because I was a good student and we had what they call Gymnasium, which was a high school in Starachowice, but it wasn't one of the best. </sentence><sentence id="193">In Radom, there was - there was one of the best girls" school, but it was almost impossible to get in for the Jews. </sentence><sentence id="194">At first, we had numerus klausus (ph), which meant one Jewish girl for 45 students in a class would be accepted, and then in the later years it was numerus nolus (ph), which means none of the Jewish girls could be accepted. </sentence><sentence id="195">So, I was lucky. </sentence><sentence id="196">You have to pass a competitive exam, and you had to really be very, very good to be accepted. </sentence><sentence id="197">So, my mother tried - she sent me there and I passed the exam, and at the end of the year, she found out that I was accepted. </sentence><sentence id="198">So, for her it was the biggest achievement that she could ever achieve at the time which - and I went to that school there and I lived on my own. </sentence><sentence id="199">Like, I had relatives, but my mother placed me in a - like she rented a room, with like there were kids there my age. </sentence><sentence id="200">So, she rented a room with a family, and that's where I stayed. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="210">Q: Did that scare you to go away? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="212">A: At first it did. </sentence><sentence id="213">As a matter of fact, I cried for a long time before I went there, and when I found myself there, I also felt a little bit strange, but soon I got used to it, and I got to know all the people my age and a year older or a year younger, because they were several schools in Radom. </sentence><sentence id="214">It was a big city with 100,000 people there. </sentence><sentence id="215">They had several different schools. </sentence><sentence id="216">They even had a Jewish high school, called Pzhiachu Wierze (ph), which meant  "friends of knowledge", if I were to translate it exactly. </sentence><sentence id="217">So, there were a lot of Jewish kids that were educated in Starachowice, Wierzbnik. </sentence><sentence id="218">The religious people didn't send the girls to high school because of the fact that they had to go to school on Shabbat. </sentence><sentence id="219">You know, because we had six days of school. </sentence><sentence id="220">So, the parents wouldn't let them do that. </sentence><sentence id="221">So, they had a lot of other schools that were connected with the religious movement. </sentence><sentence id="222">But in Radom, the parents were a little bit - I mean, it was a bigger city, and there was a lot of young people that were going to those different schools, and the schools were much better than in Wierzbnik. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="234">Q: Was it kind of exciting to be in a much larger city? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="236">A: Well, once I got to know the people my age, I felt very good there. </sentence><sentence id="237">As a matter of fact, until today, I have a lot of friends from Radom. </sentence><sentence id="238">And, as a matter of fact, my husband made a party for them all like at the cottage a year before he died. </sentence><sentence id="239">There was fifty of us. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="256">A: Yes, that's true. [ </sentence><sentence id="257">Laughs.] </sentence><sentence id="258">It was -talking about home, when he counted, he counted in German, because he was educated in German. </sentence><sentence id="259">I count - no matter what language I speak - if I have to count, I count in Polish. </sentence><sentence id="260">My husband, no matter what language he spoke, he would count in Yiddish. </sentence><sentence id="261">And since you are talking about languages.... </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="268">Q: How do you account for that? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="270">A: I think you - like I was used to speaking - we spoke Polish at home. </sentence><sentence id="271">So, I was used to speaking Polish all the time, and because I suppose that I got used to counting. </sentence><sentence id="272">I think it's very normal. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="276">Q: Did you write home a great deal? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="278">A: Well, I did write home. </sentence><sentence id="279">Every week my mother would send me home-baking and stuff like that, a parcel, and then, whoever would travel to Radom, she would send something for me. </sentence><sentence id="280">So, when this person came I wrote a letter to my parents. </sentence><sentence id="281">We didn't have a telephone at all. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="286">Q: Did you write to your sisters? </sentence><sentence id="287">Or does the one letter count? </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="288">A: One letter. </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="289">Q: Did they write to you? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="291">A: No. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="293">Q: No? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="295">A: No, because we were, you know, for every holy day, I went home. </sentence><sentence id="296">As a matter of fact, the month of September, since Radom was about sixty kilometers away from Wierzbnik, it was a two hour ride on the train because I had to change trains half way. </sentence><sentence id="297">So, at the beginning, I didn't want to go back to Radom because when I was at home it felt so good to be at home. </sentence><sentence id="298">So, the first month, I was traveling every day to Radom and back. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="303">Q: Every day? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="305">A: Every day to get home. </sentence><sentence id="306">But then, then later when the days became shorter, I stayed there. </sentence><sentence id="307">But I had a very, very good life in Radom because, as a say, I had lots of friends there. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1019">Q: deg33 or 737? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1021">A: No, he lost his - the government job in "33, and then he started working in the same capacity for private enterprise, which wasn't the same, and the reason why they let him go because they didn't want to pay his pension, or because he was Jewish, they didn't want to pay his pension. </sentence><sentence id="1022">So, my parents went - they struggled but we lived normally like any other, because the Jewish people - the Jewish population, especially the religious ones, they were tradesmen, small businessmen. </sentence><sentence id="1023">They were all poor, like, they weren't rich people. </sentence><sentence id="1024">So, although we were quite - we lived quite modestly, we weren't any different than any other people. </sentence><sentence id="1025">I remember, my mother learned a trade but it was, you know, I don't really remember exactly what - my father was also selling something. </sentence><sentence id="1026">I couldn't tell you really exactly what they did during the war. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1114">Q: Hania, I want to take us back to your life in Radom, because I think it's important for us to get a sense of what it meant for you to be that independent, and how different it was for you to be home than for your other sisters to be home. </sentence><sentence id="1115">So, let's talk a little about what your life was like during that time and some incidences that happened to you. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1118">A: Well, I lived in - my mother used to rent a room for me in a friend's place or whatever and I lived there for the 10 months; for the vacation I went home. </sentence><sentence id="1119">And she did the best she could. </sentence><sentence id="1120">She washed my laundry every week. </sentence><sentence id="1121">I sent her my laundry to be washed at home because I didn't have the facilities. </sentence><sentence id="1122">And every week she would send me the home baking and the best she could, she could afford to buy at the time: some fruits that were imported that were so expensive that only the sick ones would get them sometimes. </sentence><sentence id="1123">And I was very good at school, so I had no problem there. </sentence><sentence id="1124">I always had straight A's. </sentence><sentence id="1125">My parents were very proud of me; they were always bragging. </sentence><sentence id="1126">And I also tutored French, and I was paid for those lessons, so this was my spending money. </sentence><sentence id="1127">We could go to a movie or for ice cream, like, we were going in groups, but it was expensive, so I could afford to pay for it because I was making some money there. </sentence><sentence id="1128">And for holidays, I usually used to come home, but for the Yom Kippur and the Rosh Hashana, I not always could because it was the beginning of school and I didn't want to miss - don't forget, I was the only Jewish girl in our class, so I couldn't afford to miss a week of school at the very beginning. </sentence><sentence id="1129">So, I remember, one year I was living with the professor, the professor's family, and for the holidays, I also had an aunt living, an aunt and uncle in Radom. </sentence><sentence id="1130">My uncle was the brother of my father, but I didn't live with them. </sentence><sentence id="1131">I lived with this family. </sentence><sentence id="1132">And the lady of the house asked me what am I going to do for the holidays. </sentence><sentence id="1133">So, I couldn't say "nothing" because I didn't want to be invited by them, because it is a family holiday and they had their family. </sentence><sentence id="1134">So, she says, "What are you going to do?" </sentence><sentence id="1135">So, I said to her, "My aunt invited me for dinner." </sentence><sentence id="1136">So she said, "Oh, that's good." </sentence><sentence id="1137">So when they sat at the table, I went out  on the street, and you know, that was - all the smells were so, I mean, so inviting everywhere. </sentence><sentence id="1138">And I wasn't invited to my aunt's for the holidays. </sentence><sentence id="1139">I was walking the streets until I got tired, and I sat down on a stone somewhere near the road and started crying. </sentence><sentence id="1140">I cried myself to death. </sentence><sentence id="1141">I was so hungry and I was thinking of the house and I was envious of my sisters being there, you know, with the whole family and eating well and all. </sentence><sentence id="1142">So, I really felt very bad and I couldn't go home until they finished the dinner because I went to my aunt's officially, so when I came home, and they were already - I heard the dishes being washed and put away - and I went to bed. </sentence><sentence id="1143">I was so hungry. </sentence><sentence id="1144">I was so hungry, so I cried all night. </sentence><sentence id="1145">That's how I remember one of the incidents of being independent. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1174">Q: And why, were you not close with your aunt? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1176">A: No, my aunt was very envious that I was - from the beginning, when I was accepted, when my mother brought me to Radom and when I passed the exam and the results were being, like, "til the end of the summer, the results were unknown. </sentence><sentence id="1177">So, my aunt says to my mother, "What do you expect? </sentence><sentence id="1178">You come from a small town there, and you come from Wierzbnik, that they'1l accept you with open arms? </sentence><sentence id="1179">First of all, she has to pass as the best exam because she's Jewish. </sentence><sentence id="1180">Secondly, what do you expect? </sentence><sentence id="1181">They have in Radom a lot of people that they know, and they're prominent people, that they'1l accept you?" </sentence><sentence id="1182">And she says, "The hair will grow on my wrist if she would be accepted." </sentence><sentence id="1183">So, anyway, towards the end, my mother registered - at the same time, she registered me at the Jewish gymnasium. </sentence><sentence id="1184">And when she came to look at the results, she went by herself because she was sure that I won't be accepted. </sentence><sentence id="1185">So, she went there and, sure enough, I was accep- my name was there, so she fainted. </sentence><sentence id="1186">And then my aunt and the whole family wanted to be sure that this is true, they all went to see whether it's true. </sentence><sentence id="1187">But that wasn't the only - I talked to her many times. </sentence><sentence id="1188">We had many conversations because she was in America. </sentence><sentence id="1189">And she knows that she did me wrong. </sentence><sentence id="1190">But she had two sons and she says that she didn't want me to live in her house because the sons were my age, and that was her explanation. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1222">Q: And I understand that the packages she would send you... </sentence></p></dialogue>

I don't know. </sentence><sentence id="1614">I don't remember where she worked. </sentence><sentence id="1615">A few days later, and Vaschek (ph) was in charge of the other Lager, came to inspect what - because he was actually in charge of the two Lagers; Pohl was in the smaller camp. </sentence><sentence id="1616">He came to the office. </sentence><sentence id="1617">He looked at my work, and he says, "You know what?" </sentence><sentence id="1618">I think that because he liked the way I wrote those lists, you know, those - we started - what did we do at the office? </sentence><sentence id="1619">We kept  records of all the people that lived there. </sentence><sentence id="1620">Everyone had a card. </sentence><sentence id="1621">On the card, it was his name, the barrack number, because, I mean, the date of birth, and the barrack number, and where he worked. </sentence><sentence id="1622">Then, from those cards, we were making up lists - daily work lists - because they were different departments in the factory and those workers, like, in the morning, you would call the names and they would go to those, and the next day maybe they were changed. </sentence><sentence id="1623">So, I was making all those lists. </sentence><sentence id="1624">So, I remember Vaschek (ph) liked the way I make the lists and he says, "From now on," he sent my father. </sentence><sentence id="1625">So, Krysia was with my father, and since Renia was in Strzelnica, I was sent to Strzelnica to do the work there, to work in the office. </sentence><sentence id="1626">Now, I'll just mention it, because if somebody died, was killed, whatever, most of the people were very strong, the ones that committed themselves to work, so they didn't die the normal way. </sentence><sentence id="1627">Most of them were either killed here or there. </sentence><sentence id="1628">We used to write down in the Polish "deceased", and we kept the cards separate. </sentence><sentence id="1629">Otherwise, we knew exactly how many people we have in each camp. </sentence><sentence id="1630">Tartak (ph) was a separate unit. </sentence><sentence id="1631">They had their own office and their own people. </sentence><sentence id="1632">They - it wasn't connected. </sentence><sentence id="1633">But those two camps were connected. </sentence></p></dialogue>

we had the Lagerfiihrer, which was responsible for the camp. </sentence><sentence id="1768">He lived outside of camp, but he was there all day. </sentence><sentence id="1769">That was in Strzelnica. </sentence><sentence id="1770">I'1l talk about Strzelnica because I was there the longest. </sentence><sentence id="1771">His name was Vaschek (ph). </sentence><sentence id="1772">He was a sudetendeutche (ph), which means he came from Czechoslovakia. </sentence><sentence id="1773">He spoke Czechoslovakian, Czech, so we could understand. </sentence><sentence id="1774">He could understand Polish, and he had the green uniform, and he was - he had a very foul language. </sentence><sentence id="1775">He talked so badly, but he had - he was the only one that had a heart, the only one, because he never - he would always screamed at the people, screamed at and swore at them, even at me, like he called me all kinds of name, but I didn't pay attention because I knew that he had a heart. </sentence><sentence id="1776">He never touched a Jew, although he had this rubber stick. </sentence><sentence id="1777">He would pick it up and he would scream, "Get the hell out of here." </sentence><sentence id="1778">And he was screaming, but he never - to such a degree that once he told the Ukrainians, "No one touches my Jews. </sentence><sentence id="1779">Only I have the right to touch my Jews." </sentence><sentence id="1780">So, he wasn't so bad, and as a matter of fact, he was there for a long time. </sentence><sentence id="1781">I don't know why he was later let go. </sentence><sentence id="1782">He  went to Ostrowiec, which was a camp not far from us, and they tell me that he was horrible there. </sentence><sentence id="1783">So, I don't know. </sentence><sentence id="1784">He was the only German that I could say a good word about because the others were all murderers and, I mean, I'll tell you stories unbelievable stories. </sentence><sentence id="1785">Then we had - then we had in camp, above Vaschek (ph), Vaschek (ph) was in camp all the time. </sentence><sentence id="1786">Then there was a guy by the name of Meyer (ph) who was overseeing all the camps, but he would only come for an hour. </sentence><sentence id="1787">He would talk with Vaschek (ph).You know, they would walk and talk. </sentence><sentence id="1788">He wasn't yet - I mean, he wasn't good, but he wasn't yet as bad as the top man was called Altov (ph). </sentence><sentence id="1789">He was the most horrible killer that one, I mean, he was - he was killing Jews and when he arrived into the camp, he wanted everybody to freeze in the place where - if you walked you had to stand up. </sentence><sentence id="1790">He jumped over fences. </sentence><sentence id="1791">He killed from all kinds of situations, like he would sit down, he would jump, he would kill people that appeared on his way, and we will just make a note then at the office that is deceased. </sentence><sentence id="1792">He was the worst of them, and apparently I heard that he was from a family because there was as I said called Altov (ph), apparently in Germany a very famous circus. </sentence><sentence id="1793">So, he must have been an acrobat, because the way he behaved, I mean, only an acrobat could kill people from all positions like him. </sentence><sentence id="1794">Everybody was so scared of him that I didn't even look in his - I don't even - I don't remember his face because when he came to the office and asked for Vaschek (ph), I would pretend that - I was afraid to look up. </sentence><sentence id="1795">So, that was the worst. </sentence><sentence id="1796">Then, in the factories we had - we had people. </sentence><sentence id="1797">Okay. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1849">Q: Can I ask you a question about somebody like Altov (ph)? </sentence><sentence id="1850">How did you - how did you make sense then or how do you make sense now of this kind of brutality? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1853">A: I think that he was not accepted by the Germans because I think - he didn't have a uniform, he didn't have an SS, most likely because we found out later, whether it's true or not, we met his mother in Auschwitz and she was a gypsy. </sentence><sentence id="1854">Whether this was the same Mrs. Altov (ph), but if must have been because I talked personally with her. </sentence><sentence id="1855">When I heard that she was an Altov (ph), I went and I talked to her. </sentence><sentence id="1856">And the way she described him, it must have been her son, and she says she was a gypsy and they were in the circus business. </sentence><sentence id="1857">So, I can't tell you, but he wasn't an SS man. </sentence><sentence id="1858">Everybody was afraid of him. </sentence><sentence id="1859">The Judenrat was afraid of him. </sentence><sentence id="1860">They were hardly talking to him, and I'm telling you, I mean I would freeze. </sentence><sentence id="1861">I put my eyes down, I so was afraid, and I kept my shoulders up because I was afraid that he would shoot me in a minute. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1871">Q: But, the Germans didn't stop him. </sentence><sentence id="1872">They didn't care that he was doing this. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1875">A: They didn't care. </sentence><sentence id="1876">He was the worst and he was - his title was Stumfiihrer (ph). </sentence><sentence id="1877">Then we had - and Meyer (ph) died, I think, yes, he died. </sentence><sentence id="1878">So, he was replaced by a guy called Colditz (ph). </sentence><sentence id="1879">He was very fat man. </sentence><sentence id="1880">He was also screaming. </sentence><sentence id="1881">He was almost as bad as Altov (ph). </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1889">Q: On the Judenrat. </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1890">A: No, no, he was almost as bad as Altov (ph) by his behavior like when he was coming they'd he also demanded to freeze, people to freeze, and then they were the people, the Sicherheit Polizei, which was the, like - I don't know how to say encavudei (ph) in Russian, how do Sicherheit Polizei (ph), they were... </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1891">Q: Intelligence police? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1893">A: Intelligence police. </sentence><sentence id="1894">Okay? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1897">Q: Maybe security police. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1899">A: That's right, Sicherheit (ph). </sentence><sentence id="1900">And, I'll tell you stories about him, what he did to people, because I'll give specific stories about him, horrible man, horrible. </sentence><sentence id="1901">Then there was Kashmider (ph), and who was in charge of, like - the Germans were - the Germans soldiers, the German officials who were wearing uniforms were in charge of the place where the Jews worked. </sentence><sentence id="1902">So, they would come and look around and change workers and stuff like that. </sentence><sentence id="1903">Those were the people that accepted all sorts of bribes, you know, to take somebody to work or to change his job, you know, what it was. </sentence><sentence id="1904">So, they used to come to the, for conferences, to the Judenrat, but it wasn't a conference. </sentence><sentence id="1905">They had to be prepared with bribes. </sentence><sentence id="1906">There was another one. </sentence><sentence id="1907">I think I gave you all the names already. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1917">Q: Can I ask you something? </sentence><sentence id="1918">I think most people assume that Judenrat was a function inside a ghetto, as opposed to a labor camp. </sentence><sentence id="1919">Was this camp somehow in between being a labor camp and a ghetto? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1923">A: No, that was the labor camp, and those people were - maybe the Judenrat was the same people who were in the ghetto. </sentence><sentence id="1924">The same as they took me and my father because we were in Arbeitsamt, maybe that's why we got into the office. </sentence><sentence id="1925">Otherwise, I mean, I don't know how we could get into the office if they didn't see us writing there and keeping records. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1929">Q: Was you in somewhat of a privileged position because of the job? </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1937">Q: So, whatever... </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1939">A: I slept in the same barrack, and I wasn't in any privileged position at - they never spoke to me, nobody except for my boss, that Vaschek (ph). </sentence><sentence id="1940">He was the only one that talked to me; otherwise, nobody else talked to me ever. </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1941">Q: Did you actually have conversations with Vaschek (ph)? </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1942">A: No, because he had such a foul mouth, I was afraid to, I mean, I wasn't afraid of him, but I just couldn't take the way he - I mean, he didn't mistreat me, but he called me all sorts of names, but it wasn't only to me. </sentence><sentence id="1943">He did that to everybody. </sentence><sentence id="1944">But that was only words. </sentence><sentence id="1945">That's why I say he had heart, because sometimes there were a few cases when I was saved because of him, because he sent me to the factory to work, to type letters, and type lists where they had - when they had some kind of action. </sentence><sentence id="1946">I only think like that because on two occasions, I was sent to the factory during selection, and the first time I thought I was lucky, but the second time, I thought maybe Vaschek (ph) did that. </sentence><sentence id="1947">Although he talked to me so badly, but I didn't care. </sentence><sentence id="1948">It was a good job. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1956">Q: So, how regularly were there selections? </sentence><sentence id="1957">Was it regular or was it just...? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1960">A: No, only sometimes, and the selections were only when people were sick. </sentence><sentence id="1961">So, I'll tell you those stories separately because it was very important how they were treating it. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1964">Q: So, you're now in this - are you with Renia or with your father? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1966">A: No, my father and Krysia were in - on Majowka, and Renia and I were there for awhile, and then later - I don't - this I don't remember exactly how it happened, because they brought all the people from Majowka to Strzelnica and then from Strzelnica to Majowka. </sentence><sentence id="1967">You know, it was, I don't remember exactly what time and when, but Strzelnica was the bigger camp, the bigger camp, but then later we were all moved to Majowka. </sentence><sentence id="1968">At first, because for a time I was with my father and Krysia, and for a time I was away from them. </sentence><sentence id="1969">I don't really remember when it was, what year it was, because I'm sure that Krysia must have been - they must have taken them from Strzelnica to Majowka maybe first and then to - they made one camp at a certain time, maybe for repairs or for other things, I couldn't tell you. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1974">Q: But, when you went to Majowka, is Majowka larger than 500 people or was it was still only 500 people? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1976">A: Five hundred people, but maybe they - maybe they enlarged it meanwhile, because, you know, later on they were taking us, towards the end - towards the end, we were taken to another camp altogether. </sentence><sentence id="1977">They were building a special camp for us, just to get rid of us, because it was near a train line. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1980">Q: Can you give us some idea of what these camps looked like? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1982">A: Yes. </sentence><sentence id="1983">When you walked in, there was a gate and there was a tower. </sentence><sentence id="1984">The Ukrainian was on the tower with a gun. </sentence><sentence id="1985">The Ukrainian that was at the gate also had a gun - did he have a gun or one of those sticks? </sentence><sentence id="1986">And, the office in Strzelnica was almost close to the gate, like, you walked and that was - such a barrack was an office, and then, I remember, there was  a kitchen there further away, where they were cooking the soup, and you would have to line up for the soup right away. </sentence><sentence id="1987">And there was a laundry where Renia later worked. </sentence><sentence id="1988">She worked in a laundry, and then there were the barracks. </sentence><sentence id="1989">The barracks were separate from the men and separate for the women, and I don't remember how many of the barracks were there, but we slept two on one cot, and... </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2008">A: I suppose they had - there was no camps before, so they must have made them specially when we were in ghettos, because there were no camps there before. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2066">A: Okay, there was - there was a kitchen and some of the people worked in the kitchen, and one of them was Salka Perinsweic (ph). </sentence><sentence id="2067">She was in charge of the kitchen, if that's important. </sentence><sentence id="2068">Every noon - or the main meal - I don't know if it was at twelve or at two o'clock, or whatever - the main meal we would get soup and we had to all line up for the soup. </sentence><sentence id="2069">The workers that went to the factories were getting their main mail in the factories. </sentence><sentence id="2070">So, there weren't that many people, only the workers inside, the people that weren't well, and the people that didn't go to work that day or whatever. </sentence><sentence id="2071">So, but she would - there were some metal plates painted white. </sentence><sentence id="2072">We would line up, get the food, and I'm sorry I don't remember where we ate, whether we took it to the barrack, whether we ate outside. </sentence><sentence id="2073">I don't remember any rooms that would be available for us to sit down at the table. </sentence><sentence id="2074">I don't remember. </sentence><sentence id="2075">Maybe there were. </sentence><sentence id="2076">I couldn't really tell you. </sentence><sentence id="2077">Then we would get bread in the morning, I think. </sentence><sentence id="2078">Each time, we had to line-up, but food, like, the morning breakfast wasn't so important because many times the workers that went to the factories were buying somehow or exchanging things with the Polacks and were bringing home some bread and some other stuff. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2092">Q: What was the soup made of? </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2106">A: A few people. </sentence><sentence id="2107">I would say that at least half of them, because don't forget that we had shift work, that some people were going to work at night, in the evening, I don't know whether we had three shifts, I think. </sentence><sentence id="2108">So, they were getting food at the factory or on the premises, but this Salka Perinsweic (ph) was, she was one of the inmates as | call it. </sentence><sentence id="2109">She was in charge of the kitchen. </sentence><sentence id="2110">That was her job. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2148">A: I would go very early because the first shift, if the shift was going, I had to give them the work list. </sentence><sentence id="2149">I had to prepare it for them. </sentence><sentence id="2150">So, if they went to work at seven o'clock, I had to be there, and I worked until the last shift would go to work and Vaschek (ph) - before Vaschek (ph) would go home and put all the records under the lock and key. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2154">Q: Did you make up the work lists or did Vaschek (ph) tell you who would be on it? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2156">A: No, I was told either by the policemen or like, I was, if there was any changes. </sentence><sentence id="2157">If the list was the same, I didn't have to change it. </sentence><sentence id="2158">I just - because I got reports that would say, "This was transferred to here." </sentence><sentence id="2159">So, I knew that the next day, I'd have to put this name on another list. </sentence><sentence id="2160">And I had to adjust the cards, as well. </sentence><sentence id="2161">I had to write on it, let's say if she worked, if he worked in Department A, as an example, I'm just saying. </sentence><sentence id="2162">So, if he was changed to C, I had to put it on his card too. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2170">Q: So, everybody in the camp had a kind of identity card. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2180">Q: How big? </sentence><sentence id="2181"> A They were small cards because all we had was the name, as I told you, the birth date, the barrack number where they lived or slept, and the department where they work, and a place whether he's still alive or dead. </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2182">Q: Now, did you type these lists? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2184">A: First, we didn't have like a typewriter in camp at first. </sentence><sentence id="2185">So, if he wanted typed lists or something, he would send me to the factory, Vaschek (ph) would. </sentence><sentence id="2186">But, if - but I had a very good handwriting, very legible, I remember, and that's why he took me to his place, because he could read so easily my writing, and I was doing it all by hand. </sentence><sentence id="2187">Later on, I remember, I don't know when, he brought a typewriter, an old typewriter, to the office. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2192">Q: Did you...? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2194">A: I didn't know how to type, but I pretended. </sentence><sentence id="2195">I said, "With two fingers, I type so fast." </sentence><sentence id="2196">I learned so fast. </sentence><sentence id="2197">I never learned how to type. </sentence><sentence id="2198">So, when he asked me if I could type, I had to say yes. </sentence><sentence id="2199">I mean, otherwise he" ll take somebody else to the office. </sentence><sentence id="2200">That was a good job. </sentence><sentence id="2201">So, I typed with my fingers and I learned to type so fast that I was faster than the others - to such a degree that, in my office later, when I worked for ourselves, I took typing classes and I could never learn because I was much faster with two fingers, the way I learned in camp. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2210">Q: And did you print when you were not using the typewriter or did you handwrite? </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3061">A: Because everything happened the same time. </sentence><sentence id="3062">So, maybe I'll start with Tobah (ph) because maybe it will be shorter. </sentence><sentence id="3063">I don't know that much about her, but about my husband's escape and the way that he bought the gun and stuff like that, it might be a little longer. </sentence><sentence id="3064">So, Tobah (ph) - one day Becker, who was the Sicherheit Deist, came in a car with another German soldiers and they came and asked for Tobah (ph), and they took her out of the camp. </sentence><sentence id="3065">We didn't know why. </sentence><sentence id="3066">Then, she came back. </sentence><sentence id="3067">We didn't know why. </sentence><sentence id="3068">Then, a few days later, he came for Tobah (ph) again. </sentence><sentence id="3069">Took her himself already. </sentence><sentence id="3070">He took her out again. </sentence><sentence id="3071">He was very polite. </sentence><sentence id="3072">I remember because I was near the office, like they brought her to the office, and you know, I could look through the window and see. </sentence><sentence id="3073">He opened the door for her, like if she was - like a girl, and he took her out and he brought her back the same day. </sentence><sentence id="3074">The third time, he took her out - I don't know if it was a few days or a week or two later - he took her out and he never brought her back. </sentence><sentence id="3075">Now, that day, he was ordered - her father was ordered to, to dig a grave, and of course, it was like, they called him to work. </sentence><sentence id="3076">He didn't know it was going to be for him. </sentence><sentence id="3077">So, he started digging but he was an older man. </sentence><sentence id="3078">It took him a little time. </sentence><sentence id="3079">So, Schrodt came out of his office, and he  took the gun and killed him on the spot. </sentence><sentence id="3080">The grave wasn't dug exactly - like, the grave was half-finished and he called other workers to cover him. </sentence><sentence id="3081">And she never came back. </sentence><sentence id="3082">Then we found out, because they were from Opatow - it was about, I would say, about 40 kilometers away from Wierzbnik. </sentence><sentence id="3083">Apparently, they had money - money or some goods or some jewelry. </sentence><sentence id="3084">I don't know. </sentence><sentence id="3085">She must have showed it to them, and after they got whatever they wanted, you know, the money, they just killed her. </sentence><sentence id="3086">I didn't know what happened to her because they didn't bring her to camp, but I was talking to the professor about her because he had - he had her - heard the story and his records. </sentence><sentence id="3087">He told me that he asked, whether he asked himself or whether one of those people that he - that he was talking to told him that she was - the grave was found later in the woods very close to where she lived - where they lived, where they found the treasures. </sentence><sentence id="3088">So, this was Tobjah Weisblum (ph) that's how she perished, and her father, for money. </sentence><sentence id="3089">Not only because they were Jews, but because they had money. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3119">Q: Why did they kill the father, do you think, at the moment? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3121">A: Because I suppose they decided they didn't want to have any witnesses because nobody knew why Tobjah Weisblum (ph) was taken out, nobody knew, and she never told anybody. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3123">Q: But the father knew? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3125">A: The father probably didn't knew. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3127">Q: Didn't know? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3129">A: Didn't know what for they are taking her out. </sentence><sentence id="3130">Because he was - when he was digging the grave, it was an older man as I say, he never suspected that that was for him, but Schrodt killed him even before he finished. </sentence><sentence id="3131">Like, he just killed him in front, like during the daytime, when everybody looked on. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3135">Q: Did you see that killing? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3137">A: No, I wasn't near the grave then. </sentence><sentence id="3138">No, but of course, I was the one that wrote down "deceased". </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3145">Q: Hania, before we go onto the next story, I'm just wondering if you have a sense if there was different treatment of men and women. </sentence><sentence id="3146">Was there anything about the women's part of the camp that was different then the men? </sentence><sentence id="3147">Were women afraid of being mistreated as women, not just being brutalized, but sexually? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3151">A: Actually, it would be - to them, it would be a sacrilege to talk to - not to talk to associate with any Jewish girl, because the Jews were not people. </sentence><sentence id="3152">They were animals. </sentence><sentence id="3153">So, you are talking about the people in the camp, the people that lived in camp or the Germans. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3169">Q: So, they wouldn't be necessarily... </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3171">A: Well, they were - maybe they treated the women a little bit better, but I don't think. </sentence><sentence id="3172">When I say "better", we have nothing to do with them, but maybe they wouldn't push us or hit us or whatever, but I don't think the Ukrainians would dare, or whether they would dare or whether the Jewish girls would go with Ukrainians. </sentence><sentence id="3173">I don't think so. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3177">Q: Were women able to be in contact with men in the camp? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3179">A: To a certain point. </sentence><sentence id="3180">As a matter of fact, certain names maybe I should mention, it must have been Mr. Billenswiec had a - because his wife was there, too - and everybody knew that he had a lover there, a woman from Lodz, but that was - everybody knew about it, and - because see the camp, the camp had separate barracks for women and separate for men. </sentence><sentence id="3181">So, if they met together it must have been during the day sometime, so the barrack was open for everybody to see. </sentence><sentence id="3182">It wasn't that they had separate rooms or anything, because we had - it was like a cot underneath and another one above. </sentence><sentence id="3183">It was good for two people, but like people were saying, "Oh, this one or that one," but that was about the inmates. </sentence><sentence id="3184">But you know people, I think that people behaved a little better in camps. </sentence><sentence id="3185">What I meant - I mean, there was nowhere to go, you had to do it - if you wanted to do it, everybody could watch. </sentence><sentence id="3186">I don't know how many people got into a barrack. </sentence><sentence id="3187">I was asked the same question by the historian. </sentence><sentence id="3188">So I said, at night, the women were separated because, you know, there was no movement from one barrack to another, but during the day, maybe. </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3189">Q: Tell me, did you menstruate in the camp. </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3190">A: Yes. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3212">Q: So, you were not starved enough so that you couldn't get your period. </sentence><sentence id="3213">Did women get pregnant in this camp? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3216">A: No. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3218">Q: No one got pregnant? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3220">A: No one. </sentence><sentence id="3221">I don't know of anybody. </sentence><sentence id="3222">They would be afraid to get pregnant, I suppose. </sentence><sentence id="3223">Even if they had a relationship with their husband, there were husbands and wives there, but they were separated. </sentence><sentence id="3224">And I, so I - to tell you the truth, I don't remember having any problems with protecting - not protecting ourselves, but keeping ourselves clean. </sentence><sentence id="3225">I don't remember. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3232">Q: It is possible that some women came into the camp pregnant, however, even...? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3234">A: No, there were some children in the camp that were already the children, not too many. </sentence><sentence id="3235">Einisemann (ph) had his kids. </sentence><sentence id="3236">Wolfowicz (ph) had his kids. </sentence><sentence id="3237">Vera Veislava (ph) had a son, a young son, and he survived. </sentence><sentence id="3238">She was from Lodz. </sentence><sentence id="3239">There were several kids, but I would say not more than ten. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3246">Q: Shall we talk about the escape and the plans for the escape? </sentence><sentence id="3247">This is from 1943. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3250">A: Yes. </sentence><sentence id="3251">So, what happened - the conditions were worse and worse and, you know, when things were happening, a group of people decided that we have to make an uprising and to liberate the camp. </sentence><sentence id="3252">It was an idea that we didn't know how to achieve it, but we knew one thing: that we have to get arms, some kinds of guns and stuff like that. </sentence><sentence id="3253">And this was very secretive. </sentence><sentence id="3254">All the policemen knew about it, because they were young and strong  people, and some people, but you know, some people that belonged to the group or was told about it, but not everybody knew about the preparations or the intentions because we were afraid that we could be denounced and killed. </sentence><sentence id="3255">So, anyway, we decided - everything was secret - and we decided that Adrian was the best one to acquire - he volunteered because he was very good at schmoozing and talking people into it. </sentence><sentence id="3256">So, we decided he's going to buy guns. </sentence><sentence id="3257">We would collect whatever we can from the Ukrainians because when they were going home, they had to give their guns away and they went to get the guns when they came back to work. </sentence><sentence id="3258">They didn't keep the guns with them. </sentence><sentence id="3259">So, when they - that they were supposed to steal - the first gun was purchased, and my husband had it. </sentence><sentence id="3260">He was the one to purchase this gun. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3272">Q: Where did he...? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3274">A: Where did he keep it? </sentence><sentence id="3275">I don't know. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3278">Q: No, where did it get it from? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3280">A: From a Ukrainian, a guard, bought it. </sentence><sentence id="3281">They paid for it through the nose with the collected, whatever we could collect. </sentence><sentence id="3282">And he talked to one Ukrainian, and this Ukrainian agreed that he would be selling guns for such and such a price. </sentence><sentence id="3283">I don't remember what it was, whether it was in gold or whether it was in money or whether it was in other things. </sentence><sentence id="3284">When I say other things, some people were, in Wierzbnik, like if we left a lot of things - valuables - not only gold and silver, but other valuables like blankets and furniture and all this. </sentence><sentence id="3285">So, you know, we could tell the Ukrainian go to such and such, and we have the, let's say, two watches or something. </sentence><sentence id="3286">Take the two watches and bring me a gun. </sentence><sentence id="3287">I don't remember exactly how he got the first gun because that's as far as he got, the first gun. </sentence><sentence id="3288">On the second try, they caught the Ukrainian, when he was stealing. </sentence><sentence id="3289">Instead of taking one gun with him or whatever, they caught him stealing - they found two guns in his possession when he - whatever. </sentence><sentence id="3290">So, of course, they investigated and they interrogated him and he said, "He doesn't know the name, but there is one of the policemen." </sentence><sentence id="3291">So, they lined up the policemen, all twelve of them, and the Ukrainian came in and of course he sold it to Adrian, so he went there and he showed, "This is the policeman that bought from me the gun." </sentence><sentence id="3292">Right away, Becker came in and he started interrogating my husband, and my husband said, Adrian, he says, "I never bought from him a gun. </sentence><sentence id="3293">I don't know him. </sentence><sentence id="3294">I didn't - I never saw him." </sentence><sentence id="3295">But, of course, they didn't believe him. </sentence><sentence id="3296">He was interrogated and we had such a bunker, a small bunker that was made out of concrete. </sentence><sentence id="3297">They put him there for a while, and then Judenrat went to Becker, and Becker came in and he said that he is lying, that Adrian is lying, because the Ukrainian didn't have any problems finding him, and he's going to be condemned to death. </sentence><sentence id="3298">So, the Judenrat decided that - Becker you can buy him. </sentence><sentence id="3299">This is the guy who took out , So, he says, "Okay, if you give me..." No, the Jew said, the Judenrat said to him, "How do you know? </sentence><sentence id="3300">Maybe he's lying. </sentence><sentence id="3301">Why not put him somewhere like lock him up until we find out, until the investigation is through. </sentence><sentence id="3302">If this is true what happened, then he should be killed, but how you can take an innocent man? </sentence><sentence id="3303">I mean the Ukrainian, maybe he had another reason why  he showed that this is the guy that bought from him the gun." </sentence><sentence id="3304">So, they agreed. </sentence><sentence id="3305">They put him in this bunker, and he had to dig his own grave, and Becker, not Becker, the other, the Baumgarten read, he read, you know, he read to him the order, that because he bought the gun from the Ukrainian and because he is key of an uprising, he's condemned to death. </sentence><sentence id="3306">He said it in the name of Adolf Hitler, and whatever it is, and so he read this to him, and this was the first time that a grave was dug up and they had no body, because they kept him there and then when he got his money, they wanted a kilo of gold. </sentence><sentence id="3307">A kilo of gold, but we didn't have gold, so everybody, if they hid some ring or whatever, even teeth they were putting in their head, and what happened, they went to Becker and this Baumgarten to say, "Now, you can start the investigation." </sentence><sentence id="3308">So, in order for him not to be able to escape, they took him out of the bunker, took two Ukrainians, they covered his head - like, they put him on a bench, took off his clothes, put a sack, you know, like a sack hat you put potatoes in or sugar or whatever with holes in it? </sentence><sentence id="3309">They put it over the head. </sentence><sentence id="3310">They took two rubber sticks or whatever and they had such whips - whatever you call it - and they told him that he would get now a hundred whips and he has to count. </sentence><sentence id="3311">So, you know, one, two, three... Adrian said after the twentieth whip, his body was numb. </sentence><sentence id="3312">He says he couldn't even feel anything. </sentence><sentence id="3313">He didn't care. </sentence><sentence id="3314">So, anyway, after they did that, they put him back into the police barrack there, because they figured that after his body was black and blue and red and bloody. </sentence><sentence id="3315">But he was a very strong boy, and don't forget that in 1943 he was nineteen. </sentence><sentence id="3316">So, I mean, he was a young, strong boy. </sentence><sentence id="3317">They put him in the barrack and they said, "This is only so that he can't escape or can't do anything." </sentence><sentence id="3318">So, they took him from the bunker because he couldn't breathe there, and they put him in the barrack, and the next day they called in appel. </sentence><sentence id="3319">Everybody had to go to the - everybody had to an appel so that they could tell them that what happens if - everybody will be shot who will take part, that if things like this, if people want to escape, if anybody escapes they will kill ten people for each one that escapes, and in addition, they are not going to - because somebody - they didn't say it anymore that Adrian bought the gun - somebody bought the gun for a certain purpose. </sentence><sentence id="3320">They didn't know about the gun that already existed. </sentence><sentence id="3321">They were talking about the gun that they caught the Ukrainian with, you know?There must be a reason why they wanted the gun, and while they were doing it, the guys that were thinking of escaping, of the uprising, they decided that when they visited Adrian later, when he was so sick, that they had to escape at the first opportunity. </sentence><sentence id="3322">So, when everybody was standing at the appel and they were saying that, the policemen were moving because they were always helping to round up people. </sentence><sentence id="3323">So, they went to Adrian's room. </sentence><sentence id="3324">They took him out. </sentence><sentence id="3325">They had some shears, and they decided, because the Ukrainians were also watching us inside - not outside, the only Ukrainian that was okay was kept, was on the gate. </sentence><sentence id="3326">But they decided to cut - there was ten of them, ten young people. </sentence><sentence id="3327">I don't know how many policemen, but I think about two or three policemen. </sentence><sentence id="3328">The rest were young boys that were always in contact to do the uprising. </sentence><sentence id="3329">So, while they were talking and we were watched by the Ukrainians and the policemen moving around, they cut the barbed wire and my husband, like Adrian was at the time, you can imagine, after he got those lashes the night before or the day before. </sentence><sentence id="3330">They jumped over the fence and started running. </sentence><sentence id="3331">They had to run quickly over the road because on the other side of the road there were forests and the Germans usually, like, all they wanted is to get to the  forest as fast as they could. </sentence><sentence id="3332">But meanwhile Schrodt, the guy that was watching, he started shooting. </sentence><sentence id="3333">So, immediately they took all the Ukrainians and Schrodt was in charge. </sentence><sentence id="3334">He had a motorcycle and he started running after them. </sentence><sentence id="3335">But until they found they were a little bit further. </sentence><sentence id="3336">So, anyway they managed to go to the forest and the Ukrainians and Schrodt came back and Schrodt said to Vaschek (ph), like they said, "I am telling you, the young Wilczek (ph) ." </sentence><sentence id="3337">which in German means the younger Wilczek (ph) I killed personally. </sentence><sentence id="3338">So, we all thought that he's dead, like his mother and his sister assumed that he's completely dead. </sentence><sentence id="3339">Meanwhile, the ten of them managed to go to the forest, and what are they going to do? </sentence><sentence id="3340">I mean, they run away the way they were. </sentence><sentence id="3341">Nothing - they had nothing on them. </sentence><sentence id="3342">They had no guns, no knives, I mean, I don't know why Adrian didn't take his gun. </sentence><sentence id="3343">I never asked him that question, but when they reached the forest, they were very happy. </sentence><sentence id="3344">And we had three kinds of partisans in the forest. </sentence><sentence id="3345">One - "1l name them by the Polish name, and then I'll try to translate. </sentence><sentence id="3346">One was Armia Rudowa (ph), which means the People's Army. </sentence><sentence id="3347">This was run by the Russians. </sentence><sentence id="3348">It was a Communist party under Russian supervision, and they were taking everybody, like not everybody. </sentence><sentence id="3349">They were accepting people that when they needed them. </sentence><sentence id="3350">The second group was called Armia Kryowa (ph), which means the home army. </sentence><sentence id="3351">Those were Polacks, those were Polish people. </sentence><sentence id="3352">They wouldn't accept Jews, but they would accept Polish people. </sentence><sentence id="3353">They didn't kill the Jews. </sentence><sentence id="3354">They hated them, but they didn't kill them. </sentence><sentence id="3355">But then there was an Jnnoset (ph) which was a partisan group that were like Nazi, National Polish Organization that they were killing the Jews like if they met them - the real anti-Semites. </sentence><sentence id="3356">So, anyway, they were sitting there. </sentence><sentence id="3357">I remember four names - three names - four names. </sentence><sentence id="3358">I remember four names of the escapees. </sentence><sentence id="3359">I don't remember the rest. </sentence><sentence id="3360">So, it was Adrian. </sentence><sentence id="3361">It was a guy Salik Anulevicz (ph), he was the real first cousin of Daniel Levicz (ph) from Warsaw ghetto. </sentence><sentence id="3362">And, the third one was Freumik Singer (ph), he was from Opatow - he was related to Tobjah Weisblum (ph), and the fourth one was James Levy (ph), he was also a policeman, and there were six others, but I really don't remember their names now. </sentence><sentence id="3363">So, as they were waiting in the forest, the Russian group came by. </sentence><sentence id="3364">So, they told them that they are from camp escapees and so on. </sentence><sentence id="3365">So the guys said, "I can't take ten. </sentence><sentence id="3366">We can't take ten. </sentence><sentence id="3367">We don't have room for ten. </sentence><sentence id="3368">We don't have arms for ten." </sentence><sentence id="3369">Because the supplies came directly from Russia by plane. </sentence><sentence id="3370">So, they couldn't take so many. </sentence><sentence id="3371">So, he says, "We can only take two of you." </sentence><sentence id="3372">So, he picked up this Freumik (ph) from Opatow and they picked Adrian. </sentence><sentence id="3373">And, he says, "And you stay here, maybe the next group will take you because we don't have room." </sentence><sentence id="3374">There was apparently 25 of them in this group, this Russian group. </sentence><sentence id="3375">So, there were 27 of them. </sentence><sentence id="3376">Then - so, I will now speak about them, and I'1l come back later to those. </sentence><sentence id="3377">I'Il say what happened to them later. </sentence><sentence id="3378">So, anyway they started to - they needed miner. </sentence><sentence id="3379">What I mean miners - the ones who will put mines under bridges so that the German arms couldn't put them in trains like - what they had to do, they had to put mines under the bridges, but the mines were not like today's sophisticated. </sentence><sentence id="3380">They had their mine. </sentence><sentence id="3381">They had the string. </sentence><sentence id="3382">They had to first go by boat, don't forget the Germans were watching. </sentence><sentence id="3383">They were over every bridge, there were German soldiers walking back and forth because that's what they were afraid of, that the bridges would be mined. </sentence><sentence id="3384">So, they had to swim or go by such a boat that couldn't hear anything under the bridge, put the mine there, go far enough with the string, wait until the train comes - goes by, and pull it. </sentence><sentence id="3385">It was a very dangerous job, and very  specialized because when the Germans were up there, if they heard anybody in the river, they were shooting them right away. </sentence><sentence id="3386">So, that was a very - the two Jewish boys that were accepted, Freumik (ph) and Adrian, they were doing those jobs, and now, they had different encounters with the Germans looking for them, but the Germans were always afraid to go straight to the forest. </sentence><sentence id="3387">They had people that were in the village, Polish villages that were telling them about the movement of the Germans and where they were going, and whether they were coming, what happened here and there. </sentence><sentence id="3388">So, they had contact with the world. </sentence><sentence id="3389">They had enough to eat there. </sentence><sentence id="3390">I mean, not that they were given special - like Adrian says, they would bring them a glop of pork, you know, the fat, and they would just eat half a pound to a pound of it, no bread or anything because it depends on what they had and brought in, and he says, "You wouldn't believe what I could eat - this pure fat." </sentence><sentence id="3391">And, they could really eat the pound of fat without anything. </sentence><sentence id="3392">So, they weren't really hungry. </sentence><sentence id="3393">They slept in the woods, and they were doing the mine work. </sentence><sentence id="3394">That was their work. </sentence></p></dialogue>

But they couldn't kill him. </sentence><sentence id="3536">So, they gave him, like, they gave him a gun. </sentence><sentence id="3537">They covered him up. </sentence><sentence id="3538">They gave him all the food they had, and they left him there. </sentence><sentence id="3539">They kissed him and they said, "We are very sorry," because they left him there to die because he was so sick. </sentence><sentence id="3540">So some people were going by the woods and they found him and they took him - some Polacks, most of them were collaborating with the partisans. </sentence><sentence id="3541">They were the people that were saying where the Germans are. </sentence><sentence id="3542">So, they took him home and they, and it took him ten days and he was better. </sentence><sentence id="3543">So, he decided to go back to his group. </sentence><sentence id="3544">When he went to his - before he went out, he contacted one of those people that they were in contact with, and he said, "T'm sorry to tell you that somebody denounced the group, the Russian group. </sentence><sentence id="3545">The  Germans came in while they were asleep in there, and...and one of the - where they kept horses or cows or whatever - one of those buildings, they put it afire and everybody got killed. </sentence><sentence id="3546">So, he felt so bad, but, I mean, he couldn't believe it. </sentence><sentence id="3547">So, he went...he went back to the woods, after he felt better, and he decided he'll wait for another group. </sentence><sentence id="3548">I'll tell you more about the others that were left, the eight that were left, but I have to finish this story first. </sentence><sentence id="3549">So... </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3581">A: He - he was a Jewish boy. </sentence><sentence id="3582">He never had - he wasn't violent. </sentence><sentence id="3583">He never saw a gun in his life. </sentence><sentence id="3584">I don't think if he was given a gun whether he knew what to do with it unless someone will tell him or show him. </sentence><sentence id="3585">I don't know whether the gun was - the gun that he bought and he - from the Ukrainian guard - whether the gun was at all operational, and whether - I couldn't tell you, maybe it was, maybe it was one of the best, but even if he had it, he wouldn't know how to use it unless someone would show it to him. </sentence><sentence id="3586">So... </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3603">A: I was involved. </sentence><sentence id="3604">Some women were involved because we're talking about uprising. </sentence><sentence id="3605">So, the women were also involved. </sentence><sentence id="3606">Like, we didn't think it would be so fast. </sentence><sentence id="3607">We thought that it would take us time first of all to arms and to be prepared and to-to-to-to prepare a strata-strategy. </sentence><sentence id="3608">It wasn't - this was just the beginning. </sentence><sentence id="3609">We had no idea what's - what's going to be after, and we had to be very, very careful and secretive because I think like that, if the Germans would have found out, it would've been death to all of us. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3617">Q: So, how many of you would there have been, fifteen, twenty people? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3619">A: That's the most - all the policemen were involved in it, because they - they were the strongest and they were the ones that were supposed to know how to do that, and a few other people. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3621">Q: And, when would you meet and discuss this? </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3633">Q: No, I thought that might be the case, but one doesn't know how those things happen. </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3634">A: We knew that the policemen were the - the initiators of that. </sentence><sentence id="3635">So, I knew it, and maybe - I don't know if Chris knew it because she was too young to know about it. </sentence><sentence id="3636">Maybe she did. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="3640">I couldn't tell you, and there was a few people, so I would say if they would tell me to tell so and so, but not in certain - we didn't have meetings. </sentence><sentence id="3641">We couldn't. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3644">Q: So was there one person who was the leader who then made the decision? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3646">A: I think that my - that Adrian was the best at it because - because he knew how to talk to people - how to talk to those Ukrainians to get what he wanted. </sentence><sentence id="3647">He was the type of a person that - that he knew how to - to get things. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3650">Q: And who had experience with arms in this? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3652">A: Nobody, nobody, even the policemen, they didn't carry anything in their hands. </sentence><sentence id="3653">I mean, I'm talking the Jewish policemen. </sentence><sentence id="3654">I mean, they were only assigned a certain job and they were - there was a good job, you know, by comparison, you know, and they didn't have to go to the factory and - and work at the iron stove where it was so hot that they couldn't breathe. </sentence><sentence id="3655">So, they - they were glad that they had this job, but they were - they were all thinking of uprising and getting rid of because we were too long - too long we listened to that - we went like sheep to do that. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3660">Q: So, when you all were thinking about this separately - because clearly you're not supposed to have conversations because it's too dangerous, right? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3662">A: No, it's too dangerous, and I'll tell you, I couldn't take a part in the running away, anyway, because they told us that if someone runs away, first the family and then ten other people and there were cases where they killed ten people for one. </sentence><sentence id="3663">If one escaped, they would round up ten people and kill them - shot them. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3666">Q: So, you were not going to take any chance. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3668">A: I wouldn't because I had my father and my two sisters. </sentence><sentence id="3669">You couldn't take Renia with you, but, you know, if I took part in it and knew what was going on, and in case - listen, we didn't - we didn't expect that everybody - everybody would carry a gun. </sentence><sentence id="3670">First we had to get the guns. </sentence><sentence id="3671">I mean, the idea started - came to us, and we tried, but we weren't successful because we just started. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3676">Q: But, was the idea that all fifteen or twenty, as many as... </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3678">A: As many as possible. </sentence><sentence id="3679">That's why ten of them - ten of them were from this group. </sentence><sentence id="3680">The ten people were from this group that ran away that night - that day. </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3681">Q: And the idea was for that group, whatever the fifteen or whoever many of that group could run away. </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3682">A: Run away, and then - and then come and do something with, you know, like to maybe to get other guns somewhere else. </sentence><sentence id="3683">Go to see the partisans and come back and - and - and free all of us, but it was a stupid idea, but nobody - like you - you didn't believe, but you had to believe that something would be done that we are not going to be killed like, you know, like just go voluntarily to just be killed because the way we saw it, we didn't know about - about what happened in Treblinka. </sentence><sentence id="3684">We didn't know that there was an Auschwitz, but it was enough that any German can - could come and kill anybody and, I mean, how did we know? </sentence><sentence id="3685">Maybe one day all of them would just, keep shooting until they shoot us all. </sentence><sentence id="3686">So, those ten that ran away, they were from this group, and they had the best opportunity because the guards weren't there - only one guard. </sentence><sentence id="3687">The Germans and everybody, they round us all up to teach us a lesson. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3694">Q: So, now Adrian having gotten better, and his... </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="3696"> A He came - he came to - he come - he's in the woods, but of course, already half his time - like he was there for a long time with them, because I didn't tell you, that all he did was the mines and stuff like that. </sentence><sentence id="3697">I didn't tell you everything that happened because it wasn't important, but now - now it's already close to - already deg44. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3700">Q: So, he's with them almost a year or six months? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3702">A: Yes, he's been with them for a long time, but that's when he got sick and they left him. </sentence><sentence id="3703">Like, he was working every day that he had another assignment. </sentence><sentence id="3704">Most of them, he was a specialist in mining. </sentence><sentence id="3705">He was - I mean, working so long every day at it, he was a specialist in it. </sentence><sentence id="3706">Because they had to observe the - the bridge going up. </sentence><sentence id="3707">Like, when he had this string, he had to go far enough so that nothing would happen to him. </sentence><sentence id="3708">He had to - he - he activated the mine, the bridge went up in flames or whatever it was, whatever, and he had to run away back to the forest. </sentence><sentence id="3709">So, each - each of such escapade was very, very dangerous, but in his group, nobody - nobody died from that. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3718">Q: So, they taught him how to do all this? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3720">A: They taught him, and of course, he used his gun very efficiently later. </sentence><sentence id="3721">I mean, after - because they carried guns all the time. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3724">Q: So, now he's waiting for another group. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3726">A: He's been waiting for another group, then the worst group comes in, and that was already deg44, Don't forget that the war in Poland - in Poland, in the woods there or in this district already finished around January of 1945. </sentence><sentence id="3727">So, that was shortly before - before the end of the war. </sentence><sentence id="3728">Because we were - for us, May was the end of the war, but for him, where he  was in Poland, the Russians were very close. </sentence><sentence id="3729">So, January was already the end of the war. </sentence><sentence id="3730">So, anyway, when he came back to the woods, the worst of the groups, Anazed (ph), got him. </sentence><sentence id="3731">So, the - the name of - the name of the captain or whatever, whatever he was, I know one of the leaders of this group was - his name was Orlig (ph), which means - how do you call it now? </sentence><sentence id="3732">The bird that has such a big beak, such a very aristocratic bird. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3740">Q: Tern? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3742">A: No, aristocratic. </sentence><sentence id="3743">I forgot now. </sentence><sentence id="3744">Anyway, it was a bird, like he said - Adrian told him the truth because there was no use to tell him that - that he's Polish or whatever. </sentence><sentence id="3745">So, the guy looked at him and he figured like this - it's almost the end of the war, what they did now, the Germans would go away because they were sometimes even they were more against Russians than the Germans. </sentence><sentence id="3746">They were against Germans, too, but if they have to choose, they would kill the Russians. </sentence><sentence id="3747">So, he figured like in his mind was that if he keeps a Jew, he" ll have a token no matter what happens. </sentence><sentence id="3748">He had a son who befriended Adrian very much - was a friend. </sentence><sentence id="3749">So, he told him, "Please don't tell the guys in the group that you are Jewish." </sentence><sentence id="3750">And, he went and he taught him to pray the Catholic prayer, and he made - he was the one that started the prayer and then - but, Adrian was quite honest. </sentence><sentence id="3751">So, he told his son, but the son never told on him. </sentence><sentence id="3752">Adrian didn't realize that he wanted to - that he wanted to - the guy, the captain of the group wanted to save his life by holding a Jew, but he didn't tell anybody else, but he figured when the Russians come, you prove to them that he's a saint because he has a Jew there. </sentence><sentence id="3753">So, anyway, soon after the war finished - and he was working with them in the woods there - and soon the war finished, the Russians started appearing. </sentence><sentence id="3754">And right away, this guy wanted to say that - that he saved a Jew, but Adrian didn't pay attention to it, but the Russian - the worst part was that the Russian, when he saw him, he said, "Tell me your story." </sentence><sentence id="3755">So, Adrian tells him the story, and he says he was in the People's Army. </sentence><sentence id="3756">They were all Russians, mostly Russians and there were two of them - he didn't say Jewish because he says that they escaped the camp, and they were accepted there, and he says, "This is the last group." </sentence><sentence id="3757">He didn't say anything about being Jewish or anything because he didn't know who the Russian is. </sentence><sentence id="3758">So, the Russian says to him in Russian, he says, "You know, this is a very interesting story. </sentence><sentence id="3759">There was 27 of you - 27 of you -25 Russians and two Polacks," and he says, "That's interesting that one Polack got out and all the Russians, you know, all the Russians perished." </sentence><sentence id="3760">So, Adrian said, he says to his guy, "Kill him, like, shoot him - shoot him." </sentence><sentence id="3761">So, he says, "What do you want? </sentence><sentence id="3762">I'm Jewish." </sentence><sentence id="3763">So, the guy says in Jewish to him, "Why didn't you tell me that before?" </sentence><sentence id="3764">So, anyway, he was saved, but now this guy from the Anazed that killed so many Jews on his ways, tried to - since Adrian was already there, like the Russian and him were already such friends, and so, he tried to say that he was also good to the Jews because he saved him, but he wasn't. </sentence><sentence id="3765">So, Adrian says, "I am the first Jew that he saved." </sentence><sentence id="3766">Because he told him, when he accepted him, ""You are the first Jew that I met in my life that I'll save you - that I'm going to save your life." </sentence><sentence id="3767">So, he repeated it. </sentence><sentence id="3768">I mean, he just said it. </sentence><sentence id="3769">I don't know what happened to them. </sentence><sentence id="3770">I don't think that anything happened to them. </sentence><sentence id="3771">Adrian was right away made, like, he was a lieutenant right away. </sentence><sentence id="3772">They put all the stars on him, and then when he came home, he worked for the -  like, he was - he worked in the army as a lieutenant. </sentence><sentence id="3773">Now, I'll go back to Salik Anulevicz (ph) and the others. </sentence><sentence id="3774">When this - when they took the two of them - the two of them - the two guys Freumik (ph) and Adrian, they were very much concerned what happened to the other guys, but they never found out. </sentence><sentence id="3775">Only after the war, they found out what happened. </sentence><sentence id="3776">Salik started his story. </sentence><sentence id="3777">When they took them and went away, there was eight of them left. </sentence><sentence id="3778">So, Armia Kryowa, which was the home army, which wasn't killing the Jews, but they were - they were doing everything possible to make their life miserable, went by and they see eight people, and the people - they all told them what happened. </sentence><sentence id="3779">They told them, "We run away from this Jewish camp in..." And not all of them spoke because the - Hassidic Jews that spoke Yiddish at home, they had a very big accent. </sentence><sentence id="3780">You could right away notice that they were not - I mean, you couldn't tell them you are Polish. </sentence><sentence id="3781">They all knew that they were Jewish. </sentence><sentence id="3782">So, they said, they, so, there was eight of them - they - they were anti- Semitic, but they said, "We are not going to kill you, but what we are going to do..." They told them to undress. </sentence><sentence id="3783">They left them eight people naked, the way they are. </sentence><sentence id="3784">They took their clothes away. </sentence><sentence id="3785">He says, "Now, wait for the Russians to come, for the other army - for the People's Army. </sentence><sentence id="3786">They"! </sentence><sentence id="3787">take you." </sentence><sentence id="3788">But, and they laughed and laughed that they left them alive but completely naked and took away their clothes. </sentence><sentence id="3789">So, they were there and they started thinking, "What are we going to do now?" </sentence><sentence id="3790">I mean, they can't move. </sentence><sentence id="3791">They have nothing. </sentence><sentence id="3792">They have no clothes. </sentence><sentence id="3793">So, they sat and Salik Anulevicz (ph) was the only one that spoke without an accent. </sentence><sentence id="3794">So, they said, "You know what?" </sentence><sentence id="3795">There's a forest - there was a farmhouse and the guy was looking after the forests, you know. </sentence><sentence id="3796">So, he says, "There is this house. </sentence><sentence id="3797">If you can go there and bring us clothes or food or something." </sentence><sentence id="3798">So, he says, "Why me? </sentence><sentence id="3799">Why not you?" </sentence><sentence id="3800">He says, "You can speak Polish." </sentence><sentence id="3801">So - so, he went. </sentence><sentence id="3802">He decided - I mean, he had no alternative. </sentence><sentence id="3803">He went there, and on the way, a woman came out of the house, and he told her the story. </sentence><sentence id="3804">It was a young woman. </sentence><sentence id="3805">It was the daughter of the - this forestman. </sentence><sentence id="3806">So, she took him home. </sentence><sentence id="3807">She gave him something to wear and food and the father came in and the father says, "I can't take eight people. </sentence><sentence id="3808">I cannot." " </sentence><sentence id="3809">Okay, we can take food and clothes and whatever we can." </sentence><sentence id="3810">But he says, "They will kill me, the Germans, if they know that I hide so many Jews." </sentence><sentence id="3811">Anyway, apparently the girl fell in love with this Salik Anulevicz (ph) and she decided to save him, and she took him in and she was hiding him there, and he survived the war in her place. </sentence><sentence id="3812">Now, I'll go back to the seven and I'll tell you what happened to Salik Anulevicz (ph). </sentence><sentence id="3813">So, he and the daughter - this daughter and her name was Hela (ph), because he always talked about her, Salik Analewicz, after the war. </sentence><sentence id="3814">So, the girl's name was Hela (ph). </sentence><sentence id="3815">He and Hela (ph) were going - went to give them food and give them clothes, but they under no circumstances can they keep them there because there was eight of them. </sentence><sentence id="3816">So, they were helping them with - nobody knows what happened to them. </sentence><sentence id="3817">Nobody - they didn't survive the war. </sentence><sentence id="3818">How did they perish in the woods because when one day they were there, they weren't there. </sentence><sentence id="3819">Like, you know, they were taking daily food to them and water, but they weren't there. </sentence><sentence id="3820">Nobody knows whether they perished and they must have perished because nobody came back. </sentence><sentence id="3821">Now, I'll go back to this Salik Anulevicz (ph). </sentence><sentence id="3822">He lived there with this woman and she promised - he promised that he would marry her. </sentence><sentence id="3823">He promised he will marry her after the war, but after the war he changed his mind, but he - he wanted to pay them back for what they did for him. </sentence><sentence id="3824">So, he was a very rich guy - I forgot which city he lived, but he  was not far from the Czechoslovakian border there. </sentence><sentence id="3825">They had some real estate and stuff like that. </sentence><sentence id="3826">He went to the lawyer and assigned all the real estate to her, and he says whenever, as long as he lives, if he can help her in any way, he will help her. </sentence><sentence id="3827">I don't know whether he could do it, whether she cashed in on his promises, whether she could get - although he went to a lawyer and signed over all this properties to her, we don't know because he never - no, he saw her once. </sentence><sentence id="3828">Her father was - her father was accused of being, not a Nazi, but that he collaborated with the Germans, and they took him out, put him to jail, and she new where Salik was in Poland at the time yet. </sentence><sentence id="3829">So, she says, "I want you to be a witness to telling him that we - that we saved you." </sentence><sentence id="3830">So, he went there and they let the father go. </sentence><sentence id="3831">Whether he was a German collaborator or not, I don't know. </sentence><sentence id="3832">Anyway, Salik Anulevicz (ph) went to West Europe, and then he went to Brazil. </sentence><sentence id="3833">He married a Swiss girl, and he was coming to Toronto every year because he had - he died five years ago. </sentence><sentence id="3834">He died before my husband because the two of them were friends like, you know, and not only that, he had a brother Hirsa (ph). </sentence><sentence id="3835">He was coming and he always went, like he stayed with us with his wife and whenever we talked to them, he was talking about this Hela. </sentence><sentence id="3836">He wanted to go to Poland to see Hela, and the wife was willing to go with him, but she says, "You only know her first name, that Hela. </sentence><sentence id="3837">She must have - since then she must have been married. </sentence><sentence id="3838">She must have moved out of this farmhouse. </sentence><sentence id="3839">How are we going to find her?" </sentence><sentence id="3840">He wanted to see Hela who saved his life. </sentence><sentence id="3841">All his life, he was talking about her. </sentence><sentence id="3842">He died, as I said, about five years ago. </sentence><sentence id="3843">We never heard of the eight - no, the seven other guys, and Freun (ph) was killed together with the - with like, by the Germans together with the whole group. </sentence><sentence id="3844">So, this is Adrian's story. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="4130">Q: Did you try to convince people not to do it? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="4132">A: No, because I didn't believe anybody would do it. </sentence><sentence id="4133">We all thought about running away all the time. </sentence><sentence id="4134">That was - that was our aim, to run away from this horrible camp, but you know when the time came to run away, we were too - too - too scared to because we were afraid. </sentence><sentence id="4135">We couldn't take our father out. </sentence><sentence id="4136">We couldn't take Renia out. </sentence><sentence id="4137">And we are afraid that they would be killed. </sentence><sentence id="4138">So, we didn't even try. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="4904">A: Not in the same way. </sentence><sentence id="4905">I think that Chris was the most realistic person. </sentence><sentence id="4906">She organized things for us, whether it was food in Auschwitz or whatever, she was able to do those things. </sentence><sentence id="4907">I, on the other hand, wasn't afraid of the devil. </sentence><sentence id="4908">Like, if they told me to go right at something, I wouldn't have gone. </sentence><sentence id="4909">I wasn't afraid because - I don't know why, but I wasn't. </sentence><sentence id="4910">But Renia was - she always was hiding in corners. </sentence><sentence id="4911">She was always cold. </sentence><sentence id="4912">She was always sick. </sentence><sentence id="4913">So, that was our worry, but we were very lucky that we kept together. </sentence><sentence id="4914">We always watched for one another, and I'll tell you that, at a certain time when we were going to Auschwitz, not - from Auschwitz to Ravensbriick, when we were walking the death march, if not my sisters - I lost my conscious. </sentence><sentence id="4915">I didn't know where I was. </sentence><sentence id="4916">I couldn't walk, and I was the tallest. </sentence><sentence id="4917">Both of my sisters, Renia and Chris almost carried on one side. </sentence><sentence id="4918">It's not far anymore, let's - a few more steps, Hania, a few more steps. </sentence><sentence id="4919">They saved my life, the same way as, in other moments, I saved their life. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="4936">Q: So, Renia is the scared one, the baby. </sentence><sentence id="4937">Chris is the organized, practical one. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="4940">A: Organized, most practical, she always found us food. </sentence><sentence id="4941">She was very, very, very good at that way. </sentence><sentence id="4942">And she always shared not only with us, she shared it with others. </sentence><sentence id="4943">And I was a devil. </sentence><sentence id="4944">I wasn't afraid of anything. </sentence><sentence id="4945">I was just not afraid, and I'll tell you, since I was the tallest, there was always a risk that whenever there was a selection or they looked for somebody to work for a job or whatever, they would always - always - even if I was in the back. </sentence><sentence id="4946">Like, Krysia says, "Don't stay in the front, stay in the back. </sentence><sentence id="4947">They'll take you to take blood. </sentence><sentence id="4948">They'll take you to do this." </sentence><sentence id="4949">So, but no matter where I stood they - because I was a tall sticking out - so, "This one." </sentence><sentence id="4950">But, sometimes it was good and sometimes it wasn't so good. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="4984">A: No, we were in the last car. </sentence><sentence id="4985">I think that my father was in the car before us, or two before us, because I don't remember whether all the women were one after the other or they picked a car full of women, then men and then women. </sentence><sentence id="4986">I don't know, because we were in the last car, and I know that my father was fairly close by. </sentence><sentence id="4987">So, Krysia thinks that he was in the car right after us. </sentence><sentence id="4988">I was under the impression - because we talked about - I was under the impression that they kept women separately so, they must have been in the third car, but he was close. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="4994">Q: What was it like when the doors were opened? </sentence><sentence id="4995">Was it...? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="4998">A: When the doors were opened to go out? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="5000">Q: To go out. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="5002">A: First of all, we had a very bad experience because the guards that took us before they took us to change our dresses and everything, we went very close by a crematorium, or if that wasn't a crematorium, we were told it was a crematorium. </sentence><sentence id="5003">So, I remember having a bottle of whiskey that this Frenchman - I forgot to tell you that the Frenchman left in Auschwitz, he says, "If they take you to the crematorium..." So, we had this bottle of whiskey. </sentence><sentence id="5004">I never drank in my life, but all the girls - I told the girls, so when they German soldiers stopped us in front of the crematorium, or he called this crematorium, so we took this bottle and every girl had a taste. </sentence><sentence id="5005">Not a taste of it, but you know, like we were thinking that we're going to die now so let's just be merry. </sentence><sentence id="5006">We never drank in our lifetimes, but the whole bottle went. </sentence><sentence id="5007">Like, as far as it went from us, and then they took us to the place where they cut our hair, and after that he stayed with us there for a few minutes to scare us or to whatever - to whatever, and then they took us to the place where we had to leave everything we had, to put on the uniform or whatever you call it, a dress  with stripes, and they cut our hair. </sentence><sentence id="5008">This is another story how I suffered the most out of all of three of us. </sentence><sentence id="5009">And, then we went to the barrack. </sentence><sentence id="5010">So, I'Il tell you maybe how they first brought us in and told us to take all our clothes off and they put nothing else, we had no brassiere, this I remember - because I was so - it felt so strange to just have the dress on - and they gave us the dress. </sentence><sentence id="5011">The dress was too short on me, so there was a small girl that I don't know who, we changed dresses to fit us. </sentence><sentence id="5012">Because we were all very skinny, but nobody was as tall as I. They were mostly smaller people. </sentence><sentence id="5013">So, there were just a few long dresses. </sentence><sentence id="5014">I was glad that somebody exchanged with me the dress. </sentence><sentence id="5015">Then, they cut our hair to here. </sentence><sentence id="5016">They checked our hair for lice. </sentence><sentence id="5017">They put this stuff in, disinfectant or whatever you call it, in our hair and on our bodies before they gave us the dresses, and I remember, they took away my shoes. </sentence><sentence id="5018">So, they gave us such wooden shoes - wooden shoes - and this was a case where the wooden shoes - we were already in dresses and men from another camp were distributing the shoes, and the guy says, "Take it, take it." </sentence><sentence id="5019">To me like, in Polish we have - like in English you say "you" it means everything, but do you understand French or German? </sentence><sentence id="5020">So, they say "vous" or "tu" or in German they said - they say, because here you say "you", in Polish also you never talk to a lady by calling her "Dou"(ph), you caller her "Vu" like, and the guy says, "Take those, take those." </sentence><sentence id="5021">Well I just said, "How dare you calling me "dou"?" </sentence><sentence id="5022">Okay, it was so stupid. </sentence><sentence id="5023">And, then so anyway I put those dresses - I couldn't walk in them, and then they put us five people in a row to march to the barracks. </sentence><sentence id="5024">So, we were five, and so - Krysia, Renia and I were three and there was three others. </sentence><sentence id="5025">They didn't want to part and we didn't want to part. </sentence><sentence id="5026">So, this woman goes, she says, "What's the commotion? </sentence><sentence id="5027">The couple there." </sentence><sentence id="5028">You know, I just came to a new camp. </sentence><sentence id="5029">I didn't like the way guy says to me "Dou," and here she screams at me. </sentence><sentence id="5030">I wasn't really used to it because you know nobody really mistreated me when I worked before, and she says, "Go to the back." </sentence><sentence id="5031">I say, "I'm not going to the back." </sentence><sentence id="5032">She says - I say, "Those are my two sisters." </sentence><sentence id="5033">She didn't even want to hear. </sentence><sentence id="5034">She took me by the hair, grabbed me by the hair, to the German man there that was cutting the hair, and she says, "Make a cross on her head." </sentence><sentence id="5035">So, you know, she was mad that I talked back to her. </sentence><sentence id="5036">So, first he made the cross, and then he felt sorry for me and he shaved my head, but I was the only one with a really shaved head of hair. </sentence><sentence id="5037">You know, like, I didn't have anything on my head - just - I don't know whether I looked like a boy or whatever. </sentence><sentence id="5038">Anyway, finally we just didn't want to be parted and I didn't care what she says. </sentence><sentence id="5039">She couldn't kill me, like I was daring. </sentence><sentence id="5040">I said, "I'm not going, they are my two sisters. </sentence><sentence id="5041">I'm going with them." </sentence><sentence id="5042">So, she got mad. </sentence><sentence id="5043">She pushed us. </sentence><sentence id="5044">Anyway, we're together. </sentence><sentence id="5045">I didn't want to part from them, because if I went to the back or whatever, I mean, it wasn't the next row - we would have never been together. </sentence><sentence id="5046">When we came to the barrack... </sentence></p></dialogue>

" </sentence><sentence id="5935">Do you know how to clean?" </sentence><sentence id="5936">I think myself, "Of course I know - that's the best job I could get to clean those barracks." </sentence><sentence id="5937">So, I said, like, but then I see, there is his desk with all the papers and the radio is playing. </sentence><sentence id="5938">I think if I'm going to play smart, I won't get this job, because, you know, I have to be dumb to know how to clean the floors. </sentence><sentence id="5939">So, I decided that I'm not going to tell him that I know German. </sentence><sentence id="5940">I don't know why, but at that moment, my mind started working, and I figured to clean the floors, you don't need to be intelligent, just be as dumb as you can. </sentence><sentence id="5941">So, he says, "Can you..." I'Il speak English. " </sentence><sentence id="5942">Can you speak German?" </sentence><sentence id="5943">So, I said [so-so gesture with hand]. </sentence><sentence id="5944">And he said to me, "And how about - what do you speak?" </sentence><sentence id="5945">So, I said, "Polish." </sentence><sentence id="5946">Polish he couldn't speak. </sentence><sentence id="5947">So, he says to me, "So what can you do?" </sentence><sentence id="5948">So, I said, "Putzen." </sentence><sentence id="5949">I mean, he told me already that I'm going to clean. </sentence><sentence id="5950">So, that's what - I didn't know. </sentence><sentence id="5951">I never did the - I never cleaned a floor in the house, in my house, never touched it. </sentence><sentence id="5952">So, then he says to me, "When you clean, I don't want you to touch anything on my - on my desk because this is all private. </sentence><sentence id="5953">I don't want - if you want to - from time to time, I'1l clean it, and you will be able to clean. </sentence><sentence id="5954">All I want is to clean around, to clean the floor, but don't touch it, and don't touch my radio." </sentence><sentence id="5955">So... </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="6002">So, then he sees that I'm - I always - since I walked in, I decided that I'll play dumb. </sentence><sentence id="6003">So, then he says, he looks at me, he tells me, he shows me how to do this, how to do this, okay. </sentence><sentence id="6004">Then, he says not to touch those - I mean, he was showing me because he knew that I could only speak a little - then he says, "Can you read?" </sentence><sentence id="6005">So, I look at him. </sentence><sentence id="6006">I pretend that I don't understand and I says [shakes head].

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="6048">Q: What did you hear and what did you read? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="6050">A: That's what it is - I read all the orders. </sentence><sentence id="6051">I knew that the war is being lost. </sentence><sentence id="6052">I knew - I read all those - the letters that he gathered. </sentence><sentence id="6053">That's how we ran away. </sentence><sentence id="6054">Renia was cleaning another room. </sentence><sentence id="6055">I would go back to Krysia - how she fed us. </sentence><sentence id="6056">She was marvelous, but I'Il go back to this portion. </sentence><sentence id="6057">I'1l just talk now about this situation here. </sentence><sentence id="6058">So, I read everything and then, the Russians were already so close that he got orders that on such and such a date to let everybody go except the guards, because they weren't sending the Jews anymore to work, because they had to go out of the camp. </sentence><sentence id="6059">So, that - we had the - like, we were Poles, but we took off our triangles because then the people that work outside had white crosses across the back with the paint. </sentence><sentence id="6060">Like, whatever - if you worked outside, you had the white cross painted like this right across the back. </sentence><sentence id="6061">So, Krysia and I, we came to a conclusion that she works in the kitchen, she gets some flour and water, and she'll be able to make the crosses, new crosses, on our clothes, because we - we had clothes there. </sentence><sentence id="6062">We were also distributed some clothes for us because it was a small camp. </sentence><sentence id="6063">It wasn't a big camp. </sentence><sentence id="6064">We were all girls. </sentence><sentence id="6065">And this, we decided that we are going to run away, but we had to have a strategy. </sentence><sentence id="6066">We had a Jewish girl from Lublin. </sentence><sentence id="6067">She was blonde and had blue eyes, and she spoke perfect German. </sentence><sentence id="6068">She was one of us working in the barracks because there were either ten or twelve of us working the barracks. </sentence><sentence id="6069">I don't remember. </sentence><sentence id="6070">Since she could speak so well German, we decided that she's going to steal the kapo's - you know, kapos were wearing a black cape, a black cape what covered whatever - they didn't wear uniforms, just a black cape with a hood. </sentence><sentence id="6071">So, she stole this hood from her, and then Krysia - we decided that what we can do to take the crosses off, all we had to do is this, is to just crumbled the - like we had to wear the crosses inside, but in order to get outside, to run away from camp - I knew exactly because my boss didn't come to work that day. </sentence><sentence id="6072">I don't know whether he came later or so, because it was ten days before the end of the war - ten  or twelve days before the end of the war. </sentence><sentence id="6073">So, in the morning, we got up this Helena was her name - she put on the cape, we made sure that there was no sign of the cross, and she - we came to the gate. </sentence><sentence id="6074">She told the post that she registers with him ten people going to work outside, whatever - she knew what to say, where outside, and he says - he showed us to go. </sentence><sentence id="6075">We went to the road, and all - from there on, we didn't have to worry because all the Germans were running towards west. </sentence><sentence id="6076">They were afraid. </sentence><sentence id="6077">The Russians were very close, so the Germans were leaving their homes and everything marching, running away from the Russians. </sentence><sentence id="6078">They were afraid. </sentence><sentence id="6079">So, we were in the group. </sentence><sentence id="6080">Nobody noticed us. </sentence><sentence id="6081">Nobody bothered us, but we didn't have what to eat and we didn't know what to do. </sentence><sentence id="6082">But, we run away. </sentence><sentence id="6083">We're out of the camp. </sentence><sentence id="6084">As a matter of fact, one girl from Radom that I suggested that she goes with us, she didn't want to go because she had - somebody gave her spreads - some sardines, a box of sardines. </sentence><sentence id="6085">She had it with someone. </sentence><sentence id="6086">She didn't want to leave it, or she didn't - she didn't want to give it to her, and she didn't want - because she wanted to eat it, she didn't want to run away. </sentence><sentence id="6087">So, they went to another camp from there, you know, after - the Russians were - they must have gotten orders to go more west, but we were already free. </sentence><sentence id="6088">So, we - that was it. </sentence><sentence id="6089">Those were the camps. </sentence><sentence id="6090">Now, Krysia - she worked in the kitchen so, she stuck, you know, she cooked and she - she was sending to us - she was working on the second floor and so, we - we used to go under - stand under the kitchen and have our metal thing with the handle. </sentence><sentence id="6091">She would push down a string. </sentence><sentence id="6092">We would put the string on the handle. </sentence><sentence id="6093">She roped it, and she would take - because there was meat, like horse meat, but we didn't get it; the Germans - the Germans got it. </sentence><sentence id="6094">We only got the soup. </sentence><sentence id="6095">So, she would take a tongue or whatever, you know, she had there a big piece - a big piece of meat she would send it back. </sentence><sentence id="6096">We would take it and divide among all the girls. </sentence><sentence id="6097">So, everybody had something, not only something to eat, but we were not used to such - so rich food. </sentence><sentence id="6098">It was tremendous. </sentence><sentence id="6099">One day she tells me this story. </sentence><sentence id="6100">She worked there. </sentence><sentence id="6101">She stole a pound of butter. </sentence><sentence id="6102">It was, you know, one of those pounds in foil, and she says she didn't know what to do with it because, I mean, the Germans was - her boss, the German cook, was watching her. </sentence><sentence id="6103">So, she put it in her pants so that she could take the butter to take to us, and when she started working and cleaning up, the butter started dripping, and she got so scared she almost died. </sentence><sentence id="6104">She - but anyway, she managed somehow to bring the butter - the butter to feed us. </sentence><sentence id="6105">So, we really in Retzow we didn't have a bad day, because she was supplying all the food. </sentence><sentence id="6106">She was stealing it, but she was supplying all the food and nobody - all the girls that knew, they noticed that I went out to get whatever, they were already waiting. </sentence><sentence id="6107">I mean everybody was hungry. </sentence><sentence id="6108">So, that was also lucky. </sentence><sentence id="6109">We were lucky there. </sentence><sentence id="6110">But, this is all about Retzow. </sentence><sentence id="6111">There's very -
