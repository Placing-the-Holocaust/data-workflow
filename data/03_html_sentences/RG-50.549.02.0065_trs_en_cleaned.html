<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="685">A: Yes, in a way I did, but I remember it made me so comfortable. </sentence><sentence id="686">The only -- frankly, I'm sorry to say, the only guy that made me uncomfortable was a Jewish guy in the unit, because not what he did towards us or anything, it was the way he behaved. </sentence><sentence id="687">We came out of an anti-Semitic world, or group, and we -- myself -- we behaved, before we became prisoners, while we were prisoners, in a way that normal -- but em -- let me say I didn't USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0065 29 fin -- I hate to say this, cause it sounds like prejudice, but it isn't. </sentence><sentence id="688">Jews from eastern Europe are different Jews from western Europe, because they grew up in ghettos, the eastern European, the -- the western u -- was integrated, like my family was. </sentence><sentence id="689">I didn't know that I was Jewish until [indecipherable] I didn't know I was Jewish, I went to synagogue, but it never concerned me, never gave me a problem. </sentence><sentence id="690">And then came the Jews from the ghettos, and with the pious, and other things, and I was in the impression, the way the Nazis made us look bad, the Jews, they said all Jews are merchants, or they get the money out of pocket of a -- questioned the ma --[indecipherable]. </sentence><sentence id="691">I found out that some of the guys who came from Poland, because of their surroundings, were different people. </sentence><sentence id="692">And I look at them differently, just like the Germans -- the non-Jewish people looked at Germans who -- or who are Jewish, and [indecipherable] they said they like us. </sentence><sentence id="693">Whereas in Poland, because living conditions in Poland said these are not [indecipherable] Jews, or whatever, they're different. </sentence><sentence id="694">But in -- in the American army, the one Jew that I met in the company was not a nice guy, to start with, and nothing to do with being Jewish, but he did some of the things that Jews were oft accused of. </sentence><sentence id="695">He tried to make money, and the way he did it, he gambled with soldiers, he took the money out of their pocket. </sentence><sentence id="696">I'm not saying that non-Jews don't do that, but I was a little bit more aware of things -- not to be criticized because I -- whatever I do is -- as a money business, or whatever. </sentence><sentence id="697">I was not in a position to anyway, but -- but there were things this guy did, and had w -- he won quite a bit of money, had already done this on the way over, on the ship, had made thousands of dollars. </sentence><sentence id="698">And so I -- the others were [indecipherable] and  ontectnstonancedjusietneey for ther biormatierabouttfisstecion USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0065 30 they saw this, too. </sentence><sentence id="699">And they saw that we didn't associate very much with him, unless he associated with us, he was a -- and he was from New York. </sentence><sentence id="700">He was what you might call a ghetto type. </sentence><sentence id="701">Now, New York the ghetto, too. </sentence><sentence id="702">So New York Jews, I -- I -- I when people ask me where you from, some people think I'm from New York, cause I pick up a little accent from the three months I was there. </sentence><sentence id="703">And -- and so I wa -- I wasn't very proud of him, he did a lot of things that didn't make me proud to be a Jew, or something I could -- you could say. </sentence><sentence id="704">I was ashamed for him. </sentence><sentence id="705">And so your answer to your question that the American were nice, yes, they -- they were nice, I found this guy Hansen, didn't speak German because he -- he felt very badly about, from a moral viewpoint that this happened by his former people that he came from. </sentence><sentence id="706">And he didn't like that. </sentence><sentence id="707">Like Lieutenant Hovlent was -- I found out after the war, was very religious, that's why he behaved that way, and the guys also, I -- I compare notes with many people, but soldiers behave different in war -- in the war [indecipherable] conditions. </sentence><sentence id="708">Like the villages we were in, guys thought about taking the women, maybe the husband wasn't there, and didn't make any difference to them, and [indecipherable] it didn't happen our unit, not that anybody got caught, but -- but the guy that I don't -- didn't like, he would have been capable of doing such a thing. </sentence><sentence id="709">He tried it one time, and I -- we told him, Mike and I, sta -- stop. </sentence><sentence id="710">He came to the [indecipherable], I told you about that farm woman, that

because I love the Nazis, or that, but this is a human youMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0065 being, don't do this. </sentence><sentence id="716">There's no -- this woman is not a -- walk around in uniform with the Nazis, tha -- she is just plain farm woman, and her husband's at the front because he was ordered that way. </sentence><sentence id="717">And you don't do this, be -- how would you come a soldier into your home?" </sentence><sentence id="718">And he ever -- absolutely had been drinking too. </sentence><sentence id="719">And we told him that he better go home to his home. </sentence><sentence id="720">And he kept on, and we took away his rifle, because we thought he might -- not do anything to us, but [indecipherable] well, and we just [indecipherable] that he was the only one that we knew -- there may have been another guy was Jewish, but -- but we had good experiences too, after, and -- with Jews, and non-Jews. </sentence><sentence id="721">But he gave me a bitter taste in the mouth, and I -- he got married, and later had kids, I called him, and [indecipherable] but I never went to visit him, I just talked to him on the phone, you know. </sentence><sentence id="722">And the guys was nice to us, why, I -- well, basically because what we had endured. </sentence><sentence id="723">And there were many, and they'd seen pictures in the paper, and read about it. </sentence><sentence id="724">So they probably felt a little sorry for us, but we didn't feel sorry for ourselves, so there was no problem. </sentence><sentence id="725">We weren't -- we were treated okay, like men, and -- and there were talks about them, we'll find a way -- they want to go to the United States, which Michael did. </sentence><sentence id="726">So [indecipherable] many nice people there, aga -- or say that you thought the Americans were nice. </sentence><sentence id="727">And we found out that a lot of them were of different background, like Louie was one, then we found Irish Catholic, and we found all kinds of religions. </sentence><sentence id="728">And maybe because some guys were religious, or believers, that's why they were nice. </sentence><sentence id="729">And people were not so nice. </sentence><sentence id="730">Cannot say that they were not religious, but they -- th-they - - people like [indecipherable] that I said about Jews now, I [indecipherable] for the other USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0065 32 Poles too, who were not Jews, we had many experiences with them, too. </sentence><sentence id="731">Some of them were worse than the Germans, some of them were in guards, or were [indecipherable] from the area, were sometime with Germany, and sometimes not. </sentence><sentence id="732">And when we had Poles as supervisors for our work, they beat us like the SS did. </sentence><sentence id="733">So, I cannot make statement, all American are nice, or all are bad, or Jews, or whatever. </sentence><sentence id="734">And -- or Italians are a certain way. </sentence><sentence id="735">Yeah, I think that it's -- it -- it's [indecipherable], and we found out very early that we didn't -- like Nick Hansen was German [indecipherable]. </sentence><sentence id="736">I disagreed with him, I said, "Talk to these people, not all of them are bad. </sentence><sentence id="737">If all of them had been bad, I wouldn't be here today. </sentence><sentence id="738">There were some good ones." </sentence><sentence id="739">But I -- my experience has been talking to people -- Americans, maybe Jewish people savay, that those who were not in the camps, hate the Germans more than the wa -- than the ones who were in the camp. </sentence><sentence id="740">That's an unusual thing. </sentence><sentence id="741">Because they say all Germans are bad, some of them are -- all -- all the Nazis are, they make -- don't differentiate be -- no Nazis. </sentence><sentence id="742">And so I saw Poles who -- that were very bad, and who are -- had German SS, and some of the Poles, and know, you find bad and good everywhere, but being good, and being able to do good, also had something to do with material things. </sentence><sentence id="743">United States is a rich country. </sentence><sentence id="744">We had soldier chocolate there, had everything to eat. </sentence><sentence id="745">And it's easy to be a good guy sometimes, when you have a lot of things, if that's what needed, bread, or something to eat, be hungry. </sentence><sentence id="746">And then somebody -- the -- the person I feel is sometimes really good, a real great person, when they don't have much, and then give away something. </sentence><sentence id="747">And right now, I did pretty well in life, professionally. </sentence><sentence id="748">I worked hard, and I -- I'm glad I'm not dependent on USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0065 33 German government because I came out sick for the rest of my life, and get a small pension. </sentence><sentence id="749">The business that's going on now in getting back for the Jews, the -- some of the things that they owned, paintings, or getting pension, because they -- bec -- like Social Security, they say if you worked as slave labor, but -- but the companies that that used your slave labor should pay you compensation. </sentence><sentence id="750">I filed for it, I didn't want to. </sentence><sentence id="751">My wife did for me, I sign it, because I -- I certainly earned it, and I yi -- I -- I know -- I know I wor -- worked for what German companies, but I said they should have given it -- most people are dead already -- right after the war, and they're -- they're waiting so long til they're -- no -- not many left any more. </sentence><sentence id="752">So when the money comes, Ill take it, but I am not going to use it for myself, I'm going to give it away. </sentence><sentence id="753">To my wife, who has been good to me, can do whatever she wants, and some percentage to a good cause, not necessarily a Jewish good cause. </sentence><sentence id="754">In my donations, I include the others as well as Jews. </sentence><sentence id="755">And I don't need their money, and I -- I tell you, I'm torn from the experience that really upset me. </sentence><sentence id="756">I got myself examined by Germany, to file for [indecipherable] you know what the [indecipherable] is? </sentence><sentence id="757">Making [indecipherable], and normally you do that if you have a -- something happen to you, and you get -- you need medi -- medical help for your life, and the Germans pay for it, some extent. </sentence><sentence id="758">Well, number one, I went in the army, for various reasons, to give something back to this country, as a civil service employee, in the army now, in the army, also as a volunteer. </sentence><sentence id="759">And like I said, I got exa-examined, and they said to me, some people, "Yeah, but you -- you act like a -- like the strong guy, you're a military officer." </sentence><sentence id="760">He -- some -- some people said, "You don't look sick to me." </sentence><sentence id="761">And I said, "I'm not, I," -- USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0065 34 but -- but when you go in the -- the Germans, you got to tell them you -- you suffer. </sentence><sentence id="762">I didn't. </sentence><sentence id="763">That's ridiculous. </sentence><sentence id="764">I'm not suffering, I'm happy, I don't need them, and -- but I did get myself examined, and they didn't pass the law, whether you have something or not, you get the minimum, if you have been one year in a camp, or more. </sentence><sentence id="765">So -- but then they came up with something else, not -- couple of years ago, which is like Social Security, say they worked, but they didn't pay in, but we owe it to them. </sentence><sentence id="766">We didn't pay them, si -- they came out with German Social Security, and they sent me a letter, and they said, "Yes, you entitled that, but you must pay in the basic sum, so we can start in to -- to make it so many quarters, you don't have enough." </sentence><sentence id="767">Or whatever, I -- I [indecipherable]. </sentence><sentence id="768">So I did that, and I figure I earned that. </sentence><sentence id="769">And they said, "In your --

</sentence><sentence id="770">Who are you -- did you work for?" </sentence><sentence id="771">And I did say it, and send the papers in. </sentence><sentence id="772">And then they said, "You got to

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1632">A: Well, I was chosen from my battalion, wh-which was at a strength of about seven to 800 men, I was chosen the soldier of the month, that meant being a good soldier, and doing things right, and handling weapons all right, and going to study certain items, or things, that the army needed. </sentence><sentence id="1633">Basically what a young soldier does who first comes in the USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0065 59 army, nothing special. </sentence><sentence id="1634">Well, out of this, based on the points you win, through the months, I got the highest points, and was named soldier of the month. </sentence><sentence id="1635">That meant having the honor of sitting in the colonel's office, on Saturday morning when there was no training, and answering his telephone, on -- on the -- on his -- yeah, outside -- sit -- sitting outside the colonel's office, with the adjutant, who was a captain. </sentence><sentence id="1636">At that time the colonel was reading the New York Times, and all of a sudden, very loud he said, when he read the headlines in the New York Times, which said Israel a state, United Nations has voted to welcome Israel into the nations of the free world, or -- and the colonel said to himself, or maybe so everybody could hear it in the office, "Goddamn Jew politics." </sentence><sentence id="1637">Well, the adjutant knew that I was Jewish, the colonel didn't. </sentence><sentence id="1638">He wasn't very much interested in the soldier of the month. </sentence><sentence id="1639">To him it was just another soldier answering telephone -- although I did get a certificate from him for that. </sentence><sentence id="1640">And he -- I -- I wasn't sure how I was going to respond to that, he didn't say this to -- to me, just to himself, expressed something real loud in the office, and I walked out, and I wasn't going to have the honor of sitting in this man's outer office. </sentence><sentence id="1641">The adjutant came after me, he knew what I was doing, and he knew that I'd understood what the colonel had said. </sentence><sentence id="1642">He was very embarrassed, and he asked me to please come back. </sentence><sentence id="1643">He didn't want to make a big issue out of this. </sentence><sentence id="1644">I said, "No, I just came here to the United States, and I admire the freedoms we have here, also freedom of expression, but -- but not improper things like -- like that." </sentence><sentence id="1645">So he underst -- said he understands, but it wasn't his opinion, and no -- he didn't think anybody else in the office, just the colonel's opinion. </sentence><sentence id="1646">Well, I said I can understand,  USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0065 60 everybody's entitled to his opinion, but not in a position like he is, make a blanket statement like that. </sentence><sentence id="1647">So, the final thing was that I did not go back to the office, and in leaving him, he said, "Willner, remember for the rest of your career, that all kinds of people make this world." </sentence><sentence id="1648">And I just remember that sometimes. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1668">Q: Did you ever experience any -- did -- repercussions? </sentence><sentence id="1669">You were saying a little earlier that -- that the adjutant was concerned that you were going to be maybe demoted, or something, because you had left the office. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1672">A: I -- I -- I really, at that time, could care less. </sentence><sentence id="1673">I mean, I didn't -- I -- I -- I didn't think of that I'm afraid of being -- I don't think that could have happened to me, knowing already what I knew about the U.S. army, that everybody's pretty much the same, and people are people, there are good ones and bad ones. </sentence><sentence id="1674">There's always a rotten apple somewhere. </sentence><sentence id="1675">But there also good apples on top. </sentence><sentence id="1676">So, it didn't bother me. </sentence><sentence id="1677">Particularly, I was very con -- not concerned, but aware of the freedom that people had here, and this was part of it. </sentence><sentence id="1678">When I finished that basic training, was a battalion at Fort Dix, my luck started. </sentence><sentence id="1679">The whole battalion was ordered to Alaska, about 700 men or so, and I was in despair. </sentence><sentence id="1680">I thought if I'm going to be in the army, I'm going to use my language background, French or German, or both, but what about Alaska? </sentence><sentence id="1681">Besides it's very cold there. </sentence><sentence id="1682">So from my viewpoint, I also had to consider -- which I always considered, giving back something to this country, and I was debating with myself, well maybe I should go to Alaska, like everybody else, but again here's free speech, I can open my mouth and say I'm better fit for Germany, or France. </sentence><sentence id="1683">I can do the army more good, and perform better than being a    USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0065 61 soldier. </sentence><sentence id="1684">Many soldiers better than I am, they can shoot better, and do this better, that better. </sentence><sentence id="1685">And I decided, no, I should not keep my mouth shut. </sentence><sentence id="1686">And particularly I thought perhaps, being soldier of the month, maybe somebody remembers me, and they will talk to me, because not normally down in the army that you go and complain [indecipherable] with reason. </sentence><sentence id="1687">So I went to see another officer who was in personnel, and I said what I'm -- I'm -- I'm not norm -- not normally in the habit of making complaints, this not a complaint, a suggestion, I would appreciate look into this. </sentence><sentence id="1688">That -- that [indecipherable], as you know, I said, the battalion, infantry battalion is going to Alaska, and I feel that I'm wasting my time, and I'm wasting the army's time by just being a soldier. </sentence><sentence id="1689">The only thing he has to know maybe, to fire some weapon, and I can do that, but I can do much more if I'm in a position in -- in Europe someplace. </sentence><sentence id="1690">So the United States at that time was all over Europe, except in the east. </sentence><sentence id="1691">And so, make the long story short, he didn't say yes or no, but he said, "You'll be notified." </sentence><sentence id="1692">I was n-notified the next day that I'm taken off the orders. </sentence><sentence id="1693">So that was the first day, it didn't say I was going to Germany, but then I went around, I was excited. </sentence><sentence id="1694">I went, asked some people, some -- most people didn't know, but then I came up on the sergeant who said, "Yeah, I've seen your name. </sentence><sentence id="1695">| think you're going to Germany." </sentence><sentence id="1696">Well, I -- I was hoping he was right, and it was true. </sentence><sentence id="1697">I went to Germany, and on the ship to transport were some other foreign-born people, also in the army, mostly Polish, or Czechs, in total about 10. </sentence><sentence id="1698">And when we arrived in Germany, in Bremerhaven, the security people came on board, and they said, "You, you, and you, and you. </sentence><sentence id="1699">You remain here." </sentence><sentence id="1700">There was myself included, another guy from [indecipherable] Germany, USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0065 62 and about seven or eight Poles, and one or two Czechs. </sentence><sentence id="1701">And what this was, they were hunting spies. </sentence><sentence id="1702">The -- the [indecipherable] Intelligence had gotten information that some of the people who claimed to be refugees from the east, were not -- were from the east, but were not refugees, they pretended to be. </sentence><sentence id="1703">They want to get into United States, and spy for Russia, or Poland. </sentence><sentence id="1704">But they check everybody out then, including myself. </sentence><sentence id="1705">Anybody was fa -- I forgot to say, I was not a citizen at the time. </sentence><sentence id="1706">And everybody -- oh -- oh -- amo -- among these 10 men, didn't have American citizenship. </sentence><sentence id="1707">The regulation at that time was that anybody who immigrate to United States, who comes in, and is of draft age, will serve in the army first. </sentence><sentence id="1708">This for all the people who signed papers that they come for permanent residence to United States -- not if you're visiting here, you -- and you've given up your citizenship. </sentence><sentence id="1709">I never reclaimed my German citizenship, which I could have. </sentence><sentence id="1710">I can go today the German embassy and say, "Under Hitler I was deprived of a German citizenship, I want it back." </sentence><sentence id="1711">I could have it. </sentence><sentence id="1712">I know somebody that did that here. </sentence><sentence id="1713">I have no interest in that. </sentence><sentence id="1714">They can keep their citizenship after all that. </sentence><sentence id="1715">So -- so we were held in Marmuk, Germany, we came in Bremerhaven port, then went by train to Marmuk, Germany. </sentence><sentence id="1716">It's an old German castle. </sentence><sentence id="1717">There were no fences or anything again. </sentence><sentence id="1718">Not as a prisoner, but just a place to live. </sentence><sentence id="1719">And they told us they have to investigate each one of us, and clear us to go to our new assignment. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1770">Q: What year was this? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1772">A: This was in 1948. </sentence><sentence id="1773">I didn't think, frankly, that six -- seven months, or eight months after immigrate to United States, I would be back where I came from. </sentence><sentence id="1774">Never in my </sentence></p><p><sentence id="1775"> USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0065 63 wildest dreams I would have thought -- it wouldn't have happened if I would have gone to Alaska, and I thought I'd go to Alaska, or go the Far East or something. </sentence><sentence id="1776">But -- so I opened my mouth, and I learned my first lesson, you want to get something done, don't complain about it, go and talk to the right people. </sentence><sentence id="1777">Maybe you'll get a no, like people are re-religious, who think about praying to God, to give them this or that, or -- and then it doesn't happen. </sentence><sentence id="1778">Or like a rabbi once said, here in the military, "Well, God is hearing you, but he just said no." </sentence><sentence id="1779">Well, that's the way I felt about some of these things, so they say no, say no, but at least I try. </sentence><sentence id="1780">I don't know if you see that little saying on the wall, I've had for 25 years. </sentence><sentence id="1781">Failures [indecipherable] people are failures. </sentence><sentence id="1782">Failures are people who thi -- who thought -- I'm n -- y -- all mixed up now -- who thought and never did. </sentence><sentence id="1783">Number [indecipherable] plan yama, but if you don't do anything, you know, nothing's going to happen, or you complain about somebody if you don't complain about -- you go into a store, and you have something to complain about the merchandise, or the sales lady, well don't talk to her, talk to her supervisor, or to the manager of the place. </sentence><sentence id="1784">Get something corrected. </sentence><sentence id="1785">So my saying is failures are divided into two classes, those who did and never thought, and those who thought and never did. </sentence><sentence id="1786">You thinking about a plan of something [indecipherable] or you do it, otherwise you might as well be talking to the wall. </sentence><sentence id="1787">And also [indecipherable] you doing something, to think about it first. </sentence><sentence id="1788">I have buil -- built many things which I thought were -- help m -- help me in my sickness, or whatever, and to -- in order to get my shoes on better. </sentence><sentence id="1789">It's harder to get myself dressed, and I've become very inventive. </sentence><sentence id="1790">The moment I think about something, I start doing it already. </sentence><sentence id="1791">But a lot of </sentence></p><p><sentence id="1792"> USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0065 64 things I've done, just sitting in a corner, they're useless. </sentence><sentence id="1793">But I did them, so it was fun doing them, and the idea to do this, and I pass on the ideas to other people, who were able to help themselves [indecipherable]. </sentence><sentence id="1794">So -- and finally -- it was about 10 days later, after sitting in [indecipherable], only two people were released to go to their destination, myself and another guy. </sentence><sentence id="1795">And all the Poles were kept, because they were pretty sure, they just didn't know who, that there were spies being infiltrated into the U.S. army in Europe. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="1796">Okay, that was the start of the Cold War, let's say, and -- but it was true, there were people who were being infiltrated. </sentence><sentence id="1797">It was a good chance for them to do that. </sentence><sentence id="1798">And to -- there was specifically a case -- not one case, 5,000 people, they called it the Lodge act. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="1799">Lodge was a senator, and he had a law passed that said there are many people in Europe, or in Germany, particularly, who came originally from East Bloc countries, from Poland and Russia maybe, Czechoslovakia, who cannot go back, because they are not Communists, or for other reasons, whatever. </sentence><sentence id="1800">Some unfortunately, because they're war criminals. </sentence><sentence id="1801">And he said, "We have to do something, we employing these people." </sentence><sentence id="1802">The U.S. army was employing them as auxiliary guards. </sentence><sentence id="1803">They had the regular uniform that GIs wore, but it was dyed black. </sentence><sentence id="1804">No insignia. </sentence><sentence id="1805">And they wore rifle at night, and they stood guard around these places, where there were American soldiers housed. </sentence><sentence id="1806">And these people, probably some of them were on the Nazi side [indecipherable] because they lost the war, not on the American side. </sentence><sentence id="1807">But the Lodge act said we give them a chance for new future, and they don't have any dependents, they must be unmarried. </sentence><sentence id="1808">We accept 5,000 of these people, who are already working for us, in the --

id="1810">A: -- he was a army Intelligence school at Owamagow, Germany. </sentence><sentence id="1811">That's where they have the Passion play, you may have heard about that. </sentence><sentence id="1812">And the school had two courses, and I was picked for the criminal investigator's course. </sentence><sentence id="1813">What is this, being a de-de-detective in the army. </sentence><sentence id="1814">Which is nice, because you don't have to wear a uniform, you go out in civilian clothes. </sentence><sentence id="1815">So you're a soldier, I fig-figure for tho -- for two years, and you have a ID that you are a -- a detective, or a criminal investigator in this case [indecipherable], and you have many privileges, including most of the officer's normally have. </sentence><sentence id="1816">Here I was only a private, or a corporal, and I applied for it, and the captain called me in, and he said, "Well, I don't think you are qualified." </sentence><sentence id="1817">I said, "Why not, sir?" " </sentence><sentence id="1818">You're too short." </sentence><sentence id="1819">I said, "Captain, have you ever heard of exceptions?" </sentence><sentence id="1820">I thought he was a guy who would cat -- not ask please do this, or do that, or -- I -- I was showing him that I knew what was on. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="1821">He said, "Yeah, well wh-what do -- exception would you have?" " </sentence><sentence id="1822">An exception for height." </sentence><sentence id="1823">I know that the minimum is five foot in 0 -- in -- in officer's school the same thing, but they give a -- a exception. </sentence><sentence id="1824">He said, "And your English is not that good." </sentence><sentence id="1825">I said, "That's true, but I can learn very fast." </sentence><sentence id="1826">And [indecipherable] he didn't want to let me go to school. </sentence><sentence id="1827">So at that time, I had this civilian friend, a lady, who was a girlfriend of a colonel, who was higher than the captain, she told him my story, and that the captain had refused let me go to school. </sentence><sentence id="1828">And this girl called this captain and said, "Why don't you let Willner go to school?" </sentence><sentence id="1829">He had some stupid reasons. </sentence><sentence id="1830">He himself was a stupid man, and so </sentence></p><p><sentence id="1831"> USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0065 66 the colonel said, "Well I -- I think he is very capable, and I think you should consider him." </sentence><sentence id="1832">He couldn't tell him what to do, but captains don't fool around with colonels. </sentence><sentence id="1833">And so next thing I know was an orders to come investigator's school. </sentence><sentence id="1834">Very interesting, in the mountains, beautiful, and I became a criminal investigator and they teach you all the things a detective learns. </sentence><sentence id="1835">But you deal only with army members, or air force, or navy. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="1836">And -- so when I finished that, I was assigned to Heidelberg, which is the headquarters for yu -- all U.S. forces in Europe. </sentence><sentence id="1837">And in Heidelberg -- it -- it's the headquarters where there's staff officers. </sentence><sentence id="1838">Well I wasn't going to be a staff officer, because first of all I wasn't an officer. </sentence><sentence id="1839">Number two, that's -- you have to know good knowledge of the English language, you had to write reports, staff studies, that wasn't for me, I knew that. </sentence><sentence id="1840">So I didn't turn out -- I'm going to the right school, and -- well, in Heidelberg. </sentence><sentence id="1841">Our captain, the commander, was a Jewish guy by the name of Marcus. </sentence><sentence id="1842">He was a lawyer in civilian life, and he was being -- he had been drafted for the army, and he became the commander of the investigation unit. </sentence><sentence id="1843">So he was very good. </sentence><sentence id="1844">And -- and then he ha -- assigned me to an en -- to a guy who also was Jewish, who had been a police force in

of officers, who made more money being officers in the army than civilian life, wanted to stay in the army as a career, but they couldn't use everybody on staff, there was too many people. </sentence><sentence id="1854">They were losing the forces, and he was rift. </sentence><sentence id="1855">And then they had a deal, when people were rift, could re-enlist in the army, but not as

opinion, to have people moted up, and then they go down again. </sentence><sentence id="1858">But again, that was our system, and when I knew him was a captain, and I was a corporal, so Captain Marcus said, "You go as -- w -- Goldstein." </sentence><sentence id="1859">And it turned out to be terrific experience, he turned out to be a terrific guy. </sentence><sentence id="1860">He was very good

</sentence><sentence id="2299">Well, may -- they -- if I thought, or somebody else thought, among those hundred Germans, may be two Americans we're looking for, they decided to dig them all up, and sometimes that the uniforms, they were a mess. </sentence><sentence id="2300">But fortunately, I didn't have anything to do with that, Ijust had to investigation, and -- and then report, and then they took action on what to do about it. </sentence><sentence id="2301">So I had this place with about a hundred Germans, and I said to this farmer, "Are you sure they're no Americans?" </sentence><sentence id="2302">Because I got after action reports from the army, before I [indecipherable].They said the 75" infantry company went through there, through the area, and I had a map -- had their all map f -- when they went to the war, and they send out two scouts, to find out where the Germans [indecipherable], and those two scouts never came back. </sentence><sentence id="2303">I have reason to assume they got killed, if they were taken prisoner, and they could have [indecipherable] as prisoners, but prisoners we usually found alive. </sentence><sentence id="2304">So, here already hundred or so Germans, and they decided to dig up. </sentence><sentence id="2305">When I said I come back in two or three days, when you should be finished, and then -- and they had not archaeologists, but  ontectnstonancedjusietneey for ther biormatierabouttfisstecion USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0065 84 they had dentists sometime, and [indecipherable] soldiers. </sentence><sentence id="2306">And they couldn't, they were bloody and rotten already. </sentence><sentence id="2307">But the teeth, you could tell. </sentence><sentence id="2308">And the other thing was dogtags. </sentence><sentence id="2309">Had the dogtags, you have two of them, and take one off and take it with you, to report that this man was killed. </sentence></p></dialogue>

</sentence><sentence id="2710">So I find this major on the boat, on the ferry. </sentence><sentence id="2711">I go over to him, and I say, "Excuse me sir, I know it's illegal, I know you cannot give

about Nazism, and how much she knew about Jews. </sentence><sentence id="3612">Not from her parents, but after the war, because they didn't have any Jews where she lived, in the countryside there. </sentence><sentence id="3613">All she did, she thinks one girl that she befriended was Jewish, probably, but she wasn't sure, when she was a kid. </sentence><sentence id="3614">And so [indecipherable] I did get married to this girl, and he got permission right away, in the -- in the army, you had to get permission, because -- not just for security, but they didn't want any bad elements to come into United States, girls who were prostitutes, or -- excuse me, or had other things, Communists, or something. </sentence><sentence id="3615">And so they tried to get the -- the army required two things . </sentence><sentence id="3616">In one, a form, a letter from your commanding officer, your boss, that he certif -- that he okays that so and so gets married to -- and there's -- he had to do some checking with the police, and then finally approve it. </sentence><sentence id="3617">In a case of an officer, in my case, I had to meet Colonel Skolie, my immediate superior, but it was only a performer thing. </sentence><sentence id="3618">I had the paper typed out, and I just said, "Would you please sign my permission to get married?" </sentence><sentence id="3619">Because I was an officer, I had more of a privilege, let's say. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="3620">And they -- they -- they assumed that an officer, which wasn't always true, had the common sense not to

id="3624">But anyway, when I came with my paper to my colonel, he of course signed it right away, and he had known me for awhile already, so we had no problem. </sentence><sentence id="3625">But then my -- the second thing that we had to get was permission from the </sentence></p><p><sentence id="3626">  USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0065 137 chaplain -- not permission, to have the chaplain

that army chapel, which is -- in the army serves all faith. </sentence><sentence id="3629">So when the Jews have their service, they cover up the cross, usually, and the rabbi comes and talks from the chapel. </sentence><sentence id="3630">In that time the Jewish community in Heidelberg was about 200 people. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="3631">So we had a Jewish chaplain, in this case, Orthodox. </sentence><sentence id="3632">So there is -- you never know what the chaplain, if he's Jewish, whether Orthodox, Reformed, or Conservative. </sentence><sentence id="3633">The army took them in, and there were usually many Orthodox rabbis who didn't have a job because every o-orth -- there a lot of ri -- guys -- rabbis, who don't have a congregation here in the United States. </sentence><sentence

understand it. </sentence><sentence id="3643">I was never much interested in it, but -- but when I did go to chapel, I wanted to make sure if I did say something, I want to understand it. </sentence><sentence id="3644">So, with the Orthodox, we had no common ground, they -- they didn't do what the army [indecipherable] told them to, to say it in English, but they -- they rattled, and

by the way, my wife and I agreed before we got married, that we would like to have probably four children, and soon, because we got married, both, at an old age. </sentence><sentence id="5238">I was 32 almost, and she was 30. </sentence><sentence id="5239">And religion was going to be no problem. </sentence><sentence id="5240">I only stated that I want my children to grow up with the Jewish

that's not necessary, like I said before. </sentence><sentence id="5242">What's in -- what's in your heart, that's what's important. </sentence><sentence id="5243">In her case, I knew particularly what was -- so Albert was born in Germany, then went to American schools, some overseas in Japan. </sentence><sentence id="5244">And finally he went to college here in the United States, and he got an ROTC schol -- ROTC scholar -- scholarship. </sentence><sentence id="5245">And he happened to come out as the number one man in his class, and the first man that the -- top man who gets the scholarship

out. </sentence><sentence id="5250">So, to make a real, real long story short, after I finish the ROTC, and he -- he majored in political science, and he went into the army, got a regular commission, then became a paratrooper, became a ranger, studied Chinese for three years, went to China for one year on an educational tour, just traveling around for one year. </sentence><sentence id="5251">Then became a -- what they call a foreign area officer, studies foreign areas, they must know the language. </sentence><sentence id="5252">And then he didn't think that he should be just a soldier at a desk, he should be a combat soldier. </sentence><sentence id="5253">And I must say also, frankly, that I feel what happened in World War two, when Jews were not able to defend themselves, I didn't want my children to be in a position -- you don't know when it's -- could happen. </sentence><sentence id="5254">There are people who would -- don't like Jews, and I -- I think German Jews particularly have been criticized why they went to the places of killing, like sheep. </sentence><sentence id="5255">Well, nobody had a gun. </sentence><sentence id="5256">In Germany nobody owned a gun, my father didn't own one, although my uncle owned a saber, which he brought back from World War two, but -- so I was very particular s -- I felt very strongly about getting a military education, in the same time serving your country, and seeing to it that we remain a democracy. </sentence><sentence id="5257">And the army can be responsible, to a certain extent, provided we have the right leaders. </sentence><sentence id="5258">And Albert went in, and then, since he wanted to become a combat soldier, not sit down and some -- somebody telling him, oh you're just a desk officer, he went to attack helicopters, and he was -- he was taught to fly Cobra attack helicopters, which were very successful during USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0065 193 several wars. </sentence><sentence id="5259">And then he became commander of -- of -- of the unit. </sentence><sentence id="5260">Then he got promoted to major, and then every officer who wants to stay in the army, ma-make the career today, must have a Master's degree in one field or another. </sentence><sentence id="5261">So the army gave Albert 18 months to go to the University of Virginia, and get a Master's degree within 18 months. </sentence><sentence id="5262">Well, again, to make a long story short, he finished his Master's degree in foreign relations in nine months instead of 18 months. </sentence><sentence

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="5398">Q: Wh-What about your other children? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="5400">A: Okay. </sentence><sentence id="5401">We come to Nicole, our oldest daughter. </sentence><sentence id="5402">Our oldest daughter was impressed by older son's beginnings in ROTC. </sentence><sentence id="5403">She didn't have ROTC when she started college -- and by the way, I must explain about education. </sentence><sentence id="5404">I was a male chauvinist, I must admit that, coming from Europe, from Germany. </sentence><sentence id="5405">German, and whether Jewish or not, most men were sh -- male chauvinists. </sentence><sentence id="5406">And when I came to United States [indecipherable] start in having children, I thought, not having too much money, that the boys must go to college. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="5407">Well very soon my [indecipherable] by my wife, and m-my daughters, and I felt in -- marriages sometimes don't last very long here. </sentence><sentence id="5408">The women have to have profession, too, so they can make their own living. </sentence><sentence id="5409">And I said, "Well, the money's not going to have me split three ways to go to college, it's going to be six ways from now on." </sentence><sentence id="5410">So how do I do that? </sentence><sentence id="5411">Well, I know how much money was avail -- and I had no experience with college, because nobody had st -- had started yet, and Albert was going to start. </sentence><sentence id="5412">So I said, "One thing Ill assure you of, the first year's assured, for everybody. </sentence><sentence id="5413">I -- I pay for it. </sentence><sentence id="5414">After that you're on your own." </sentence><sentence id="5415">So I want to put a taste in their mouths what college is like, not to say I go to work first, and like I have a lot of people that let their children go to work for   ontectnstonancedjusietneey for ther biormatierabouttfisstecion </sentence></p><p><sentence id="5416"> USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0065 196 a year, and they make so much money, and they don't want to get a college degree. </sentence><sentence id="5417">You know, why should I go to college, I can make more money not going? </sentence><sentence id="5418">So I didn't want that to happen, since I like -- like the education. </sentence><sentence id="5419">I picked some up in the army, picked up a degree in the army, but not like my oldest son. </sentence><sentence id="5420">Because my main interest was a family, not -- not studying. </sentence><sentence id="5421">So some of them wound up with scholarships, or part scholar -- and I made sure that, of course, they started first year, that was on me, and anything else later on will have to be scholarships, or borrow money from a bank, or from me, if -- if -- if nothing -- if you don't -- couldn't get the money, but you pay me back, because we have to get some money for your mother to be on her own someday. </sentence><sentence id="5422">I don't want her to be dependent on you. </sentence><sentence id="5423">| -- I want her to have enough to live on if something happens to me. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="5424">So they all agreed. </sentence><sentence id="5425">And I said, "If you need any money at the end of your college time, the fourth year, and the third year, and you can't get any loans because your dad makes too much money, or whatever, you can borrow money from me, and no interest. </sentence><sentence id="5426">And you pay me back when you can, when you start working." </sentence><sentence id="5427">And that's what happened every one of them. </sentence><sentence id="5428">The three last ones owed me each -- I don't know how much they owed me, but somewhere around 10,000 dollars each. </sentence><sentence id="5429">And I -- I agreed that -- like I said, no -- no interest. </sentence><sentence id="5430">If they can pay, they pay me back [indecipherable] hundred dollars a month. </sentence><sentence id="5431">And if they good -- good at it, paying back the money they owe me, said they owe me no interest. </sentence><sentence id="5432">I will let them off when I can afford to. </sentence><sentence id="5433">So as it turned out, the last three owed me about six, seven, 8,000 dollars, and I was at a point in time when I was making good money with the government, I said you all paid me back, what you could every month, </sentence></p><p><sentence id="5434"> USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0065 197 and y -- I -- I wrote it off, you don't owe me any money any more. </sentence><sentence id="5435">Because I could afford, there was nobody else going to college. </sentence><sentence id="5436">So they all understood, and they all were helping, and they were -- and they continue to do so. </sentence><sentence id="5437">So we go to Nina. </sentence><sentence id="5438">Nina, or Nicole, who is 39, the oldest daughter, is a terrific girl. </sentence><sentence id="5439">After she saw her mother doing these things in the military, and getting paid for it also, she volunteered after two years in college, to go out to ROTC. </sentence><sentence id="5440">In the meantime, her brother was a battalion commander, not really, but like -- but that the ROTC battalion commander. </sentence><sentence id="5441">And she got also a commission as a second lieutenant, and they gave me the honor to -- if I can appear in uniform, to be at the Pentagon, or at the college, and pin the bars on my daughter. </sentence><sentence id="5442">And so one side was her brother, and the other side was me, pinning second lieutenant bars on her. </sentence><sentence id="5443">So she became a captain in the army, then she met her husband, she was Intelligence in Berlin, very interesting career. </sentence><sentence id="5444">She was, since she studied psychology, they put her in Intelligence too, and she was dealing with the Russians in Berlin. </sentence><sentence id="5445">We visited her, we went to east Berlin. </sentence><sentence id="5446">She went in uniform, because the Russians had an agreement, they don't touch Americans. </sentence><sentence id="5447">The east Germans wanted to, but they were not allowed to touch us, it was a very interesting experience. </sentence><sentence id="5448">But anyway, Nina became a captain, then met her husband at the advanced Intelligence school in -- and she married a guy who was Catholic, but he agreed that the children were now Jewish. </sentence><sentence id="5449">So she got out of the army, he's now a lieutenant colonel, he was -- his last job was -- he was military attache -- defense attache in Belarus, which is white Russia, or the city of Minsk, where a lot of Jews lived, and still live. </sentence><sentence id="5450">They have three synagogues

Anendale, and she still brings her children up the Jewish way. </sentence><sentence id="5455">She has one boy and two girls. </sentence><sentence id="5456">And she educates them a very nice way, play the violin, play the piano, and so on. </sentence><sentence id="5457">And her husband has been offered now, the next assignment as a military attache to Czechoslovakia, to Prague. </sentence><sentence id="5458">And I said, "Take it, take it. </sentence><sentence id="5459">That's a nice place to go to, Prague." </sentence><sentence id="5460">We -- my wife and I have been there one time. </sentence><sentence id="5461">And so Nina is very successful in many ways, particularly bringing up her children the proper way. </sentence><sentence id="5462">And she did the right thing to leave the army. </sentence><sentence id="5463">She was a good soldier, she's a good mother, particularly sh-she studies ecology, which [indecipherable] in the army, no, she was near the mother. </sentence><sentence id="5464">So, we come to the third child, Marcel, who is money-wise, the most successful of all. </sentence><sentence id="5465">He worked for a congressman, for our congressman as
