<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="39">A: Matsas, right. </sentence><sentence id="40">And if it's a female is Matza, which really means you are the daughter of Matsas. </sentence><sentence id="41">In -- in Greece, you're either the daughter of someone, or the wife of someone. </sentence><sentence id="42">So it's the -- you -- you decline the -- the -- the name, Matsas, of Matza -- of Matsas, which becomes Matsas, the generative -- you decline the name. </sentence><sentence id="43">And so my name, maiden name is Matza, not Matsas. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="62">Q: That you can be named in the Sephardic tradition with someone who's alive. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="64">A: That's right. </sentence><sentence id="65">I think the Greek Jews adopted this tradition from the Christians because the Christian Greeks also name their children after the grandparents, regardless whether they're living or not, and so the first son is named after the father of the father, after the  Interview with Ninetta Feldman deg September 14, 2010 grandfather. </sentence><sentence id="66">The father of the father. </sentence><sentence id="67">The second son will be named after the father of the mother. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="76">Q: Oh, I see. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="78">A: The -- if there's a daughter, the first daughter will be named after the mother of the father, and the second daughter after the mother of the -- the f-- the mother, after the mother of the mother. </sentence><sentence id="79">So it creates a lot of confusion, because there are so many people with the same first name and surname. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="85">Q: Right, right. </sentence><sentence id="86">And what -- when were you born? </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="101">A: After my grandfather Nahoum. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="103">Q: Right. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="105">A: Now, to have a name like Nahoum in Greece does not make a child very comfortable, because it's very unusual. </sentence><sentence id="106">So he was -- he grew up known by that -- his nickname, Mykas(ph), his friends called him Mykas(ph), but his official name is Nahoum. </sentence><sentence id="107">And    Interview with Ninetta Feldman deg September 14, 2010 then when he came to the United States, he changed his name further, from -- Mykas(ph) became Michael. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="122">Q: Now, since you were so young at the time, do you think you can distinguish between what your earliest memories are, and what you were told happened, or is that difficult? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="124">A: That's a very, very good question, I often sort of struggle with it, trying to determine whether my recollection is a firsthand experience, or it's a reconstruction of what I heard from -- so many times from my parents and my brother. </sentence><sentence id="125">There are certain scenes that I know for sure; I'm talking about the earliest recollections, when I was perhaps three years old. </sentence><sentence id="126">There's certain scenes that I--I know, I remember very vividly. </sentence><sentence id="127">And I know these are firsthand recollections. </sentence></p></dialogue>

place, because the Germans have advanced to -- ar-are-are -- are in Agios Vlassis, and they are advancing in the direction of Psilovrahos. </sentence><sentence id="1141">By that time there were two

</sentence><sentence id="1143">They -- they were advised to go to a higher place up in the mountains. </sentence><sentence id="1144">And we arranged with a mule driver to come the following morning,

the Germans were advancing during the night, but there was a big explosion, a distant explosion. </sentence><sentence id="1146">We didn't know where it was coming from. </sentence><sentence id="1147">I should say that when Yonas Mionis came to alert us of the advance of the Germans, there was there -- the church bells started to ring alarm, and these young men of EPON was calling everybody to his feet, and urging able-bodied men to take their weapons, rifles, whatever they had, and go to Agios Vlassis to stop advance of the Germans. </sentence><sentence id="1148">So,

house. </sentence><sentence id="1156">And of course, he opens the door, sees this unlikely group of people, city people at his doorstep, he didn't know what was going on. </sentence><sentence id="1157">And -- and it was revealed that -- that wi -- th-the -- the mule driver told him who we were and why we were there. </sentence><sentence id="1158">So they probably -- he probably told them

heard the word Agrinion, he became very excited, because he told us that his daughter Theandafela(ph) was working for a family in Agrinion, the family of Davaroukas(ph). </sentence><sentence id="1161">And it so happened that Davaroukas(ph) was a colleague of my Interview with Ninetta Feldman * September 14, 2010 father's in the National Bank of Greece. </sentence><sentence id="1162">So he became very excited, because my father told him, oh I know your daughter, she came to the bank several times, and I know her, she is a very nice girl. </sentence><sentence id="1163">And you see, a lot of villagers would send their daughters into the city to work as maids in hope that they would learn to grow -- to learn -- acquire some skills with city people. </sentence><sentence id="1164">They would take them out of school and they would work as maids to bring some income for the family, and also learn to be nice young ladies, the way city people were. </sentence><sentence id="1165">So he

with the -- the children of the owner of the house, and they told me one day, oh -- they were boasting, oh, we have so much food now. </sentence><sentence id="1703">We have rice and beans, we have -- we even have candles. </sentence><sentence id="1704">We have things that we never had before. </sentence><sentence id="1705">And I -- I was very impressed, and I reported this to my parents, you know, I said the -- my friends, they told me they have all this good stuff. </sentence><sentence id="1706">And immediately my parents suspected that the owner of the house was the one who looted the room, and my father confronted him, and he denied that he -- he took anything. </sentence><sentence id="1707">And my father persisted, and he had to accept to -- the fact that -- he had to admit that he did take a few things. </sentence><sentence id="1708">He was afraid of my father talking about this to the village, and that he was going to be embarrassed. </sentence><sentence id="1709">And so he returned a few items. </sentence><sentence id="1710">But my parents knew that he probably had a lot more, and was hidden somewhere. </sentence><sentence id="1711">And so my father searched the -- the barn and other hidden -- possible Interview with Ninetta Feldman *8 September 14, 2010 places where he could have hidden food, and sure enough they -- he found a can of oil. </sentence><sentence id="1712">And oil was a real treasure, because was -- this is olive oil, was very hard to find, very valuable, if you were going to use it as a commodity to exchange it for other kinds of food. </sentence><sentence id="1713">So my parents were infuriated with this man because he -- he really -- he created the situation that we -- we were trying to avoid, and that is lack of food in the winter. </sentence><sentence id="1714">So they considered bringing this matter to the people's court. </sentence><sentence id="1715">There were people's courts then, in villages. </sentence><sentence id="1716">They were not official courts, but they were -- consisted of the elders of the village, and all sorts of ma -- matters of -- disputes were brought to the people's court. </sentence><sentence id="1717">And the people's court was actually very severe in punishments that -- that they imposed on people. </sentence><sentence id="1718">So my parents reconsidered that, because they were afraid he would be, who knows, imprisoned, or some very severe punishment; he had a young family, so they decided to drop the matter. </sentence><sentence id="1719">And that they also didn't want to draw attention to ourselves. </sentence><sentence id="1720">So they dropped the matter, and at this point we had to leave that room, and we went to another house to live in. </sentence><sentence id="1721">This was very similar to the one we occupied the first time. </sentence><sentence id="1722">This one had two rooms, one room was a kafeneio, a cafe. </sentence><sentence id="1723">And the other room was the room that we occupied, and th -- and it had a basement. </sentence><sentence id="1724">And so -- so that was a big change, it was -- we adjusted to it very quickly. </sentence><sentence id="1725">But the main concern now was food. </sentence><sentence id="1726">There was a family by the name Yovanos(ph) who lived in Agrinion, but had come to the village for the summer, and they stayed on because of the -- the war situation. </sentence><sentence id="1727">But they had decided to return to Agrinion. </sentence><sentence id="1728">And they had a lot of wheat with them. </sentence><sentence id="1729">So my father, being a bank Interview with Ninetta Feldman 4 September 14, 2010 employee, he conducted a transaction not with checks, but with wheat. </sentence><sentence id="1730">He told him, if you give us your wheat that is here, you can collect our wheat, which is stored in the bank. </sentence><sentence id="1731">It was an exchange, and no wheat had to travel to Agrinion or from Agrinion to Psilovrahos, but it was a transaction that s-seemed reasonable to him, and he gave us a certain amount of wheat. </sentence><sentence id="1732">But he had more wheat, but this other villager that was wealthy, who could have cooperated at this point and -- and he could have made the Yovanos(ph) wheat available to us, he decided not to do that, and he kept the wheat for -- for himself. </sentence><sentence id="1733">And that was a very callous thing to do, and he, years later when -- after the war, the man recognized that he had done something very, very bad, and he came to my father and my parents and -- and asked them for their forgiveness, because by -- by not agreeing to make this wheat available to us, he made life absolutely horrible for the family. </sentence><sentence id="1734">So -- so th-that is the situation now, we are -- we have very little food. </sentence><sentence id="1735">We do have this oil that the villager brings from the village, and this wheat. </sentence><sentence id="1736">Then my mother started exchanging sugar for a certain kind of cereal that is called Trachanas. </sentence><sentence id="1737">It's a--a coarsely ground wheat mixed with milk that is -- that -- that is in a dry state and when you add some milk, it expands, and it's a very nutritious food and very filling. </sentence><sentence id="1738">So -- so this is what my mother started doing, exchanging sugar for -- for Trachanas or corn meal. </sentence><sentence id="1739">Then some of the villagers would give us some eggs from the chickens, some milk, a piece of cheese. </sentence><sentence id="1740">It was a very difficult situation and there's winter approaching, it's already winter. </sentence><sentence id="1741">It is cold. </sentence><sentence id="1742">And so then, my mother, wh-who is a very resourceful person, she decided that --  Interview with Ninetta Feldman degdeg September 14, 2010 that she is going to barter clothing, our personal clothes, for food. </sentence><sentence id="1743">And so she became a peddler, and she went with my 13 year old brother from village to village, exchanging clothing for food. </sentence><sentence id="1744">Or, she did other things. </sentence><sentence id="1745">She knitted for people. </sentence><sentence id="1746">She was -- she had many skills. </sentence><sentence id="1747">She knew how to make lace. </sentence><sentence id="1748">An-And one -- one thought came to her mind is that the girls in the village, they want to prepare their dowry, and I can teach them how to --to knit. </sentence><sentence id="1749">I di-- can teach them how to embroider, how to make lace, and so -- and said, there are a lot of girls in the village who would want this, and they would exchange my services for food. </sentence><sentence id="1750">And the one family that I mentioned earlier, the Tsulamitsu(ph) family, they had seven daughters. </sentence><sentence id="1751">They had prepare seven dowries. </sentence><sentence id="1752">So she went to -- started with them. </sentence><sentence id="1753">And she'd go there every day and help them, show them how to embroider, how to make lace and so on, in exchange for cheese or bread or whatever they had. </sentence><sentence id="1754">So they ha -- my parents had to start rationing the food. </sentence><sentence id="1755">It was less and less every day. </sentence><sentence id="1756">And I --- I remember it was winter, still winter, and there were some mulberry trees and fig trees. </sentence><sentence id="1757">There are a lot of mulberry trees and fig trees in Greece. </sentence><sentence id="1758">And my mother said, you know, when these, you know, these fig trees, when

in the mountains. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="2126">They have left their -- their families to -- to save themselves, and they joined the resistance. </sentence><sentence id="2127">Unfortunately, a

tears. </sentence><sentence id="2139">And so she told us, and we were -- we were just devastated. </sentence><sentence id="2140">And I remember this scene. </sentence><sentence id="2141">I had never, ever seen my mother in that state. </sentence><sentence id="2142">Her eyes were -- her -- her feet were swollen, her face was swollen, her eyes were red, and she was physically exhausted and emotionally just absolutely drained. </sentence><sentence id="2143">So we were just -- just -- just shocked. </sentence><sentence id="2144">It took us -- took a long time for -- to recover from this shock, and the only thing that sort of brought a ray of hope that sustained us was the possibility that they were taken to Krakow, Poland, because that was the rumors that circulated when they deported the Jews of Salonika, that they were being relocated to -- to Krakow to establish their own Jewish community, to be self-governed with their own mayor, to establish synagogues wherever they wanted. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="2145">So we thought that th -- these Jews as well, from Ioannina, Arta and Preveza, that that was their destination. </sentence><sentence id="2146">And you know, my parents said, we have to do something, but -- but what can we do in -- we're in this remote village, what can we do? </sentence><sentence id="2147">But my father knew that there was a contingent of the British mission in Greece in a nearby village, because the British, throughout the war, were there helping the war effort behind the scenes. </sentence><sentence id="2148">Helping the resistance. </sentence><sentence id="2149">The British were there helping the resistance, even though later on, after the war, the British were instrumental in preventing communism from becoming established in Greece. </sentence><sentence id="2150">But we -- my father knew of this British mission, and he said we -- we -- we have to contact them. </sentence><sentence id="2151">We should write letters and we should send a letter to the -- he said, the nations of the world have to know what's happening, they have to do something to stop it. </sentence><sentence id="2152">We didn't really know what was -- you know, anything about </sentence></p><p><sentence id="2153"> Interview with Ninetta Feldman " September 14, 2010 the Final Solution or what diabolic plans of the Nazis were at this point. </sentence><sentence id="2154">So -- so my father decided to write a letter addressed to the British government. </sentence><sentence id="2155">And the letter, that was going to be delivered to my aunt and uncle, who resided in Alexandria in Egypt, and they in turn would give the letter to the Greek government in exile, which was in Egypt. </sentence><sentence id="2156">It all sounds so naive now, but at the time it was a way of doing something. </sentence><sentence id="2157">And so sure enough, my father composed these letters and -- and my mother and brother again, were to deliver these letters to the village of Priantza. </sentence><sentence id="2158">They didn't know where Priantza was, they had to -- to ask many people to find their way to Priantza. </sentence><sentence id="2159">So they finally arrive in Priantza and the -- the British officials are willing to meet with them. </sentence><sentence id="2160">And my mother, when she came back, she described that they -- they walked into a large room, and they sat on two chairs, my brother and -- and her, and facing these British officers, and they told them what had happened, and they -- they begged them to deliver these letters. </sentence><sentence id="2161">And the British officers, they accepted the letters, but they didn't sound very reassuring. </sentence><sentence id="2162">In fact, one of them said to my mother, you know -- and I don't know if it was his wife and children or -- or some other relative, they -- you know, my wife and children died in the bombing in London, and -- and that -- I have to bear that loss. </sentence><sentence id="2163">So my mother was in tears because she felt they were not giving her any encouraging words. </sentence><sentence id="2164">And so they left with my brother and felt that this was a fruitless mission. </sentence><sentence id="2165">I don't know whether these letters were ever de-delivered to -- to anybody. </sentence><sentence id="2166">But one -- one good thing that they discovered while in Priantza, there were a lot of parachute drops that they were -- th-they </sentence></p><p><sentence id="2167"> Interview with Ninetta Feldman &gt;&gt; September 14, 2010 were delivering supplies to the British officers in the British mission, and -- and so the villagers in Priantza had a lot of this material. </sentence><sentence id="2168">So much of it they didn't know what to do with it. </sentence><sentence id="2169">And so when my mother discovered that this material was plentiful, she went from house to house asking for some of this parachute material, it's like a dark, khaki kind of greenish fabric, and rope from the parachutes. </sentence><sentence id="2170">And so when they returned home after their mission, my brother came into the hou -- room with this big bundle of parachute material. </sentence><sentence id="2171">And that was like gold for us, because my mother finally had fabric to sew dresses, blouses, and so on. </sentence><sentence id="2172">But I -- from what I recall, we did not dwell on this. </sentence><sentence id="2173">Th- There weren't many discussions about this between my parents, about the deportation of the Jews. </sentence><sentence id="2174">And -- and th-the hope that we maintained throughout the war was that they were relocated to Poland, and when the war is over, they will return. </sentence><sentence id="2175">We were -- my parents were primarily concerned with my grandparents, because they were in their late years, and they were very concerned about them, if they would be -- they" be able to survive. </sentence><sentence id="2176">So then -- so my mother started working again, sewing the dresses and blouses and resuming her bartering activities with my brother, from village to village. </sentence><sentence id="2177">And that really was very, very helpful, because now it's summertime, the villagers have more food to exchange for -- for dresses, and so the

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2284">Q: Cause you really didn't like being without her. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2286">A: I didn't like to be -- she was a pillar of strength for me, and I --I felt lonely -- oh, my father tried to entertain me and keep me busy, but I -- I -- and -- and of course, for me it was a mystery, all these villages, you know. </sentence><sentence id="2287">Cause they would come back with many stories to tell about oh, how a sheep was

the villagers had this belief that the spa can cure anything, anything you had, whether it was a skin problem or orthopedic problem, whatever you had. </sentence><sentence id="2292">The place to go was in Kremasta. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="2293"> Interview with Ninetta Feldman "8 September 14, 2010 And so my mother one day, it was August, it was summer, she told me, you're coming with me

far. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="2295">And we went to Kremasta, and this place was just teeming with people. </sentence><sentence id="2296">There were a lot of partisans, ardat -- andartes, recuperating andartes. </sentence><sentence id="2297">Many of them were injured, and they were recuperating there. </sentence><sentence id="2298">There were villagers that had orthopedic problems, and they would -- would -- would come to Kremasta for the baths. </sentence><sentence id="2299">The baths were supposed to cure everything. </sentence><sentence id="2300">And my mother st -- I remember her saying how people would come curled up in a basket on a mule, take the baths and then they would walk straight, you know, without the assistance of a cane or anything. </sentence><sentence id="2301">I mean, there were miraculous cures. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="2302">So we -- we shared a room with another woman and her child, and we started going into these baths, they were constructed of cement, and they would get filled up with this water that was -- smelled of sulfur, like rotten eggs. </sentence><sentence id="2303">And my mother kept saying, well this is very good,

it was a sort of a nice, little vacation. </sentence><sentence id="2306">But unfortunately came to an abrupt end when the captain of the unit of the partisans that were stationed in Kremasta announced that th-the -- first of all, the partisans had to go back to their units, wherever they belonged, and the villa -- villagers had to go back home because the Germans were advancing towards that area. </sentence><sentence id="2307">So, people panicked, they immediately stopped their baths and they started just a huge group of </sentence></p><p><sentence id="2308"> Interview with Ninetta Feldman *deg September 14, 2010 people, some on canes or sticks -- not canes, but sticks, or -- or mules and horses, going back to their homes. </sentence><sentence id="2309">And so when we reached the village with my mother and brother, the village was in a state of excitement, because this time all of the villagers were going to leave the village. </sentence><sentence id="2310">They -- with their animals, because the -- at this point the Germans had become very aggressive towards the villagers, who at the beginning they were trying to appease, but now the villagers were supporting the resistance by providing them with shelter and food and so these -- th-the Germans were carrying out retaliations against the villagers by executing them, or burning the villages. </sentence><sentence id="2311">So that was known, and so everybody was leaving the village with their animals. </sentence><sentence id="2312">And my father was in the process of baking bread in the -- </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2313">Q: In the oven. </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2314">A: -- his famous homemade oven. </sentence><sentence id="2315">And there was no time for the bread to -- to -- to bake completely. </sentence><sentence id="2316">This reminds me of the exodus from Egypt, with Moses.

have to travel light, with one blanket and very few food supplies. </sentence><sentence id="2319">And so everybody is leaving the village, and this time we go to another -- a place much higher than the earlier place of Chiandafelis. </sentence><sentence id="2320">This place is called Kamaria. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="2321">And so the entire village, with their animals, they camp this plateau at the top of the mountain, which offered a very good vantage point view of the villages below, not only Psilovrahos but the other surrounding villages. </sentence><sentence id="2322">And so there we are, it's August, the sun </sentence></p><p><sentence id="2323"> Interview with Ninetta Feldman a September 14, 2010 is burning, there's no -- they -- we -- we had brought the canteen, a

enough water. </sentence><sentence id="2325">The villagers, because they knew the terrain very well, and they were used to this rough terrain, they were able to discover other sources of water, but -- but not us. </sentence><sentence id="2326">So my father actually had to -- to go from villager to villager begging for a little bit of water to fill the canteen. </sentence><sentence id="2327">And I remember we were allowed only three gulps of water, you know, no more, because it had to last. </sentence><sentence id="2328">The other problem was that we didn't have -- we brought only one blanket and it was very cold at night up at the top of the mountain, so my father borrowed a blanket from one of the villagers. </sentence><sentence id="2329">And we decided -- my parents decided that it would be best if we didn't stay with the rest of the villagers, but went to a secluded place, so in case the Germans came to Kamaria, they wouldn't find us. </sentence><sentence id="2330">So again we were separated, we were separated from the rest of the villagers, and we found a secluded place and my mother or father or Mykas(ph) caught a goat, a stray goat, and we milked it. </sentence><sentence id="2331">So we had a little bit of milk. </sentence><sentence id="2332">And so we -- we stayed in this place. </sentence><sentence id="2333">Now, my mother was in -- she was sick, she had fever, she was in very, very bad shape, because she had gone to -- to Kremasta to recuperate from her ordeals, and now, all of a sudden, she has to go up to the mountains again. </sentence><sentence id="2334">And I -- I remember this -- my brother doesn't remember this, but my -- but I do -- my mother saying, if the Germans come here, Mykas(ph) will take Ninetta, climb a rock and then a tree.

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2622">A: Yes, then my --I--I believe they sent my brother first, with -- with Baba(ph) Yoros(ph) with a horse loa -- load of food, because by then we had -- having sold all these little dresses made out of the parachute, my mother had collected a lot of wheat. </sentence><sentence id="2623">Because she would sell dresses to people who didn't have wheat, but with a promise that when   Interview with Ninetta Feldman deg8 September 14, 2010 they harvest, they would -- she would be paid at harvest time. </sentence><sentence id="2624">So now we have quite a bit of wheat to transport into the city. </sentence><sentence id="2625">So -- so my brother and -- and this Baba(ph) Yoros(ph) and the mule, or horse, I don't know what it was, they come down into the city. [ </sentence><sentence id="2626">--I-- I'm -- I'm glad that I-- you asked me this question, because I didn't say anything about Baba(ph) Yoros(ph). </sentence><sentence id="2627">There was a time, after the first time that -- which was in November -- when we had to leave Psilovrahos and go to Chiandafelis" house. </sentence><sentence id="2628">There was another time when we had to leave the village. </sentence><sentence id="2629">I don't remember which month it was, but this time my father and Mykas(ph) decided to leave the village, but my mother decided to stay, to guard whatever food we had. </sentence><sentence id="2630">So my mother and I stayed in the house, and we were joined by the wife of Mr. Lavee(ph), her name was [indecipherable], and she spoke German, and at one point she actually spoke with the Germans, and she claims that she protected the upper village of Psilovrahos from the Germans. </sentence><sentence id="2631">I don't know, this is a story that I'm not very clear on. </sentence><sentence id="2632">But -- so my mother and I slept in the room, and then early next morning we hear a knock on the door. </sentence><sentence id="2633">And we woke up, and there was Baba(ph) Yoros(ph), who was a neighbor, he was a retired policeman, and his son was a partisan. </sentence><sentence id="2634">And Baba(ph) Yoros(ph) said to my mother, what are you doing here with your child? </sentence><sentence id="2635">If the Germans were to come to the village and -- and take you and your child, I will never, ever forgive myself. </sentence><sentence id="2636">And so when my mother heard that, she ha -- didn't have to hear anything more, she packed quickly and -- and -- and she packed more than -- than she could carry, and she -- in her memoir she says how she -- she didn't want to leave the    Interview with Ninetta Feldman " September 14, 2010 -- the things that she packed, which was food and -- and a blanket, but at the same time she realized that she couldn't carry it. </sentence><sentence id="2637">And at that point, Mrs. Tsulamitsu(ph), this -- the -- the mother of this -- of the seven daughters who my mother was tutoring and knitting and crocheting and making lace, she appeared with her mule, and -- and she saw my mother in -- in this -- in distress, and she said, oh don't worry, I will carry all of your belongings. </sentence><sentence id="2638">And so, with her, we reached the upper village, and -- and so this is how we stand this time when the -- the Germans -- that was their second foray into our region, but this time they never reached the village, and -- and so -- and so we all returned. </sentence><sentence id="2639">So this is Baba(ph) Yoros(ph) who played a significant part in -- in our story. </sentence><sentence id="2640">As I said, th-the people really -- they tried to -- to help in any way they -- they could, including th-the priest. </sentence><sentence id="2641">You know, we -- we used to go to the church, first of all to -- not to show that we were any different than the other villagers, and also to eat some food there, because whenever there was a -- a memorial service, they would serve koliva, which is a mixture of boiled wheat and pomegranates, cinnamon and sugar. </sentence><sentence id="2642">It's a very nutritious, delicious thing, but we'd go there and -- and the relatives of the deceased would give everybody a handful of this and so there was another source of food for us. </sentence><sentence id="2643">And the priest, I don't remember his name. </sentence><sentence id="2644">Papa Demetrius(ph), perhaps. </sentence><sentence id="2645">I don't remember his name. </sentence><sentence id="2646">He used to come to our house quite often, because he befriended my parents. </sentence><sentence id="2647">And my mother would always serve him coffee, which was a rare find, a ra--a re -- a real treat for him. </sentence><sentence id="2648">And he would chat with my father. </sentence><sentence id="2649">I don't know what they talked about, but we went to -- attended even Easter   100 Interview with Ninetta Feldman September 14, 2010 services -- Friday, Good Friday services. </sentence><sentence id="2650">And this is the time when -- I learned later on, you know, after the war, I -- I used to go to the church with my friends a lot. </sentence><sentence id="2651">And so as I said earlier, I knew a lot more about the Christian religion than -- than the Jewish religion. </sentence><sentence id="2652">But on Fridays, when Jesus has been crucified and -- and he's dead, and the priest is supposed to exhort his flock to -- to move them, that this wonderful human being sacrificed his -- his life t-to save you. </sentence><sentence id="2653">He's -- and so he would -- he -- he -- he would ha -- he had to give a sermon to make people cry, especially the old women cry, and so he had to go on and on with the crucifixion and the pain that he suffered on the cross. </sentence><sentence id="2654">And so Sunday they celebrated Easter, the resurrection, he came to our house and apologized to my parents for having to give this kind of sermon in front of us. </sentence><sentence id="2655">So i-it was, of course, appreciated by my parents. </sentence><sentence id="2656">He was a kind man, and he said, what can I do?
