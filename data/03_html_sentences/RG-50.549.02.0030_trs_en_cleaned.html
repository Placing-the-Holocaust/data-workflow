<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="62">Q: And I had a question -- two questions, actually, the first one being, do you know -- do you understand now and did you understand then, why your mother left you alone? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="64">A: It's such a interesting question. </sentence><sentence id="65">Did I understand? </sentence><sentence id="66">I -- Obviously, I must have understood something when she said, ""You have to stay here. </sentence><sentence id="67">I must leave with your sister. </sentence><sentence id="68">But," she said, "in the spring, someone will come to get you and bring you to me, wherever I'm going to be." </sentence><sentence id="69">A-And as much as I didn't like the thought that my mother was leaving, a-and I was, you know, I was crying and my excuse was, "Mama," I says, "but I have a headache." </sentence><sentence id="70">Cause I felt, maybe if I tell her I have a headache, she will stay. </sentence><sentence id="71">And she said to me, she said, "The lady will give you an aspirin, and you" ll feel better. </sentence><sentence id="72">And here." </sentence><sentence id="73">She gave me a hundred rubles, she says, "In case you want to buy yourself something and you need money." </sentence><sentence id="74">So she gave me the hundred rubles and she kissed me goodbye, she walked out. </sentence><sentence id="75">Now -- She walked out, I -- I guess there was something that I must have understood when she said, "I must go, and I can't take you along," she says, "because it is too cold outside." </sentence><sentence id="76">And -- And i-in Europe, the winters are extremely cold. </sentence><sentence id="77">You can really freeze. </sentence><sentence id="78">And -- And I had very little clothing, because that clothing wasn't even mine, it was the clothing that belonged to somebody else from the first pogrom yet. </sentence><sentence id="79">So, I guess, in the way, I understood that it's cold outside and I might get sick or freeze and my mother said she must leave and I knew one thing, that, as a Jew, we had to USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0030 5 escape. </sentence><sentence id="80">So, that was my understanding, and I didn't make a scene. </sentence><sentence id="81">I just said, "My head hurts." </sentence><sentence id="82">That's all. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="103">Q: Now, the part two of the question that I wanted to ask that I would -- while I was watching the video, that I wondered -- now, to step way back into the -- well, way up into the future from that moment, did you ever discuss this with your mother, about leaving? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="105">A: Interesting. </sentence><sentence id="106">No. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="109">Q: Okay. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="111">A: Never discussed it and I never, ever felt any resentment. </sentence><sentence id="112">As the years went by, I guess somebody would say, "Oh, Ma, you left me." </sentence><sentence id="113">or "You abandoned me." </sentence><sentence id="114">I never felt that way. </sentence><sentence id="115">And I just never discussed it with her and I -- but I did asked her, when we were reunited and she held me on her lap -- see, now I remem -- I remember, and my first question was, "Mama, why did you leave me?" </sentence><sentence id="116">That I did, yeah. </sentence><sentence id="117">And she just explained to me again what she said, "I had to leave, it was too cold and I was afraid if I take you, you might freeze to death." </sentence><sentence id="118">Cause even the clothe -- my clothing consisted of knee-highs and a pair of short boots. </sentence><sentence id="119">A little skirt, a sweater and a little jacket with a scarf, that's it. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="129">Q: And your sister was much older than you? </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="163">Q: A Jewish mother and -- </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="164">A: Yeah, a Jewish mother and a Jew -- and her daughter. </sentence><sentence id="165">So, they slept on one -- it wasn't really a bed, it was one of those four legs and -- a-a-and -- and some hay on it, I mean, that was the bed. </sentence><sentence id="166">And we had another bed, which was a little bit bigger, because my mother, myself, my sister and then later on, a cousin of ours joined us, too. </sentence><sentence id="167">So we all slept on the same bed and instead of sleeping horizontally, we slept diagonally. </sentence><sentence id="168">And if there wasn't enough room, so one of us will sleep on the floor. </sentence><sentence id="169">A-And that was o-our quarters. </sentence><sentence id="170">Now, what we did is -- is -- we had no money to pay for our -- our rent. </sentence><sentence id="171">So, we worked for this gentleman. </sentence><sentence id="172">Of course, we were very grateful, the fact that he even gave </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="182">  USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0030 7 us a place where to sleep -- where to sleep. </sentence><sentence id="183">So, we worked on his -- on his fields and I was one of his workers, and my job was to -- with my fingers, I would have to dig out the potatoes from -- you know, from under the earth. </sentence><sentence id="184">And I cleaned them up, put them in a sack and tied the sack and then, you know, just so -- drag it to his warehouse, which I don't know how many blocks it was exactly, I never counted it. </sentence><sentence id="185">To me, it was just part of my life. </sentence><sentence id="186">And for that, he would give me a loaf of black bread. </sentence><sentence id="187">So, we didn't have to pay for the rent and he gave me a loaf of bread and that was a tremendous salary. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="201">Q: How often did you get bread? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="203">A: Well, every day. </sentence><sentence id="204">I wor -- I worked every day. </sentence><sentence id="205">And so did, of course, my sister and my mother and my cousin. </sentence><sentence id="206">We all worked for him. </sentence><sentence id="207">Well, they -- they worked in different parts of the field and I worked, you know, digging up the potatoes with my hands, my bare hands, yeah. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="216">Q: Do you remember what -- what -- what they did? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="218">A: What -- I'm sorry? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="220">Q: What your mother and sister did? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="222">A: Oh, they were also working on the fields. </sentence><sentence id="223">Well, they must have -- they -- may -- may - </sentence></p><p><sentence id="224"> - maybe they did different, you know, diggings, different, whatchamacallit, vegetables, </sentence></p><p><sentence id="225"> you know, also it was -- everything was digging up, you know, because like he did the </sentence></p><p><sentence id="226"> seeding and then, you know, y -- and you would have to -- in the springtime, that's what </sentence></p><p><sentence id="227"> you did. </sentence><sentence id="228">In springtime, everything was growing and you had to rip it off of, or rip it out </sentence></p><p><sentence id="229"> of the ground and bring it into his warehouse. </sentence><sentence id="230">So we were all just working on the fields. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="231">   USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0030 8 </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="232">Q: But you were not in hiding at this time? </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="233">A: No. </sentence><sentence id="234">At that time, it was not a question of hiding, because there was no ghetto, this was not a ghetto. </sentence><sentence id="235">You wo -- just would have to be very careful if sometimes a German would pass by in the street, you understand? </sentence><sentence id="236">Or -- Or someone, some other Gentile would know that you were Jewish, he might just go to the German and tell them, you know, in this house, they have Jews. </sentence><sentence id="237">So, actually, we were hiding out and nobody was supposed to know that we are Jews, except for the person with whom we lived, he knew that we were Jewish. </sentence><sentence id="238">So, that's how it worked. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="245">Q: Was he -- What would have been his motivation, was -- was it political, was it -- was it a spiritual motivation? </sentence><sentence id="246">Was it circumstantial? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="249">A: To say -- Do you mean to hol -- to hide out Jews? </sentence><sentence id="250">Well, there were some good people and he must have been one of those people wh-wh -- who felt sorry for a mother and her children and he also felt, you know, that we'll be devoted and loyal. </sentence><sentence id="251">We'Il -- We'1l work for him, we'll help him out, because after all, he was all alone. </sentence><sentence id="252">And at the same time, he was, you know, saving lives. </sentence><sentence id="253">And that's -- That was really something very, very amazing and very important to us. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="259">Q: That sort of reminds me a -- a little bit of what I'm reading about the -- the slaves in America and how there were certain homes, when they were on their way from the south to the north -- </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="260">A: Took them in. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="262"> USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0030 9 </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="263">Q: -- where they stayed, I wondered, just jumping way into the future, did you have a -- make a connection with the Civil Rights movement at all, or the story of slavery in America? </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="264">A: You mean, at the present time, connecting their past and my past? </sentence><sentence id="265">Well, you know, in those years, in my -- my times -- you're talking 55 years ago, there was no such thing as Civil Rights, there wa-was only such a thing as good people versing not such good people. </sentence><sentence id="266">And he was one of those top people, who -- all he knew was perhaps for -- because of his belief, that God said, you know, you should help others and that's what he was doing. </sentence><sentence id="267">And the mere fact that he took us in, he must have been very special and -- and -- and obviously a believer too, in saving lives. </sentence><sentence id="268">So, you know, things were different then, as they are today, or -- </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="269">Q: Do you have any idea how your mother found him? </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="270">A: No, but I am sure my mother was something very special. </sentence><sentence id="271">She was someone who was always ahead of everyone. </sentence><sentence id="272">And I imagine she just found out abis -- about this gentleman that, you know, lived alone and she must have approached him and -- and offered, you know, our services and he accepted them. </sentence><sentence id="273">So we are very lucky. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="278">Q: Now, from there I would love to -- whoa. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="280">A: That's the airport. </sentence><sentence id="281">We're not that far from the airport. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="284">Q: Oh. </sentence><sentence id="285">From LaGuardia? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="288">A: You see -- no, JFK. </sentence><sentence id="289">You hear that noise? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="292">Q: Yes. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="294"> USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0030 10 </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="295">A: Every time -- This is not too bad, but every time, could be in the morning, could be during the day, could be in the evening, suddenly there will be a tr-tremendous noise coming from the airport and I think it's from the airport, from that direction, and that will bring horrible memories to me and I sometimes just shake and I can't do anything until this noise stops. </sentence><sentence id="296">That reminds me, after the liberation, when we came back to Proscurov, to our home, every night for a whole year, until "45, the German planes, 30 or 40 of them would come over every night and bombard the city. </sentence><sentence id="297">And so, we would hear that noise, f+ from those planes approaching us and then, of course, either we -- if we had enough time, we would run to shelters and if we didn't, we would just lie on the floors and -- and our ho -- our glass, you know the windows would be open and we would have tapes on them, that th-the -- the glass should not shatter and we would lie under our beds until they finished bombarding and they left. </sentence><sentence id="298">This is how I lived. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="303">Q: Wa -- That's interesting that that plane would give us a cue, cause what -- one thing I - - [know we want to know about, is at the exact time of liberation, because you briefly mentioned it in the video interview and later you say that you never really felt liberated. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="305">A: Mm-hm. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="307">Q: And I wondered, for a moment, if we might focus on your experience of the -- the exact moment of liberation are -- are -- and then the few days after that, from a child's -- how old were you? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="309">A: I was, at that time, eight. </sentence><sentence id="310">Eight years old, that was in 1944. </sentence><sentence id="311">And, actually the Russians liberated us, okay, the Russian army. </sentence><sentence id="312">And there was -- it was really horrible, because for USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0030 11 a day and night, there was door to door fighting between the Russian soldiers and -- and the Germans. </sentence><sentence id="313">And, course the following day, when -- when we realized that we were free, that -- I ran into the house -- to that -- to our room, where that lady with her daughter were and these poor people, you know, their fingers were all frostbitten and well, while they were there, I used to go in the fields and look for a special leaf. </sentence><sentence id="314">There was a special leaf which, when you would put to the infected area, that at least alleviated their pain. </sentence><sentence id="315">Cause, you see, we could not get to a doctor and we were not allowed to go to a hospital and nobody was supposed to know that we were Jews. </sentence><sentence id="316">So, we couldn't call for help to help that mother and daughter who were constantly in excruciating pain because those -- that area where the fingers fell off, was just closing and half -- it wasn't completely closed. </sentence><sentence id="317">So -- So I was told that if I can find those type of leaves in the fields, then they would put it in -- o-on the affect -- in -- affect -- infected area and -- and that would alleviate their pain. </sentence><sentence id="318">So, I used to do that. </sentence><sentence id="319">But then, when we were told that we are liberated, we are free, we don't have to be afraid, well, I ran in -- you know, I was in the street and I ran in to give them the good news. </sentence><sentence id="320">And I was so happy, I was jumping and this poor lady, now I understand, you know, how she felt. </sentence><sentence id="321">Then, I couldn't understand. </sentence><sentence id="322">She took a broom and she started hitting me. </sentence><sentence id="323">And she said to me, "What is there to rejoice?" </sentence><sentence id="324">Because she and her daughter, they were really cripples. </sentence><sentence id="325">And -- And I was jumping for joy, so she beat me up with a broom. </sentence><sentence id="326">And she said, "Well, there's nothing to rejoice about." </sentence><sentence id="327">I says, "But we don't have -- the Germans are gone, the Germans are gone." </sentence><sentence id="328">She said, "Oh. </sentence><sentence id="329">So?" </sentence><sentence id="330">And that was that, you know, and I just walked out of the  USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0030 12 house, because I was afraid she will beat me up some more, so that was that. </sentence><sentence id="331">Then, we also ran to see the first Russian airplane that landed in that -- in our little town. </sentence><sentence id="332">And it was on the hill and it was very big and I was so happy to see this big plane, because when I was little and I would go with my father for walks and I would see an airplane in the sky and I would say, "Papa, how does this plane fly?" </sentence><sentence id="333">And he would say, "There is a man in it." </sentence><sentence id="334">And I would say, "But it's so small, how can a person sit in it?" </sentence><sentence id="335">And he would say to me, "It seems to you that it -- he's -- this plane is very small. </sentence><sentence id="336">That's because this plane is so far, far away. </sentence><sentence id="337">But it's really very, very big." </sentence><sentence id="338">Well, this was my opportunity to see this big plane on the hill -- course with the -- with the Russian soldiers and -- a-and oh, ar -- that was a sunny day and oh, I was so happy. </sentence><sentence id="339">And then, we heard that this was the day that the Germans were planning to kill that handful of Jews that were hiding out with the Gentile people. </sentence><sentence id="340">They had already dug up a ditch for us. </sentence><sentence id="341">But the Russians came in and never gave them a chance to kill us. </sentence><sentence id="342">So, i-i-it was a tremendous celebration. </sentence><sentence id="343">I remember we were just dancing in the street and was just something so very special. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="381">Q: Did -- The first few days after being liberated, did your life change at all? </sentence><sentence id="382">Did you continue to be in the -- living in the same place? </sentence></p></dialogue>
