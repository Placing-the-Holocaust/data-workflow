straw. </sentence><sentence id="103">We had no blankets or anything. </sentence><sentence id="104">We were allowed, after a few days, we were allowed to contact our parents and our families and they could deliver to us food, because they didn't supply any food. </sentence><sentence id="105">I stayed there for three weeks and only because a friend of mine who knew -- who had a German friend who was associated with some German organization. </sentence><sentence id="106">Matter of fact, he studied journalism in Germany in Berlin and, after he finished his studies he became a member of the propaganda ministry propaganda ministry, and his parents lived in my hometown and he was visiting at the time. </sentence><sentence id="107">And my parents asked him if he could get in touch with this friend of his, whether he can get me released. </sentence><sentence id="108">So they did one night. </sentence><sentence id="109">I think at midnight they called me into a small room where there was three Germans. </sentence><sentence id="110">There was one in charge of this camp, hostage camp. </sentence><sentence id="111">He was a local veterinarian doctor, German. </sentence><sentence id="112">Then some other person which | didn't know and this friend of his, of my friend whom I knew only from sight. </sentence><sentence id="113">And they interrogated me and, you know, what I was doing and what I intend to do. </sentence><sentence id="114">And I said, well, I don't know, the war -- they said, we're going to release you but under the condition that you have to leave these territories. </sentence><sentence id="115">These territories which we lived, you know, were the western and north territories. </sentence><sentence id="116">We are right away incorporated right in into the German Reich. </sentence><sentence id="117">They considered these lands as purely German. </sentence><sentence id="118">So they said you cannot live here. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="119">You have to go to the part of Poland which was not incorporated into Germany but which was formed as what they call it, General Government, and government general of this territory was Hans Frank(ph) who was later on, you know, at the Nuremberg Trials was convicted, you know, to death and was hung. </sentence><sentence id="120">And the territory encompassed both Warsaw and Kokov(ph) and Lublin. </sentence><sentence id="121">It was the center of Poland and they said, you cannot stay here. </sentence><sentence id="122">And then this veterinarian -- I remember his name. </sentence><sentence id="123">It was Grahams(ph) and he said, how long do you need to liquidate your things here? </sentence><sentence id="124">I said, well, three weeks. </sentence><sentence id="125">He said, you're crazy. </sentence><sentence id="126">You don't need three weeks. </sentence><sentence id="127">We want you out of here in a week. </sentence><sentence id="128">So I said, of course, I agreed. </sentence><sentence id="129">I would even go in one day. </sentence><sentence id="130">And so they told me -- they released me. </sentence><sentence id="131">I walked out of the room and this friend of my friend, his name was Lukow, I forgot his first name, he was a doctor of journalism. </sentence><sentence id="132">Anyway, he walked out with me and he started speaking, and because he spoke Polish and he started speaking to me in Polish. </sentence><sentence id="133">He said, look, it's only, you know, you don't have to leave. </sentence><sentence id="134">You can stay here. </sentence><sentence id="135">This Dr. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="136">Grahams(ph) said you have to but I can tell you you don't have to leave. </sentence><sentence id="137">You can stay here. </sentence><sentence id="138">And so I thanked him very much and I when back to the cell, and the next morning I was supposed to be released and the next morning came and nothing. </sentence><sentence id="139">They called some other names of other people released but not my name. </sentence><sentence id="140">So I went to the door and told the guard and said that my name was, shows supposed to be called. </sentence><sentence id="141">And he went back to the office and after a while they did call my name and I was released. </sentence><sentence id="142">But while I was there in prison one day they called ten names of ten hostages, and they took -- they were taken away and then they were publicly shot in the town square. </sentence><sentence id="143">Today there's a monument remembering this, you know, they were innocent people that didn't do anything wrong. </sentence><sentence id="144">I knew some of them. </sentence><sentence id="145">For no reason whatsoever they were shot publicly. </sentence><sentence id="146">And after I was released, I think I didn't even wait a week, and again was my cousin because his property was taken away, you know, the fellow who had the lumber yard. </sentence><sentence id="147">It was confiscated and a German owner was put in his place, and he didn't feel secure and we both left and we </sentence></p><p><sentence

course, I didn't have much means, you know, of supporting myself. </sentence><sentence id="153">My cousin being in the business, you know, had some savings and we lived together in Warsaw for time being. </sentence><sentence id="154">In the meantime, he was trying to recover his property which he eventually didn't recover but they permitted him to go back, and he could run it because, you know, he knew how to run the business, and apparently the owner or the, what they called troyhander (ph) it means a man of who was, can't find the proper name of it, but anyway, somebody who was taking his, you know, and running the business apparently didn't do a good job, and he was eventually able to get the job back, not as an owner but as a manager, and he went back and I stayed in Warsaw. </sentence><sentence id="155">In the meantime, I did join, you know, the underground movement. </sentence><sentence id="156">It started -- the first organization was called Zydowska Organizacja Bojow </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="157">A: ZWZ was the abbreviation, which later became the Home Army. </sentence><sentence id="158">The Army of Kroiova(ph), which was the army which was supported by the legitimate government, which was at that time was already in London, and I was arrested on the 31 of October 1940. </sentence><sentence id="159">At that time -- </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="163">Q: Before you go to that -- how did you find out about the underground movement? </sentence><sentence id="164">Tell me a little bit more about that. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="167">A: Well, I had a friend -- a friend who his name was Tobulsky(ph). </sentence><sentence id="168">That's also was one reason why I was arrested, and he was also from my hometown in Grujand and, he was involved in an organization which was formed by one also a student in my hometown which he joined. </sentence><sentence id="169">I didn't join because I wasn't there already, and they joined this organization and he wasn't caught, but the principal of the organization was caught, and he was tried and then convicted, you know, and sentenced to death. </sentence><sentence id="170">And he was executed in Poz -- which was another quite a big city which was incorporated in Germany. </sentence><sentence id="171">And the executioned at that time was my -- he was -- they chopped you know his head off with an axe. </sentence><sentence id="172">He was axed, and this friend of mine, since he escaped and he came to the General Government to Warsaw, was tried in that and he was also sentenced to death. </sentence><sentence id="173">And he already had connections with the underground and he contacted me and we got together, and he had -- he knew a captain of the Polish Armed Forces, prewar, who was member of the organization, and he swore me in as a member. </sentence><sentence id="174">And I myself, don't think that I was arrested for that because I don't think they knew about it. </sentence><sentence id="175">But they knew that I knew this friend of mine and since he had a sentence, a death sentence hanging over his head. </sentence><sentence id="176">Apparently, they were following him because when they arrested me they came to my -- they arrested me at three o'clock in the morning on October 31, 1940. </sentence><sentence id="177">I was asleep. </sentence><sentence id="178">Thad a small bachelor's apartment, one room and kitchen and bathroom, and in the night, you know, I heard tremendous knocking at the door, kicking at door, and I looked through the window and I saw three people. </sentence><sentence id="179">And one was in a Gestapo uniform and the other two were in civilian clothes and they were shouting to open the door immediately. </sentence><sentence id="180">So I opened the door and they pushed me aside. </sentence><sentence id="181">They came with drawn revolvers and they push me aside, and one went to the kitchen and one went to the bathroom and the other to the room, and they were looking around. </sentence><sentence id="182">They were looking for they said leaflets This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="183">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="184"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection you know and for arms. </sentence><sentence id="185">Well, they didn't find it either because I didn't keep anything at home. </sentence><sentence id="186">Anyway, then they started asking me questions and one question was that your friend was here with you yesterday. </sentence><sentence id="187">And they -- apparently he changed his name and he failed to tell me about it. </sentence><sentence id="188">I knew him only by his new name, and so when they asked me was Tobulksy (ph) you know that was his assumed name, I said no, so they hit me. </sentence><sentence id="189">You know, you can see it here on the movies you know with the hand across there. </sentence><sentence id="190">Hit me right in my temple and I fell to the floor, and as I fell to the floor, they started, the three of them started kicking me and I said -- I remember the only person who visited me was this young Tobulsky and I told them his real name. </sentence><sentence id="191">Apparently, they knew this and they stopped beating me, I got up, and after a while they had a small conference between the three of them and then they came back and said, you better get dressed and you will go with us. </sentence><sentence id="192">So I got dressed and then they took me out, and the two of them held me by the cuffs of my jacket and they walked on both sides. </sentence><sentence id="193">And this one in the uniform drew his revolver and walked behind me, and he told me, don't try anything because I'm going to shoot you. </sentence><sentence id="194">So they took me down through the street and there was a car waiting, Mercedes -- they only drove Mercedes -- and they opened the door, and as they opened the door I saw another friend of mine sitting there, and he said, oh, you know each other. </sentence><sentence id="195">And I said, yes, I do, and they told me to get in. </sentence><sentence id="196">And one of the SS sat between the two of us and their chauffeur. </sentence><sentence id="197">They drove me to the prison, prison Pawiak in Warsaw, and then approximately, already ten people from other prisoners, and they were registered and then taken -- I was taken to a single cell in the basement and there was no -- it was only a small bulb. </sentence><sentence id="198">There was no furniture. </sentence><sentence id="199">There was no window there. </sentence><sentence id="200">It was a dirt floor, and the walls were dripping with water, and there was only a pail which you used as a toilet. </sentence><sentence id="201">And when I came there I didn't really know what happened. </sentence><sentence id="202">After a while a guard came and took me out and into the yard and to the showers. </sentence><sentence id="203">I had to undress and my clothes were disinfected and I had to shower. </sentence><sentence id="204">And then after the clothes came back, my suit and so on, was all trampled they took me -- the guard took me to the first -- no, second floor of the prison and took me to a cell. </sentence><sentence id="205">I don't remember the number of the cell. </sentence><sentence id="206">Anyway, the cells were small. </sentence><sentence id="207">They were maybe seven feet wide and ten feet long, and there were already nine prisoners. </sentence><sentence id="208">Which means, there were ten of us. </sentence><sentence id="209">There was no bunk or anything. </sentence><sentence id="210">We had to lie on the floor. </sentence><sentence id="211">Again, there was no furniture whatsoever except the pail where we could relieve ourselves. </sentence><sentence id="212">We were only taken in the morning to the toilets where we could wash a little, and I think in the afternoon once and in the evening, and the rest we had to spend in the cells. </sentence><sentence id="213">At that time there were Polish guards, you know, prewar Polish guards as were as Germans, SS people, and some of the Polish guards were very friendly and pleasant and helpful. </sentence><sentence id="214">Some were not so helpful. </sentence><sentence id="215">Anyway, one of the guards in my -- I don't know how he found out -- but he found out that I do speak German, and one day he asked me -- apparently he was living in a house which was Jewish-owned house, and it was requisitioned by the government and the Germans and apparently, whoever took over from the Germans wanted to increase his rent and he asked me, he said, on the salary which they pay me, I won't be able to pay the rent for it. </sentence><sentence id="216">And he asked me if I could write a -- how do you say -- an application to the authorities, you know, whereby they wouldn't increase his rent. </sentence><sentence id="217">So I did. </sentence><sentence id="218">He took me to the office and I did write the letter, and after a few weeks he got a reply. </sentence><sentence id="219">And they didn't increase -- not This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="220">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="221"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection only didn't they increase. </sentence><sentence id="222">Matter of fact, they reduced his rent. </sentence><sentence id="223">So he was very appreciative and he said what can I do for you, and of course, I wanted to tell him, let me go free from the prison, but he said, what I can do for you, I can take you out of the cell. </sentence><sentence id="224">Since you do speak German you can be an interpreter, and he took me to another part of the prison to another ward which was served only by German guard. </sentence><sentence id="225">And there I became an interpreter to this German guard, and of course, my life was a little easier because I was with four other prisoners in one cell and we also had bunks. </sentence><sentence id="226">I didn't have to sleep on the floor. </sentence><sentence id="227">And two of the prisoners, who lived also in this cell, they worked in the prison kitchen and as such they were able to -- well, they had more food but they were not allowed -- they couldn't and they were afraid to bring any food, but what they did bring they brought always in the evening to the cell, whole pot of coffee. </sentence><sentence id="228">And the coffee was so sweet. </sentence><sentence id="229">They probably put pounds of sugar in it. </sentence><sentence id="230">So we drank this coffee, this sweet coffee, which was not real coffee because the Germans, they wouldn't give the prisoners. </sentence><sentence id="231">It was such a good coffee. </sentence><sentence id="232">Anyway, it looked like coffee and the sugar of course was very important. </sentence><sentence id="233">So I felt I could move free because they didn't close the cell, and whenever the guard needed me to translate. </sentence><sentence id="234">And so I did translate and in the meantime, I was taking for interrogation. </sentence><sentence id="235">You were interrogated in the headquarters of the Gestapo which was in the central part of Warsaw, and you were taken there by a truck. </sentence><sentence id="236">And the guards were in the truck as well, as motorcycle guards as well as going behind the truck and when you came to the Gestapo headquarters, which were now located in the prewar Polish Educational Ministry, and one of the wings was converted. </sentence><sentence id="237">The southern wing was converted into cells where the prisoners, before they went for interrogation, were taken. </sentence><sentence id="238">There were ten individual cells and four, I believe four, common cells and the common cells, we -- the prisoners called them trams because they were single seats on each side of the cell, and in the middle there was a walking path and you had to sit facing the wall and you were not allowed to look around or you couldn't talk to you, and the guard was behind you and if he heard you talk or move your head, he came and hit you over the head. </sentence><sentence id="239">And you sat there motionless. </sentence><sentence id="240">You didn't get any food or anything to drink, and they called when the interrogating officer called. </sentence><sentence id="241">A guard came and took you up to the room. </sentence><sentence id="242">I was taken to the room, and in the room there were this interrogating officer who was now in uniform. </sentence><sentence id="243">When he arrested me, he was one arresting, he was in civilian clothes. </sentence><sentence id="244">He was an officer of the Gestapo. </sentence><sentence id="245">And there was a typist, a girl and interpreter. </sentence><sentence id="246">Since he knew -- the interrogating officer knew that I spoke German -- he was very rude matter of fact, to the interpreter. </sentence><sentence id="247">He told him get lost, you know, he speaks German, so we don't need you here. </sentence><sentence id="248">And then he started interrogating, questioning. </sentence><sentence id="249">Actually, they didn't have anything, you know, which they could hang on me. </sentence><sentence id="250">They didn't find any leaflet. </sentence><sentence id="251">They didn't find anything and I didn't admit that I was a member of the resistance movement and they didn't know that. </sentence><sentence id="252">The only thing they were about was a friend of mine and again, as I told them when they first arrested me. </sentence><sentence id="253">And so it was typed and then the typed report was given to me for reading. </sentence><sentence id="254">I read it through and then I had to sign it. </sentence><sentence id="255">I did sign it. </sentence><sentence id="256">Frankly, it was not incriminating to me at all except that I knew this fellow, and then he called the guard and the guard took me again down to the cellar into this common cells and I had to sit until all the prisoners were interrogated. </sentence><sentence id="257">Sometimes, the interrogation went deep into the night and sometimes until the next morning of the other prisoners, and you had to sit This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="258">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="259"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection there until they took you back or they loaded you back into the truck and then they took you to the prison. </sentence><sentence id="260">So I was taken in the late afternoon back to the prison. </sentence><sentence id="261">In the meantime, you missed your food. </sentence><sentence id="262">You didn't get any food in the prison. </sentence><sentence id="263">The food was meager as it was but anyway, I still didn't get anything that day to eat. </sentence><sentence id="264">I can tell you one incident when I was awakened in the middle of the night by a Gestapo man. </sentence><sentence id="265">They came to our ward and they woke me up, and I had to interpret and they called 20 names out of different cells. </sentence><sentence id="266">And these were hostages and I think some of them knew what the fate which they faced. </sentence><sentence id="267">Most of them were very well educated. </sentence><sentence id="268">Some were professors of the Warsaw University. </sentence><sentence id="269">Some were engineers and only one, I remember, was a criminal prisoner, and all of them behaved with tremendous dignity. </sentence><sentence id="270">They didn't plead or beg or anything except this criminal prisoner. </sentence><sentence id="271">He fell to the floor and begged to the

2000 or even more. </sentence><sentence id="284">And they were preparing a transport and the transport was over a thousand prisoners. </sentence><sentence id="285">So after we -- the prisoners whose names were not called went back into the cells, then they issued us I think -- I don't remember exactly but I think half a loaf of bread -- and we knew that we were going into transport.

they didn't have the capacity to burn the bodies. </sentence><sentence id="914">The one crematorium which was in Auschwitz One was the smallest of all the crematoriums and it just couldn't burn the bodies, you know, fast enough. </sentence><sentence id="915">There was also a crematorium - next to the crematorium in Auschwitz was a small gas chamber where people were gassed. </sentence><sentence id="916">Of course, the biggest crematoriums were in Auschwitz Two and Birkenau. </sentence><sentence id="917">There were this crematorium in Auschwitz was designated as Number | and then there were Number 2, 3, 4 and 5 in Birkenau, and there the capacity was much greater, much greater, especially the gas chambers. </sentence><sentence id="918">They had the capacity of 2000 or even more prisoners or people could be gassed in one sitting. </sentence><sentence id="919">And there were four of them so it's approximately 10,000 people could be gassed in, well, matter of few hours. </sentence><sentence id="920">The gassing was not the problem. </sentence><sentence id="921">The problem was the disposing of the bodies because the capacity of the ovens were quite limited. </sentence><sentence id="922">That's why many of the bodies were burned in ditches or they were burned on stacks and disposed this way. </sentence><sentence id="923">Now, since we were about gassing, the first gassing actually took place in Auschqitz camp itself and it was the gassing of some 600 Russian prisoners of war. </sentence><sentence id="924">We - and some Polish prisoners. </sentence><sentence id="925">One day, it was of course after the invasion of Russia by Hitler, I think it was approximately on, in September, I think, September of 1941. </sentence><sentence id="926">We were all called back from our workplaces to the camp. </sentence><sentence id="927">Maybe I should also explain how the compound itself was only for the prisoners to go for the night to sleep, and the compound - as I said in Auschwitz One was 28 blocks and it was surrounded by two rows of barbedwire, electrified barbwire and by towers with guards with machine guns. </sentence><sentence id="928">On the east side, east and south side there was also maybe 15 high - maybe not 15 - maybe 10 feet high concrete wall because next to the east was a road, public road, which of course, they didn't want anybody to see the camp and from the south. </sentence><sentence id="929">And I lost my thought now - yes - so we were all brought back to the camp one afternoon, and we had to go on the blocks and they told us that we, nobody can go to the windows and look out the windows. </sentence><sentence id="930">Anybody who will be caught will be killed and the guards were all over the camp, and we didn't know what was going on. </sentence><sentence id="931">We found out later on the next days because the pallbearers told us, you know, there were prisoners who had to remove the bodies and apparently, 600 Russian prisoners. </sentence><sentence id="932">And I don't know, I think they were all officers and most of them probably were all political commisars [ph] and they were taken to Block 11, the death block, and they were put into the cellars and the cellars were sealed off. </sentence><sentence id="933">There were half windows and the half windows were covered with dirt in order to make them gas tight and they were gassed there. </sentence><sentence id="934">And in the night the bodies were removed by the pallbearers and taken to the crematorium Number | in Auschwitz and they were burned. </sentence><sentence id="935">And from the pallbearers we learned that they were Russian officers or soldiers, and among them there were also some 200 Polish prisoners that were gassed. </sentence><sentence id="936">So that was the first gassing, as I, which was performed. </sentence><sentence id="937">Later on, there were gassings in the small gas chamber in Auschwitz and I once was witness, I mean, not to the gassing itself because nobody -

were insulated inside with some gas proof material. </sentence><sentence id="954">I don't know what it was. </sentence><sentence id="955">I think it was wool, some wool, and then the edges, the edges of the door, they were this way, and the edges were then felt. </sentence><sentence id="956">You know, how do you say. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1514">A: Well, you know, I was thinking about escaping. </sentence><sentence id="1515">As a matter of fact, the first day I was arrested when I was taken to the prison and we were in the entrance hall, I already thought then that I just walk out because I did speak German. </sentence><sentence id="1516">I thought maybe I be able to talk myself out and I wanted to go to the gate. </sentence><sentence id="1517">But I didn't. </sentence><sentence id="1518">I didn't know enough, you know, how the workings of it were. </sentence><sentence id="1519">But then when I came to Auschwitz at the beginning, I didn't think it because, you know, you were so hungry and you just couldn't gather your thoughts. </sentence><sentence id="1520">All you were thinking about how to survive. </sentence><sentence id="1521">But later on when I, more or less, became acquainted and I got together with a friend of mine and we were thinking about escaping, and we did have a plan and we did prepare for it. </sentence><sentence id="1522">And of course, the preparations were you had to do it with and had to involve many people and trust many people. </sentence><sentence id="1523">Now, in the camp there were some crafts which couldn't be performed by prisoners because they were specialties things which had to be done. </sentence><sentence id="1524">And therefore, they did employ outside people from the Polish workers, and these workers were more or less free to mingle you know with the prisoners and some people did mingle with them and were able to talk and exchange information from the outside, and some of them were even able to send letters to their family from outside. </sentence><sentence id="1525">Some were caught and if the civilian person was caught, then they were brought to the camp or they were executed right away. </sentence><sentence id="1526">So they were taking great chances. </sentence><sentence id="1527">But anyway, so we did - one of the fellows made the contact, there were four of us who planned to escape, and we wanted to escape as civilian workers and we did prepare, you know, the passes. </sentence><sentence id="1528">They were of course forged and our photographs were drawings you know and then taken - the photographs by a lens and somebody in a box. </sentence><sentence id="1529">Somebody brought a lens and we made a photograph of this drawings. </sentence><sentence id="1530">Not of us. </sentence><sentence id="1531">Couldn't be done. </sentence><sentence id="1532">And then that's what we put on the passes and then the civilians also brought bicycles, and what they did, they came on a bicycle and left the bicycle in this spot. </sentence><sentence id="1533">It was in not carpentry. </sentence><sentence id="1534">It was in the joiners. </sentence><sentence id="1535">There were small places where they could be hidden you know, in the joiners, and they left them and they brought four because four of us wanted to escape, and they brought four bikes. </sentence><sentence id="1536">They also brought four civilian clothes and they also - we were able to prepare toupees, you know. </sentence><sentence id="1537">They were very crudely made. </sentence><sentence id="1538">I don't know who made them, but anyway there were, and then we decided that we going to go out of the camp. </sentence><sentence id="1539">At that time when we planned, you know, there was no more collective responsibility. </sentence><sentence id="1540">In other words, nobody would have suffered because of our escape and that's what - we didn't want anybody to be starved to death because we escaped. </sentence><sentence id="1541">We didn't think in those terms. </sentence><sentence id="1542">We thought that if we do, we didn't want anybody to suffer for us. </sentence><sentence id="1543">So when the day came that we escaped, we wanted to go with the other workers and could mingle and go in one group and then show the passes. </sentence><sentence id="1544">And I'm sure the guards wouldn't check each pass separately, you know closely, and when the day and the time to quit, which was the worker had to leave by five o'clock, we went to the shed. </sentence><sentence id="1545">It was a shed where we changed the clothes, into the civilian, and this one fellow who actually made all the contacts with

change. </sentence><sentence id="1548">So then one of my friends you know changed back into the prison and went to see what is happening. </sentence><sentence id="1549">And then he came and he was shaking life a leaf and he just couldn't contain himself. </sentence><sentence id="1550">He was mumbling. </sentence><sentence id="1551">He said, I'm sorry I can't make it. </sentence><sentence id="1552">He said, I cannot do it, I just can't take the risk. </sentence><sentence id="1553">So then we had to abandon it. </sentence><sentence id="1554">And we again changed into our prison garb, and now we were afraid about him, whether he is not going to you know to tell on us. </sentence><sentence id="1555">And we had to, well - we could have, if we wanted we could have eliminated him by - because of the lies, we could have infected him with typhus you know and he knew it and if he once he went to the hospital, you know, the doctors were all Polish or Jewish and Czechs or what and they were friends of ours, they would have taken care of him. </sentence><sentence id="1556">But he promised us, he cannot do it but he is not going to do any harm to us if we want to go in a different way. </sentence><sentence id="1557">He said to trust him and we did. </sentence><sentence id="1558">We did trust him and we had to change our plans, and then apparently, apparently somebody must have known that we were planning to escape, and then the other group came and they approached us with - we wouldn't go in a different way, and the different way was to acquire SS uniforms and take prisoners out to work outside the camp. </sentence><sentence id="1559">And that's how we started planning, and some of the people who were involved had connections. </sentence><sentence id="1560">One of the prisoners had connections with the people, because everywhere I worked were prisoners, everywhere. </sentence><sentence id="1561">Only the top authorities were the Germans, but otherwise, the inside organization of it was all, in the prisoners hands. </sentence><sentence id="1562">There were all in the offices, everything. </sentence><sentence id="1563">The whole evidence, everything, was kept by the prisoners. </sentence><sentence id="1564">Doctors, you know, everything. </sentence><sentence id="1565">So we decided that we do escape as SS guards and take four prisoners out to work, outside the camp. </sentence><sentence id="1566">And since my friend and myself spoke quite decent German, we were picked to be the SS people. </sentence><sentence id="1567">And then some of the friends who were involved had friends who worked in the storage rooms where they stored the SS uniforms and they were able to smuggle out of the storage rooms one pair of trousers and then second pair of trousers, and then one jacket and another one, then a cap, then second cap, then the belt, then second belt, and this was brought in and it was stored, you know, my friends who was supposed to change in the SS uniform with me who had a small studio. </sentence><sentence id="1568">He was a carver and a sculptor and he had a small studio, and he was not bothered by anybody, by the SS, because he worked for them. </sentence><sentence id="1569">He sculpted things for them for which they sometimes give him some bread and some sausage and, you know. </sentence><sentence id="1570">And they took these things and probably sold it or kept it, sent it to home. </sentence><sentence id="1571">So we stored it in his small studio, and then when the time came to escape, then we transferred it to the lumber yard. </sentence><sentence id="1572">Actually, it was not only a lumber yard but it was all the building materials were stored, in this place. </sentence><sentence id="1573">It was called Bowhov [?] </sentence><sentence id="1574">and in the barrack where the lumber was kept there were three friends of ours and they hid the uniforms there. </sentence><sentence id="1575">And these uniforms, they then put the insignia because we didn't want to go out as just ordinary SS men. </sentence><sentence id="1576">We wanted to go as NCOs in order that we were able to carry sidearms. </sentence><sentence id="1577">Of course, any SS man who was taking out people to work outside, you know, had to be armed. </sentence><sentence id="1578">Not only armed, had to have a special permit, but I'll come back later to it. </sentence><sentence id="1579">The arms of course, was an impossibility for us to obtain, but we again, had friends who worked in the saddlery that, you know, workshops, and we were able to obtain two holsters for which we then made dummy pistols out of wood. </sentence><sentence id="1580">Now, one of our friends knew somebody in the saddlery and he

fellow said, yes. </sentence><sentence id="1584">Of course, everything was done for a piece of bread or piece of sausage if you could obtain it. </sentence><sentence id="1585">And he said, yes he will do it, but what size is the pistol? </sentence><sentence id="1586">We said, well, we can't ask him to give us the pistol so that you can make the holster we said the normal size, just make one. </sentence><sentence id="1587">So he said Okay, but don't blame me if it doesn't fit. </sentence><sentence id="1588">But of course that was the whole idea, that it wouldn't fit because we needed two. </sentence><sentence id="1589">So no matter what he do it wouldn't be the right size. </sentence><sentence id="1590">So he made this one holster, and we told him no, I'm sorry, it is too small. </sentence><sentence id="1591">Will you make a larger one? </sentence><sentence id="1592">Again, for a piece of bread. </sentence><sentence id="1593">So he made another one and then we had the two holsters, and as I said, for the two holsters, we sculptured and made dummy out of wood, dummy pistols. </sentence><sentence id="1594">The pistol's holsters were open in the back and of course, you could see, you know, whether there were a real pistol or not. </sentence><sentence id="1595">But since camp, especially in the winter, was rather damp place - Auschwitz was a damp place, so the SS always wrapped the back of the pistol in a dark cloth, black cloth, you know, piece of cloth so that you couldn't see from the back whether it was a real pistol or not. </sentence><sentence id="1596">So we did the same thing and nobody knew whether there was a real pistol or not. </sentence><sentence id="1597">Then the SS needed a pass to take prisoners out to work and the passes were issued by the issuing SS officer, and they were of different color for different days and again, one of our fellows who were escaping with us knew a fellow prisoner who worked in the printing office and the printer gave him some blank forms in different colors. </sentence><sentence id="1598">Now, the day we wanted to escape which was, matter of fact, it will be in six days. </sentence><sentence id="1599">It will be the 50" anniversary, on the 28 of September, 1944. </sentence><sentence id="1600">And when we came to issue this blanks - the colors was pale blue - and we looked through our blanks and we didn't have a pale blue. </sentence><sentence id="1601">The nearest to it was pale green and we said well we'll take the pale green. </sentence><sentence id="1602">We take a chance. </sentence><sentence id="1603">So I knew who the issuing officer was and I did it in my office. </sentence><sentence id="1604">Of course, we needed a stamp. </sentence><sentence id="1605">The stamp - again, the sculptor, the carver, he carved it out, the stamp out of a very soft wood and he made a very good facsimile of it, and I tested it on a piece of paper in my office on an ink pad and it came a very good facsimile. </sentence><sentence id="1606">So then I did fill out on the 28" I did fill out this pass and I signed, forged the name of the issuing officer who was the SS ? </sentence><sentence id="1607">De Fuhrer, Miller, signed his name, put the stamp, and in order that the stamp wouldn't be recognized, you know, I smudged it a little. </sentence><sentence id="1608">And then the prisoners themselves needed a permit from the workshop SS man and this was no problem because one of the escapees was a clerk in the office there, and he had blanks and he issued the blanks that four prisoners, glassers are going to work in this spot and he signed this SS man, forged his name. </sentence><sentence id="1609">So we had these two pieces of passes which we needed. </sentence><sentence id="1610">Then we obtained, because if we failed, we obtained some cyanide poison. </sentence><sentence id="1611">We obtained it from the pharmacy, the camp pharmacy, which again, was run by prisoners, and the prisoners who did run it was named Marion Dolinski [ph] and he was a very nice fellow and he gave us cyanide in the form of powder, which we put, wrapped in pieces of paper and each one of us had it with him. </sentence><sentence id="1612">So then, now, before that we already had contact with the underground, and we had the contact with the underground through a Polish girl who worked as a SS civilian cleaning woman in the barracks of the national labor social - NSDRP, I don't know what the - that's the acronym of the German Nazi party - and through her we contacted with the underground and the resistance movement. </sentence><sentence id="1613">And how we did contact her is that again, she was instructed to do some damage, either to the plumbing or to the electricity or something that broke down and that the workers had to come and to correct it. </sentence><sentence id="1614">And of course, whenever we needed This is a verbatim transcript of

with another mechanic to go there or I went there, and he made the contact. </sentence><sentence id="1617">We exchanged the information with the girl and she took it to the - so with her we decided that we escape on the 28 of September 1944 and that - how do you say, the word you know, the recognition? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1728">Q: Password? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1730">A: Password will be a Polish carol, which the fellow who is going to meet us was supposed to whistle. </sentence><sentence id="1731">And the carol, Polish carol name was "" ? " </sentence><sentence id="1732">which means "They came to Bethlehem." </sentence><sentence id="1733">So then everything was ready for us to go, and since we didn't have the proper color pass we said that we will try to avoid going through the gates where the passes would be checked. </sentence><sentence id="1734">And we already surveyed it beforehand, that there to the buildings to which we had to go to do to put the panes in you know, the panes, the glasspanes in, was there was a shortcut which led under the tower of a guard. </sentence><sentence id="1735">And many workers pass this way many times and they were never stopped. </sentence><sentence id="1736">So we said that we will try to do the same things, and we had a lookout for us, a fellow prisoner, a very good friend of us who was looking at the place, and he was supposed to give us the sign you know whether it's okay or not okay. </sentence><sentence id="1737">Anyway, so when the day came and we decided to escape at noontime, it was the time when the SS, most of them went to the mess hall you know, for lunch and there wouldn't be too much of them moving around. </sentence><sentence id="1738">Because we had quite a distance to walk to meet our prisoners, you know, whom we were taking out to work and they were quite a distance away. </sentence><sentence id="1739">So when the day came at noontime, at one o'clock it so happened that the SS man who was in charge of me and the workshops came to my office, and he wanted something urgently done and it took sometime and I was delayed. </sentence><sentence id="1740">Eventually, he did leave and he went to lunch, and then I was able to leave and I went to meet my friend, the other one who was supposed to change into the SS clothes, and we went to the lumber yard. </sentence><sentence id="1741">Because in the meantime, we transferred it to the lumber yard, the uniforms, we went there and these people were quite worried that we were late, and they thought matter of fact that we won't show up at all. </sentence><sentence id="1742">But anyway we did come, and we changed into the uniforms you know and they inspected us. </sentence><sentence id="1743">They were supposed to then, after we were successful in escaping, they would burn our prison uniforms. </sentence><sentence id="1744">They inspected us and they looked out of the barrack whether the air was clear and they told us yes, and we walked out. </sentence><sentence id="1745">And as I said, we had to walk approximately some, almost half a mile and it was dangerous. </sentence><sentence id="1746">It was really dangerous because we were afraid that we could meet some SS people who would recognize us. </sentence><sentence id="1747">So it happened that we were lucky. </sentence><sentence id="1748">We didn't meet many prisoners who had to salute us the prescribed way and where they had to take off their cap and, you know, look at us, and one of the fellows recognized me because I met him later on, 1945, in Italy, and he said that I looked very pale. </sentence><sentence id="1749">Well, anyway so we came to the place where we were supposed to meet these prisoners whom we were taking out to work. </sentence><sentence id="1750">We told them to pick up their tools, the glass, and shouted the way the SS shouted at prisoners to pick up, and they picked up the glass and we walked towards the tower. </sentence><sentence id="1751">And there our lookout gave us the sign that everything is clear, that we can go and we went. </sentence><sentence id="1752">We went it was a narrow pass leading under the tower and the guard on the tower with the machine gun, seeing our insignia, you know, shouted Hail Hitler to us and we shouted This is a verbatim transcript

id="1756">And he said, yes, it's a nice day. </sentence><sentence id="1757">And we went, we passed. </sentence><sentence id="1758">We had to come to the main road and on the main road as we were maybe some 50 or 40 yards away, there were always roving patrols would check, you know, the SS and the prisoners who worked outside the big chain of guards and as we were approaching this road on the bicycle was an SS man, a Sergeant SS man on the bicycle and he was looking in our direction, and he was unable to make up his mind whether to stop and check us out or whether to go on. </sentence><sentence id="1759">Anyway, he almost stopped on the bike and finally, he decided to go and he went on. </sentence><sentence id="1760">And we didn't know what we would do, but between ourselves we said if he does check out and he finds out we have the wrong passes, we either have to kill him or take him with us and hoping he wouldn't make to much noise. </sentence><sentence id="1761">Anyway, he did go on so we came to the road. </sentence><sentence id="1762">As we came to the road, going away from us was a whole company of SS going to the firing range. </sentence><sentence id="1763">So they must have passed only a few minutes before we got there - so we crossed the road. </sentence><sentence id="1764">We went into the houses. </sentence><sentence id="1765">There were new houses being built for the SS and they had to be, you know, the panes had be put into the frames of the window frames. </sentence><sentence id="1766">It's not like here where the whole window comes with glass and everything's there, you just put first the frame and then you have to put the window. </sentence><sentence id="1767">So we went into the house looked around. </sentence><sentence id="1768">Nobody was there. </sentence><sentence id="1769">We went to the other side of the house and looked around. </sentence><sentence id="1770">Nobody there, and we walked because they were open fields and the fields led to the river, the River Soya [ph] which floats near and through Auschwitz city, the city of Auschwitz. </sentence><sentence id="1771">We came to the river. </sentence><sentence id="1772">Near the river the vegetation was quite lush and in the brushes the glassers, you know, took off the heavy panes off their backs ad the other tools and we dumped it there. </sentence><sentence id="1773">And then we walked on the west side of the river going south for some 150 yards and then went into the river. </sentence><sentence id="1774">The level of the river was very low at that time. </sentence><sentence id="1775">We walked in the river bed for some 150 yards in order to lose the scent for the dogs once the search would start, then cross to the east side of the bank and walked along. </sentence><sentence id="1776">As we walked further south there was a couple lying, young couple lying in the grass and we knew that there was only a fellow was supposed to be - anyway we came there and we don't hear any whistling of the carol, so we pass and suddenly we hear that somebody is walking or even running behind us and he's trying whistling but no tune comes out. </sentence><sentence id="1777">So we turned around and we then spoke in Polish what are you trying to whistle? </sentence><sentence id="1778">and he said this " "" and we said well, you're our contact then. </sentence><sentence id="1779">He said, yes. </sentence><sentence id="1780">He said, I couldn't get a tune out. </sentence><sentence id="1781">I was so nervous because you looked so impressive as SS men. </sentence><sentence id="1782">I said, now, you were supposed to be my yourself. </sentence><sentence id="1783">And he said, yes, but I was so lonely I said I better take a companion, the girl. </sentence><sentence id="1784">So then they came with us and we walked further south, and they put us in very deep bushes and we - he said we have to wait here. </sentence><sentence id="1785">I'm going to see the commandant of the unit, of the Partisan unit and he will come here. </sentence><sentence id="1786">And he came after a while. </sentence><sentence id="1787">He came and he brought us three grenades and two real pistols this time. </sentence><sentence id="1788">And then he said we can't go any further until it become dark because some of the bridges and the roads are being watched by the SS. </sentence><sentence id="1789">So we waited in the bushes until it became dark. </sentence><sentence id="1790">While we were sitting in the bushes we heard the siren go off in the camp. </sentence><sentence id="1791">We probably at that time were maybe three, three miles, three and a half miles away from the camp, and once a siren went off we knew that we were discovered that we were missing and that the search would begin. </sentence><sentence id="1792">And when it became dark he took us and he led us through some pass and roads. </sentence><sentence id="1793">I don't know where. </sentence><sentence id="1794">Anyway, we came to a farmer's house and there we were given very poor civilian clothes, This is a verbatim transcript

they hid because for further use later on, and the prison garb was taken out and burned right away. </sentence><sentence id="1798">And we were given a bowl of soup and glass of Polish vodka, a small glass. </sentence><sentence id="1799">And then the same guide who picked us up came and walked us bypassing the villages further south to the foothills of the Carpathian Mountains. </sentence><sentence id="1800">And we arrived there in the morning and there we were met by two Partisans, also former escapees from Auschwitz, and then taken back further in, deep in the mountains and high in the mountains to the headquarters of the Partisans. </sentence><sentence id="1801">The Partisans were - approximately 100 people were there, and approximately 20 of them were former escapees from Auschwitz. </sentence><sentence id="1802">Well, there were approximately 667 attempts of escape from Auschwitz and 270 were caught and executed. </sentence><sentence id="1803">The execution was always by hanging, public hanging. </sentence><sentence id="1804">397, you know, survived, but not much is know about them. </sentence><sentence id="1805">Our group which escaped, we

Auschwitz, and it was -- there was two big complexes of synthetic rubber factories and synthetic gas plants, and I remember when these were built, and I think they were not finished until 1943. </sentence><sentence id="2490">And the prisoners who worked there, they had to get up around when it was still dark. </sentence><sentence id="2491">Then they had to go by train, if the trains were running, they loaded them on the train. </sentence><sentence id="2492">They didn't come back from work until late when it was dark, many times very dark. </sentence><sentence id="2493">And then they got the Russians. </sentence><sentence id="2494">Most of the workers were Jewish and many of them died by the thousands because of the hard labor. </sentence><sentence id="2495">They were digging for the foundations and the meager rations and the long hours, it was terrible. </sentence><sentence id="2496">Nobody wanted to go to this commando, but I think there were thousands of prisoners who had to work and thousands of them were dying and so that, these were the three main camps. </sentence><sentence id="2497">Then there were set camp subcamps all over the place. </sentence><sentence id="2498">There were subcamps. </sentence><sentence id="2499">Some of them were even in Czechoslovakia, in the mines, coal mines. </sentence><sentence id="2500">Many prisoners worked in the coal mines. </sentence><sentence id="2501">There were times when I think close to 200,000 prisoners. </sentence><sentence id="2502">Can you imagine, 200,000? </sentence><sentence id="2503">That's a big city, 200,000. </sentence><sentence id="2504">Those who were in the camp who got numbers and so on, there were approximately over 400,000 which were numbered and tattooed and, you know, the numbers tattooed, the tattooed number. </sentence><sentence id="2505">At the beginning when I came we were not tattooed. </sentence><sentence id="2506">The orders came later on in 1942 when everybody had to be tattooed, and then we had to be tattooed and were tattooed and then inspected if w truly did carry out the orders. </sentence><sentence id="2507">And the new arrivals after that day were tattooed right away at registration. </sentence></p></dialogue>
