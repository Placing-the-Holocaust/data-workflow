<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="7">A: Well, I went to school in my hometown and I finished, graduated from the high school which we called gymnasium, and after the graduation I enlisted into the School of Foreign Trade in Warsaw. </sentence><sentence id="8">And in 1938 I was called up to the Polish Army and as a graduate of gymnasium I only had to serve one year, and you served in cadet officers school, reserve cadet officers school, which I did. </sentence><sentence id="9">And I was supposed to be released in October 1939 and as you probably know the war started on September 1, "39 and I took part in the fighting. </sentence><sentence id="10">I was assigned to a unit of antitank artillery and I took part in the defense of Warsaw, and on September 27 Warsaw surrendered, and I was taken as a prisoner of war and taken out first, out of Warsaw on the 28 of September to the west, and near a small town of Prostejov where we were kept, you know, thousands of soldiers in an open field and meadows and then divided in four groups; south, north, east and west, and since I came from the north I went to the north group, and we were loaded then on tanks and taken to the north, and we came to the town of Torun, which is a town some 40 miles south of my hometown, and there we were taken and unloaded and then taken to the other side of the Vistul </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="11">A: We came, arrived at the western part of the Vistula River and the two bridges which were across the Vistula were both damaged, and we had to walk single file to across the other side of the river. </sentence><sentence id="12">And there we were again assembled and we were supposed to go to the citadel where they told us that we were only go to stay overnight and the next morning they were going to release us. </sentence><sentence id="13">Of course, I realized that this was a lie, as most of the things they told us, and I, myself, separated myself from -- I asked the guard if I could go to the toilet because we were near the station in Torun and he said yes. </sentence><sentence id="14">I went to the toilet and I didn't return to it. </sentence><sentence id="15">He saw me going away and he said, where are you going? </sentence><sentence id="16">And I said, well, my troops assemble at the other part of the station and I have to -- and I think he realized that I was running away but he let me go. </sentence><sentence id="17">So I went to the other station, and there quite accidently I met my cousin, who never did serve in the Armed Forces, but he was in a uniform, a soldiers uniform and we got together, and somehow he was able to secure some blank forms which were given to people who considered themselves of German origin, and they were issued these passes and he had the blank forms. </sentence><sentence id="18">So we filled them out with our names and signed some fictitious names to it. </sentence><sentence id="19">Of course, we didn't have any stamps. </sentence><sentence id="20">Anyway, we boarded the train to our hometown and we arrived around midnight in my hometown, and at the exit all the passes were checked and there were the SS people and the SR people and the Armed Forces people, and when they This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="21">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="22"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection looked at our passes they told us to step aside. </sentence><sentence id="23">We stepped aside and then they gathered us. </sentence><sentence id="24">I think there were 11 of us or so and they said, well, again you have to go to the citadel overnight and then in the morning we going to release you. </sentence><sentence id="25">Of course, we knew better than that. </sentence><sentence id="26">So they marched us from the station, and my cousin was an owner of a lumber yard and we had to pass near the lumber yard, and he told the guard -- we were in the last row and he told, he looked, still my name on the -- my firm name, and why do you want me to go to the citadel for the night if I could sleep at home? </sentence><sentence id="27">And he said, all right. </sentence><sentence id="28">Go ahead. </sentence><sentence id="29">And then I told him, well, it's my cousin, can I stay with him there too?And he said already, go. </sentence><sentence id="30">And we went and that's how we got away from being prisoner of war and spending the rest of the war. </sentence><sentence id="31">So I stayed overnight and the next morning I went home and-- </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="108">Q: Before you go to that -- how did you find out about the underground movement? </sentence><sentence id="109">Tell me a little bit more about that. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="112">A: Well, I had a friend -- a friend who his name was Tobulsky(ph). </sentence><sentence id="113">That's also was one reason why I was arrested, and he was also from my hometown in Grujand and, he was involved in an organization which was formed by one also a student in my hometown which he joined. </sentence><sentence id="114">I didn't join because I wasn't there already, and they joined this organization and he wasn't caught, but the principal of the organization was caught, and he was tried and then convicted, you know, and sentenced to death. </sentence><sentence id="115">And he was executed in Poz -- which was another quite a big city which was incorporated in Germany. </sentence><sentence id="116">And the executioned at that time was my -- he was -- they chopped you know his head off with an axe. </sentence><sentence id="117">He was axed, and this friend of mine, since he escaped and he came to the General Government to Warsaw, was tried in that and he was also sentenced to death. </sentence><sentence id="118">And  http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection you know and for arms. </sentence><sentence id="119">Well, they didn't find it either because I didn't keep anything at home. </sentence><sentence id="120">Anyway, then they started asking me questions and one question was that your friend was here with you yesterday. </sentence><sentence id="121">And they -- apparently he changed his name and he failed to tell me about it. </sentence><sentence id="122">I knew him only by his new name, and so when they asked me was Tobulksy (ph) you know that was his assumed name, I said no, so they hit me. </sentence><sentence id="123">You know, you can see it here on the movies you know with the hand across there. </sentence><sentence id="124">Hit me right in my temple and I fell to the floor, and as I fell to the floor, they started, the three of them started kicking me and I said -- I remember the only person who visited me was this young Tobulsky and I told them his real name. </sentence><sentence id="125">Apparently, they knew this and they stopped beating me, I got up, and after a while they had a small conference between the three of them and then they came back and said, you better get dressed and you will go with us. </sentence><sentence id="126">So I got dressed and then they took me out, and the two of them held me by the cuffs of my jacket and they walked on both sides. </sentence><sentence id="127">And this one in the uniform drew his revolver and walked behind me, and he told me, don't try anything because I'm going to shoot you. </sentence><sentence id="128">So they took me down through the street and there was a car waiting, Mercedes -- they only drove Mercedes -- and they opened the door, and as they opened the door I saw another friend of mine sitting there, and he said, oh, you know each other. </sentence><sentence id="129">And I said, yes, I do, and they told me to get in. </sentence><sentence id="130">And one of the SS sat between the two of us and their chauffeur. </sentence><sentence id="131">They drove me to the prison, prison Pawiak in Warsaw, and then approximately, already ten people from other prisoners, and they were registered and then taken -- I was taken to a single cell in the basement and there was no -- it was only a small bulb. </sentence><sentence id="132">There was no furniture. </sentence><sentence id="133">There was no window there. </sentence><sentence id="134">It was a dirt floor, and the walls were dripping with water, and there was only a pail which you used as a toilet. </sentence><sentence id="135">And when I came there I didn't really know what happened. </sentence><sentence id="136">After a while a guard came and took me out and into the yard and to the showers. </sentence><sentence id="137">I had to undress and my clothes were disinfected and I had to shower. </sentence><sentence id="138">And then after the clothes came back, my suit and so on, was all trampled they took me -- the guard took me to the first -- no, second floor of the prison and took me to a cell. </sentence><sentence id="139">I don't remember the number of the cell. </sentence><sentence id="140">Anyway, the cells were small. </sentence><sentence id="141">They were maybe seven feet wide and ten feet long, and there were already nine prisoners. </sentence><sentence id="142">Which means, there were ten of us. </sentence><sentence id="143">There was no bunk or anything. </sentence><sentence id="144">We had to lie on the floor. </sentence><sentence id="145">Again, there was no furniture whatsoever except the pail where we could relieve ourselves. </sentence><sentence id="146">We were only taken in the morning to the toilets where we could wash a little, and I think in the afternoon once and in the evening, and the rest we had to spend in the cells. </sentence><sentence id="147">At that time there were Polish guards, you know, prewar Polish guards as were as Germans, SS people, and some of the Polish guards were very friendly and pleasant and helpful. </sentence><sentence id="148">Some were not so helpful. </sentence><sentence id="149">Anyway, one of the guards in my -- I don't know how he found out -- but he found out that I do speak German, and one day he asked me -- apparently he was living in a house which was Jewish-owned house, and it was requisitioned by the government and the Germans and apparently, whoever took over from the Germans wanted to increase his rent and he asked me, he said, on the salary which they pay me, I won't be able to pay the rent for it. </sentence><sentence id="150">And he asked me if I could write a -- how do you say -- an application to the authorities, you know, whereby they wouldn't increase his rent. </sentence><sentence id="151">So I did. </sentence><sentence id="152">He took me to the office and I did write the letter, and after a few weeks he got a reply. </sentence><sentence id="153">And they didn't increase -- not This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="154">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="155"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection only didn't they increase. </sentence><sentence id="156">Matter of fact, they reduced his rent. </sentence><sentence id="157">So he was very appreciative and he said what can I do for you, and of course, I wanted to tell him, let me go free from the prison, but he said, what I can do for you, I can take you out of the cell. </sentence><sentence id="158">Since you do speak German you can be an interpreter, and he took me to another part of the prison to another ward which was served only by German guard. </sentence><sentence id="159">And there I became an interpreter to this German guard, and of course, my life was a little easier because I was with four other prisoners in one cell and we also had bunks. </sentence><sentence id="160">I didn't have to sleep on the floor. </sentence><sentence id="161">And two of the prisoners, who lived also in this cell, they worked in the prison kitchen and as such they were able to -- well, they had more food but they were not allowed -- they couldn't and they were afraid to bring any food, but what they did bring they brought always in the evening to the cell, whole pot of coffee. </sentence><sentence id="162">And the coffee was so sweet. </sentence><sentence id="163">They probably put pounds of sugar in it. </sentence><sentence id="164">So we drank this coffee, this sweet coffee, which was not real coffee because the Germans, they wouldn't give the prisoners. </sentence><sentence id="165">It was such a good coffee. </sentence><sentence id="166">Anyway, it looked like coffee and the sugar of course was very important. </sentence><sentence id="167">So I felt I could move free because they didn't close the cell, and whenever the guard needed me to translate. </sentence><sentence id="168">And so I did translate and in the meantime, I was taking for interrogation. </sentence><sentence id="169">You were interrogated in the headquarters of the Gestapo which was in the central part of Warsaw, and you were taken there by a truck. </sentence><sentence id="170">And the guards were in the truck as well, as motorcycle guards as well as going behind the truck and when you came to the Gestapo headquarters, which were now located in the prewar Polish Educational Ministry, and one of the wings was converted. </sentence><sentence id="171">The southern wing was converted into cells where the prisoners, before they went for interrogation, were taken. </sentence><sentence id="172">There were ten individual cells and four, I believe four, common cells and the common cells, we -- the prisoners called them trams because they were single seats on each side of the cell, and in the middle there was a walking path and you had to sit facing the wall and you were not allowed to look around or you couldn't talk to you, and the guard was behind you and if he heard you talk or move your head, he came and hit you over the head. </sentence><sentence id="173">And you sat there motionless. </sentence><sentence id="174">You didn't get any food or anything to drink, and they called when the interrogating officer called. </sentence><sentence id="175">A guard came and took you up to the room. </sentence><sentence id="176">I was taken to the room, and in the room there were this interrogating officer who was now in uniform. </sentence><sentence id="177">When he arrested me, he was one arresting, he was in civilian clothes. </sentence><sentence id="178">He was an officer of the Gestapo. </sentence><sentence id="179">And there was a typist, a girl and interpreter. </sentence><sentence id="180">Since he knew -- the interrogating officer knew that I spoke German -- he was very rude matter of fact, to the interpreter. </sentence><sentence id="181">He told him get lost, you know, he speaks German, so we don't need you here. </sentence><sentence id="182">And then he started interrogating, questioning. </sentence><sentence id="183">Actually, they didn't have anything, you know, which they could hang on me. </sentence><sentence id="184">They didn't find any leaflet. </sentence><sentence id="185">They didn't find anything and I didn't admit that I was a member of the resistance movement and they didn't know that. </sentence><sentence id="186">The only thing they were about was a friend of mine and again, as I told them when they first arrested me. </sentence><sentence id="187">And so it was typed and then the typed report was given to me for reading. </sentence><sentence id="188">I read it through and then I had to sign it. </sentence><sentence id="189">I did sign it. </sentence><sentence id="190">Frankly, it was not incriminating to me at all except that I knew this fellow, and then he called the guard and the guard took me again down to the cellar into this common cells and I had to sit until all the prisoners were interrogated. </sentence><sentence id="191">Sometimes, the interrogation went deep into the night and sometimes until the next morning of the other prisoners, and you had to sit This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="192">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="193"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection there until they took you back or they loaded you back into the truck and then they took you to the prison. </sentence><sentence id="194">So I was taken in the late afternoon back to the prison. </sentence><sentence id="195">In the meantime, you missed your food. </sentence><sentence id="196">You didn't get any food in the prison. </sentence><sentence id="197">The food was meager as it was but anyway, I still didn't get anything that day to eat. </sentence><sentence id="198">I can tell you one incident when I was awakened in the middle of the night by a Gestapo man. </sentence><sentence id="199">They came to our ward and they woke me up, and I had to interpret and they called 20 names out of different cells. </sentence><sentence id="200">And these were hostages and I think some of them knew what the fate which they faced. </sentence><sentence id="201">Most of them were very well educated. </sentence><sentence id="202">Some were professors of the Warsaw University. </sentence><sentence id="203">Some were engineers and only one, I remember, was a criminal prisoner, and all of them behaved with tremendous dignity. </sentence><sentence id="204">They didn't plead or beg or anything except this criminal prisoner. </sentence><sentence id="205">He fell to the floor and begged to the SS man, kissed his boots, you know that, to spare him. </sentence><sentence id="206">Of course, they wouldn't have anything of it. </sentence><sentence id="207">And I had to interpret and they were taken, and they were taken outside to Warsaw and shot as hostages. </sentence><sentence id="208">So thats the one experience I had in prison. </sentence><sentence id="209">I spent five months in the prison in Pawiak prison. </sentence><sentence id="210">During that time I had a girlfriend whom I left who of course, was not arrested -- and somehow she managed to send me a parcel, and how I knew that the parcel was from her because I couldn't communicate. </sentence><sentence id="211">You couldn't write any letters or anything like this. </sentence><sentence id="212">You could only send letters if a guard would take them on the sly, but otherwise there was no, no possibility of communicating. </sentence><sentence id="213">But I know that this what is from my girlfriend because she send me also a small pillow, and I recognized the pillow that it was from her, and she sent me some food. </sentence><sentence id="214">But the food was always shared with others and before it came to you it was -- the parcel was very skimpy -- but anyway, it was a sign that somebody did think about you. </sentence><sentence id="215">And as I said, I was five months and on April the 4, 1941, in the afternoon the whole prison population was called out in into the yard, and there were already tables set up and the Gestapo people were there with lists and they called the names of different prisoners. </sentence><sentence id="216">And once your name was called you had to go to a different part of the yard and stand, and my name was called too and I had to go, and those prisoners whose names were not called were then taken back to the cells. </sentence><sentence id="217">The prisoner -- I think the capacity of the prison was around 800 prisoners but there were approximately over 2000 or even more. </sentence><sentence id="218">And they were preparing a transport and the transport was over a thousand prisoners. </sentence><sentence id="219">So after we -- the prisoners whose names were not called went back into the cells, then they issued us I think -- I don't remember exactly but I think half a loaf of bread -- and we knew that we were going into transport. </sentence><sentence id="220">Of course, we didn't know where but the word already was spreading in Warsaw and in the prison that there was a camp, concentration camp by the name, Polish name, Oswiecim, in German Auschwitz. </sentence><sentence id="221">And everybody dreaded it because the word was that it was an extermination camp, and we all prayed that we are not going to that camp. </sentence><sentence id="222">In the evening the big trucks arrived. </sentence><sentence id="223">SS with SS guards and also Warsaw municipal buses arrived, and we were loaded into these buses. </sentence><sentence id="224">And we were loaded with shouts and with beatings. </sentence><sentence id="225">It was, you know, the SS people with bats, you know, and with bull whips, beating us, and we had to run into the trucks and the buses and then taken to the western part of Warsaw, the western railroad station. </sentence><sentence id="226">There again were on the ramp, we were loaded into the cattle cars. </sentence><sentence id="227">Again, with beatings and shouts, dogs, and I don't remember how many prisoners to a cattle car but there was standing room only and again, there was no water. </sentence><sentence id="228">The only This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="229">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="230"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection thing was a big drum which served as a toilet, and then probably around midnight they locked the doors and the train moved. </sentence><sentence id="231">Of course, we didn't know where we were going. </sentence><sentence id="232">Anyway, the next morning we arrived somewhere at a siding, and we heard some voices, shouts, and barking, dogs barking, and then the doors were opened and with shouts we were driven out of the car. </sentence><sentence id="233">You had to jump out. </sentence><sentence id="234">There was no ramp, and we were put into formation in rows of five prisoners and twenty rows to -- . </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="365">Q: Tell me what you remember about the forming of the Jewish ghetto and did you see anything when the Ghetto got formed, and did you see people get rounded up? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="367">A: Yes, the Jewish ghetto was started sometime in 1940 and, you know, prewar there was a Jewish quarters in Warsaw. </sentence><sentence id="368">There was no ghetto. </sentence><sentence id="369">People could go freely but most of the Jews concentrated you know, in one section and it was called the Main Street. </sentence><sentence id="370">There was Naleverky(ph). </sentence><sentence id="371">Matter of fact, the prison Pawiak was right in the middle of the ghetto and the ghetto was formed, I think, I don't know exactly what month, but in 1940. </sentence><sentence id="372">And at that time Jews -- there were orders given that all Jews, you know, had to go and register to go to the ghetto. </sentence><sentence id="373">Now, many Jews didn't. </sentence><sentence id="374">They also were by law had to wear armbands with the Star of David, and I don't think they in Warsaw they didn't wear any Star of David on their jackets, but they had to have an armband with a Star of David. </sentence><sentence id="375">A blue Star of David as far as I remember and now those who didn't wear it, you know, could hide. </sentence><sentence id="376">They just didn't wear it. </sentence><sentence id="377">Now It's true that some of them were betrayed and they went to -- they had to go into the ghetto. </sentence><sentence id="378">But the ghetto now there were gates and you couldn't go to the ghetto yourself. </sentence><sentence id="379">Nobody could. </sentence><sentence id="380">I think you had to have a special permit. </sentence><sentence id="381">I never did. </sentence><sentence id="382">And through the ghetto, for instance, there were trams, you know, streetcars going through it but they were separated. </sentence><sentence id="383">They were, for instance, the streetcar trucks separated one part of the ghetto from the other one, and in order from one part to go to it, there were bridges built just provisional bridges made out of wood, wooden bridges where the Jews could go through one part to another part, and I think they could move around in the ghetto freely. </sentence><sentence id="384">So that as much as I remember about the ghetto. </sentence></p></dialogue>

they didn't have the capacity to burn the bodies. </sentence><sentence id="793">The one crematorium which was in Auschwitz One was the smallest of all the crematoriums and it just couldn't burn the bodies, you know, fast enough. </sentence><sentence id="794">There was also a crematorium - next to the crematorium in Auschwitz was a small gas chamber where people were gassed. </sentence><sentence id="795">Of course, the biggest crematoriums were in Auschwitz Two and Birkenau. </sentence><sentence id="796">There were this crematorium in Auschwitz was designated as Number | and then there were Number 2, 3, 4 and 5 in Birkenau, and there the capacity was much greater, much greater, especially the gas chambers. </sentence><sentence id="797">They had the capacity of 2000 or even more prisoners or people could be gassed in one sitting. </sentence><sentence id="798">And there were four of them so it's approximately 10,000 people could be gassed in, well, matter of few hours. </sentence><sentence id="799">The gassing was not the problem. </sentence><sentence id="800">The problem was the disposing of the bodies because the capacity of the ovens were quite limited. </sentence><sentence id="801">That's why many of the bodies were burned in ditches or they were burned on stacks and disposed this way. </sentence><sentence id="802">Now, since we were about gassing, the first gassing actually took place in Auschqitz camp itself and it was the gassing of some 600 Russian prisoners of war. </sentence><sentence id="803">We - and some Polish prisoners. </sentence><sentence id="804">One day, it was of course after the invasion of Russia by Hitler, I think it was approximately on, in September, I think, September of 1941. </sentence><sentence id="805">We were all called back from our workplaces to the camp. </sentence><sentence id="806">Maybe I should also explain how the compound itself was only for the prisoners to go for the night to sleep, and the compound - as I said in Auschwitz One was 28 blocks and it was surrounded by two rows of barbedwire, electrified barbwire and by towers with guards with machine guns. </sentence><sentence id="807">On the east side, east and south side there was also maybe 15 high -

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1339">A: One time - well, typhus was always but there was an epidemic in 1942. </sentence><sentence id="1340">There was a great epidemic of typhus. </sentence><sentence id="1341">It was the spotted fever. </sentence><sentence id="1342">I contracted it and I went to the hospital, what they called the hospital in the camp. </sentence><sentence id="1343">It was so bad that later on, you know, we had bunks and there they were three-tier bunks in the hospital. </sentence><sentence id="1344">There were also three-tier bunks and they were approximately three feet wide and on them, many times, three prisoners, three sick people had to lie. </sentence><sentence id="1345">And, two this way and one in the legs, you know. </sentence><sentence id="1346">So it was terrible, and I contracted it too and I was for 16 days in high fever. </sentence><sentence id="1347">I never apparently - my constitution was quite good and I didn't lose consciousness, but I didn't eat through the whole 16 days and all I did get was hot water, boiled water to drink. </sentence><sentence id="1348">And then I was for the next three weeks in convalescence, and then I was released one afternoon, but I don't know. </sentence><sentence id="1349">Maybe I had a friend, doctor whom I knew and the friend doctor, it was Dr. Tyfeld [ph] he - after I got out and was in convalescence, he gave me two injections of glucose. </sentence><sentence id="1350">That's the only medication I did get, to strengthen me. </sentence><sentence id="1351">And then, as I said, one afternoon I was released, and the reason for it I don't know. </sentence><sentence id="1352">Maybe the doctor knew something or not. </sentence><sentence id="1353">I was released in the afternoon and I was so happy that I was now out of the - and I tried to run and I didn't realize how weak I was and I couldn't lift my feet, and I fell right on my face. </sentence><sentence id="1354">And then I went on the block and the next morning around, I think, six o'clock in the morning or seven o'clock, the trucks came to the hospital and all the patients, whether in convalescence or sick were loaded on these trucks and taken to the gas chambers and they were all gassed. </sentence><sentence id="1355">And they were not all Jewish, you know Jews. </sentence><sentence id="1356">There were Christians and Poles, and Czechs, many different nationalities, and they were all dead and all taken and gassed, and I avoided it just by well some 12, 13 hours, you know I avoided being gassed. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1389">Q: Sometime around late in 1943, I think it was that you decided, even though escape was impossible, that you would look into that. </sentence><sentence id="1390">Tell me what happened, how it led into that? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1393">A: Well, you know, I was thinking about escaping. </sentence><sentence id="1394">As a matter of fact, the first day I was arrested when I was taken to the prison and we were in the entrance hall, I already thought then that I just walk out because I did speak German. </sentence><sentence id="1395">I thought maybe I be able to talk myself out and I wanted to go to the gate. </sentence><sentence id="1396">But I didn't. </sentence><sentence id="1397">I didn't know enough, you know, how the workings of it were. </sentence><sentence id="1398">But then when I came to Auschwitz at the beginning, I didn't think it because, you know, you were so hungry and you just couldn't gather your thoughts. </sentence><sentence id="1399">All you were thinking about how to survive. </sentence><sentence id="1400">But later on when I, more or less, became acquainted and I got together with a friend of mine and we were thinking about escaping, and we did have a plan and we did prepare for it. </sentence><sentence id="1401">And of course, the preparations were you had to do it with and had to involve many people and trust many people. </sentence><sentence id="1402">Now, in the camp there were some crafts which couldn't be performed by prisoners because they were specialties things which had to be done. </sentence><sentence id="1403">And therefore, they did employ outside people from the Polish workers, and these workers were more or less free to mingle you know with the prisoners and some people did mingle with them and were able to talk and exchange information from the outside, and some of them were even able to send letters to their family from outside. </sentence><sentence id="1404">Some were caught and if the civilian person was caught, then they were brought to the camp or they were executed right away. </sentence><sentence id="1405">So they were taking great chances. </sentence><sentence id="1406">But anyway, so we did - one of the fellows made the contact, there were four of us who planned to escape, and we wanted to escape as civilian workers and we did prepare, you know, the passes. </sentence><sentence id="1407">They were of course forged and our photographs were drawings you know and then taken - the photographs by a lens and somebody in a box. </sentence><sentence id="1408">Somebody brought a lens and we made a photograph of this drawings. </sentence><sentence id="1409">Not of us. </sentence><sentence id="1410">Couldn't be done. </sentence><sentence id="1411">And then that's what we put on the passes and then the civilians also brought bicycles, and what they did, they came on a bicycle and left the bicycle in this spot. </sentence><sentence id="1412">It was in not carpentry. </sentence><sentence id="1413">It was in the joiners. </sentence><sentence id="1414">There were small places where they could be hidden you know, in the joiners, and they left them and they brought four because four of us wanted to escape, and they brought four bikes. </sentence><sentence id="1415">They also brought four civilian clothes and they also - we were able to prepare toupees, you know. </sentence><sentence id="1416">They were very crudely made. </sentence><sentence id="1417">I don't know who made them, but anyway there were, and then we decided that we going to go out of the camp. </sentence><sentence id="1418">At that time when we planned, you know, there was no more collective responsibility. </sentence><sentence id="1419">In other words, nobody would have suffered because of our escape and that's what - we didn't want anybody to be starved to death because we escaped. </sentence><sentence id="1420">We didn't think in those terms. </sentence><sentence id="1421">We thought that if we do, we didn't want anybody to suffer for us. </sentence><sentence id="1422">So when the day came that we escaped, we wanted to go with the other workers and could mingle and go in one group and then show the passes. </sentence><sentence id="1423">And I'm sure the guards wouldn't check each pass separately, you know closely, and when the day and the time to quit, which was the worker had to leave by five o'clock, we went to the shed. </sentence><sentence id="1424">It was a shed where we changed the clothes, into the civilian, and this one fellow who actually made all the contacts with the civilians because he was in a position This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="1425">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="1426"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection 4 to do it, he just didn't show up in the shed to change. </sentence><sentence id="1427">So then one of my friends you know changed back into the prison and went to see what is happening. </sentence><sentence id="1428">And then he came and he was shaking life a leaf and he just couldn't contain himself. </sentence><sentence id="1429">He was mumbling. </sentence><sentence id="1430">He said, I'm sorry I can't make it. </sentence><sentence id="1431">He said, I cannot do it, I just can't take the risk. </sentence><sentence id="1432">So then we had to abandon it. </sentence><sentence id="1433">And we again changed into our prison garb, and now we were afraid about him, whether he is not going to you know to tell on us. </sentence><sentence id="1434">And we had to, well - we could have, if we wanted we could have eliminated him by - because of the lies, we could have infected him with typhus you know and he knew it and if he once he went to the hospital, you know, the doctors were all Polish or Jewish and Czechs or what and they were friends of ours, they would have taken care of him. </sentence><sentence id="1435">But he promised us, he cannot do it but he is not going to do any harm to us if we want to go in a different way. </sentence><sentence id="1436">He said to trust him and we did. </sentence><sentence id="1437">We did trust him and we had to change our plans, and then apparently, apparently somebody must have known that we were planning to escape, and then the other group came and they approached us with - we wouldn't go in a different way, and the different way was to acquire SS uniforms and take prisoners out to work outside the camp. </sentence><sentence id="1438">And that's how we started planning, and some of the people who were involved had connections. </sentence><sentence id="1439">One of the prisoners had connections with the people, because everywhere I worked were prisoners, everywhere. </sentence><sentence id="1440">Only the top authorities were the Germans, but otherwise, the inside organization of it was all, in the prisoners hands. </sentence><sentence id="1441">There were all in the offices, everything. </sentence><sentence id="1442">The whole evidence, everything, was kept by the prisoners. </sentence><sentence id="1443">Doctors, you know, everything. </sentence><sentence id="1444">So we decided that we do escape as SS guards and take four prisoners out to work, outside the camp. </sentence><sentence id="1445">And since my friend and myself spoke quite decent German, we were picked to be the SS people. </sentence><sentence id="1446">And then some of the friends who were involved had friends who worked in the storage rooms where they stored the SS uniforms and they were able to smuggle out of the storage rooms one pair of trousers and then second pair of trousers, and then one jacket and another one, then a cap, then second cap, then the belt, then second belt, and this was brought in and it was stored, you know, my friends who was supposed to change in the SS uniform with me who had a small studio. </sentence><sentence id="1447">He was a carver and a sculptor and he had a small studio, and he was not bothered by anybody, by the SS, because he worked for them. </sentence><sentence id="1448">He sculpted things for them for which they sometimes give him some bread and some sausage and, you know. </sentence><sentence id="1449">And they took these things and probably sold it or kept it, sent it to home. </sentence><sentence id="1450">So we stored it in his small studio, and then when the time came to escape, then we transferred it to the lumber yard. </sentence><sentence id="1451">Actually, it was not only a lumber yard but it was all the building materials were stored, in this place. </sentence><sentence id="1452">It was called Bowhov [?] </sentence><sentence id="1453">and in the barrack where the lumber was kept there were three friends of ours and they hid the uniforms there. </sentence><sentence id="1454">And these uniforms, they then put the insignia because we didn't want to go out as just ordinary SS men. </sentence><sentence id="1455">We wanted to go as NCOs in order that we were able to carry sidearms. </sentence><sentence id="1456">Of course, any SS man who was taking out people to work outside, you know, had to be armed. </sentence><sentence id="1457">Not only armed, had to have a special permit, but I'll come back later to it. </sentence><sentence id="1458">The arms of course, was an impossibility for us to obtain, but we again, had friends who worked in the saddlery that, you know, workshops, and we were able to obtain two holsters for which we then made dummy pistols out of wood. </sentence><sentence id="1459">Now, one of our friends knew somebody in the saddlery and he approached him with a concocted story that the chief of the carpenters and workshops, who was an SS man by the name of [fred Shiner [ph] had his birthday coming up, and his holster was rather This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="1460">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="1461"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection 5 shabby, and whether he wouldn't make a new holster for him. </sentence><sentence id="1462">The fellow said, yes. </sentence><sentence id="1463">Of course, everything was done for a piece of bread or piece of sausage if you could obtain it. </sentence><sentence id="1464">And he said, yes he will do it, but what size is the pistol? </sentence><sentence id="1465">We said, well, we can't ask him to give us the pistol so that you can make the holster we said the normal size, just make one. </sentence><sentence id="1466">So he said Okay, but don't blame me if it doesn't fit. </sentence><sentence id="1467">But of course that was the whole idea, that it wouldn't fit because we needed two. </sentence><sentence id="1468">So no matter what he do it wouldn't be the right size. </sentence><sentence id="1469">So he made this one holster, and we told him no, I'm sorry, it is too small. </sentence><sentence id="1470">Will you make a larger one? </sentence><sentence id="1471">Again, for a piece of bread. </sentence><sentence id="1472">So he made another one and then we had the two holsters, and as I said, for the two holsters, we sculptured and made dummy out of wood, dummy pistols. </sentence><sentence id="1473">The pistol's holsters were open in the back and of course, you could see, you know, whether there were a real pistol or not. </sentence><sentence id="1474">But since camp, especially in the winter, was rather damp place - Auschwitz was a damp place, so the SS always wrapped the back of the pistol in a dark cloth, black cloth, you know, piece of cloth so that you couldn't see from the back whether it was a real pistol or not. </sentence><sentence id="1475">So we did the same thing and nobody knew whether there was a real pistol or not. </sentence><sentence id="1476">Then the SS needed a pass to take prisoners out to work and the passes were issued by the issuing SS officer, and they were of different color for different days and again, one of our fellows who were escaping with us knew a fellow prisoner who worked in the printing office and the printer gave him some blank forms in different colors. </sentence><sentence id="1477">Now, the day we wanted to escape which was, matter of fact, it will be in six days. </sentence><sentence id="1478">It will be the 50" anniversary, on the 28 of September, 1944. </sentence><sentence id="1479">And when we came to issue this blanks - the colors was pale blue - and we looked through our blanks and we didn't have a pale blue. </sentence><sentence id="1480">The nearest to it was pale green and we said well we'll take the pale green. </sentence><sentence id="1481">We take a chance. </sentence><sentence id="1482">So I knew who the issuing officer was and I did it in my office. </sentence><sentence id="1483">Of course, we needed a stamp. </sentence><sentence id="1484">The stamp - again, the sculptor, the carver, he carved it out, the stamp out of a very soft wood and he made a very good facsimile of it, and I tested it on a piece of paper in my office on an ink pad and it came a very good facsimile. </sentence><sentence id="1485">So then I did fill out on the 28" I did fill out this pass and I signed, forged the name of the issuing officer who was the SS ? </sentence><sentence id="1486">De Fuhrer, Miller, signed his name, put the stamp, and in order that the stamp wouldn't be recognized, you know, I smudged it a little. </sentence><sentence id="1487">And then the prisoners themselves needed a permit from the workshop SS man and this was no problem because one of the escapees was a clerk in the office there, and he had blanks and he issued the blanks that four prisoners, glassers are going to work in this spot and he signed this SS man, forged his name. </sentence><sentence id="1488">So we had these two pieces of passes which we needed. </sentence><sentence id="1489">Then we obtained, because if we failed, we obtained some cyanide poison. </sentence><sentence id="1490">We obtained it from the pharmacy, the camp pharmacy, which again, was run by prisoners, and the prisoners who did run it was named Marion Dolinski [ph] and he was a very nice fellow and he gave us cyanide in the form of powder, which we put, wrapped in pieces of paper and each one of us had it with him. </sentence><sentence id="1491">So then, now, before that we already had contact with the underground, and we had the contact with the underground through a Polish girl who worked as a SS civilian cleaning woman in the barracks of the national labor social - NSDRP, I don't know what the - that's the acronym of the German Nazi party - and through her we contacted with the underground and the resistance movement. </sentence><sentence id="1492">And how we did contact her is that again, she was instructed to do some damage, either to the plumbing or to the electricity or something that broke down and that the workers had to come and to correct it. </sentence><sentence id="1493">And of course, whenever we needed This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="1494">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="1495"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection 6 something and there was a call, then this fellow who worked in the workshop office always assigned somebody, either himself to do it with another mechanic to go there or I went there, and he made the contact. </sentence><sentence id="1496">We exchanged the information with the girl and she took it to the - so with her we decided that we escape on the 28 of September 1944 and that - how do you say, the word you know, the recognition? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1607">Q: Password? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1609">A: Password will be a Polish carol, which the fellow who is going to meet us was supposed to whistle. </sentence><sentence id="1610">And the carol, Polish carol name was "" ? " </sentence><sentence id="1611">which means "They came to Bethlehem." </sentence><sentence id="1612">So then everything was ready for us to go, and since we didn't have the proper color pass we said that we will try to avoid going through the gates where the passes would be checked. </sentence><sentence id="1613">And we already surveyed it beforehand, that there to the buildings to which we had to go to do to put the panes in you know, the panes, the glasspanes in, was there was a shortcut which led under the tower of a guard. </sentence><sentence id="1614">And many workers pass this way many times and they were never stopped. </sentence><sentence id="1615">So we said that we will try to do the same things, and we had a lookout for us, a fellow prisoner, a very good friend of us who was looking at the place, and he was supposed to give us the sign you know whether it's okay or not okay. </sentence><sentence id="1616">Anyway, so when the day came and we decided to escape at noontime, it was the time when the SS, most of them went to the mess hall you know, for lunch and there wouldn't be too much of them moving around. </sentence><sentence id="1617">Because we had quite a distance to walk to meet our prisoners, you know, whom we were taking out to work and they were quite a distance away. </sentence><sentence id="1618">So when the day came at noontime, at one o'clock it so happened that the SS man who was in charge of me and the workshops came to my office, and he wanted something urgently done and it took sometime and I was delayed. </sentence><sentence id="1619">Eventually, he did leave and he went to lunch, and then I was able to leave and I went to meet my friend, the other one who was supposed to change into the SS clothes, and we went to the lumber yard. </sentence><sentence id="1620">Because in the meantime, we transferred it to the lumber yard, the uniforms, we went there and these people were quite worried that we were late, and they thought matter of fact that we won't show up at all. </sentence><sentence id="1621">But anyway we did come, and we changed into the uniforms you know and they inspected us. </sentence><sentence id="1622">They were supposed to then, after we were successful in escaping, they would burn our prison uniforms. </sentence><sentence id="1623">They inspected us and they looked out of the barrack whether the air was clear and they told us yes, and we walked out. </sentence><sentence id="1624">And as I said, we had to walk approximately some, almost half a mile and it was dangerous. </sentence><sentence id="1625">It was really dangerous because we were afraid that we could meet some SS people who would recognize us. </sentence><sentence id="1626">So it happened that we were lucky. </sentence><sentence id="1627">We didn't meet many prisoners who had to salute us the prescribed way and where they had to take off their cap and, you know, look at us, and one of the fellows recognized me because I met him later on, 1945, in Italy, and he said that I looked very pale. </sentence><sentence id="1628">Well, anyway so we came to the place where we were supposed to meet these prisoners whom we were taking out to work. </sentence><sentence id="1629">We told them to pick up their tools, the glass, and shouted the way the SS shouted at prisoners to pick up, and they picked up the glass and we walked towards the tower. </sentence><sentence id="1630">And there our lookout gave us the sign that everything is clear, that we can go and we went. </sentence><sentence id="1631">We went it was a narrow pass leading under the tower and the guard on the tower with the machine gun, seeing our insignia, you know, shouted Hail Hitler to us and we shouted This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="1632">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="1633"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection 7 back, Hail Hitler. </sentence><sentence id="1634">And we said, what a beautiful day it is, in German. </sentence><sentence id="1635">And he said, yes, it's a nice day. </sentence><sentence id="1636">And we went, we passed. </sentence><sentence id="1637">We had to come to the main road and on the main road as we were maybe some 50 or 40 yards away, there were always roving patrols would check, you know, the SS and the prisoners who worked outside the big chain of guards and as we were approaching this road on the bicycle was an SS man, a Sergeant SS man on the bicycle and he was looking in our direction, and he was unable to make up his mind whether to stop and check us out or whether to go on. </sentence><sentence id="1638">Anyway, he almost stopped on the bike and finally, he decided to go and he went on. </sentence><sentence id="1639">And we didn't know what we would do, but between ourselves we said if he does check out and he finds out we have the wrong passes, we either have to kill him or take him with us and hoping he wouldn't make to much noise. </sentence><sentence id="1640">Anyway, he did go on so we came to the road. </sentence><sentence id="1641">As we came to the road, going away from us was a whole company of SS going to the firing range. </sentence><sentence id="1642">So they must have passed only a few minutes before we got there - so we crossed the road. </sentence><sentence id="1643">We went into the houses. </sentence><sentence id="1644">There were new houses being built for the SS and they had to be, you know, the panes had be put into the frames of the window frames. </sentence><sentence id="1645">It's not like here where the whole window comes with glass and everything's there, you just put first the frame and then you have to put the window. </sentence><sentence id="1646">So we went into the house looked around. </sentence><sentence id="1647">Nobody was there. </sentence><sentence id="1648">We went to the other side of the house and looked around. </sentence><sentence id="1649">Nobody there, and we walked because they were open fields and the fields led to the river, the River Soya [ph] which floats near and through Auschwitz city, the city of Auschwitz. </sentence><sentence id="1650">We came to the river. </sentence><sentence id="1651">Near the river the vegetation was quite lush and in the brushes the glassers, you know, took off the heavy panes off their backs ad the other tools and we dumped
