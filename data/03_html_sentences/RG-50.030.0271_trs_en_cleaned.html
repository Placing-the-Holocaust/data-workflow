<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="7">Q: Tell me a little tiny bit about your childhood. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="9">A: Well, I went to school in my hometown and I finished, graduated from the high school which we called gymnasium, and after the graduation I enlisted into the School of Foreign Trade in Warsaw. </sentence><sentence id="10">And in 1938 I was called up to the Polish Army and as a graduate of gymnasium I only had to serve one year, and you served in cadet officers school, reserve cadet officers school, which I did. </sentence><sentence id="11">And I was supposed to be released in October 1939 and as you probably know the war started on September 1, "39 and I took part in the fighting. </sentence><sentence id="12">I was assigned to a unit of antitank artillery and I took part in the defense of Warsaw, and on September 27 Warsaw surrendered, and I was taken as a prisoner of war and taken out first, out of Warsaw on the 28 of September to the west, and near a small town of Prostejov where we were kept, you know, thousands of soldiers in an open field and meadows and then divided in four groups; south, north, east and west, and since I came from the north I went to the north group, and we were loaded then on tanks and taken to the north, and we came to the town of Torun, which is a town some 40 miles south of my hometown, and there we were taken and unloaded and then taken to the other side of the Vistul </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="13">A: We came, arrived at the western part of the Vistula River and the two bridges which were across the Vistula were both damaged, and we had to walk single file to across the other side of the river. </sentence><sentence id="14">And there we were again assembled and we were supposed to go to the citadel where they told us that we were only go to stay overnight and the next morning they were going to release us. </sentence><sentence id="15">Of course, I realized that this was a lie, as most of the things they told us, and I, myself, separated myself from -- I asked the guard if I could go to the toilet because we were near the station in Torun and he said yes. </sentence><sentence id="16">I went to the toilet and I didn't return to it. </sentence><sentence id="17">He saw me going away and he said, where are you going? </sentence><sentence id="18">And I said, well, my troops assemble at the other part of the station and I have to -- and I think he realized that I was running away but he let me go. </sentence><sentence id="19">So I went to the other station, and there quite accidently I met my cousin, who never did serve in the Armed Forces, but he was in a uniform, a soldiers uniform and we got together, and somehow he was able to secure some blank forms which were given to people who considered themselves of German origin, and they were issued these passes and he had the blank forms. </sentence><sentence id="20">So we filled them out with our names and signed some fictitious names to it. </sentence><sentence id="21">Of course, we didn't have any stamps. </sentence><sentence id="22">Anyway, we boarded the train to our hometown and we arrived around midnight in my hometown, and at the exit all the passes were checked and there were the SS people and the SR people and the Armed Forces people, and when they looked at our passes they told us to step aside. </sentence><sentence id="23">We stepped aside and then they gathered us. </sentence><sentence id="24">I think there were 11 of us or so and they said, well, again you have to go to the citadel overnight and then in the morning we going to release you. </sentence><sentence id="25">Of course, we knew better than that. </sentence><sentence id="26">So they marched us from the station, and my cousin was an owner of a lumber yard and we had to pass near the lumber yard, and he told the guard -- we were in the last row and he told, he looked, still my name on the -- my firm name, and why do you want me to go to the citadel for the night if I could sleep at home? </sentence><sentence id="27">And he said, all right. </sentence><sentence id="28">Go ahead. </sentence><sentence id="29">And then I told him, well, it's my cousin, can I stay with him there too?And he said already, go. </sentence><sentence id="30">And we went and that's how we got away from being prisoner of war and spending the rest of the war. </sentence><sentence id="31">So I stayed overnight and the next morning I went home and-- </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="53">Q: Let's back up. </sentence><sentence id="54">Why do you think he did that? </sentence><sentence id="55">Why do you think he let you go? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="59">A: Well, I suppose because first of all we spoke German to him. </sentence><sentence id="60">We both did speak German and we more or less pleaded and -- I don't know who the man was. </sentence><sentence id="61">Maybe he was a local man. </sentence><sentence id="62">Maybe he knew us or at least he knew my cousin. </sentence><sentence id="63">Anyway, it seems that well he had some kind of feeling that he let us go. </sentence><sentence id="64">I don't know and I don't know who he was or what. </sentence><sentence id="65">But anyway, he did let us go. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="73">Q: And one other question was that whole period -- what was it like? </sentence><sentence id="74">Was it very disorganized? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="77">A: Well no, no, it was not. </sentence><sentence id="78">The Germans were not disorganized. </sentence><sentence id="79">It was very -- the terror was right from the first day, the Germans came, they started terrorizing people. </sentence><sentence id="80">Matter of fact, some of my relatives who belonged to organizations which the German thought were unfriendly to them, they were arrested right on the spot and taken into the forest and shot on the spot and all trace disappeared. </sentence><sentence id="81">So the terror was there right from the first day of occupation. </sentence><sentence id="82">And why he did this I couldn't tell. </sentence><sentence id="83">Well, I can go further, and that was when I came home. </sentence><sentence id="84">It was in October in "39, and I think after three weeks I was arrested. </sentence><sentence id="85">Not myself, with some other friends of mine, students. </sentence><sentence id="86">I was arrested by the local Germans who formed special units, protective units. </sentence><sentence id="87">They called -- the German name was and they wore armbands, green armbands and with black lettering saying and they were looking Germans because my town had approximately 10 percent of the German population, and I was arrested just when we were visiting a friend and as we walked out of his apartment they were in the hallway and they arrested us, two of them. </sentence><sentence id="88">Matter of fact, I knew one of the German. </sentence><sentence id="89">He was a young man also, attending the yimnasium(ph) in my hometown. </sentence><sentence id="90">There were two . </sentence><sentence id="91">There were two yimnasium(ph), you know high schools, German high schools. </sentence><sentence id="92">One was in my hometown and the other one was in southern Poland in Silesi </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="93">A: I don't know exactly which town but I think it was Bitum(ph) and, so he was, you know, a student at the high school and became this and, he arrested us and we were taken to a place as hostages. </sentence><sentence id="94">We were kept in a huge hall and there were no beds. </sentence><sentence id="95">It was only </sentence></p><p><sentence id="96"> straw on the sides of the room on which we for the night spread, and we had to lay on this straw. </sentence><sentence id="97">We had no blankets or anything. </sentence><sentence id="98">We were allowed, after a few days, we were allowed to contact our parents and our families and they could deliver to us food, because they didn't supply any food. </sentence><sentence id="99">I stayed there for three weeks and only because a friend of mine who knew -- who had a German friend who was associated with some German organization. </sentence><sentence id="100">Matter of fact, he studied journalism in Germany in Berlin and, after he finished his studies he became a member of the propaganda ministry propaganda ministry, and his parents lived in my hometown and he was visiting at the time. </sentence><sentence id="101">And my parents asked him if he could get in touch with this friend of his, whether he can get me released. </sentence><sentence id="102">So they did one night. </sentence><sentence id="103">I think at midnight they called me into a small room where there was three Germans. </sentence><sentence id="104">There was one in charge of this camp, hostage camp. </sentence><sentence id="105">He was a local veterinarian doctor, German. </sentence><sentence id="106">Then some other person which | didn't know and this friend of his, of my friend whom I knew only from sight. </sentence><sentence id="107">And they interrogated me and, you know, what I was doing and what I intend to do. </sentence><sentence id="108">And I said, well, I don't know, the war -- they said, we're going to release you but under the condition that you have to leave these territories. </sentence><sentence id="109">These territories which we lived, you know, were the western and north territories. </sentence><sentence id="110">We are right away incorporated right in into the German Reich. </sentence><sentence id="111">They considered these lands as purely German. </sentence><sentence id="112">So they said you cannot live here. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="113">You have to go to the part of Poland which was not incorporated into Germany but which was formed as what they call it, General Government, and government general of this territory was Hans Frank(ph) who was later on, you know, at the Nuremberg Trials was convicted, you know, to death and was hung. </sentence><sentence id="114">And the territory encompassed both Warsaw and Kokov(ph) and Lublin. </sentence><sentence id="115">It was the center of Poland and they said, you cannot stay here. </sentence><sentence id="116">And then this veterinarian -- I remember his name. </sentence><sentence id="117">It was Grahams(ph) and he said, how long do you need to liquidate your things here? </sentence><sentence id="118">I said, well, three weeks. </sentence><sentence id="119">He said, you're crazy. </sentence><sentence id="120">You don't need three weeks. </sentence><sentence id="121">We want you out of here in a week. </sentence><sentence id="122">So I said, of course, I agreed. </sentence><sentence id="123">I would even go in one day. </sentence><sentence id="124">And so they told me -- they released me. </sentence><sentence id="125">I walked out of the room and this friend of my friend, his name was Lukow, I forgot his first name, he was a doctor of journalism. </sentence><sentence id="126">Anyway, he walked out with me and he started speaking, and because he spoke Polish and he started speaking to me in Polish. </sentence><sentence id="127">He said, look, it's only, you know, you don't have to leave. </sentence><sentence id="128">You can stay here. </sentence><sentence id="129">This Dr. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="130">Grahams(ph) said you have to but I can tell you you don't have to leave. </sentence><sentence id="131">You can stay here. </sentence><sentence id="132">And so I thanked him very much and I when back to the cell, and the next morning I was supposed to be released and the next morning came and nothing. </sentence><sentence id="133">They called some other names of other people released but not my name. </sentence><sentence id="134">So I went to the door and told the guard and said that my name was, shows supposed to be called. </sentence><sentence id="135">And he went back to the office and after a while they did call my name and I was released. </sentence><sentence id="136">But while I was there in prison one day they called ten names of ten hostages, and they took -- they were taken away and then they were publicly shot in the town square. </sentence><sentence id="137">Today there's a monument remembering this, you know, they were innocent people that didn't do anything wrong. </sentence><sentence id="138">I knew some of them. </sentence><sentence id="139">For no reason whatsoever they were shot publicly. </sentence><sentence id="140">And after I was released, I think I didn't even wait a week, and again was my cousin because his property was taken away, you know, the fellow who had the lumber yard. </sentence><sentence id="141">It was confiscated and a German owner was put in his place, and he didn't feel secure and we both left and we </sentence></p><p><sentence id="142"> went to Warsaw. </sentence><sentence id="143">And of course, I didn't have much means, you know, of supporting myself. </sentence><sentence id="144">My cousin being in the business, you know, had some savings and we lived together in Warsaw for time being. </sentence><sentence id="145">In the meantime, he was trying to recover his property which he eventually didn't recover but they permitted him to go back, and he could run it because, you know, he knew how to run the business, and apparently the owner or the, what they called troyhander (ph) it means a man of who was, can't find the proper name of it, but anyway, somebody who was taking his, you know, and running the business apparently didn't do a good job, and he was eventually able to get the job back, not as an owner but as a manager, and he went back and I stayed in Warsaw. </sentence><sentence id="146">In the meantime, I did join, you know, the underground movement. </sentence><sentence id="147">It started -- the first organization was called Zydowska Organizacja Bojow </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="148">A: ZWZ was the abbreviation, which later became the Home Army. </sentence><sentence id="149">The Army of Kroiova(ph), which was the army which was supported by the legitimate government, which was at that time was already in London, and I was arrested on the 31 of October 1940. </sentence><sentence id="150">At that time -- </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="154">Q: Before you go to that -- how did you find out about the underground movement? </sentence><sentence id="155">Tell me a little bit more about that. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="158">A: Well, I had a friend -- a friend who his name was Tobulsky(ph). </sentence><sentence id="159">That's also was one reason why I was arrested, and he was also from my hometown in Grujand and, he was involved in an organization which was formed by one also a student in my hometown which he joined. </sentence><sentence id="160">I didn't join because I wasn't there already, and they joined this organization and he wasn't caught, but the principal of the organization was caught, and he was tried and then convicted, you know, and sentenced to death. </sentence><sentence id="161">And he was executed in Poz -- which was another quite a big city which was incorporated in Germany. </sentence><sentence id="162">And the executioned at that time was my -- he was -- they chopped you know his head off with an axe. </sentence><sentence id="163">He was axed, and this friend of mine, since he escaped and he came to the General Government to Warsaw, was tried in that and he was also sentenced to death. </sentence><sentence id="164">And he already had connections with the underground and he contacted me and we got together, and he had -- he knew a captain of the Polish Armed Forces, prewar, who was member of the organization, and he swore me in as a member. </sentence><sentence id="165">And I myself, don't think that I was arrested for that because I don't think they knew about it. </sentence><sentence id="166">But they knew that I knew this friend of mine and since he had a sentence, a death sentence hanging over his head. </sentence><sentence id="167">Apparently, they were following him because when they arrested me they came to my -- they arrested me at three o'clock in the morning on October 31, 1940. </sentence><sentence id="168">I was asleep. </sentence><sentence id="169">Thad a small bachelor's apartment, one room and kitchen and bathroom, and in the night, you know, I heard tremendous knocking at the door, kicking at door, and I looked through the window and I saw three people. </sentence><sentence id="170">And one was in a Gestapo uniform and the other two were in civilian clothes and they were shouting to open the door immediately. </sentence><sentence id="171">So I opened the door and they pushed me aside. </sentence><sentence id="172">They came with drawn revolvers and they push me aside, and one went to the kitchen and one went to the bathroom and the other to the room, and they were looking around. </sentence><sentence id="173">They were looking for they said leaflets you know and for arms. </sentence><sentence id="174">Well, they didn't find it either because I didn't keep anything at home. </sentence><sentence id="175">Anyway, then they started asking me questions and one question was that your friend was here with you yesterday. </sentence><sentence id="176">And they -- apparently he changed his name and he failed to tell me about it. </sentence><sentence id="177">I knew him only by his new name, and so when they asked me was Tobulksy (ph) you know that was his assumed name, I said no, so they hit me. </sentence><sentence id="178">You know, you can see it here on the movies you know with the hand across there. </sentence><sentence id="179">Hit me right in my temple and I fell to the floor, and as I fell to the floor, they started, the three of them started kicking me and I said -- I remember the only person who visited me was this young Tobulsky and I told them his real name. </sentence><sentence id="180">Apparently, they knew this and they stopped beating me, I got up, and after a while they had a small conference between the three of them and then they came back and said, you better get dressed and you will go with us. </sentence><sentence id="181">So I got dressed and then they took me out, and the two of them held me by the cuffs of my jacket and they walked on both sides. </sentence><sentence id="182">And this one in the uniform drew his revolver and walked behind me, and he told me, don't try anything because I'm going to shoot you. </sentence><sentence id="183">So they took me down through the street and there was a car waiting, Mercedes -- they only drove Mercedes -- and they opened the door, and as they opened the door I saw another friend of mine sitting there, and he said, oh, you know each other. </sentence><sentence id="184">And I said, yes, I do, and they told me to get in. </sentence><sentence id="185">And one of the SS sat between the two of us and their chauffeur. </sentence><sentence id="186">They drove me to the prison, prison Pawiak in Warsaw, and then approximately, already ten people from other prisoners, and they were registered and then taken -- I was taken to a single cell in the basement and there was no -- it was only a small bulb. </sentence><sentence id="187">There was no furniture. </sentence><sentence id="188">There was no window there. </sentence><sentence id="189">It was a dirt floor, and the walls were dripping with water, and there was only a pail which you used as a toilet. </sentence><sentence id="190">And when I came there I didn't really know what happened. </sentence><sentence id="191">After a while a guard came and took me out and into the yard and to the showers. </sentence><sentence id="192">I had to undress and my clothes were disinfected and I had to shower. </sentence><sentence id="193">And then after the clothes came back, my suit and so on, was all trampled they took me -- the guard took me to the first -- no, second floor of the prison and took me to a cell. </sentence><sentence id="194">I don't remember the number of the cell. </sentence><sentence id="195">Anyway, the cells were small. </sentence><sentence id="196">They were maybe seven feet wide and ten feet long, and there were already nine prisoners. </sentence><sentence id="197">Which means, there were ten of us. </sentence><sentence id="198">There was no bunk or anything. </sentence><sentence id="199">We had to lie on the floor. </sentence><sentence id="200">Again, there was no furniture whatsoever except the pail where we could relieve ourselves. </sentence><sentence id="201">We were only taken in the morning to the toilets where we could wash a little, and I think in the afternoon once and in the evening, and the rest we had to spend in the cells. </sentence><sentence id="202">At that time there were Polish guards, you know, prewar Polish guards as were as Germans, SS people, and some of the Polish guards were very friendly and pleasant and helpful. </sentence><sentence id="203">Some were not so helpful. </sentence><sentence id="204">Anyway, one of the guards in my -- I don't know how he found out -- but he found out that I do speak German, and one day he asked me -- apparently he was living in a house which was Jewish-owned house, and it was requisitioned by the government and the Germans and apparently, whoever took over from the Germans wanted to increase his rent and he asked me, he said, on the salary which they pay me, I won't be able to pay the rent for it. </sentence><sentence id="205">And he asked me if I could write a -- how do you say -- an application to the authorities, you know, whereby they wouldn't increase his rent. </sentence><sentence id="206">So I did. </sentence><sentence id="207">He took me to the office and I did write the letter, and after a few weeks he got a reply. </sentence><sentence id="208">And they didn't increase -- not only didn't they increase. </sentence><sentence id="209">Matter of fact, they reduced his rent. </sentence><sentence id="210">So he was very appreciative and he said what can I do for you, and of course, I wanted to tell him, let me go free from the prison, but he said, what I can do for you, I can take you out of the cell. </sentence><sentence id="211">Since you do speak German you can be an interpreter, and he took me to another part of the prison to another ward which was served only by German guard. </sentence><sentence id="212">And there I became an interpreter to this German guard, and of course, my life was a little easier because I was with four other prisoners in one cell and we also had bunks. </sentence><sentence id="213">I didn't have to sleep on the floor. </sentence><sentence id="214">And two of the prisoners, who lived also in this cell, they worked in the prison kitchen and as such they were able to -- well, they had more food but they were not allowed -- they couldn't and they were afraid to bring any food, but what they did bring they brought always in the evening to the cell, whole pot of coffee. </sentence><sentence id="215">And the coffee was so sweet. </sentence><sentence id="216">They probably put pounds of sugar in it. </sentence><sentence id="217">So we drank this coffee, this sweet coffee, which was not real coffee because the Germans, they wouldn't give the prisoners. </sentence><sentence id="218">It was such a good coffee. </sentence><sentence id="219">Anyway, it looked like coffee and the sugar of course was very important. </sentence><sentence id="220">So I felt I could move free because they didn't close the cell, and whenever the guard needed me to translate. </sentence><sentence id="221">And so I did translate and in the meantime, I was taking for interrogation. </sentence><sentence id="222">You were interrogated in the headquarters of the Gestapo which was in the central part of Warsaw, and you were taken there by a truck. </sentence><sentence id="223">And the guards were in the truck as well, as motorcycle guards as well as going behind the truck and when you came to the Gestapo headquarters, which were now located in the prewar Polish Educational Ministry, and one of the wings was converted. </sentence><sentence id="224">The southern wing was converted into cells where the prisoners, before they went for interrogation, were taken. </sentence><sentence id="225">There were ten individual cells and four, I believe four, common cells and the common cells, we -- the prisoners called them trams because they were single seats on each side of the cell, and in the middle there was a walking path and you had to sit facing the wall and you were not allowed to look around or you couldn't talk to you, and the guard was behind you and if he heard you talk or move your head, he came and hit you over the head. </sentence><sentence id="226">And you sat there motionless. </sentence><sentence id="227">You didn't get any food or anything to drink, and they called when the interrogating officer called. </sentence><sentence id="228">A guard came and took you up to the room. </sentence><sentence id="229">I was taken to the room, and in the room there were this interrogating officer who was now in uniform. </sentence><sentence id="230">When he arrested me, he was one arresting, he was in civilian clothes. </sentence><sentence id="231">He was an officer of the Gestapo. </sentence><sentence id="232">And there was a typist, a girl and interpreter. </sentence><sentence id="233">Since he knew -- the interrogating officer knew that I spoke German -- he was very rude matter of fact, to the interpreter. </sentence><sentence id="234">He told him get lost, you know, he speaks German, so we don't need you here. </sentence><sentence id="235">And then he started interrogating, questioning. </sentence><sentence id="236">Actually, they didn't have anything, you know, which they could hang on me. </sentence><sentence id="237">They didn't find any leaflet. </sentence><sentence id="238">They didn't find anything and I didn't admit that I was a member of the resistance movement and they didn't know that. </sentence><sentence id="239">The only thing they were about was a friend of mine and again, as I told them when they first arrested me. </sentence><sentence id="240">And so it was typed and then the typed report was given to me for reading. </sentence><sentence id="241">I read it through and then I had to sign it. </sentence><sentence id="242">I did sign it. </sentence><sentence id="243">Frankly, it was not incriminating to me at all except that I knew this fellow, and then he called the guard and the guard took me again down to the cellar into this common cells and I had to sit until all the prisoners were interrogated. </sentence><sentence id="244">Sometimes, the interrogation went deep into the night and sometimes until the next morning of the other prisoners, and you had to sit there until they took you back or they loaded you back into the truck and then they took you to the prison. </sentence><sentence id="245">So I was taken in the late afternoon back to the prison. </sentence><sentence id="246">In the meantime, you missed your food. </sentence><sentence id="247">You didn't get any food in the prison. </sentence><sentence id="248">The food was meager as it was but anyway, I still didn't get anything that day to eat. </sentence><sentence id="249">I can tell you one incident when I was awakened in the middle of the night by a Gestapo man. </sentence><sentence id="250">They came to our ward and they woke me up, and I had to interpret and they called 20 names out of different cells. </sentence><sentence id="251">And these were hostages and I think some of them knew what the fate which they faced. </sentence><sentence id="252">Most of them were very well educated. </sentence><sentence id="253">Some were professors of the Warsaw University. </sentence><sentence id="254">Some were engineers and only one, I remember, was a criminal prisoner, and all of them behaved with tremendous dignity. </sentence><sentence id="255">They didn't plead or beg or anything except this criminal prisoner. </sentence><sentence id="256">He fell to the floor and begged to the SS man, kissed his boots, you know that, to spare him. </sentence><sentence id="257">Of course, they wouldn't have anything of it. </sentence><sentence id="258">And I had to interpret and they were taken, and they were taken outside to Warsaw and shot as hostages. </sentence><sentence id="259">So thats the one experience I had in prison. </sentence><sentence id="260">I spent five months in the prison in Pawiak prison. </sentence><sentence id="261">During that time I had a girlfriend whom I left who of course, was not arrested -- and somehow she managed to send me a parcel, and how I knew that the parcel was from her because I couldn't communicate. </sentence><sentence id="262">You couldn't write any letters or anything like this. </sentence><sentence id="263">You could only send letters if a guard would take them on the sly, but otherwise there was no, no possibility of communicating. </sentence><sentence id="264">But I know that this what is from my girlfriend because she send me also a small pillow, and I recognized the pillow that it was from her, and she sent me some food. </sentence><sentence id="265">But the food was always shared with others and before it came to you it was -- the parcel was very skimpy -- but anyway, it was a sign that somebody did think about you. </sentence><sentence id="266">And as I said, I was five months and on April the 4, 1941, in the afternoon the whole prison population was called out in into the yard, and there were already tables set up and the Gestapo people were there with lists and they called the names of different prisoners. </sentence><sentence id="267">And once your name was called you had to go to a different part of the yard and stand, and my name was called too and I had to go, and those prisoners whose names were not called were then taken back to the cells. </sentence><sentence id="268">The prisoner -- I think the capacity of the prison was around 800 prisoners but there were approximately over 2000 or even more. </sentence><sentence id="269">And they were preparing a transport and the transport was over a thousand prisoners. </sentence><sentence id="270">So after we -- the prisoners whose names were not called went back into the cells, then they issued us I think -- I don't remember exactly but I think half a loaf of bread -- and we knew that we were going into transport. </sentence><sentence id="271">Of course, we didn't know where but the word already was spreading in Warsaw and in the prison that there was a camp, concentration camp by the name, Polish name, Oswiecim, in German Auschwitz. </sentence><sentence id="272">And everybody dreaded it because the word was that it was an extermination camp, and we all prayed that we are not going to that camp. </sentence><sentence id="273">In the evening the big trucks arrived. </sentence><sentence id="274">SS with SS guards and also Warsaw municipal buses arrived, and we were loaded into these buses. </sentence><sentence id="275">And we were loaded with shouts and with beatings. </sentence><sentence id="276">It was, you know, the SS people with bats, you know, and with bull whips, beating us, and we had to run into the trucks and the buses and then taken to the western part of Warsaw, the western railroad station. </sentence><sentence id="277">There again were on the ramp, we were loaded into the cattle cars. </sentence><sentence id="278">Again, with beatings and shouts, dogs, and I don't remember how many prisoners to a cattle car but there was standing room only and again, there was no water. </sentence><sentence id="279">The only thing was a big drum which served as a toilet, and then probably around midnight they locked the doors and the train moved. </sentence><sentence id="280">Of course, we didn't know where we were going. </sentence><sentence id="281">Anyway, the next morning we arrived somewhere at a siding, and we heard some voices, shouts, and barking, dogs barking, and then the doors were opened and with shouts we were driven out of the car. </sentence><sentence id="282">You had to jump out. </sentence><sentence id="283">There was no ramp, and we were put into formation in rows of five prisoners and twenty rows to -- . </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="416">A: Yes, the Jewish ghetto was started sometime in 1940 and, you know, prewar there was a Jewish quarters in Warsaw. </sentence><sentence id="417">There was no ghetto. </sentence><sentence id="418">People could go freely but most of the Jews concentrated you know, in one section and it was called the Main Street. </sentence><sentence id="419">There was Naleverky(ph). </sentence><sentence id="420">Matter of fact, the prison Pawiak was right in the middle of the ghetto and the ghetto was formed, I think, I don't know exactly what month, but in 1940. </sentence><sentence id="421">And at that time Jews -- there were orders given that all Jews, you know, had to go and register to go to the ghetto. </sentence><sentence id="422">Now, many Jews didn't. </sentence><sentence id="423">They also were by law had to wear armbands with the Star of David, and I don't think they in Warsaw they didn't wear any Star of David on their jackets, but they had to have an armband with a Star of David. </sentence><sentence id="424">A blue Star of David as far as I remember and now those who didn't wear it, you know, could hide. </sentence><sentence id="425">They just didn't wear it. </sentence><sentence id="426">Now It's true that some of them were betrayed and they went to -- they had to go into the ghetto. </sentence><sentence id="427">But the ghetto now there were gates and you couldn't go to the ghetto yourself. </sentence><sentence id="428">Nobody could. </sentence><sentence id="429">I think you had to have a special permit. </sentence><sentence id="430">I never did. </sentence><sentence id="431">And through the ghetto, for instance, there were trams, you know, streetcars going through it but they were separated. </sentence><sentence id="432">They were, for instance, the streetcar trucks separated one part of the ghetto from the other one, and in order from one part to go to it, there were bridges built just provisional bridges made out of wood, wooden bridges where the Jews could go through one part to another part, and I think they could move around in the ghetto freely. </sentence><sentence id="433">So that as much as I remember about the ghetto. </sentence></p></dialogue>

</sentence><sentence id="488">Whether it is okay for me to take? </sentence><sentence id="489">Because I mean I had to live and I didn't have any other means. </sentence><sentence id="490">So they said yes, that is okay. </sentence><sentence id="491">You can administer. </sentence><sentence id="492">So I took the job and I administered these six houses, and there was the house where I lived there and the next few houses. </sentence><sentence id="493">And later on the doctor got in touch with me and he said, you know what, he said, the German authorities want me to take under administration 10,000 houses of Jewish, confiscated Jewish property because most -- well, most, I don't know whether most, but many of the houses were owned -- apartment houses were owned by Jews -- and he said they were all confiscated and they had to be administered and he said, what do you think?

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="645">A: Well, when they opened the cattle car it was now April the 5, 1941. </sentence><sentence id="646">We were driven out of the cattle cars and put in rows of five and twenty rows of five made a hundred prisoners, and the next hundred and so on. </sentence><sentence id="647">And then we were surrounded by the guards and with the dogs and marched. </sentence><sentence id="648">We marched maybe 15, 20 minutes and then we came to a gate. </sentence><sentence id="649">Of course, we still didn't know where we were. </sentence><sentence id="650">We came to a gate and on top of the gate there was a sign which read " ", which means, "Work will make you free". </sentence></p><p><sentence id="651">And on the side later on we found out it was the guardhouse on the side, there was a sign which read KL Auschwitz. " </sentence><sentence id="652">KL" stands for concentration-slager (ph) Auschwitz, and then of course, we knew we were in Auschwitz, the place we dreaded most. </sentence><sentence id="653">And they opened the gate, we marched in and we were met by some, as I said, sinister looking characters, you know, in navy caps, something like marines, I mean sailors ware and navy blue jackets and stripe trousers with high boots. </sentence><sentence id="654">Later on we found out that this was the German Elderstedt(ph) which means he was camp senior and he was a German criminal prisoner and his name was number one. </sentence><sentence id="655">His name as I mentioned before was Bruno Brounee(ph). </sentence><sentence id="656">He wore a yellow armband with black lettering on which is it says, - ---Elderstedt, and then there was some other, you know, prisoners in striped uniforms with armbands. </sentence><sentence id="657">Some had block elderstedt which means block senior, and we were marched to the showers. </sentence><sentence id="658">There we had to undress and we were shaved all over our bodies including our heads, and then we had to go into a tank which was full of some chemicals, disinfectants, we had to submerge in it, and then from there we went to the showers and we had to wash, and when we came out of the showers, we had to put our civilian clothes, because when we came from the prison we were still in civilian clothes. </sentence><sentence id="659">We had to -- it was packed in a bag, in a paper bag with our number. </sentence><sentence id="660">Of course, we didn't have the number then but after the showers then we were issued prison uniforms. </sentence><sentence id="661">We got long underwear, striped, you know, blue and white stripes but very, very narrow underwear, and then we received striped, one-inch white striped, white and blue trousers and jackets and a cap, also striped. </sentence><sentence id="662">Then we were issued to swatches of white cloth with a number. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="663">My number was 13390 and two red triangles. </sentence><sentence id="664">A red triangle indicated that we were political prisoners, and these, these numbers and the triangles we later on had to sew on our jackets on the left hand side of the jacket, the triangle first, and underneath the number and on the right hand side of the trouser leg. </sentence><sentence id="665">Again, the triangle at the top and the number at the bottom, and the numbers were assigned also to the our civilian clothes which we had to pack in a bag which was then stored in a special storage rooms. </sentence><sentence id="666">And then again, we were put -- I don't know, with a 100 or 50 or what, and we were taken over by a block elderstedt, it means a block senior. </sentence><sentence id="667">And the block senior walked us to the block and we were assigned to block. </sentence><sentence id="668">I remember my block assignment was number seven, and at that time the numbering changed constantly because the camp was in constant construction. </sentence><sentence id="669">You know, the camp was the former barracks of a Polish artillery unit, prewar artillery unit, and this sight was chosen, you know, for the camp. </sentence><sentence id="670">And this </sentence></p><p><sentence id="671"> block number seven was a one-story brick building and the block elder, his name was -- well, I don't know his name but he was called "Bloody Alloys". </sentence><sentence id="672">His first name was Alloys, "Bloody Alloys". </sentence><sentence id="673">He wore also a red triangle and he came from Sacknow(ph). </sentence><sentence id="674">He was a German apparently, a German Communist but he was the most brutal person one can imagine. </sentence><sentence id="675">To kill for him, a prisoner didn't mean anything and that's why he was called "Bloody Alloys", and we were taken to this block and I was assigned to -- there were only four rooms on this block and this huge room, I don't know the size, but probably maybe 50 feet by 20 or so, a huge room and in charge of each room was a room elder, and most of them were already Polish prisoners. </sentence><sentence id="676">The block elder were all Germans and I was assigned to this room, and he was a Polish fellow, I forgot his name, and we had -- there were no beds. </sentence><sentence id="677">There was only in one part of the room there was a pile of straw and next to it were few blankets and in the night the straw was spread over the whole floor of the room and we had to lie there, one next to another in many rows, and we had the blankets one blanket maybe for three prisoners. </sentence><sentence id="678">And in the morning we were -- well, the day started, you know, at dawn to dusk, and even before the dawn we had to get up and we had to run out of the block in front of the block. </sentence><sentence id="679">There were small pails, wooden pails of water and everybody had to wash in this water. </sentence><sentence id="680">You know, maybe 10, 20 prisoners washed in the same water. </sentence><sentence id="681">You just splashed your -- there was no means of cleaning your teeth or anything like that. </sentence><sentence id="682">And then you got in the morning, you got half a liter of some liquid which they called either coffee or te </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="683">A: It looked, maybe it had the color of coffee or the color of tea but it was some substitute. </sentence><sentence id="684">That's all you got in the morning. </sentence><sentence id="685">Then you went to work and there were three roll calls at that time I came, three roll calls of the prisoners a day. </sentence><sentence id="686">One was in the morning and one was at noontime and one was in the evening. </sentence><sentence id="687">After the morning tea you went to work. </sentence><sentence id="688">Those like myself, when I first came, were assigned of course, to the worst possible jobs. </sentence><sentence id="689">You know, you had to dig for the foundations. </sentence><sentence id="690">I myself had to carry the wheelbarrows full of earth some 300 yards away. </sentence><sentence id="691">And all the work had to be done on the double, and you had to run with it, and while you were running with this wheelbarrow you were shouted at and beaten and then you had to come back and get another load. </sentence><sentence id="692">And again, you know, and the foremens they were mostly all Germans at that time and they beat you for no reason whatsoever. </sentence><sentence id="693">And of course, doing such exhaustive work, you just couldn't do it you know for long. </sentence><sentence id="694">At one time I was also assigned to a lumber yard where I had to chop wood and saw wood and you were exposed to the elements, whether rain or shine you know, snow or not, you know. </sentence><sentence id="695">You just had to work. </sentence><sentence id="696">Now, at noontime we did get a liter of soup and the soup was watery soup. </sentence><sentence id="697">Mostly, I remember for a long time we had nothing but turnip soup and very seldom did you see a piece of potato and not to mention meat or anything like that. </sentence><sentence id="698">And in the evening we received one third of a loaf of bread, dark bread, and we received a small cube of margarine, you know, the size which you get in the restaurant sometimes. </sentence><sentence id="699">We also got a slice maybe a quarter of an inch wide slice of sausage, you know, second quality sausage and a teaspoon of substitute marmalade and also this coffee or tea or whatever they called, and that was our food for the day. </sentence><sentence id="700">I don't know how many calories it was, but it was starvation, rations. </sentence><sentence id="701">And I myself always ate the bread and I never saved it for the morning because many times, prisoners who did save, their bread was stolen and then they didn't have anything. </sentence><sentence id="702">So I ate mine in the evening and didn't leave anything. </sentence><sentence id="703">Never ate any - didn't have any bread in the morning. </sentence><sentence id="704">And now, the punishment, if they caught you stealing other prisoners bread and you were caught, it was a death sentence. </sentence><sentence id="705">You were killed, you know, either the room elder or the block elder told a Kapo because when you went to work, you went under different, you know, the Kapos were in charge of you and they told that this fellow stole bread from another prisoner he was killed. </sentence><sentence id="706">They brought him back from work, you know, dead. </sentence><sentence id="707">That was an unwritten rule in the camp, you never stole from another prisoner because you deprived him of his livelihood. </sentence><sentence id="708">So -- </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="736">Q: Tell me about the different triangles? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="738">A: Oh yes, there were six main colors of triangles indicating the different kind of prisoner. </sentence><sentence id="739">As I said the red was the political prisoners and most of the Poles. </sentence><sentence id="740">Then there was a triangle, a red triangle on top of a yellow triangle but reversed so that it formed the Star of David. </sentence><sentence id="741">This was the designation of Jews. </sentence><sentence id="742">There were Jews, you know, at the time. </sentence><sentence id="743">At the beginning there were in small numbers but there were Jews. </sentence><sentence id="744">Then there was a green triangle indicated the criminal prisoner and they were mostly, mostly Germans, and then there was a black triangle which indicated an antisocial element, like in cases of woman and, you know, prostitutes and men, pimps and so on. </sentence><sentence id="745">Then there was a pink triangle which indicated homosexuals. </sentence><sentence id="746">Then there was a lavender color which indicated bible scientists, you know, those who were opposed to war, pacifists and so on, Jehovah witnesses. </sentence><sentence id="747">They were this lavender, purple color. </sentence><sentence id="748">They were most, I would say, decently treated of all the prisoners. </sentence><sentence id="749">So this was the main six different colors of triangles. </sentence><sentence id="750">With the Jews it was the Star of David, two triangles, you know, reversed on the yellow. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="817">A: I worked in the workshops and I was -- later on, you know, I went to work as a carpenter. </sentence><sentence id="818">I mean, I was no carpenter but they took me later on to work in the office in the carpentry. </sentence><sentence id="819">Later on I was you could say I was promoted and I became the chief clerk of all workshops, which consisted of the electricians, you know, locksmiths, carters, joiners, glassers, roofers, you know. </sentence><sentence id="820">All the trades were there. </sentence><sentence id="821">So I became the chief clerk of this and later on I became also -- they transferred me from the workshop itself to the central construction offices, which where, they employed architects, engineers, draftsman and I was there. </sentence><sentence id="822">The workshops had their own room. </sentence><sentence id="823">Matter of fact, I was sitting with an SS man and a civilian German, and as such I was able to go to the camp because I asked. </sentence><sentence id="824">I wanted to see the conditions. </sentence><sentence id="825">The different craftsmen had to go to this camp if there repairs to be made. </sentence><sentence id="826">For instance, if something went wrong with the electricity or something needed to be done by the joiners or by the carpenters. </sentence><sentence id="827">I was able, once there was a need to go to the camp, I asked -- well, I didn't ask. </sentence><sentence id="828">The fellow in the office another clerk, a friend of mine with whom I escaped, he made out a pass and he put my name and I went with them. </sentence><sentence id="829">And the SS who took us, because you couldn't go there without a guard, didn't care which prisoner he took, whether I was a real craftsman or not. </sentence><sentence id="830">That was how I was able to go and I saw the conditions. </sentence><sentence id="831">That's the only one time I was. </sentence><sentence id="832">But there were many other people like carpenters, electricians and so on and who went daily, and they were telling, you know, about conditions that were. </sentence><sentence id="833">So that's how I was able to go there and see. </sentence><sentence id="834">Now, let's see, yes. </sentence><sentence id="835">Now, the camp was in constant, in constant building, so when I first came I was on Block 7. </sentence><sentence id="836">This block later on was raised and another story was put up on it. </sentence><sentence id="837">So later on it became Number 14 and later on it became number, Block Number 22. </sentence><sentence id="838">And there were 28 blocks in the mother camp, 28 blocks, and they went from 1 to on one side, to 11. </sentence><sentence id="839">Block 11 was called the death block. </sentence><sentence id="840">It was the bunker block and there was a yard and there was a wall, death wall against in which prisoners were shot in the back of the head. </sentence><sentence id="841">And in the bunkers, there were bunkers, standing bunkers where four people. </sentence><sentence id="842">The cell was three feet by three feet and there was only a door at the bottom of this. </sentence><sentence id="843">The prisoners had to crawl in and stand up and four of the prisoner in this small - were locked up for the night. </sentence><sentence id="844">I think there were six of such standing bunkers. </sentence><sentence id="845">Mostly, they were put there without any food and then only the bodies were pulled out from there and burned. </sentence><sentence id="846">And there were other cells and other instruments of torture where people went - anybody who went to Block 11 seldom came out alive. </sentence><sentence id="847">Now, the woman come at one time - it was actually in Auschwitz itself. </sentence><sentence id="848">You know the 11 blocks which were on the eastern side of the camp, were all partitioned, with barbwire, and this was a womens camp. </sentence><sentence id="849">And then the conditions there for the women were quite quite decent, but it didn't last long because they were only put there until they build a camp, the camp in Birkenau. </sentence><sentence id="850">And once this was built, then they went back there. </sentence><sentence id="851">Also after invasion of the Russian on June 22, 1941, I don't know exactly. </sentence><sentence id="852">I think either it was in October or November, the part of 9 blocks was separated again by barbwire and the gate was put on and on this gate they wrote that a prisoner of war camp and the Russian prisoners were brought there. </sentence><sentence id="853">And there were approximately 11,000 of them and out of the 11,000 by, I think, December of that year only maybe a thousand survived. </sentence><sentence id="854">The rest were all dead and most of them were dead by starvation and by typhus and by beatings. </sentence><sentence id="855">And the bodies of these Russian prisoners were stuck six feet high because there was no - they didn't have the capacity to burn the bodies. </sentence><sentence id="856">The one crematorium which was in Auschwitz One was the smallest of all the crematoriums and it just couldn't burn the bodies, you know, fast enough. </sentence><sentence id="857">There was also a crematorium - next to the crematorium in Auschwitz was a small gas chamber where people were gassed. </sentence><sentence id="858">Of course, the biggest crematoriums were in Auschwitz Two and Birkenau. </sentence><sentence id="859">There were this crematorium in Auschwitz was designated as Number | and then there were Number 2, 3, 4 and 5 in Birkenau, and there the capacity was much greater, much greater, especially the gas chambers. </sentence><sentence id="860">They had the capacity of 2000 or even more prisoners or people could be gassed in one sitting. </sentence><sentence id="861">And there were four of them so it's approximately 10,000 people could be gassed in, well, matter of few hours. </sentence><sentence id="862">The gassing was not the problem. </sentence><sentence id="863">The problem was the disposing of the bodies because the capacity of the ovens were quite limited. </sentence><sentence id="864">That's why many of the bodies were burned in ditches or they were burned on stacks and disposed this way. </sentence><sentence id="865">Now, since we were about gassing, the first gassing actually took place in Auschqitz camp itself and it was the gassing of some 600 Russian prisoners of war. </sentence><sentence id="866">We - and some Polish prisoners. </sentence><sentence id="867">One day, it was of course after the invasion of Russia by Hitler, I think it was approximately on, in September, I think, September of 1941. </sentence><sentence id="868">We were all called back from our workplaces to the camp. </sentence><sentence id="869">Maybe I should also explain how the compound itself was only for the prisoners to go for the night to sleep, and the compound - as I said in Auschwitz One was 28 blocks and it was surrounded by two rows of barbedwire, electrified barbwire and by towers with guards with machine guns. </sentence><sentence id="870">On the east side, east and south side there was also maybe 15 high - maybe not 15 - maybe 10 feet high concrete wall because next to the east was a road, public road, which of course, they didn't want anybody to see the camp and from the south. </sentence><sentence id="871">And I lost my thought now - yes - so we were all brought back to the camp one afternoon, and we had to go on the blocks and they told us that we, nobody can go to the windows and look out the windows. </sentence><sentence id="872">Anybody who will be caught will be killed and the guards were all over the camp, and we didn't know what was going on. </sentence><sentence id="873">We found out later on the next days because the pallbearers told us, you know, there were prisoners who had to remove the bodies and apparently, 600 Russian prisoners. </sentence><sentence id="874">And I don't know, I think they were all officers and most of them probably were all political commisars [ph] and they were taken to Block 11, the death block, and they were put into the cellars and the cellars were sealed off. </sentence><sentence id="875">There were half windows and the half windows were covered with dirt in order to make them gas tight and they were gassed there. </sentence><sentence id="876">And in the night the bodies were removed by the pallbearers and taken to the crematorium Number | in Auschwitz and they were burned. </sentence><sentence id="877">And from the pallbearers we learned that they were Russian officers or soldiers, and among them there were also some 200 Polish prisoners that were gassed. </sentence><sentence id="878">So that was the first gassing, as I, which was performed. </sentence><sentence id="879">Later on, there were gassings in the small gas chamber in Auschwitz and I once was witness, I mean, not to the gassing itself because nobody - only the prisoners who worked - but the block I was on was Number 22 later on, which was the nearest to the crematorium. </sentence><sentence id="880">You couldn't see the whole of the crematorium. </sentence><sentence id="881">Only part of it. </sentence><sentence id="882">You could only see the foreyard, you know, to the crematorium. </sentence><sentence id="883">There was a gate and then there was a small yard and to this from our windows where we were at the far end of this block. </sentence><sentence id="884">I saw myself a truck arrive and back out to the gate to the small yard and Jews had to - only men - they arrive from the truck and were put into the yard and there they had to undress. </sentence><sentence id="885">Now, how do I know they were Jews? </sentence><sentence id="886">Because, because they were Hasidic Jews. </sentence><sentence id="887">They wore special dress. </sentence><sentence id="888">You know, mostly black, black hats and most of them had beards. </sentence><sentence id="889">Later on, we also found out from the crematorium people who had to burn the bodies that there were Jews from the Polish city of Bendzin, which was in Syvicia [ph] not far from Auschwitz, and these people had to undress and they disappeared. </sentence><sentence id="890">I couldn't see that, but they all went to the gas chambers there and they were gassed. </sentence><sentence id="891">Now, as I worked in the carpentry a time and then in the workshops you know I had to take orders and the orders came to me, and I had to distribute the orders to the different workshops, you know whether it was an order for the locksmiths or an order for the carpenters or for the glassers or for the electricians and so on. </sentence><sentence id="892">Well, there were orders coming, for instance, for gas-tight doors and there were drawings, you know, how the doors should look. </sentence><sentence id="893">What it should look like, and the doors were approximately three inches, maybe three and a half inches thick, and they were - were insulated inside with some gas proof material. </sentence><sentence id="894">I don't know what it was. </sentence><sentence id="895">I think it was wool, some wool, and then the edges, the edges of the door, they were this way, and the edges were then felt. </sentence><sentence id="896">You know, how do you say. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="979">Q: Padded? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="981">A: Yes. </sentence><sentence id="982">And in the middle of the door was a visor open, you know, with glass from both sides. </sentence><sentence id="983">Because as I said, the doors were three, three and a half inches thick. </sentence><sentence id="984">And there were two bolts and through this - and then the way when they gave the order read, Fear for "Zander ber hablen der Juden" [ph]. </sentence><sentence id="985">It means for special treatment of Jews. </sentence><sentence id="986">There never was. </sentence><sentence id="987">I never came across where they talked about Final Solution. </sentence><sentence id="988">They always referred to it as "Zander ber hablen der Juden" [ph], the special treatment of Jews. </sentence><sentence id="989">Of course, we knew it was the same thing. </sentence><sentence id="990">Final Solution. </sentence><sentence id="991">So these doors - somebody today tries to say that it didn't exist, so why did you need gas-tight doors? </sentence><sentence id="992">Anyway, anybody who wants to deny this, either ignore it or - Now - </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1005">Q: How many of those doors were there? </sentence><sentence id="1006">Were there many? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1009">A: Quite a few because the first door was done for the crematorium for the gas chamber in Auschwitz and then there were the other ones were in Birkenau. </sentence><sentence id="1010">I don't know how many altogether, but at least, as far as I know, probably were at least five. </sentence><sentence id="1011">Five doors and I'm now sorry because when I when back to Auschwitz - I had to keep a register, a big book where I had to register every order which came in had to be registered and it was my job, and I, when I went back I'm sure had I seen it right away I would have taken it with me, and then from there you would be able to find out how many doors there were. </sentence><sentence id="1012">But I remember it. </sentence><sentence id="1013">Matter of fact, if I had drawing board or something I could draw exactly you know what the door looked like because I know. </sentence><sentence id="1014">I remember it so well. </sentence><sentence id="1015">So, but now maybe you want to ask --. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1023">Q: Yes. </sentence><sentence id="1024">Why don't I ask you - you mentioned an incident about Russian POWs? </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1033">Q: And it was Block 25? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1035">A: 25A was right next to the kitchen, the camp kitchen, and at that time there was a small yard in front of the kitchen, and one day and it was in the morning, you know, when all the commanders went to work and only on the blocks were the block elder and the people in the rooms you know and the clerk, and we saw through the window, because it was on the second, yes the second floor, we were on the second floor, that the SS brought out tables, and there were some papers on it. </sentence><sentence id="1036">We knew something was going on. </sentence><sentence id="1037">Later on, they brought maybe 100, I don't know exactly, 100 men. </sentence><sentence id="1038">Now, they were stripped to the waist but you could see from the trousers that they were soldiers. </sentence><sentence id="1039">As I said, later on we did find out that they were Russian soldiers. </sentence><sentence id="1040">It as also after the invasion, after the June 22, 1941, I think it was in August, and they, they were registered or questioned or whatever the SS - nobody. </sentence><sentence id="1041">Again, we couldn't go, you couldn't be conspicuous and look through the window, you know, with your nose next to the pane. </sentence><sentence id="1042">You couldn't do it. </sentence><sentence id="1043">You could only do it from afar. </sentence><sentence id="1044">They were taking some evidence of them and later on they were taken to a sand pit which was behind the kitchen. </sentence><sentence id="1045">Already outside the compound near the guardhouse there was a sand pit. </sentence><sentence id="1046">The sand was used you know for construction. </sentence><sentence id="1047">They were taken out and the SS, only the SS, and the most vicious way they were killed. </sentence><sentence id="1048">They were killed by -- and this I saw with my own eyes - they were killed by being hit by spades as they split their heads. </sentence><sentence id="1049">They were told to lie down and they put the handles of the spades on over their throat and they stood on each end of it and they suffocated them. </sentence><sentence id="1050">And they were put on the edge of the pit and then kicked in the groin and they fell down, and they took big stones and they through them. </sentence><sentence id="1051">Of course, I couldn't see because they were down in the pit but I saw the SS throwing the big stones on them. </sentence><sentence id="1052">They they did - there was a small narrow-gauged wagons which they loaded the sand to be taken to the construction site. </sentence><sentence id="1053">They loaded this with the sand then they told the prisoners to lie down next to this. </sentence><sentence id="1054">These wagons were, they could turn over and then they turned over and the whole load of sand was put, and they buried them alive, and that I saw. </sentence><sentence id="1055">And that was the most horrible thing I ever saw. </sentence><sentence id="1056">Now, I couldn't tell and nobody really knew, at that time, they probably killed half of these hundred men before noon. </sentence><sentence id="1057">Then of course, they had to go to lunch, the SS, and after lunch they killed the rest of them. </sentence><sentence id="1058">They were all killed. </sentence><sentence id="1059">They were not shot or anything. </sentence><sentence id="1060">They were murdered in the most brutal way. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1087">Q: By a small handful of SS or - how many SS were there? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1089">A: I couldn't tell you. </sentence><sentence id="1090">I just don't know. </sentence><sentence id="1091">Not too many SS men. </sentence><sentence id="1092">Not too many. </sentence><sentence id="1093">And we learned or we heard that they were also commisars you know and some of them, at least to me, some of them looked, had Semitic features. </sentence><sentence id="1094">So maybe they were Jews. </sentence><sentence id="1095">I don't know. </sentence><sentence id="1096">Because the viciousness which they displayed, the SS. </sentence><sentence id="1097">Just, you can't imagine. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1107">Q: You told another incident where you mentioned a pretty heroic act by Father Colby? </sentence></p></dialogue>

</sentence><sentence id="1205">The one, the one person it was Hapchar [ph]. </sentence><sentence id="1206">I think his first name was Gearhart. </sentence><sentence id="1207">He was also the Report Fuhrer and he was also the executioner, and you could see him at the time when I was the clerk on the block. </sentence><sentence id="1208">You saw him with his rifle under his arm walking to the Block 11 which meant that there would be execution, and the executions were almost daily, daily, every day, one way or the other. </sentence><sentence id="1209">Either, well later on, the gassing was every day and there were shootings were every day and the injections were given almost daily, and you could see him going. </sentence><sentence id="1210">In other words, one knew that there would be execution, and the small caliber rifle was used because it didn't make too much sound. </sentence><sentence id="1211">It wasn't very loud and apparently it must have been very effective. </sentence><sentence id="1212">And there were others who did the executions. </sentence><sentence id="1213">There was another Report Fuhrer, his name was Kadook [ph]. </sentence><sentence id="1214">Matter of fact, he was -- .Now apparently, he got into trouble with the authorities and he was later on sent to - that's what I hear - now, this is only from hearing, I have no knowledge otherwise - that apparently his family, his wife and two children were bombed and killed in bombing raids, and he apparently got friendly with a Jewess in the Birkenau camp and he was found out, and then he was sent to fight the Partisans. </sentence><sentence id="1215">Because of his great services which he rendered to the German camp he was not executed or anything but he was sent to fight the Partisans in Yugoslavia and he was killed. </sentence><sentence id="1216">So that's what we heard. </sentence><sentence id="1217">And this other - Kadook was first caught and he was tried in East Germany, he was sentenced to death but then it was commuted to life, and afterwards he was given - because there were other things which they try him in West Germany, and he was taken to West Germany and tried again. </sentence><sentence id="1218">And I think the trial went for many, many years, and there were many witnesses called from Poland and I don't know whether he is free or whether he is still in prison. </sentence><sentence id="1219">I didn't know. </sentence><sentence id="1220">I think that was one of the last trials that was conducted. </sentence><sentence id="1221">End of Tape #2    Tape #3 </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1270">Q: Tell me what it meant to be one of the older prisoners in camp. </sentence><sentence id="1271">Tell me about life expectancy in the camp. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1274">A: Well, life expectancy of a prisoner, of a new arrival was between two to three months. </sentence><sentence id="1275">It depended of course, upon the work. </sentence><sentence id="1276">If you had a very heavy and of course, new arrivals always got worst jobs, the heaviest jobs, like digging on the foundations and carrying bricks and very heavy duties. </sentence><sentence id="1277">On the food which we received they couldn't exist longer than two three months. </sentence><sentence id="1278">So if you were lucky, like I suppose I was, that I did you know meet a friend of mine who was already established prisoner, because he came with the first transport and was able to get a job as a groom to the SS horses, officer's horses. </sentence><sentence id="1279">And therefore, he was able to share some of the food which the horses received, which was more than the prisoners did, like potatos and carrots, and even sugar even though the sugar was discolored, they had means of cleaning it, they could survive. </sentence><sentence id="1280">And because of them I was able to survive because they introduced me to the carpentry, master of carpentry and I was able to get and work in the carpentry shop. </sentence><sentence id="1281">But other people who were unable and who had to work these hard, you know, labors just couldn't possible survive more than two, three months, and those who were emaciated were called Muslim man and the were - they lost all will to life and they walked you know like in a daze and you could - with one finger you could push them and they fell over and never got up. </sentence><sentence id="1282">It was a terrible sight. </sentence><sentence id="1283">And one of my friends - matter of fact, we came together, who was arrested with me - he died. </sentence><sentence id="1284">He didn't survive, and I met him once and I couldn't do anything for to help him. </sentence><sentence id="1285">He died. </sentence><sentence id="1286">He became a Muslim man and perished. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1300">Q: So, if you had lived for a long time you gained respect? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1302">A: Yes. </sentence><sentence id="1303">The respect was in the SS. </sentence><sentence id="1304">The German guards respected anybody. </sentence><sentence id="1305">Well, respected - they had a certain respect because they saw that anybody was able to survive three months, and say and longer, then he must be a person of strong character and strong will and good physical condition. </sentence><sentence id="1306">So they did they had certain respect. </sentence><sentence id="1307">I would say, yes they did. </sentence><sentence id="1308">And of course, there was among prisoners - when you were an old prisoner you were also trusted. </sentence><sentence id="1309">That if you survived the first few months, that you must be of good character and be able to conduct yourself in a manner. </sentence><sentence id="1310">Now, there were, of course, some prisoners who did survive because of their brutality. </sentence><sentence id="1311">Not only all were German criminal prisoners who were in charge, you know Kapos and so on. </sentence><sentence id="1312">Later on matter of fact, I think when the German war machine was slowing down and they called up some of the German prisoners, the German prisoners were called up to the German Army and they apparently formed some special units. </sentence><sentence id="1313">So the Kapos later on and the block elders became, they were eighter Polish or Czech or - there were also some Jewish in the Jewish camp. </sentence><sentence id="1314">In Birkenau there were Jews. </sentence><sentence id="1315">Now, some behaved honorably and some didn't. </sentence><sentence id="1316">There were, like one of the prisoners in Auschwitz I camp who did the injections you know killing, was a Polish prisoner who did this. </sentence><sentence id="1317">His name was Pineschhk [ph]. </sentence><sentence id="1318">Everybody knew about it but nobody could do - what happened, he was transferred later on to another camp and then he was killed. </sentence><sentence id="1319">So these were the unwritten rules you know of the camp. </sentence><sentence id="1320">That you better behave yourself because eventually somebody will get you. </sentence><sentence id="1321">And there was another prisoner, who is also tried and I told about this Kadook [ph] Report Fuhrer - he was a block elder in a Auschwitz One and later on he became a block leader in the punishment company. </sentence><sentence id="1322">Because there was a company where you went as a punishment and you seldom came out once you went to this company. </sentence><sentence id="1323">And he behaved badly and he was arrested in West Germany and tried. </sentence><sentence id="1324">I don't know what the result was, whether he's free now or not. </sentence><sentence id="1325">So there were, you know, there were many prisoners - and there were many informers among the prisoners, and there were not only German informers there were Polish informers. </sentence><sentence id="1326">It was a fight for survival and some did it by honest means and others couldn't care less how they achieved this. </sentence><sentence id="1327">So --, but I would say anybody who survived for a long time was trusted, and that's how, for instance, we could arranged our escape from the camp because we knew all the prisoners and we trusted them and when they trusted us, and we more or less knew who the informers were. </sentence><sentence id="1328">Once you were that long in the camp you knew whom to avoid and whom not. </sentence><sentence id="1329">Whom you could trust and whom you could speak and so on. </sentence><sentence id="1330">Could I tell you that I contracted typhus? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1361">Q: Yes, but I think we should - let's do typhus and then go on. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1363">A: One time - well, typhus was always but there was an epidemic in 1942. </sentence><sentence id="1364">There was a great epidemic of typhus. </sentence><sentence id="1365">It was the spotted fever. </sentence><sentence id="1366">I contracted it and I went to the hospital, what they called the hospital in the camp. </sentence><sentence id="1367">It was so bad that later on, you know, we had bunks and there they were three-tier bunks in the hospital. </sentence><sentence id="1368">There were also three-tier bunks and they were approximately three feet wide and on them, many times, three prisoners, three sick people had to lie. </sentence><sentence id="1369">And, two this way and one in the legs, you know. </sentence><sentence id="1370">So it was terrible, and I contracted it too and I was for 16 days in high fever. </sentence><sentence id="1371">I never apparently - my constitution was quite good and I didn't lose consciousness, but I didn't eat through the whole 16 days and all I did get was hot water, boiled water to drink. </sentence><sentence id="1372">And then I was for the next three weeks in convalescence, and then I was released one afternoon, but I don't know. </sentence><sentence id="1373">Maybe I had a friend, doctor whom I knew and the friend doctor, it was Dr. Tyfeld [ph] he - after I got out and was in convalescence, he gave me two injections of glucose. </sentence><sentence id="1374">That's the only medication I did get, to strengthen me. </sentence><sentence id="1375">And then, as I said, one afternoon I was released, and the reason for it I don't know. </sentence><sentence id="1376">Maybe the doctor knew something or not. </sentence><sentence id="1377">I was released in the afternoon and I was so happy that I was now out of the - and I tried to run and I didn't realize how weak I was and I couldn't lift my feet, and I fell right on my face. </sentence><sentence id="1378">And then I went on the block and the next morning around, I think, six o'clock in the morning or seven o'clock, the trucks came to the hospital and all the patients, whether in convalescence or sick were loaded on these trucks and taken to the gas chambers and they were all gassed. </sentence><sentence id="1379">And they were not all Jewish, you know Jews. </sentence><sentence id="1380">There were Christians and Poles, and Czechs, many different nationalities, and they were all dead and all taken and gassed, and I avoided it just by well some 12, 13 hours, you know I avoided being gassed. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1399">Q: You don't know if somebody saved you? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1401">A: I don't know, I don't know. </sentence><sentence id="1402">Maybe the doctor knew and they released me. </sentence><sentence id="1403">I was the only one released and I don't know why. </sentence><sentence id="1404">But I suppose it was fate or somebody just knew something. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1409">Q: Sometime around late in 1943, I think it was that you decided, even though escape was impossible, that you would look into that. </sentence><sentence id="1410">Tell me what happened, how it led into that? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1413">A: Well, you know, I was thinking about escaping. </sentence><sentence id="1414">As a matter of fact, the first day I was arrested when I was taken to the prison and we were in the entrance hall, I already thought then that I just walk out because I did speak German. </sentence><sentence id="1415">I thought maybe I be able to talk myself out and I wanted to go to the gate. </sentence><sentence id="1416">But I didn't. </sentence><sentence id="1417">I didn't know enough, you know, how the workings of it were. </sentence><sentence id="1418">But then when I came to Auschwitz at the beginning, I didn't think it because, you know, you were so hungry and you just couldn't gather your thoughts. </sentence><sentence id="1419">All you were thinking about how to survive. </sentence><sentence id="1420">But later on when I, more or less, became acquainted and I got together with a friend of mine and we were thinking about escaping, and we did have a plan and we did prepare for it. </sentence><sentence id="1421">And of course, the preparations were you had to do it with and had to involve many people and trust many people. </sentence><sentence id="1422">Now, in the camp there were some crafts which couldn't be performed by prisoners because they were specialties things which had to be done. </sentence><sentence id="1423">And therefore, they did employ outside people from the Polish workers, and these workers were more or less free to mingle you know with the prisoners and some people did mingle with them and were able to talk and exchange information from the outside, and some of them were even able to send letters to their family from outside. </sentence><sentence id="1424">Some were caught and if the civilian person was caught, then they were brought to the camp or they were executed right away. </sentence><sentence id="1425">So they were taking great chances. </sentence><sentence id="1426">But anyway, so we did - one of the fellows made the contact, there were four of us who planned to escape, and we wanted to escape as civilian workers and we did prepare, you know, the passes. </sentence><sentence id="1427">They were of course forged and our photographs were drawings you know and then taken - the photographs by a lens and somebody in a box. </sentence><sentence id="1428">Somebody brought a lens and we made a photograph of this drawings. </sentence><sentence id="1429">Not of us. </sentence><sentence id="1430">Couldn't be done. </sentence><sentence id="1431">And then that's what we put on the passes and then the civilians also brought bicycles, and what they did, they came on a bicycle and left the bicycle in this spot. </sentence><sentence id="1432">It was in not carpentry. </sentence><sentence id="1433">It was in the joiners. </sentence><sentence id="1434">There were small places where they could be hidden you know, in the joiners, and they left them and they brought four because four of us wanted to escape, and they brought four bikes. </sentence><sentence id="1435">They also brought four civilian clothes and they also - we were able to prepare toupees, you know. </sentence><sentence id="1436">They were very crudely made. </sentence><sentence id="1437">I don't know who made them, but anyway there were, and then we decided that we going to go out of the camp. </sentence><sentence id="1438">At that time when we planned, you know, there was no more collective responsibility. </sentence><sentence id="1439">In other words, nobody would have suffered because of our escape and that's what - we didn't want anybody to be starved to death because we escaped. </sentence><sentence id="1440">We didn't think in those terms. </sentence><sentence id="1441">We thought that if we do, we didn't want anybody to suffer for us. </sentence><sentence id="1442">So when the day came that we escaped, we wanted to go with the other workers and could mingle and go in one group and then show the passes. </sentence><sentence id="1443">And I'm sure the guards wouldn't check each pass separately, you know closely, and when the day and the time to quit, which was the worker had to leave by five o'clock, we went to the shed. </sentence><sentence id="1444">It was a shed where we changed the clothes, into the civilian, and this one fellow who actually made all the contacts with the civilians because he was in a position to do it, he just didn't show up in the shed to change. </sentence><sentence id="1445">So then one of my friends you know changed back into the prison and went to see what is happening. </sentence><sentence id="1446">And then he came and he was shaking life a leaf and he just couldn't contain himself. </sentence><sentence id="1447">He was mumbling. </sentence><sentence id="1448">He said, I'm sorry I can't make it. </sentence><sentence id="1449">He said, I cannot do it, I just can't take the risk. </sentence><sentence id="1450">So then we had to abandon it. </sentence><sentence id="1451">And we again changed into our prison garb, and now we were afraid about him, whether he is not going to you know to tell on us. </sentence><sentence id="1452">And we had to, well - we could have, if we wanted we could have eliminated him by - because of the lies, we could have infected him with typhus you know and he knew it and if he once he went to the hospital, you know, the doctors were all Polish or Jewish and Czechs or what and they were friends of ours, they would have taken care of him. </sentence><sentence id="1453">But he promised us, he cannot do it but he is not going to do any harm to us if we want to go in a different way. </sentence><sentence id="1454">He said to trust him and we did. </sentence><sentence id="1455">We did trust him and we had to change our plans, and then apparently, apparently somebody must have known that we were planning to escape, and then the other group came and they approached us with - we wouldn't go in a different way, and the different way was to acquire SS uniforms and take prisoners out to work outside the camp. </sentence><sentence id="1456">And that's how we started planning, and some of the people who were involved had connections. </sentence><sentence id="1457">One of the prisoners had connections with the people, because everywhere I worked were prisoners, everywhere. </sentence><sentence id="1458">Only the top authorities were the Germans, but otherwise, the inside organization of it was all, in the prisoners hands. </sentence><sentence id="1459">There were all in the offices, everything. </sentence><sentence id="1460">The whole evidence, everything, was kept by the prisoners. </sentence><sentence id="1461">Doctors, you know, everything. </sentence><sentence id="1462">So we decided that we do escape as SS guards and take four prisoners out to work, outside the camp. </sentence><sentence id="1463">And since my friend and myself spoke quite decent German, we were picked to be the SS people. </sentence><sentence id="1464">And then some of the friends who were involved had friends who worked in the storage rooms where they stored the SS uniforms and they were able to smuggle out of the storage rooms one pair of trousers and then second pair of trousers, and then one jacket and another one, then a cap, then second cap, then the belt, then second belt, and this was brought in and it was stored, you know, my friends who was supposed to change in the SS uniform with me who had a small studio. </sentence><sentence id="1465">He was a carver and a sculptor and he had a small studio, and he was not bothered by anybody, by the SS, because he worked for them. </sentence><sentence id="1466">He sculpted things for them for which they sometimes give him some bread and some sausage and, you know. </sentence><sentence id="1467">And they took these things and probably sold it or kept it, sent it to home. </sentence><sentence id="1468">So we stored it in his small studio, and then when the time came to escape, then we transferred it to the lumber yard. </sentence><sentence id="1469">Actually, it was not only a lumber yard but it was all the building materials were stored, in this place. </sentence><sentence id="1470">It was called Bowhov [?] </sentence><sentence id="1471">and in the barrack where the lumber was kept there were three friends of ours and they hid the uniforms there. </sentence><sentence id="1472">And these uniforms, they then put the insignia because we didn't want to go out as just ordinary SS men. </sentence><sentence id="1473">We wanted to go as NCOs in order that we were able to carry sidearms. </sentence><sentence id="1474">Of course, any SS man who was taking out people to work outside, you know, had to be armed. </sentence><sentence id="1475">Not only armed, had to have a special permit, but I'll come back later to it. </sentence><sentence id="1476">The arms of course, was an impossibility for us to obtain, but we again, had friends who worked in the saddlery that, you know, workshops, and we were able to obtain two holsters for which we then made dummy pistols out of wood. </sentence><sentence id="1477">Now, one of our friends knew somebody in the saddlery and he approached him with a concocted story that the chief of the carpenters and workshops, who was an SS man by the name of [fred Shiner [ph] had his birthday coming up, and his holster was rather shabby, and whether he wouldn't make a new holster for him. </sentence><sentence id="1478">The fellow said, yes. </sentence><sentence id="1479">Of course, everything was done for a piece of bread or piece of sausage if you could obtain it. </sentence><sentence id="1480">And he said, yes he will do it, but what size is the pistol? </sentence><sentence id="1481">We said, well, we can't ask him to give us the pistol so that you can make the holster we said the normal size, just make one. </sentence><sentence id="1482">So he said Okay, but don't blame me if it doesn't fit. </sentence><sentence id="1483">But of course that was the whole idea, that it wouldn't fit because we needed two. </sentence><sentence id="1484">So no matter what he do it wouldn't be the right size. </sentence><sentence id="1485">So he made this one holster, and we told him no, I'm sorry, it is too small. </sentence><sentence id="1486">Will you make a larger one? </sentence><sentence id="1487">Again, for a piece of bread. </sentence><sentence id="1488">So he made another one and then we had the two holsters, and as I said, for the two holsters, we sculptured and made dummy out of wood, dummy pistols. </sentence><sentence id="1489">The pistol's holsters were open in the back and of course, you could see, you know, whether there were a real pistol or not. </sentence><sentence id="1490">But since camp, especially in the winter, was rather damp place - Auschwitz was a damp place, so the SS always wrapped the back of the pistol in a dark cloth, black cloth, you know, piece of cloth so that you couldn't see from the back whether it was a real pistol or not. </sentence><sentence id="1491">So we did the same thing and nobody knew whether there was a real pistol or not. </sentence><sentence id="1492">Then the SS needed a pass to take prisoners out to work and the passes were issued by the issuing SS officer, and they were of different color for different days and again, one of our fellows who were escaping with us knew a fellow prisoner who worked in the printing office and the printer gave him some blank forms in different colors. </sentence><sentence id="1493">Now, the day we wanted to escape which was, matter of fact, it will be in six days. </sentence><sentence id="1494">It will be the 50" anniversary, on the 28 of September, 1944. </sentence><sentence id="1495">And when we came to issue this blanks - the colors was pale blue - and we looked through our blanks and we didn't have a pale blue. </sentence><sentence id="1496">The nearest to it was pale green and we said well we'll take the pale green. </sentence><sentence id="1497">We take a chance. </sentence><sentence id="1498">So I knew who the issuing officer was and I did it in my office. </sentence><sentence id="1499">Of course, we needed a stamp. </sentence><sentence id="1500">The stamp - again, the sculptor, the carver, he carved it out, the stamp out of a very soft wood and he made a very good facsimile of it, and I tested it on a piece of paper in my office on an ink pad and it came a very good facsimile. </sentence><sentence id="1501">So then I did fill out on the 28" I did fill out this pass and I signed, forged the name of the issuing officer who was the SS ? </sentence><sentence id="1502">De Fuhrer, Miller, signed his name, put the stamp, and in order that the stamp wouldn't be recognized, you know, I smudged it a little. </sentence><sentence id="1503">And then the prisoners themselves needed a permit from the workshop SS man and this was no problem because one of the escapees was a clerk in the office there, and he had blanks and he issued the blanks that four prisoners, glassers are going to work in this spot and he signed this SS man, forged his name. </sentence><sentence id="1504">So we had these two pieces of passes which we needed. </sentence><sentence id="1505">Then we obtained, because if we failed, we obtained some cyanide poison. </sentence><sentence id="1506">We obtained it from the pharmacy, the camp pharmacy, which again, was run by prisoners, and the prisoners who did run it was named Marion Dolinski [ph] and he was a very nice fellow and he gave us cyanide in the form of powder, which we put, wrapped in pieces of paper and each one of us had it with him. </sentence><sentence id="1507">So then, now, before that we already had contact with the underground, and we had the contact with the underground through a Polish girl who worked as a SS civilian cleaning woman in the barracks of the national labor social - NSDRP, I don't know what the - that's the acronym of the German Nazi party - and through her we contacted with the underground and the resistance movement. </sentence><sentence id="1508">And how we did contact her is that again, she was instructed to do some damage, either to the plumbing or to the electricity or something that broke down and that the workers had to come and to correct it. </sentence><sentence id="1509">And of course, whenever we needed something and there was a call, then this fellow who worked in the workshop office always assigned somebody, either himself to do it with another mechanic to go there or I went there, and he made the contact. </sentence><sentence id="1510">We exchanged the information with the girl and she took it to the - so with her we decided that we escape on the 28 of September 1944 and that - how do you say, the word you know, the recognition? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1612">Q: Password? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1614">A: Password will be a Polish carol, which the fellow who is going to meet us was supposed to whistle. </sentence><sentence id="1615">And the carol, Polish carol name was "" ?

that we will try to avoid going through the gates where the passes would be checked. </sentence><sentence id="1618">And we already surveyed it beforehand, that there to the buildings to which we had to go to do to put the panes in you know, the panes, the glasspanes in, was there was a shortcut which led under the tower of a guard. </sentence><sentence id="1619">And many workers pass this way many times and they were never stopped. </sentence><sentence id="1620">So we said that we will try to do the same things, and we had a lookout for us, a fellow prisoner, a very good friend of us who was looking at the place, and he was supposed to give us the sign you know whether it's okay or not okay. </sentence><sentence id="1621">Anyway, so when the day came and we decided to escape at noontime, it was the time when the SS, most of them went to the mess hall you know, for lunch and there wouldn't be too much of them moving around. </sentence><sentence id="1622">Because we had quite a distance to walk to meet our prisoners, you know, whom we were taking out to work and they were quite a distance away. </sentence><sentence id="1623">So when the day came at noontime, at one o'clock it so happened that the SS man who was in charge of me and the workshops came to my office, and he wanted something urgently done and it took sometime and I was delayed. </sentence><sentence id="1624">Eventually, he did leave and he went to lunch, and then I was able to leave and I went to meet my friend, the other one who was supposed to change into the SS clothes, and we went to the lumber yard. </sentence><sentence id="1625">Because in the meantime, we transferred it to the lumber yard, the uniforms, we went there and these people were quite worried that we were late, and they thought matter of fact that we won't show up at all. </sentence><sentence id="1626">But anyway we did come, and we changed into the uniforms you know and they inspected us. </sentence><sentence id="1627">They were supposed to then, after we were successful in escaping, they would burn our prison uniforms. </sentence><sentence id="1628">They inspected us and they looked out of the barrack whether the air was clear and they told us yes, and we walked out. </sentence><sentence id="1629">And as I said, we had to walk approximately some, almost half a mile and it was dangerous. </sentence><sentence id="1630">It was really dangerous because we were afraid that we could meet some SS people who would recognize us. </sentence><sentence id="1631">So it happened that we were lucky. </sentence><sentence id="1632">We didn't meet many prisoners who had to salute us the prescribed way and where they had to take off their cap and, you know, look at us, and one of the fellows recognized me because I met him later on, 1945, in Italy, and he said that I looked very pale. </sentence><sentence id="1633">Well, anyway so we came to the place where we were supposed to meet these prisoners whom we were taking out to work. </sentence><sentence id="1634">We told them to pick up their tools, the glass, and shouted the way the SS shouted at prisoners to pick up, and they picked up the glass and we walked towards the tower. </sentence><sentence id="1635">And there our lookout gave us the sign that everything is clear, that we can go and we went. </sentence><sentence id="1636">We went it was a narrow pass leading under the tower and the guard on the tower with the machine gun, seeing our insignia, you know, shouted Hail Hitler to us and we shouted back, Hail Hitler. </sentence><sentence id="1637">And we said, what a beautiful day it is, in German. </sentence><sentence id="1638">And he said, yes, it's a nice day. </sentence><sentence id="1639">And we went, we passed. </sentence><sentence id="1640">We had to come to the main road and on the main road as we were maybe some 50 or 40 yards away, there were always roving patrols would check, you know, the SS and the prisoners who worked outside the big chain of guards and as we were approaching this road on the bicycle was an SS man, a Sergeant SS man on the bicycle and he was looking in our direction, and he was unable to make up his mind whether to stop and check us out or whether to go on. </sentence><sentence id="1641">Anyway, he almost stopped on the bike and finally, he decided to go and he went on. </sentence><sentence id="1642">And we didn't know what we would do, but between ourselves we said if he does check out and he finds out we have the wrong passes, we either have to kill him or take him with us and hoping he wouldn't make to much noise. </sentence><sentence id="1643">Anyway, he did go on so we came to the road. </sentence><sentence id="1644">As we came to the road, going away from us was a whole company of SS going to the firing range. </sentence><sentence id="1645">So they must have passed only a few minutes before we got there - so we crossed the road. </sentence><sentence id="1646">We went into the houses. </sentence><sentence id="1647">There were new houses being built for the SS and they had to be, you know, the panes had be put into the frames of the window frames. </sentence><sentence id="1648">It's not like here where the whole window comes with glass and everything's there, you just put first the frame and then you have to put the window. </sentence><sentence id="1649">So we went into the house looked around. </sentence><sentence id="1650">Nobody was there. </sentence><sentence id="1651">We went to the other side of the house and looked around. </sentence><sentence id="1652">Nobody there, and we walked because they were open fields and the fields led to the river, the River Soya [ph] which floats near and through Auschwitz city, the city of Auschwitz. </sentence><sentence id="1653">We came to the river. </sentence><sentence id="1654">Near the river the vegetation was quite lush and in the brushes the glassers, you know, took off the heavy panes off their backs ad the other tools and we dumped it there. </sentence><sentence id="1655">And then we walked on the west side of the river going south for some 150 yards and then went into the river. </sentence><sentence id="1656">The level of the river was very low at that time. </sentence><sentence id="1657">We walked in the river bed for some 150 yards in order to lose the scent for the dogs once the search would start, then cross to the east side of the bank and walked along. </sentence><sentence id="1658">As we walked further south there was a couple lying, young couple lying in the grass and we knew that there was only a fellow was supposed to be - anyway we came there and we don't hear any whistling of the carol, so we pass and suddenly we hear that somebody is walking or even running behind us and he's trying whistling but no tune comes out. </sentence><sentence id="1659">So we turned around and we then spoke in Polish what are you trying to whistle? </sentence><sentence id="1660">and he said this " "" and we said well, you're our contact then. </sentence><sentence id="1661">He said, yes. </sentence><sentence id="1662">He said, I couldn't get a tune out. </sentence><sentence id="1663">I was so nervous because you looked so impressive as SS men. </sentence><sentence id="1664">I said, now, you were supposed to be my yourself. </sentence><sentence id="1665">And he said, yes, but I was so lonely I said I better take a companion, the girl. </sentence><sentence id="1666">So then they came with us and we walked further south, and they put us in very deep bushes and we - he said we have to wait here. </sentence><sentence id="1667">I'm going to see the commandant of the unit, of the Partisan unit and he will come here. </sentence><sentence id="1668">And he came after a while. </sentence><sentence id="1669">He came and he brought us three grenades and two real pistols this time. </sentence><sentence id="1670">And then he said we can't go any further until it become dark because some of the bridges and the roads are being watched by the SS. </sentence><sentence id="1671">So we waited in the bushes until it became dark. </sentence><sentence id="1672">While we were sitting in the bushes we heard the siren go off in the camp. </sentence><sentence id="1673">We probably at that time were maybe three, three miles, three and a half miles away from the camp, and once a siren went off we knew that we were discovered that we were missing and that the search would begin. </sentence><sentence id="1674">And when it became dark he took us and he led us through some pass and roads. </sentence><sentence id="1675">I don't know where. </sentence><sentence id="1676">Anyway, we came to a farmer's house and there we were given very poor civilian clothes, very poor but Polish peasants didn't have much themselves. </sentence><sentence id="1677">Anyway, we did shed our SS uniforms which they hid because for further use later on, and the prison garb was taken out and burned right away. </sentence><sentence id="1678">And we were given a bowl of soup and glass of Polish vodka, a small glass. </sentence><sentence id="1679">And then the same guide who picked us up came and walked us bypassing the villages further south to the foothills of the Carpathian Mountains. </sentence><sentence id="1680">And we arrived there in the morning and there we were met by two Partisans, also former escapees from Auschwitz, and then taken back further in, deep in the mountains and high in the mountains to the headquarters of the Partisans. </sentence><sentence id="1681">The Partisans were - approximately 100 people were there, and approximately 20 of them were former escapees from Auschwitz. </sentence><sentence id="1682">Well, there were approximately 667 attempts of escape from Auschwitz and 270 were caught and executed. </sentence><sentence id="1683">The execution was always by hanging, public hanging. </sentence><sentence id="1684">397, you know, survived, but not much is know about them. </sentence><sentence id="1685">Our group which escaped, we were six and I believe, I'm not sure but I believe it was the biggest group that ever escaped from Auschwitz. </sentence><sentence id="1686">And out of the six, three are - I'm sorry. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1772">Q: Don't be sorry at all. </sentence><sentence id="1773">Now, you're with the Partisans and so what did you do then? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1776">A: Well, when we came to the Partisans we, of course, didn't know what the strength was of the Partisans and what the equipment and armament was, but we had plans that we thought maybe we could liberate, you know, some of the prisoners and liberate the whole camp. </sentence><sentence id="1777">But we found out that we were too ill equipped and we wouldn't have any chance, you know, of liberating. </sentence><sentence id="1778">Maybe because it may have been a big catastrophe. </sentence><sentence id="1779">You couldn't fight against 3 to 4,000 well-armed guards. </sentence><sentence id="1780">It was a impossibility. </sentence><sentence id="1781">Besides that, even if we did succeed, what would you do with the thousand of prisoners? </sentence><sentence id="1782">What would happen? </sentence><sentence id="1783">How would you feed them? </sentence><sentence id="1784">Where would they go? </sentence><sentence id="1785">Where would they hide? </sentence><sentence id="1786">It was impossible. </sentence><sentence id="1787">But we did succeed in one instance where we freed two prisoners. </sentence><sentence id="1788">We intercepted them while they were walking from one camp to another. </sentence><sentence id="1789">They were taken by genuine guards and we gave them fictitious papers that they were wanted, these two prisoners were wanted in the political department, which was the camp Gestapo. </sentence><sentence id="1790">And they released them and we signed the papers for them and they released them and they were free. </sentence><sentence id="1791">But one of them - no, both - no one of them didn't survive. </sentence><sentence id="1792">He was killed later on and he was killed later on. </sentence><sentence id="1793">There was a raid on one house where they were staying. </sentence><sentence id="1794">Matter of fact, I was in the house the night before, in the house with this friend of mine also who did escape. </sentence><sentence id="1795">Now is still alive but who had the stroke in Poland. </sentence><sentence id="1796">We were six together and they told us that too many of us here and why don't you leave, and since we didn't know what they wanted to do. </sentence><sentence id="1797">So we did leave and the next morning the SS surrounded the whole house and they were killed. </sentence><sentence id="1798">Three of them were killed and one, I think I did describe to you when I spoke before. </sentence><sentence id="1799">He was taken alive. </sentence><sentence id="1800">And how he survived, he hid in the basement of the house. </sentence><sentence id="1801">Actually, in the cellar, and in the cellar they </sentence></p><p><sentence id="1802"> kept potatoes, and when the potato is, when the old potatos get, they start sprouting and then they remove the sprouts and they put them in one, one corner of the cellar. </sentence><sentence id="1803">And the SS knew that there were four, four prisoners - I mean four Partisans - so then knew that they killed three of them and there must be a fourth one. </sentence><sentence id="1804">So what they did, they were throwing grenades into the cellar and this fellow took - once they threw the grenade he through it to the next compartment in the, in the cellar and then they exploded. </sentence><sentence id="1805">And after the second one, grenade, he went into the the sprouts and he hid underneath there, and after while the SS came to the cellar because there was no movement, and they looked and they didn't see anybody and they were saying, "He must be here, he must be here." </sentence><sentence id="1806">And they looked and then finally one of the SS had an idea to look under this and they discovered him. </sentence><sentence id="1807">And then they bound his hands. </sentence><sentence id="1808">Matter of fact, one of the SS man discovered him was from the political department and he knew him personally and he said, his name was Anton Vikrent [ph] and he said, "Ah, das bist du, Anton" [ph]. </sentence><sentence id="1809">He said, "oh, it's you, Anton." </sentence><sentence id="1810">And they did bound his hands behind his back and, and took him, put him on a truck and the truck was going, you know. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="1811">They put him with his back to the caboose or whatever you call it and the SS were sitting on each side of the truck. </sentence><sentence id="1812">And at one time he knew that if, if they going to cross the tracks which might make a bump, he knew that he was very close to the camp and it was time to escape. </sentence><sentence id="1813">Anyway. </sentence><sentence id="1814">He loosened his hands in the back and, as it when through the tracks he jumped out and jumped straight on the street. </sentence><sentence id="1815">He broke his collarbone and his face, you know, was one mess of blood. </sentence><sentence id="1816">He picked himself up and he run straight on the road before they stopped the truck. </sentence><sentence id="1817">He was quite a long distance away. </sentence><sentence id="1818">Anyway, he was running, you know. </sentence><sentence id="1819">He said I didn't look any way, left or right. </sentence><sentence id="1820">I just run straight, and then he came to a house. </sentence><sentence id="1821">We had some safe houses where the people would house us and he went there. </sentence><sentence id="1822">And this lady of the house, you know, took care of his wound and so on, and afterwards the search came. </sentence><sentence id="1823">Matter of fact, he -- she pretended that she is not well and she went to bed and he hid behind her in bed, was lying behind her. </sentence><sentence id="1824">In Poland winters are quite cold and they have andthe _are quite thick, so when the SS came to the house, she pretended that she is very sick. </sentence><sentence id="1825">And matter of fact -- and the SS were very afraid of catching any disease or anything -- so they just glanced through and walked out. </sentence><sentence id="1826">So the next day I think I came back from the mountains back again and we took him to another place. </sentence><sentence id="1827">We had to take him on a cart. </sentence><sentence id="1828">That's how he survived. </sentence><sentence id="1829">And he lives today in Edmonton, Canad </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1830">A: </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2017">A: No, no. </sentence><sentence id="2018">But we knew there was a plan to destroy the evidence. </sentence><sentence id="2019">The whole camp was called Fuhrer . </sentence><sentence id="2020">He was a very cruel man. </sentence><sentence id="2021">You better watch out, and you didn't take -- if you didn't take your cap off in time, he would kill you right away. </sentence><sentence id="2022">And I only know this from hearing. </sentence><sentence id="2023">I didn't witness it myself. </sentence><sentence id="2024">But he was able -- apparently he was taking the Jewish children by the feet and, you know, hitting with the head against the wall or throwing them alive in the pits, which where they burned the body and burning them alive. </sentence><sentence id="2025">He was a monster of a man. </sentence><sentence id="2026">He was a blond and he had a plan. </sentence><sentence id="2027">He came with the proposal to the commandant they he knew how to destroy the evidence and what he wanted to do was to bomb, you know, and to get bombers and then machine guns and tanks, and of course, the German Command couldn't afford it. </sentence><sentence id="2028">It was already 1944.They were losing end of "44. </sentence><sentence id="2029">They were losing the war and they couldn't possibly commit big forces to destroy the camp. </sentence><sentence id="2030">So it fell flat. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2046">Q: You knew about that plan in the camp? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="2048"> A Yes, we did know that. </sentence><sentence id="2049">We knew that there was -- we knew that the Germans are not going to do that. </sentence><sentence id="2050">They would try to destroy the evidence. </sentence><sentence id="2051">We knew. </sentence><sentence id="2052">We didn't know of course, in what form and how it would be done. </sentence><sentence id="2053">But we did know. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2060">Q: Did you know why -- ? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2062">A: Because they did it in the prior, in the other camps which were further east. </sentence><sentence id="2063">They did destroy much of the evidence. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2066">Q: And you heard about that? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2068">A: Oh, yes, yes. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2070">Q: And did you know what was going on in the war on the outside? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2072">A: Yes, we did know. </sentence><sentence id="2073">I'll tell you how we knew. </sentence><sentence id="2074">How we did know, we had the electricians and the -- through the electricians they brought -- when a radio went on the blink, and the electricians never released a radio, and they never repaired it until they got another radio and they repaired it right away, and we listened to BBC and we had all the information. </sentence><sentence id="2075">Matter of fact, in my office I had a big map of Europe and one of the prisoners, who also was a Clerk in one of the -- oh, yeah. </sentence><sentence id="2076">It was a paner. </sentence><sentence id="2077">Somehow he got a map, somewhere, I don't know, of Europe and he brought it to my office and he said, can I display it here? </sentence><sentence id="2078">I said, gee, I don't know why not. </sentence><sentence id="2079">What can happen. </sentence><sentence id="2080">So he displayed it i my office. </sentence><sentence id="2081">And in my office I was sitting, on the left hand side there was an SS man. </sentence><sentence id="2082">He was seldom in. </sentence><sentence id="2083">Oh, he was not a bad man. </sentence><sentence id="2084">And on the right side sat a civilian German from Breslau, now Poland, and I was sitting here, my desk here and the map was behind me. </sentence><sentence id="2085">And many times the SS man, when he was in the office -- because he was a supply man, he was traveling all over Europe getting supplies for the camp. </sentence><sentence id="2086">The camp was constantly being built, you know, enlarged -- so whenever he was in the office and he looked at the map and he came to me always and he said -- they called me Leo, and he said, Leo, tell me where is the front. </sentence><sentence id="2087">So I told him. </sentence><sentence id="2088">I wasn't afraid. </sentence><sentence id="2089">I told him it's here, here. </sentence><sentence id="2090">We went to the map and I said, here. </sentence><sentence id="2091">Oh, it's impossible. </sentence><sentence id="2092">Oh, you crazy. </sentence><sentence id="2093">Our people say that it is there. </sentence><sentence id="2094">And I say, well, you believe your people and I believe whatever you want, but I'm telling you that's what they say. </sentence><sentence id="2095">So they knew. </sentence><sentence id="2096">They knew that we were. </sentence><sentence id="2097">We were organized. </sentence><sentence id="2098">We were, and if it wasn't for the uncertain of life, it would be bearable. </sentence><sentence id="2099">But you knew around you everything was all the gassing and the smell of it, and you knew what was going on. </sentence><sentence id="2100">So -- but we -- the SS, later on in 1944, they knew that the war -- but of course, they couldn't say anything. </sentence><sentence id="2101">They couldn't say, but they knew it was crumbling. </sentence><sentence id="2102">Now, you know, and that the end -- and this particular SS man, his name was . </sentence><sentence id="2103">He came from Silesia and he spoke some Polish. </sentence><sentence id="2104">These people spoke both Polish and German, and he was the purchaser. </sentence><sentence id="2105">He was going around and apparently, what he said, that he took over a Jewish owned enterprise, you know, in his hometown and he got to, you know, for nothing. </sentence><sentence id="2106">And what he was doing when he got purchases traveling over all Europe, it went first to his enterprise and then from there he sold it to the camp. </sentence><sentence id="2107">So he was making money hand over fist. </sentence><sentence id="2108">He was very shrewd, sly shrewd. </sentence><sentence id="2109">But he never, never did anything wrong to me or as far as I know to nobody else. </sentence><sentence id="2110">There were many, many SS people who were from that part of the Auschwitz was in Silesia actually, and many of them were from that part of the country, and they were all mostly all bilingual. </sentence><sentence id="2111">And some of them had Polish names but they were Germans. </sentence><sentence id="2112">And I think -- especially the civilian. </sentence><sentence id="2113">The civilian from Breslau, Polish. </sentence><sentence id="2114">He was constricted, you know, he was sent here as a civilian because he couldn't serve in the army. </sentence><sentence id="2115">He had some -- he was lame in one leg and therefore, couldn't serve in the Armed Forces. </sentence><sentence id="2116">But they assigned him here and he was very unhappy and he told me and I did -- he was a decent man. </sentence><sentence id="2117">I wrote through him to my family and he took the letters, and my family sent to his address and he brought the letters to me which were, you know, going without the censor. </sentence><sentence id="2118">And next to my office there was an office. </sentence><sentence id="2119">The partitions were all glass partitions and we could see there were four offices, and right next to mine was an office where there were ten Jewish girls, and they were all bilingual or even more and all of them spoke excellent German, and they could take shorthand in German. </sentence><sentence id="2120">And they were girls from Czechoslovakia, from Slovakia, from Hungary. </sentence><sentence id="2121">One was from Holland. </sentence><sentence id="2122">There were two German girls, one Polish girl. </sentence><sentence id="2123">Matter of fact, the one Polish girl, they married -- they all got out. </sentence><sentence id="2124">All the ten girls, they were evacuated. </sentence><sentence id="2125">I escaped but they were evacuated later on and they survived, and the Polish girl survived. </sentence><sentence id="2126">And later on she came to London is and I met her in London when I was in London, and she met a Polish fellow -- also the name is Savinsky -- and they married. </sentence><sentence id="2127">She got married. </sentence><sentence id="2128">He was a Polish lawyer and she married this lawyer. </sentence><sentence id="2129">He died since and they had one child, a son. </sentence><sentence id="2130">And whenever I am in London now I still see her and so. </sentence><sentence id="2131">And the other girls, you know, they all survived and I corresponded with one for sometime. </sentence><sentence id="2132">She was in Prague in Czechoslovakia but after a while I did stop writing to her and they did stop writing to me. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2195">Q: Did they live in Auschwitz too and then come there from the morning to work? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2197">A: Yes. </sentence><sentence id="2198">These girls had a special quarters. </sentence><sentence id="2199">These quarters were not in our camp. </sentence><sentence id="2200">Our camp and compound was separately, only men, only men. </sentence><sentence id="2201">And these girls and there were other that worked in different offices. </sentence><sentence id="2202">They had one block, there. </sentence><sentence id="2203">But these girls and there were other who worked in different other offices, they had one block. </sentence><sentence id="2204">There were blocks built where the SS lived. </sentence><sentence id="2205">Some of the SS were quartered and they had one block, and they lived. </sentence><sentence id="2206">How they -- if they were surrounded by guards, I don't know. </sentence><sentence id="2207">I was never there. </sentence><sentence id="2208">And that's where they lived and they came every day in the morning to work. </sentence><sentence id="2209">They were very, very smart girls, excellent typists. </sentence><sentence id="2210">And this one girl, because many times I had some typing for them to do, and this one girl she talked, you know, with me and typed a mile a minute and reading that and talking to me. </sentence><sentence id="2211">I just couldn't believe how she did it. </sentence><sentence id="2212">So they were excellent workers. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2229">Q: In that time period in the winter then, in the winter of "44 after you escaped and you were with the Partisans, in that time period in the early spring of "45 did you happen to see any death marches or did -- ? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2231">A: No, I didn't. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2233">Q: And did the Partisans know about them? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2235">A: No, we didn't know. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2237">Q: Didn't know the camps were getting evacuated? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2239">A: Well, we suspected it but we don't know, no. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2241">Q: Now, I'm going to go back. </sentence><sentence id="2242">I just want you to, as if we haven't talked before, I want you to tell me a little bit about being the clerk, because we sort of covered that in the context of other stories and I think that was a really important job. </sentence><sentence id="2243">And I want you to tell me a little bit about that. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2247">A: Well, as I said, the administration of the camp is, the administration of the camp, the top administration was SS. </sentence><sentence id="2248">The commandant at one was Rudolf Hess, and afterwards they changed and everything was the SS. </sentence><sentence id="2249">The political department was, you know, chief of the political was and -- but in the political department, you know, the clerical work was done by the prisoners and the camp itself, the compound itself, all the evidence, all the registration was done, everything was done by prisoners, by prisoners. </sentence><sentence id="2250">The roll call, the preparation of the roll call for the evening and the morning was done by prisoners. </sentence><sentence id="2251">The SS were only, were taking the prepared things, you know, from the clerks of the different blocks. </sentence><sentence id="2252">The evidence, they took it and then they went to the Report Fuhrer in the front and they reported everything is okay. </sentence><sentence id="2253">And then this Report Fuhrer in turn went to the camp commandant, all everything is accounted for. </sentence><sentence id="2254">If somebody died in the night, they had to come and be laid out, you know, for the roll call. </sentence><sentence id="2255">Dead or alive you had to be accounted for. </sentence><sentence id="2256">Now, in all the work like, for instance, in the workshops where I was there was only one SS man in charge of the carpentry and one SS man of the whole workshops, all the workshops. </sentence><sentence id="2257">So all the other clerical work had to be done by the prisoners, and the SS relied upon it. </sentence><sentence id="2258">They relied. </sentence><sentence id="2259">I mean of course, it was for us, it was easier because we had an easy job. </sentence><sentence id="2260">We were not exposed to the elements. </sentence><sentence id="2261">We sat at a desk. </sentence><sentence id="2262">We didn't get any more bread. </sentence><sentence id="2263">We didn't get any more. </sentence><sentence id="2264">We didn't have any other privileges. </sentence><sentence id="2265">Once we went to the camp, we were just again an ordinary prisoner, except that we were already old prisoners. </sentence><sentence id="2266">We already knew other prisoners and other prisoners knew us and that was the only advantage that we had. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2287">Q: Now, when prisoners got taken out to work the ratio was quite different with the SS, is that right? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2289">A: The ratio was -- if they went I don't know the name, guards. </sentence><sentence id="2290">You see, let me put it this way. </sentence><sentence id="2291">When we went in to the compound to work, I mean, to sleep, then the guards surrounding the compound were those only on the towers, right? </sentence><sentence id="2292">And then there was the guardhouse and all the big chain of commands when we went to work were taken out and taken back to the barracks, you know, they were free. </sentence><sentence id="2293">When we went out in the morning to work, then they, through the big chain of guards around on which territories, some prisoners like myself, because I had to go with orders to different parts of the camp. </sentence><sentence id="2294">I could move freely but I couldn't go beyond the big chain of guards. </sentence><sentence id="2295">Once you wanted to go beyond this, you had to be accompanied by an SS man. </sentence><sentence id="2296">In other words, you were out of the camp altogether. </sentence><sentence id="2297">The ratio was so, one prisoner, one guard; two prisoners, one guard; but three prisoners, two guards and so on. </sentence><sentence id="2298">And so on it progressed. </sentence><sentence id="2299">The more prisoners the more guards and the ratio was mostly one prisoner for two. </sentence><sentence id="2300">Four prisoners, two guards and so on. </sentence><sentence id="2301">That's how it was. </sentence><sentence id="2302">So -- but with the greater chain you could move freely. </sentence><sentence id="2303">Some prisoners could, some prisoners, but the whole administration relied very much on the prison work. </sentence><sentence id="2304">The Germans couldn't do it without, for instance, the architects and engineers who worked, the doctors. </sentence><sentence id="2305">There was a chief doctor SS doctor and there were chief engineers in the camp. </sentence><sentence id="2306">But most of the work, you know, the donkey work was done by the prisoners, by the engineers, architects, prisoners and they were Jewish, you know, engineers working and Polish and Czech. </sentence><sentence id="2307">There were no German prisoner. </sentence><sentence id="2308">There were some draftsmen, yes, who were German. </sentence><sentence id="2309">There was one Polish prisoner. </sentence><sentence id="2310">He was an engineer and apparently, he was so good and he was -- yes, I remember his name was . </sentence><sentence id="2311">He was an engineer, a civil engineer and he was from the town of Auschwitz itself, prewar he live there, and he knew the territories and he did all the -- how do you say, the draining and so on of turf because it was very damp. </sentence><sentence id="2312">Matter of fact, they appreciated him so much they released him from the camp. </sentence><sentence id="2313">They released him and he could work as a civilian engineer. </sentence><sentence id="2314">He had to report every morning, you know, to work but he could live outside the camp, but he was -- he had to be committed to work in the camp, and that's the only one. </sentence><sentence id="2315">And I think another one, a builder and he was also Polish and we was a construction engineer and he built most of the big -- and he was also released, but could work as a civilian and live outside the camp. </sentence><sentence id="2316">So that's two instance which I remember which took place. </sentence><sentence id="2317">For instance, this fellow , this civil engineer, his brother was also in the camp but of course, he was not released and he was a chemical engineer and they wouldn't let him. </sentence><sentence id="2318">Now, there were -- I started talking about there were actually three big camps. </sentence><sentence id="2319">There was Auschwitz One and Auschwitz Two, which was Birkenau and Auschwitz Three which was Monowice. </sentence><sentence id="2320">Monowice was east of the city of Auschwitz, and it was -- there was two big complexes of synthetic rubber factories and synthetic gas plants, and I remember when these were built, and I think they were not finished until 1943. </sentence><sentence id="2321">And the prisoners who worked there, they had to get up around when it was still dark. </sentence><sentence id="2322">Then they had to go by train, if the trains were running, they loaded them on the train. </sentence><sentence id="2323">They didn't come back from work until late when it was dark, many times very dark. </sentence><sentence id="2324">And then they got the Russians. </sentence><sentence id="2325">Most of the workers were Jewish and many of them died by the thousands because of the hard labor. </sentence><sentence id="2326">They were digging for the foundations and the meager rations and the long hours, it was terrible. </sentence><sentence id="2327">Nobody wanted to go to this commando, but I think there were thousands of prisoners who had to work and thousands of them were dying and so that, these were the three main camps. </sentence><sentence id="2328">Then there were set camp subcamps all over the place. </sentence><sentence id="2329">There were subcamps. </sentence><sentence id="2330">Some of them were even in Czechoslovakia, in the mines, coal mines. </sentence><sentence id="2331">Many prisoners worked in the coal mines. </sentence><sentence id="2332">There were times when I think close to 200,000 prisoners. </sentence><sentence id="2333">Can you imagine, 200,000? </sentence><sentence id="2334">That's a big city, 200,000. </sentence><sentence id="2335">Those who were in the camp who got numbers and so on, there were approximately over 400,000 which were numbered and tattooed and, you know, the numbers tattooed, the tattooed number. </sentence><sentence id="2336">At the beginning when I came we were not tattooed. </sentence><sentence id="2337">The orders came later on in 1942 when everybody had to be tattooed, and then we had to be tattooed and were tattooed and then inspected if w truly did carry out the orders. </sentence><sentence id="2338">And the new arrivals after that day were tattooed right away at registration. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2390">Q: Did you work -- did you ever meet Rudolf Hess? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2392">A: Yes. </sentence><sentence id="2393">Matter of fact, I did and I tell you how. </sentence><sentence id="2394">I worked as a clerk in the carpentry and the Oberkapo of the carpentry was a German criminal but a very decent fellow. </sentence><sentence id="2395">His name was -- I forget his first name -- and I was the clerk. </sentence><sentence id="2396">Matter of fact, he put me in the clerkship there because I was an ordinary carpenter, but he knew of me that I spoke German and he couldn't get along with the clerk that was there. </sentence><sentence id="2397">He was also a Polish fellow but he couldn't get along because this fellow the Oberkapo, he was an operator. </sentence><sentence id="2398">He did things, you know, on the left as we say. </sentence><sentence id="2399">He did things, you know, had furniture made for some of the SS for which he got some cigarettes and sometimes even liquor. </sentence><sentence id="2400">And so he did it and, you know, and this fellow in the office there the Pole apparently, they didn't agree and he wouldn't assign the wood to it, and so they through him out. </sentence><sentence id="2401">And then he took me and I said, look, I don't know anything about. </sentence><sentence id="2402">I'm not a carpenter. </sentence><sentence id="2403">I don't know how to assign the wood, how much wood is necessary for this. </sentence><sentence id="2404">He said, oh, never mind. </sentence><sentence id="2405">You learn. </sentence><sentence id="2406">And I said, okay. </sentence><sentence id="2407">So one day he did. </sentence><sentence id="2408">He had a plate carved, you know, carved and beautiful work. </sentence><sentence id="2409">There were artists, you know, in the paners and we had artists who came from the Polish School of Academy of Arts, professors, beautiful work. </sentence><sentence id="2410">So this one plate was carved. </sentence><sentence id="2411">And he said, take this to the commandant's wife. </sentence><sentence id="2412">You know, he was an operator. </sentence><sentence id="2413">I said, I don't know whether she ordered it or -- anyway, he said, take it to her. </sentence><sentence id="2414">So I said, okay. </sentence><sentence id="2415">So, to their house you could go through the back through the garden because the house of the commandant, Rudolf Hess, was right near the road, and there was another guardhouse nearby and you couldn't go on the road to get to the house, but through the garden you could get through if -- and so I went. </sentence><sentence id="2416">I went through the garden and as I walked to the house through the garden, was Hess and he saw me and he stopped me, and he said, what are you doing here? </sentence><sentence id="2417">And I said, I was sent by the Kapo of the carpentry, you know, to deliver this to Fraulein Hess. </sentence><sentence id="2418">And he looked at me and he said, oh, okay. </sentence><sentence id="2419">And I went into the house and I give it to them, . </sentence><sentence id="2420">I told that this is from Kapo of the carpentry so she said oh, wait, wait. </sentence><sentence id="2421">I give you some cigarettes and she did go and brought me, but not a full. </sentence><sentence id="2422">And she said, oh, I don't know where my husband keeps the packages of cigarettes. </sentence><sentence id="2423">And they gave me already a started pack of cigarettes and she gave it to me and I, of course, took it to the Kapo and gave it to him, and I told him I didn't take the cigarettes out. </sentence><sentence id="2424">I didn't want him to think I was taking. </sentence><sentence id="2425">I didn't smoke anyway. </sentence><sentence id="2426">So that's the one time where I did meet Rudolf Hess, yes, and I did speak to him. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2462">Q: Okay. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2464">A: Of course, as you know he was captured after the war and he was hung, he was tried. </sentence><sentence id="2465">He was brought back to Poland and he was tried and convicted to, you know, to death. </sentence><sentence id="2466">And then he was hung in Auschwitz itself in the camp, facing the camp. </sentence><sentence id="2467">He was hung. </sentence></p></dialogue>
