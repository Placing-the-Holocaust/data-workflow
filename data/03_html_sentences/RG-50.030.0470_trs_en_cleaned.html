<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="152">A: Giza plays an important role in my life. </sentence><sentence id="153">Well, Blanka does too in some sense because basically they lived sort of together. </sentence><sentence id="154">The family lived together. </sentence><sentence id="155">It was a small town. </sentence><sentence id="156">Giza was ten years, I'm sorry, fifteen years older than my mother. </sentence><sentence id="157">So, she often was sort of active as my mother's mother in they -- I see pictures that they had traveled together, for example, all three sisters to the seashore. </sentence><sentence id="158">The middle sister got married fairly young and had two children, two daughters -- Zdenka and Vera. </sentence><sentence id="159">Their name was Appler, and the youngest -- the youngest daughter, my mother, was eventually sent to a school in Cakovec which is another small town, much larger town actually than Ludbreg, much closer even to the Hungarian border, and she went there to a teacher's -- a teacher's school, became an elementary school teacher. </sentence><sentence id="160">The middle sister who was married, was married to Rudi Appler, who came to Ludbreg, opened a store, and that's -- and that's where they had two children. </sentence><sentence id="161">The oldest of the three, Giza, worked in the bank, in the Ludbreg Bank, and there she met a person who was to play a large part in my life and that was Ludva Vrancic. </sentence><sentence id="162">Ljudevit is actually his real name. </sentence><sentence id="163">I'll get back to him. </sentence><sentence id="164">The brother Erne worked in Zagreb, worked early in Zagreb, and I'm not exactly sure what he did there. </sentence><sentence id="165">I think clerical work of some sort. </sentence><sentence id="166">I'm not sure of what he did. </sentence><sentence id="167">And the -- my mother eventually finished the teacher's school and worked as a teacher in a small village near Ludbreg for a short period of time. </sentence><sentence id="168">Then my father and she met and married and left to live in Zagreb, and that's how I happened to have been born in Zagreb. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="186">Q: So, let me ask you something, you were a very, very young child when the war came in 1941. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="188">A: Right. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="190">Q: So, what I need you to try to do is to distinguish what you've learned from other people and what you actually remember, because you were so little. </sentence><sentence id="191">So, if you can, as you speak, make that distinction, it might be very helpful. </sentence><sentence id="192">So, this is what my first question is for </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="203">Q: Images? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="205">A: Yes, I have in my head an image of my mother, but it's very hard to really tell because I was fortunate to have a lot of pictures of my parents, which I think a lot of children that lived through the Holocaust never got to have. </sentence><sentence id="206">And so it's very difficult because I've seen those pictures all my life. </sentence><sentence id="207">It's very difficult to really distinguish what's memory and what's a photograph that you have in your head. </sentence><sentence id="208">So, I think I have an image in my head, but I can't really tell you whether I do or don't. </sentence><sentence id="209">I think I have an image of myself leaving on a train, because I left apparently when I was three years old. </sentence><sentence id="210">I left Zagreb with friends of my grandparents and went to Ludbreg, and that happened before, just before, the war started, from what I understand. </sentence><sentence id="211">And, again, I don't have any idea whether -- because people often ask me whether I remember whether I was sent away because my parents were afraid of what's going to happen, or whether I was just going to visit my family just to visit my family or whether my mother, who already -- my brother had already been born, he was three years younger than I -- whether, you know, she said, you know, why not have this kid go away while she has a baby? </sentence><sentence id="212">I have no -- no idea why I was sent except there was an opportunity. </sentence><sentence id="213">These neighbors came and I went with them, and I don't remember being tearful or I don't remember the farewell. </sentence><sentence id="214">I don't remember any of that, but that was the last time I saw my parents. </sentence><sentence id="215">I don't remember any farewells. </sentence><sentence id="216">I remember sort of being on the train and there being fun. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="229">Q: It was fun? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="231">A: Mm-hmm. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="233">Q: Was that the first time you were on a train? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="235">A: Oh, I think so, probably. </sentence><sentence id="236">Well, I don't know. </sentence><sentence id="237">It's very hard to tell. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="241">Q: Do you remember the birth of your brother? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="243">A: No. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="247">A: No. </sentence><sentence id="248">No. </sentence><sentence id="249">I mean, I remember him, however, when I do remember him very well is when he was brought to Ludbreg. </sentence><sentence id="250">That I remember. </sentence><sentence id="251">That I really do remember. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="257">Q: So, were you told about your mother going to school, because clearly you were too young. </sentence><sentence id="258">Your mother wouldn't have explained to you that she was a teacher. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="261"> This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="262">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="263"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="264">A: No, none of that. </sentence><sentence id="265">I'm just saying the background of what really -- of what this family was all about, who was who. </sentence><sentence id="266">I have not the foggiest. </sentence><sentence id="267">No, of course not, because all of that happened before I was born. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="272">Q: What did your father do? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="274">A: My father had apparently learned the trade of brushmaking, and had opened a workshop to make brushes. </sentence><sentence id="275">From what I am told by his surviving brother, he was very good at it, and by the time that I was born, I can tell from, again, from the pictures of him, what people told me, there was a small workshop with, I don't know, ten or so workmen, and there was machinery and they made brushes and was very successful at it. </sentence><sentence id="276">But, I, again, don't have any memory of it. </sentence><sentence id="277">I only know pictures and stories. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="282">Q: Is this difficult for you as an adult person thinking about who were these parents and what you have are paper pictures? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="284">A: It's not actually that difficult. </sentence><sentence id="285">The reason for it is that it was not a new discovery that I made as an adult. </sentence><sentence id="286">If I had known nothing of that, and all of a sudden as an adult it came upon me, yes, of course, it would have been difficult. </sentence><sentence id="287">But I grew up with all of that. </sentence><sentence id="288">It's -- it's just part and parcel of my growing up. </sentence><sentence id="289">I always heard stories and always knew who I was and I always had these pictures so that, you know, it's, you know, you just to grow up with stories. </sentence><sentence id="290">That's all. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="298">Q: So, you go to Ludberg- </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="300">A: Ludbreg, which actually has a meaning. </sentence><sentence id="301">The word "lud" in Croatian means crazy or mad. </sentence><sentence id="302">This is kind of crazy. </sentence><sentence id="303">And "breg", I think, means a mountain, but it also could be the words got transposed and it was "berg" which means town. </sentence><sentence id="304">So, I don't know. </sentence><sentence id="305">Nobody ever explained why this is called that, but it's Ludbreg. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="312">Q: Do you have a first memory of Ludbreg? </sentence><sentence id="313">Remember arriving? </sentence><sentence id="314">You don't remember - </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="320">Q: With your grandparents? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="322">A: I remember very well being with my grandparents. </sentence><sentence id="323">That I do remember, and again, I have certain images like I remember sitting with my grandfather in a room and playing at his feet, and he was paralyzed already on one side because he had a stroke. </sentence><sentence id="324">And he was trying to pick up the toys that I was playing with, something like that, and he fell. </sentence><sentence id="325">It was a traumatic experience for me. </sentence><sentence id="326">So, I remember that, and I remember Hanukkah. </sentence><sentence id="327">I remember the- </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="334">Q: What happened after he fell? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="336">A: Oh, someone came -- he couldn't pick himself up. </sentence><sentence id="337">This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="338">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="339"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="344">Q: You just-- </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="346">A: I just remember that I was guilty of throwing the toys around or something. </sentence><sentence id="347">So, I remember being upset and crying. </sentence><sentence id="348">So, that's why I remember that. </sentence><sentence id="349">I remember Hanukkah for example, but not the whole thing. </sentence><sentence id="350">I remember candles and I remember getting an orange, which was very exciting. </sentence><sentence id="351">Oranges were not to be had. </sentence><sentence id="352">I remember at Pesach, or before Pesach. </sentence><sentence id="353">I remember that they were burying silverware, and I thought that was a very strange thing to do, but that's apparently what can be done. </sentence><sentence id="354">I found that much later. </sentence><sentence id="355">I had no idea of that. </sentence><sentence id="356">I remember my grandfather sitting in the garden with all of us playing around and he used to -- he used to have his little table in front. </sentence><sentence id="357">This was, mind you, we were living in the house that was attached to the synagogue, and it was also -- and everything -- all the Jewish community matters played themselves out there. </sentence><sentence id="358">So, there was also the school and there were some kind of classrooms, and, of course, that was there much later. </sentence><sentence id="359">It's been destroyed now, but -- so, he would sit in the garden with the little table and he had little piles of money in front of him and there were beggars that were sort of like professional beggars in that town, and they would come Wednesdays and Saturdays because those were market days in Ludbreg, and on Saturdays, of course, he wouldn't do that, but -- that's Shabbat, but on Wednesdays they would sit and they would come and take their little piles. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="374">Q: They, as far as you knew, they were specifically for these particular people? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="376">A: Yes, yes, there was specific people. </sentence><sentence id="377">There was a specific beggar that used to come to our --to the house where I lived much, much later and he would come every Wednesday and would always get alms, and I remember seeing him later on on the train and being like a normal person, you know? </sentence><sentence id="378">It was very strange, but they were characters. </sentence><sentence id="379">Ludbreg's a very small town, and especially was, and everybody sort of knew everybody and there were all these sort of different routines that were going on. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="384">Q: Since you said there were about 30 families who lived here, how much larger was the town? </sentence><sentence id="385">A couple of hundred families? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="388">A: Yes, and all of these families did not live in Ludbreg proper, either. </sentence><sentence id="389">Some of them were in surrounding villages. </sentence><sentence id="390">Ludbreg is sort of like the county seat, and there were many surrounding villages, and those villages did not have either their own Jewish anything, nor did they have even middle schools. </sentence><sentence id="391">For example, later on when I went to middle school, people, kids from those villages would come to school, and that was also the place where market that was happening, and any kind of official papers were held and so on and so forth. </sentence><sentence id="392">So, it was sort of a -- basically like a county seat. </sentence><sentence id="393">So, anyway, back to the images of my grandfather. </sentence><sentence id="394">Those are the images that I have my grandparents, but of course- </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="569">A: When he came, I don't know whether I paid that much attention. </sentence><sentence id="570">Eventually, it was kind of nice having him around sometimes, but sometimes I was -- with time, as he got to be bigger, he played a large role in everybody's life. </sentence><sentence id="571">He was very cute and very smart and I was often very jealous, especially later on, he got to be -- he was very personable and both of us were very redhead. </sentence><sentence id="572">This is very muted now. </sentence><sentence id="573">I mean, I was flaming red and so was he, and he was very cute and he had a very good memory. </sentence><sentence id="574">He'd memorize very long poems, and he would stand up and recite them, and I was like, "Ugh, there he goes again." </sentence><sentence id="575">But, the whole town was very fond of him, and he -- he somehow acquired a nickname "Lovrek" which wasn't his name, and everybody thought it was his name, but it wasn't. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="623">Q: Dora, do you have your first recollection of the effect of a war or something, anything that has to do with this chaos that obviously encumbering Croatia? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="625">A: Well, I-- I have memories that have to do with what must have then been become a persecution, with the issuing of lists, et cetera, et cetera, and you know, historically we know what happened. </sentence><sentence id="626">There were lists, and they, you know, the Ustashe came to Ludbreg and, they -- people were being rounded up. </sentence><sentence id="627">I was not aware of that as such, but I do remember people leaving and I remember being left behind, and I didn't know exactly what was happening. </sentence><sentence id="628">Perhaps, again, they told me, but I didn't understand what they were telling me. </sentence><sentence id="629">But, as I mentioned, my Aunt Blanka and her family lived next door to Aunt Giza and Ludjevit, and basically I remember at one point people coming and we were all in one room and they came with satchels or small suitcases in their hands and pillows under their arms and saying goodbye and leaving. </sentence><sentence id="630">And I didn't know exactly what was going on and why were they leaving and who was crying, and I was sad because these were my cousins, but that's the image that I have in my head of their leaving. </sentence><sentence id="631">And I had the sense that it was, there was something that was dangerous and bad and that people were being taken away. </sentence><sentence id="632">I don't have the image of my grandparents leaving. </sentence><sentence id="633">I don't remember that. </sentence><sentence id="634">I remember my cousins. </sentence><sentence id="635">I know that my grandparents were taken at the same time. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="647">Q: At the same time? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="649">A: Mm-hmm. </sentence><sentence id="650">Fairly early, they all left. </sentence><sentence id="651">I also know that my cousins, I know that now, that my favorite cousins with whom I stayed quite a bit of time and the middle aunt, Blanka, the middle aunt and her husband, that they had left for awhile and went to the Italian part of the country, that they were someplace in Dalmatia. </sentence><sentence id="652">And then there was a proclamation by Pavelic that people who had left, Jews who had left, should return, and if they return they will be spared, nothing will happen to them, and they stupidly returned. </sentence><sentence id="653">I have a very good friend of mine who still lives in Zagreb now. </sentence><sentence id="654">Her family, which was another family in Ludbreg left also, and had left before this proclamation and they cleverly did not return. </sentence><sentence id="655">They were the only Jewish family, in fact, that returned after the war intact because they were smart enough not to return, actually because the mother in the family said she was absolutely not returning, and so they stayed with the Partisans in Partisan- held territory in Kordun. </sentence><sentence id="656">But, people who returned believing that this was going, you know, that they were going to be okay, they were gone. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="665">Q: Is it possible that it was -- there was a list, and people knew they were supposed to go so they didn't have to be rounded up, they went, yes? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="667">A: I think somebody must have come and gotten them and had the list, and I -- I tried to reconstruct why I wasn't taken, and I hadn't thought about it before even to ask my  http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection 2 would be a raid. </sentence><sentence id="668">I have a feeling that I was not on the list. </sentence><sentence id="669">I had seen one of those lists. </sentence><sentence id="670">One of them is published in a book on Ludbreg, which I have, and it lists Ludbreg Jews, and my aunts are there, and everybody's listed, and I'm not on the list, neither is my brother. </sentence><sentence id="671">I have a feeling that the must have gotten the list maybe from the synagogue, from the community center, and of course, I was not, since I was not born in Ludbreg and I was not considered a, you know, a member of the Ludbreg Jews, I was from Zagreb, I was not on that list. </sentence><sentence id="672">That's a possibility. </sentence><sentence id="673">But the other thing is that I know that many times we were warned that there would be a raid, and perhaps I -- if they had been warned, they would have hidden someplace, but I always wondered why in the world were they sitting there? </sentence><sentence id="674">Like sitting ducks. </sentence><sentence id="675">Even I -- I mean I didn't have a choice, of course, I was a child -- but I'm thinking, ""Why in the world were we there?" </sentence><sentence id="676">I recently, my aunt made a tape of her experiences- </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="688">Q: This is Magda? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="690">A: Magda, and she was in Zagreb this whole time. </sentence><sentence id="691">They stayed until the bitter end and they could barely escape at that point. </sentence><sentence id="692">I was like, "Why were you there?" </sentence><sentence id="693">You know, it's very hard for me to understand. </sentence><sentence id="694">It's not hard to understand why they didn't -- why in some places there was no place to go, but I think in Ludbreg, one of the things about Ludbreg, it was a town that was very close to the -- to where the Partisans where. </sentence><sentence id="695">It's at the foot of the mountains, and of course, it was very difficult and Partisans had a very difficult life, but for those of us who were so vulnerable, why we didn't you go someplace into a small village or smaller village. </sentence><sentence id="696">I mean, this was small, but it wasn't really small, not by Croatian standards. </sentence><sentence id="697">Why we stayed there, I don't know. </sentence><sentence id="698">Faith that we would not be wanted? </sentence><sentence id="699">Or something? </sentence><sentence id="700">I don't really know. </sentence><sentence id="701">But I know that often with my Aunt Giza, we would -- we would go places. </sentence><sentence id="702">I remember one time going to Varazdin, which is a larger town nearby, and staying with a relative, and I think this was the time that I understood that it was dangerous to stay and that we had to hide for a few days. </sentence><sentence id="703">The other --all the other hiding that I did was sort of nearby with -- mostly with friends, and there were a number of families. </sentence><sentence id="704">There was the Ziza, the Runjak family, my brother and I would spend some time with, especially Ludbreg -- Ludbreg experienced a lot of fighting. </sentence><sentence id="705">We were really not so much in a concentration camp kind of situation. </sentence><sentence id="706">We were in a war -- we were in a war zone. </sentence><sentence id="707">So, when it was -- when it was time to hide because the Ustashe took town, then I spent, for example, time with this Runjak family, and they had rented from this other house which was now empty. </sentence><sentence id="708">They had rented that apartment, and we stayed with them. </sentence><sentence id="709">And I called Mrs. Runjak "Mother" when I knew that it was dangerous, and I understood at that point what was dangerous, and my brother called her "Mother" all the time because he wouldn't know how to distinguish from when it was dangerous and when it wasn't. </sentence><sentence id="710">So, I lived with them, and they had three teenage children, and it's thoroughly amazing because I remember Ustashe making camp in our backyard, and we were there, and just pretending that we were part of this other family. </sentence><sentence id="711">And it's amazing sometimes because the whole town essentially knew who we were. </sentence><sentence id="712">That's the most amazing part of all. </sentence><sentence id="713">In a small town like that, everybody knew that we were the rabbi's grandchildren, and at no point did anybody say, "What about these kids?" </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="738">Q: So, is there some way in which the town is protecting you? </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="766">Q: In the streets? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="768">A: In the streets, yes. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="770">Q: Really? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="772">A: Yeah, oh yeah. </sentence><sentence id="773">There were -- the street that I lived on was after the war called, "The Street of the 17" Udarna Brigada". </sentence><sentence id="774">1 don't know how to translate -- Brigade is Brigada, of course. </sentence><sentence id="775">Udarna means -- it's striking, one who can strike well, particularly well. </sentence><sentence id="776">And the reason it's called that is because the members of that brigade, the remnant of that brigade lost their lives. </sentence><sentence id="777">They killed themselves at the end of the battle in a house that was down my street because they were totally surrounded. </sentence><sentence id="778">They had fought all night, and they were totally surrounded, and in the end, they just threw a bomb among themselves because they didn't want to be captured. </sentence><sentence id="779">But there were fights and we would spend -- we spent a lot of time in the basement. </sentence><sentence id="780">We had a cellar, not a basement in an American sense. </sentence><sentence id="781">It was a cellar. </sentence><sentence id="782">We had a vineyard, and we had wine, and there were big barrels down there, and shelves and shelves full of apples that were there for the winter. </sentence><sentence id="783">And at one point, we had beds down there, rollaway beds. </sentence><sentence id="784">And we spent every night there because we knew that there would be bad fighting. </sentence><sentence id="785">Sometimes, but sometimes, we would forget to go down there on time, and -- not forget -- I'm sorry, we didn't know that we should go down there on time. </sentence><sentence id="786">So, then if a fight -- if a battle started, there was no way to get there because you had to get out of the house to get -- to go into the cellar, and so it was too dangerous already to do that. </sentence><sentence id="787">So, we stayed in the house. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="804">Q: Where would you stay? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="806">A: We -- yeah, I remember. </sentence><sentence id="807">That I remember very well. </sentence><sentence id="808">Sometimes the bullets were flying like crazy through the house. </sentence><sentence id="809">There was one night, I won't forget, where the house across the street was a two-story house and ours was a one-story house, and they were shooting from our backyard into that house across the street back and forth. </sentence><sentence id="810">The bullets were flying through our windows, and I was sleeping on the sofa in a corner. </sentence><sentence id="811">So, if you can imagine a corner and then window-window. </sentence><sentence id="812">So, I was fairly well protected, but I was scared to death and I don't have any recollection of where my brother, but my aunt and uncle were sleeping in the room next to my room, and for some strange reason, I think This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="813">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="814"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection 4 everybody was kind of paralyzed that no one left there, but there was a window that was -- that was right facing out from this bedroom, and I remember crying and asking for somebody to come, and finally my uncle got up and came, and no sooner did he come to comfort me than a bullet landed on the pillow of his bed. </sentence><sentence id="815">He would've been killed if not for the fact that I had been crying. </sentence><sentence id="816">But in the morning sometimes, you looked out the window -- I remember one time it was a horrible battle, and we looked -- in Croatia you have these -- they're not shades in our sense. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="830">Q: Shutters? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="832">A: No, not even shutters. </sentence><sentence id="833">They're more like our Venetian blinds, but they are on the outside and they are wooden, and you pull them up like that, but so, you can also turn them so that you can kind of peer out. </sentence><sentence id="834">I remember peering out, and that is a recollection I definitely have of carriages going by our windows full of dead -- nude, dead bodies because they had collected them and then just stripped them of clothes and were taking them someplace. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="846">Q: Did you see that often? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="848">A: No, not often. </sentence><sentence id="849">I remember that one very well. </sentence><sentence id="850">We lived on a main -- pretty much main street on the corner of two very important main streets so that when things went by, we saw them. </sentence><sentence id="851">And, also, often -- well, as these bullets would come through, I mean, after the war, our living room and one of the bedrooms were riddled with bullets, and the -- we had these armoires and cabinets of books and they had bullet holes through them, and if you opened the tablecloths, it looked like a doily, you know, all full of beautifully separated. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="856">Q: If you couldn't get into the cellar, would you lie on the floor so that you wouldn't be by a window? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="858">A: Sometimes, yes, and we would sometimes also go into the side of the house that didn't have windows to the street. </sentence><sentence id="859">There was one side of the house into the hallway, except that one night that I remember so well, when we stupidly stayed where we shouldn't have stayed. </sentence><sentence id="860">I think sometimes it was so bad that nobody wanted to move. </sentence><sentence id="861">But most of the time, -- most of the -- it's very -- it's horrible, I hate to say that, but I remember being quite exhilarated by it all at times. </sentence><sentence id="862">I should have been -- instead of being afraid, I used to think it was sort of very exciting to have these battles going on, and thinking it was quite great fun to sleep down in the cellar where there were always some frogs jumping around. </sentence><sentence id="863">This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="864">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="865"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection 5 </sentence></p></dialogue>
