<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="19">A: T-e-o. It got changed much later on when I got American citizenship. </sentence><sentence id="20">Once I came to the States, I got tired of telling everybody that my name was just like Theodora, but without the "h"". </sentence><sentence id="21">So, when I got my citizenship, and was asked if I would like to change anything in my name, I said, "Yes, please give me an "h"." [ </sentence><sentence id="22">Laughs.] </sentence><sentence id="23">So, that's how, but I did not change- </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="29">Q: So, that's how the "h" came. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="31">A: That's how the "h" came. </sentence><sentence id="32">The Rachela part I kept as is, even though, of course, it's Rachel, but it wasn't important to change, and since I mostly just use my initials, so I didn't change that. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="41">A: Ihave had a variety of nicknames. </sentence><sentence id="42">I use Dora. </sentence><sentence id="43">I noticed that in the pictures during my childhood, that sometimes there is a photograph when I was like six months old that was sent by my mother to my grandparents, and it says, "Tea". </sentence><sentence id="44">So, at one point, I had the nickname Tea from Thea, but I don't remember being called that. </sentence><sentence id="45">Then, in Croatia, Dora is a rather sort of, a name, a very folksy name used usually sort of used for old ladies, and that's not what I was ever called. </sentence><sentence id="46">I was called "Dorica" as a child. </sentence><sentence id="47">So, if we go back now, I'm still called Dorica, and at home, I often was also called "Dorek", and when I came here, I became "Dora", and that's how it's -- it's sticking to that one now. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="55">Q: So, no one here calls you Dorica? </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="61">A: It's very -- it's sort of very -- it's -- its, diminutive names are used a lot in all Slavic countries. </sentence><sentence id="62">So, it's very normal for someone from a Slavic country to use that, but it's really not -- it sounds very strange, I think, in English. </sentence><sentence id="63">I know a young woman who lives here who's from Belgrade, and she's called Bekica, and it's Becky, and to me it's like sounds very strange. </sentence><sentence id="64">It's sort of like, you know, Dolly or something like that, and you don't use those names very much. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="69">Q: When were you born? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="71">A: January 31, 1938. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="73">Q: And, you were born- </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="75">A: In Zagreb. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="77">Q: In Zagreb? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="79">A: I was born in Zagreb. </sentence><sentence id="80">I was born in Zagreb, apparently. </sentence><sentence id="81">I checked that about two years after my parents were married, and I lived there only the first two and a half, three years of my life. </sentence><sentence id="82">My mother was not originally Zagreb. </sentence><sentence id="83">My father's family lived in Zagreb, and that not for a very long time in history. </sentence><sentence id="84">I mean, they came, I think, when my father was already in his early teens or so. </sentence><sentence id="85">They came mostly from Bosnia. </sentence><sentence id="86">They were not however Sefardi. </sentence><sentence id="87">They had come there from, I think, elsewhere in Europe. </sentence><sentence id="88">And then came to live in Zagreb, and my father's family tended to be cantors. </sentence><sentence id="89">They were very -- it was a very religious family, and they studied cantorial music and one of them, one of my uncles, Arnold, was actually a cantor and had studied very seriously. </sentence><sentence id="90">Another uncle, Joseph, also studied seriously. </sentence><sentence id="91">My father, I think, went to Ludbreg, to another little town, to -- also to be a cantor at times, and met my mother. </sentence><sentence id="92">So, my mother's family was from a different town. </sentence><sentence id="93">They were from the town, a very small town called Ludbreg; it's further north from Zagreb on the Hungarian border, really very close to Hungary, but that town, in contrast to others, did not have a Hungarian population. </sentence><sentence id="94">I never learned Hungarian. </sentence><sentence id="95">My mother apparently did. </sentence><sentence id="96">My grandfather on my mother's side was the rabbi of that town, Ludbreg. </sentence><sentence id="97">There were some 30 plus Jewish families. </sentence><sentence id="98">I think about, according to some books that I've seen, about 37 Jewish families. </sentence><sentence id="99">And my grandfather, I believe, was invited to come and be a rabbi there, and they came from Czechoslovakia, and he -- he came from Bratislava already with his -- with the family, and so I don't know exactly how old he was, but from what I gather, most of his writing, he did quite a bit of writing, published, was in German, though he did learn Croatian, spoke in Croatian, but I think all of his writing is in German. </sentence><sentence id="100">I have papers where he wrote by hand and you can see that. </sentence><sentence id="101">Though his publications are in Croatian -- I have some of the stuff that he published mostly treaties on the Torah and so on, so I don't know exactly. </sentence><sentence id="102">I've only been told all these things, and I don't know really if he wrote in German and someone translated, or whether he wrote directly in Croatian. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="128">Q: What was your father's name? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="130"> A My father's name is Salamon -- Shlomo, Salamon, and my mother's name was Silva, which is Silvia, of course. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="132">Q: And her maiden name was Deutsch? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="134">A: Deutsch. </sentence><sentence id="135">So, my grandfather, my maternal grandfather was Leopold Deutsch. </sentence><sentence id="136">My grandmother was Katarina, and they had three children. </sentence><sentence id="137">I'm sorry, they had three daughters and a son, four children. </sentence><sentence id="138">The oldest -- the oldest daughter was Giza, then Blanka, and then Silva, and the son was Emme. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="144">Q: And Giza plays an important role in your life? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="146">A: Giza plays an important role in my life. </sentence><sentence id="147">Well, Blanka does too in some sense because basically they lived sort of together. </sentence><sentence id="148">The family lived together. </sentence><sentence id="149">It was a small town. </sentence><sentence id="150">Giza was ten years, I'm sorry, fifteen years older than my mother. </sentence><sentence id="151">So, she often was sort of active as my mother's mother in they -- I see pictures that they had traveled together, for example, all three sisters to the seashore. </sentence><sentence id="152">The middle sister got married fairly young and had two children, two daughters -- Zdenka and Vera. </sentence><sentence id="153">Their name was Appler, and the youngest -- the youngest daughter, my mother, was eventually sent to a school in Cakovec which is another small town, much larger town actually than Ludbreg, much closer even to the Hungarian border, and she went there to a teacher's -- a teacher's school, became an elementary school teacher. </sentence><sentence id="154">The middle sister who was married, was married to Rudi Appler, who came to Ludbreg, opened a store, and that's -- and that's where they had two children. </sentence><sentence id="155">The oldest of the three, Giza, worked in the bank, in the Ludbreg Bank, and there she met a person who was to play a large part in my life and that was Ludva Vrancic. </sentence><sentence id="156">Ljudevit is actually his real name. </sentence><sentence id="157">I'll get back to him. </sentence><sentence id="158">The brother Erne worked in Zagreb, worked early in Zagreb, and I'm not exactly sure what he did there. </sentence><sentence id="159">I think clerical work of some sort. </sentence><sentence id="160">I'm not sure of what he did. </sentence><sentence id="161">And the -- my mother eventually finished the teacher's school and worked as a teacher in a small village near Ludbreg for a short period of time. </sentence><sentence id="162">Then my father and she met and married and left to live in Zagreb, and that's how I happened to have been born in Zagreb. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="180">Q: So, let me ask you something, you were a very, very young child when the war came in 1941. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="182">A: Right. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="184">Q: So, what I need you to try to do is to distinguish what you've learned from other people and what you actually remember, because you were so little. </sentence><sentence id="185">So, if you can, as you speak, make that distinction, it might be very helpful. </sentence><sentence id="186">So, this is what my first question is for </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="190"> you. </sentence><sentence id="191">What is your -- do you have any memories before 1941, before you leave Zagreb to go to Ludbreg? </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="192">A: Images. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="194">Q: Images? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="196">A: Yes, I have in my head an image of my mother, but it's very hard to really tell because I was fortunate to have a lot of pictures of my parents, which I think a lot of children that lived through the Holocaust never got to have. </sentence><sentence id="197">And so it's very difficult because I've seen those pictures all my life. </sentence><sentence id="198">It's very difficult to really distinguish what's memory and what's a photograph that you have in your head. </sentence><sentence id="199">So, I think I have an image in my head, but I can't really tell you whether I do or don't. </sentence><sentence id="200">I think I have an image of myself leaving on a train, because I left apparently when I was three years old. </sentence><sentence id="201">I left Zagreb with friends of my grandparents and went to Ludbreg, and that happened before, just before, the war started, from what I understand. </sentence><sentence id="202">And, again, I don't have any idea whether -- because people often ask me whether I remember whether I was sent away because my parents were afraid of what's going to happen, or whether I was just going to visit my family just to visit my family or whether my mother, who already -- my brother had already been born, he was three years younger than I -- whether, you know, she said, you know, why not have this kid go away while she has a baby? </sentence><sentence id="203">I have no -- no idea why I was sent except there was an opportunity. </sentence><sentence id="204">These neighbors came and I went with them, and I don't remember being tearful or I don't remember the farewell. </sentence><sentence id="205">I don't remember any of that, but that was the last time I saw my parents. </sentence><sentence id="206">I don't remember any farewells. </sentence><sentence id="207">I remember sort of being on the train and there being fun. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="220">Q: It was fun? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="222">A: Mm-hmm. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="224">Q: Was that the first time you were on a train? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="226">A: Oh, I think so, probably. </sentence><sentence id="227">Well, I don't know. </sentence><sentence id="228">It's very hard to tell. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="232">Q: Do you remember the birth of your brother? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="234">A: No. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="236">Q: You don't remember him as this tiny little baby? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="238">A: No. </sentence><sentence id="239">No. </sentence><sentence id="240">I mean, I remember him, however, when I do remember him very well is when he was brought to Ludbreg. </sentence><sentence id="241">That I remember. </sentence><sentence id="242">That I really do remember. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="248">Q: So, were you told about your mother going to school, because clearly you were too young. </sentence><sentence id="249">Your mother wouldn't have explained to you that she was a teacher. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="252">A: No, none of that. </sentence><sentence id="253">I'm just saying the background of what really -- of what this family was all about, who was who. </sentence><sentence id="254">I have not the foggiest. </sentence><sentence id="255">No, of course not, because all of that happened before I was born. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="260">Q: What did your father do? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="262">A: My father had apparently learned the trade of brushmaking, and had opened a workshop to make brushes. </sentence><sentence id="263">From what I am told by his surviving brother, he was very good at it, and by the time that I was born, I can tell from, again, from the pictures of him, what people told me, there was a small workshop with, I don't know, ten or so workmen, and there was machinery and they made brushes and was very successful at it. </sentence><sentence id="264">But, I, again, don't have any memory of it. </sentence><sentence id="265">I only know pictures and stories. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="270">Q: Is this difficult for you as an adult person thinking about who were these parents and what you have are paper pictures? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="272">A: It's not actually that difficult. </sentence><sentence id="273">The reason for it is that it was not a new discovery that I made as an adult. </sentence><sentence id="274">If I had known nothing of that, and all of a sudden as an adult it came upon me, yes, of course, it would have been difficult. </sentence><sentence id="275">But I grew up with all of that. </sentence><sentence id="276">It's -- it's just part and parcel of my growing up. </sentence><sentence id="277">I always heard stories and always knew who I was and I always had these pictures so that, you know, it's, you know, you just to grow up with stories. </sentence><sentence id="278">That's all. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="286">Q: So, you go to Ludberg- </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="288">A: Ludbreg, which actually has a meaning. </sentence><sentence id="289">The word "lud" in Croatian means crazy or mad. </sentence><sentence id="290">This is kind of crazy. </sentence><sentence id="291">And "breg", I think, means a mountain, but it also could be the words got transposed and it was "berg" which means town. </sentence><sentence id="292">So, I don't know. </sentence><sentence id="293">Nobody ever explained why this is called that, but it's Ludbreg. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="300">Q: Do you have a first memory of Ludbreg? </sentence><sentence id="301">Remember arriving? </sentence><sentence id="302">You don't remember - </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="306">A: No, I don't remember arriving. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="308">Q: With your grandparents? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="310">A: I remember very well being with my grandparents. </sentence><sentence id="311">That I do remember, and again, I have certain images like I remember sitting with my grandfather in a room and playing at his feet, and he was paralyzed already on one side because he had a stroke. </sentence><sentence id="312">And he was trying to pick up the toys that I was playing with, something like that, and he fell. </sentence><sentence id="313">It was a traumatic experience for me. </sentence><sentence id="314">So, I remember that, and I remember Hanukkah. </sentence><sentence id="315">I remember the- </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="322">Q: What happened after he fell? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="324">A: Oh, someone came -- he couldn't pick himself up. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="326">Q: You just-- </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="328">A: I just remember that I was guilty of throwing the toys around or something. </sentence><sentence id="329">So, I remember being upset and crying. </sentence><sentence id="330">So, that's why I remember that. </sentence><sentence id="331">I remember Hanukkah for example, but not the whole thing. </sentence><sentence id="332">I remember candles and I remember getting an orange, which was very exciting. </sentence><sentence id="333">Oranges were not to be had. </sentence><sentence id="334">I remember at Pesach, or before Pesach. </sentence><sentence id="335">I remember that they were burying silverware, and I thought that was a very strange thing to do, but that's apparently what can be done. </sentence><sentence id="336">I found that much later. </sentence><sentence id="337">I had no idea of that. </sentence><sentence id="338">I remember my grandfather sitting in the garden with all of us playing around and he used to -- he used to have his little table in front. </sentence><sentence id="339">This was, mind you, we were living in the house that was attached to the synagogue, and it was also -- and everything -- all the Jewish community matters played themselves out there. </sentence><sentence id="340">So, there was also the school and there were some kind of classrooms, and, of course, that was there much later. </sentence><sentence id="341">It's been destroyed now, but -- so, he would sit in the garden with the little table and he had little piles of money in front of him and there were beggars that were sort of like professional beggars in that town, and they would come Wednesdays and Saturdays because those were market days in Ludbreg, and on Saturdays, of course, he wouldn't do that, but -- that's Shabbat, but on Wednesdays they would sit and they would come and take their little piles. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="356">Q: They, as far as you knew, they were specifically for these particular people? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="358">A: Yes, yes, there was specific people. </sentence><sentence id="359">There was a specific beggar that used to come to our --to the house where I lived much, much later and he would come every Wednesday and would always get alms, and I remember seeing him later on on the train and being like a normal person, you know? </sentence><sentence id="360">It was very strange, but they were characters. </sentence><sentence id="361">Ludbreg's a very small town, and especially was, and everybody sort of knew everybody and there were all these sort of different routines that were going on. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="366">Q: Since you said there were about 30 families who lived here, how much larger was the town? </sentence><sentence id="367">A couple of hundred families? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="370">A: Yes, and all of these families did not live in Ludbreg proper, either. </sentence><sentence id="371">Some of them were in surrounding villages. </sentence><sentence id="372">Ludbreg is sort of like the county seat, and there were many surrounding villages, and those villages did not have either their own Jewish anything, nor did they have even middle schools. </sentence><sentence id="373">For example, later on when I went to middle school, people, kids from those villages would come to school, and that was also the place where market that was happening, and any kind of official papers were held and so on and so forth. </sentence><sentence id="374">So, it was sort of a -- basically like a county seat. </sentence><sentence id="375">So, anyway, back to the images of my grandfather. </sentence><sentence id="376">Those are the images that I have my grandparents, but of course- </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="384">Q: You only mentioned - </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="386">A: My grandfather -- yes, I know. </sentence><sentence id="387">I remember my grandmother less. </sentence><sentence id="388">I think I remember her more from pictures than I remember anything that went on in the house, strangely enough. </sentence><sentence id="389">No meals, no nothing. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="394">Q: No playing? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="396">A: I don't remember that, no. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="404">A: It's interesting, right. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="406">Q: Maybe you actually spent more time with your grandfather. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="408">A: It's possible. </sentence><sentence id="409">It's possible. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="412">Q: Do you have any recollection of wondering who you parents are after a while? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="414">A: No. </sentence><sentence id="415">I know- </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="418">Q: You're there probably the end of March- </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="420">A: I'm there visiting. </sentence><sentence id="421">The next memory I have in my grandparents" house, I remember one evening, being lots of commotion, lots of unhappiness, and then, lo and behold, there arrives a baby, and that -- a child, a young child. </sentence><sentence id="422">That was my brother. </sentence><sentence id="423">I remember his arrival because he looked very strange. </sentence><sentence id="424">He had lines, like brown lines on his face, and I thought, "What's with the brown lines?" </sentence><sentence id="425">I know now that basically he was crying and there was dirt on the road until they washed him up and so on. </sentence><sentence id="426">I know now what had happened, but I don't have a memory of that. </sentence><sentence id="427">I only know what happened. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="438">A: What happened- </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="440">Q: What were you told? </sentence><sentence id="441">Your grandparents told you or do you remember? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="444">A: I was constantly surrounded by this extended family. </sentence><sentence id="445">So, there was my grand -- there were my grandparents and then only about two blocks away lived the middle sister, my mother's middle sister of the three sisters, Blanka with her husband and two of my cousins Vera and Zdenka, and then there was also Giza, who by that time was also married, and her husband Ludva, the Vrancic family. </sentence><sentence id="446">So, there was constant comings and goings, so that I don't know who said what, and in fact, I remember that evening in particular when my brother arrived, and then I remember also being sort of distracted later on the next day by my two cousins who took me away. </sentence><sentence id="447">I spent much time with them. </sentence><sentence id="448">So, I was just sort of floating between these families. </sentence><sentence id="449">I don't remember being particularly rooted in one place or another. </sentence><sentence id="450">But, anyway, the reason -- what happened with my brother. </sentence><sentence id="451">That must have after the fall of Yugoslavia, April 41. </sentence><sentence id="452">My parents were apparently almost immediately taken into jail, led and my mother had my brother with me. </sentence><sentence id="453">We had -- I don't know if it was a housekeeper or somebody who lived nearby, a non-Jewish woman, and she went and was able to get my brother out. </sentence><sentence id="454">So, he was in jail with my parents for a very short period of time. </sentence><sentence id="455">Then she got him out, and she must have phoned Ludbreg, I mean, I know she did because I went through that story before, and they immediately -- the oldest sister, Giza and her husband who was not Jewish, Ludva Vrancic, they went immediately to Zagreb and they got my brother, and they brought him back to Ludbreg. </sentence><sentence id="456">And that's -- that's what happened that night, and that's -- they brought him and he was there. </sentence><sentence id="457">He was nine months old at that time, and so he was crying and carrying on, and that's about what I remember of that. </sentence><sentence id="458">And I remember everybody being nervous and upset and- </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="533">Q: Were you glad he was there? </sentence><sentence id="534">Or did it take something away from you when he came? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="537">A: When he came, I don't know whether I paid that much attention. </sentence><sentence id="538">Eventually, it was kind of nice having him around sometimes, but sometimes I was -- with time, as he got to be bigger, he played a large role in everybody's life. </sentence><sentence id="539">He was very cute and very smart and I was often very jealous, especially later on, he got to be -- he was very personable and both of us were very redhead. </sentence><sentence id="540">This is very muted now. </sentence><sentence id="541">I mean, I was flaming red and so was he, and he was very cute and he had a very good memory. </sentence><sentence id="542">He'd memorize very long poems, and he would stand up and recite them, and I was like, "Ugh, there he goes again." </sentence><sentence id="543">But, the whole town was very fond of him, and he -- he somehow acquired a nickname "Lovrek" which wasn't his name, and everybody thought it was his name, but it wasn't. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="551">Q: What does Lovrek mean? </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="559">A: His name was Zdravko, which is very hard for you I'm sure to pronounce, but it's actually means hime (ph), because zdravije is health. </sentence><sentence id="560">Apparently, my -- from what I was told, again, I was told that my mother wanted us to have very Croatian names. </sentence><sentence id="561">People were very, very much into being Croat, and Nationalists, and so on. </sentence><sentence id="562">So, those two names were supposed to be, you know, real Croatian names. </sentence><sentence id="563">We weren't going to have such names as who knows what. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="581"> End of Tape #1 Tape #2 </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="584">Q: Dora, do you have your first recollection of the effect of a war or something, anything that has to do with this chaos that obviously encumbering Croatia? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="586">A: Well, I-- I have memories that have to do with what must have then been become a persecution, with the issuing of lists, et cetera, et cetera, and you know, historically we know what happened. </sentence><sentence id="587">There were lists, and they, you know, the Ustashe came to Ludbreg and, they -- people were being rounded up. </sentence><sentence id="588">I was not aware of that as such, but I do remember people leaving and I remember being left behind, and I didn't know exactly what was happening. </sentence><sentence id="589">Perhaps, again, they told me, but I didn't understand what they were telling me. </sentence><sentence id="590">But, as I mentioned, my Aunt Blanka and her family lived next door to Aunt Giza and Ludjevit, and basically I remember at one point people coming and we were all in one room and they came with satchels or small suitcases in their hands and pillows under their arms and saying goodbye and leaving. </sentence><sentence id="591">And I didn't know exactly what was going on and why were they leaving and who was crying, and I was sad because these were my cousins, but that's the image that I have in my head of their leaving. </sentence><sentence id="592">And I had the sense that it was, there was something that was dangerous and bad and that people were being taken away. </sentence><sentence id="593">I don't have the image of my grandparents leaving. </sentence><sentence id="594">I don't remember that. </sentence><sentence id="595">I remember my cousins. </sentence><sentence id="596">I know that my grandparents were taken at the same time. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="608">Q: At the same time? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="610">A: Mm-hmm. </sentence><sentence id="611">Fairly early, they all left. </sentence><sentence id="612">I also know that my cousins, I know that now, that my favorite cousins with whom I stayed quite a bit of time and the middle aunt, Blanka, the middle aunt and her husband, that they had left for awhile and went to the Italian part of the country, that they were someplace in Dalmatia. </sentence><sentence id="613">And then there was a proclamation by Pavelic that people who had left, Jews who had left, should return, and if they return they will be spared, nothing will happen to them, and they stupidly returned. </sentence><sentence id="614">I have a very good friend of mine who still lives in Zagreb now. </sentence><sentence id="615">Her family, which was another family in Ludbreg left also, and had left before this proclamation and they cleverly did not return. </sentence><sentence id="616">They were the only Jewish family, in fact, that returned after the war intact because they were smart enough not to return, actually because the mother in the family said she was absolutely not returning, and so they stayed with the Partisans in Partisan- held territory in Kordun. </sentence><sentence id="617">But, people who returned believing that this was going, you know, that they were going to be okay, they were gone. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="626">Q: Is it possible that it was -- there was a list, and people knew they were supposed to go so they didn't have to be rounded up, they went, yes? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="628">A: I think somebody must have come and gotten them and had the list, and I -- I tried to reconstruct why I wasn't taken, and I hadn't thought about it before even toask my | with whom I eventually grew up, "Why wasn't I taken ever?" </sentence><sentence id="629">Besides having been hidden here and there, which I know I was, because people would warn us that there would be a raid. </sentence><sentence id="630">I have a feeling that I was not on the list. </sentence><sentence id="631">I had seen one of those lists. </sentence><sentence id="632">One of them is published in a book on Ludbreg, which I have, and it lists Ludbreg Jews, and my aunts are there, and everybody's listed, and I'm not on the list, neither is my brother. </sentence><sentence id="633">I have a feeling that the must have gotten the list maybe from the synagogue, from the community center, and of course, I was not, since I was not born in Ludbreg and I was not considered a, you know, a member of the Ludbreg Jews, I was from Zagreb, I was not on that list. </sentence><sentence id="634">That's a possibility. </sentence><sentence id="635">But the other thing is that I know that many times we were warned that there would be a raid, and perhaps I -- if they had been warned, they would have hidden someplace, but I always wondered why in the world were they sitting there? </sentence><sentence id="636">Like sitting ducks. </sentence><sentence id="637">Even I -- I mean I didn't have a choice, of course, I was a child -- but I'm thinking, ""Why in the world were we there?" </sentence><sentence id="638">I recently, my aunt made a tape of her experiences- </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="651">Q: This is Magda? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="653">A: Magda, and she was in Zagreb this whole time. </sentence><sentence id="654">They stayed until the bitter end and they could barely escape at that point. </sentence><sentence id="655">I was like, "Why were you there?" </sentence><sentence id="656">You know, it's very hard for me to understand. </sentence><sentence id="657">It's not hard to understand why they didn't -- why in some places there was no place to go, but I think in Ludbreg, one of the things about Ludbreg, it was a town that was very close to the -- to where the Partisans where. </sentence><sentence id="658">It's at the foot of the mountains, and of course, it was very difficult and Partisans had a very difficult life, but for those of us who were so vulnerable, why we didn't you go someplace into a small village or smaller village. </sentence><sentence id="659">I mean, this was small, but it wasn't really small, not by Croatian standards. </sentence><sentence id="660">Why we stayed there, I don't know. </sentence><sentence id="661">Faith that we would not be wanted? </sentence><sentence id="662">Or something? </sentence><sentence id="663">I don't really know. </sentence><sentence id="664">But I know that often with my Aunt Giza, we would -- we would go places. </sentence><sentence id="665">I remember one time going to Varazdin, which is a larger town nearby, and staying with a relative, and I think this was the time that I understood that it was dangerous to stay and that we had to hide for a few days. </sentence><sentence id="666">The other --all the other hiding that I did was sort of nearby with -- mostly with friends, and there were a number of families. </sentence><sentence id="667">There was the Ziza, the Runjak family, my brother and I would spend some time with, especially Ludbreg -- Ludbreg experienced a lot of fighting. </sentence><sentence id="668">We were really not so much in a concentration camp kind of situation. </sentence><sentence id="669">We were in a war -- we were in a war zone. </sentence><sentence id="670">So, when it was -- when it was time to hide because the Ustashe took town, then I spent, for example, time with this Runjak family, and they had rented from this other house which was now empty. </sentence><sentence id="671">They had rented that apartment, and we stayed with them. </sentence><sentence id="672">And I called Mrs. Runjak "Mother" when I knew that it was dangerous, and I understood at that point what was dangerous, and my brother called her "Mother" all the time because he wouldn't know how to distinguish from when it was dangerous and when it wasn't. </sentence><sentence id="673">So, I lived with them, and they had three teenage children, and it's thoroughly amazing because I remember Ustashe making camp in our backyard, and we were there, and just pretending that we were part of this other family. </sentence><sentence id="674">And it's amazing sometimes because the whole town essentially knew who we were. </sentence><sentence id="675">That's the most amazing part of all. </sentence><sentence id="676">In a small town like that, everybody knew that we were the rabbi's grandchildren, and at no point did anybody say, "What about these kids?" </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="701">Q: So, is there some way in which the town is protecting you? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="703">A: It wasn't organized. </sentence><sentence id="704">Yeah, definitely. </sentence><sentence id="705">It wasn't an organized kind of thing, but a lot of people in that town were really Partisan sympathizers, and I know a number of people who lost, who perished, who lost their lives as Partisans during the war. </sentence><sentence id="706">People across the street lost their one and only son. </sentence><sentence id="707">So, I think -- unwittingly, I mean, not in an organized manner, but it just was not a kind of town that would -- that would say, "Oh, well, go some place else." </sentence><sentence id="708">Or, "You're endangering us." </sentence><sentence id="709">I was endangering some of these people, and -- but, they took us in anyway. </sentence><sentence id="710">So, but, anyway, our bad experiences during the war really had to do with the fighting, which everybody experienced, not just the Jews. </sentence><sentence id="711">Just there was only brother and I and my aunt that were left at the end. </sentence><sentence id="712">Because there were fights especially at night. </sentence><sentence id="713">There would be terrible fights. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="725">Q: In the streets? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="727">A: In the streets, yes. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="729">Q: Really? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="731">A: Yeah, oh yeah. </sentence><sentence id="732">There were -- the street that I lived on was after the war called, "The Street of the 17" Udarna Brigada". </sentence><sentence id="733">1 don't know how to translate -- Brigade is Brigada, of course. </sentence><sentence id="734">Udarna means -- it's striking, one who can strike well, particularly well. </sentence><sentence id="735">And the reason it's called that is because the members of that brigade, the remnant of that brigade lost their lives. </sentence><sentence id="736">They killed themselves at the end of the battle in a house that was down my street because they were totally surrounded. </sentence><sentence id="737">They had fought all night, and they were totally surrounded, and in the end, they just threw a bomb among themselves because they didn't want to be captured. </sentence><sentence id="738">But there were fights and we would spend -- we spent a lot of time in the basement. </sentence><sentence id="739">We had a cellar, not a basement in an American sense. </sentence><sentence id="740">It was a cellar. </sentence><sentence id="741">We had a vineyard, and we had wine, and there were big barrels down there, and shelves and shelves full of apples that were there for the winter. </sentence><sentence id="742">And at one point, we had beds down there, rollaway beds. </sentence><sentence id="743">And we spent every night there because we knew that there would be bad fighting. </sentence><sentence id="744">Sometimes, but sometimes, we would forget to go down there on time, and -- not forget -- I'm sorry, we didn't know that we should go down there on time. </sentence><sentence id="745">So, then if a fight -- if a battle started, there was no way to get there because you had to get out of the house to get -- to go into the cellar, and so it was too dangerous already to do that. </sentence><sentence id="746">So, we stayed in the house. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="763">Q: Where would you stay? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="765">A: We -- yeah, I remember. </sentence><sentence id="766">That I remember very well. </sentence><sentence id="767">Sometimes the bullets were flying like crazy through the house. </sentence><sentence id="768">There was one night, I won't forget, where the house across the street was a two-story house and ours was a one-story house, and they were shooting from our backyard into that house across the street back and forth. </sentence><sentence id="769">The bullets were flying through our windows, and I was sleeping on the sofa in a corner. </sentence><sentence id="770">So, if you can imagine a corner and then window-window. </sentence><sentence id="771">So, I was fairly well protected, but I was scared to death and I don't have any recollection of where my brother, but my aunt and uncle were sleeping in the room next to my room, and for some strange reason, I think everybody was kind of paralyzed that no one left there, but there was a window that was -- that was right facing out from this bedroom, and I remember crying and asking for somebody to come, and finally my uncle got up and came, and no sooner did he come to comfort me than a bullet landed on the pillow of his bed. </sentence><sentence id="772">He would've been killed if not for the fact that I had been crying. </sentence><sentence id="773">But in the morning sometimes, you looked out the window -- I remember one time it was a horrible battle, and we looked -- in Croatia you have these -- they're not shades in our sense. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="784">Q: Shutters? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="786">A: No, not even shutters. </sentence><sentence id="787">They're more like our Venetian blinds, but they are on the outside and they are wooden, and you pull them up like that, but so, you can also turn them so that you can kind of peer out. </sentence><sentence id="788">I remember peering out, and that is a recollection I definitely have of carriages going by our windows full of dead -- nude, dead bodies because they had collected them and then just stripped them of clothes and were taking them someplace. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="792">Q: Were these horse drawn? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="794">A: Horse-drawn. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="796">Q: Like a cart? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="798">A: Horse-drawn carts, yes. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="800">Q: Did you see that often? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="802">A: No, not often. </sentence><sentence id="803">I remember that one very well. </sentence><sentence id="804">We lived on a main -- pretty much main street on the corner of two very important main streets so that when things went by, we saw them. </sentence><sentence id="805">And, also, often -- well, as these bullets would come through, I mean, after the war, our living room and one of the bedrooms were riddled with bullets, and the -- we had these armoires and cabinets of books and they had bullet holes through them, and if you opened the tablecloths, it looked like a doily, you know, all full of beautifully separated. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="810">Q: If you couldn't get into the cellar, would you lie on the floor so that you wouldn't be by a window? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="812">A: Sometimes, yes, and we would sometimes also go into the side of the house that didn't have windows to the street. </sentence><sentence id="813">There was one side of the house into the hallway, except that one night that I remember so well, when we stupidly stayed where we shouldn't have stayed. </sentence><sentence id="814">I think sometimes it was so bad that nobody wanted to move. </sentence><sentence id="815">But most of the time, -- most of the -- it's very -- it's horrible, I hate to say that, but I remember being quite exhilarated by it all at times. </sentence><sentence id="816">I should have been -- instead of being afraid, I used to think it was sort of very exciting to have these battles going on, and thinking it was quite great fun to sleep down in the cellar where there were always some frogs jumping around. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="822">Q: Maybe as a child - </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="824"> A As a child, it is so much better. </sentence><sentence id="825">I mean, I'm sure the adults were totally, totally traumatized, but as a child, it's very interesting looking back, and I'm looking now at my granddaughter who is now about the age that I was at the end of the war, and I'm thinking, "Can you imagine what something like that would do to her?" </sentence><sentence id="826">And, yet, when I think of myself at the time, I don't think I was so horribly scared at many of the points. </sentence><sentence id="827">I was more -- I think there were some things that were just very scary, like seeing all these bodies going by. </sentence><sentence id="828">And there was a time that -- an image that I have very much in my head again, that was another thing that happened in Ludbreg. </sentence><sentence id="829">There were -- the Ustashe would take people who were thought to be sympathizers of the Partisans, which they were, many of them, and if they -- sometimes they would catch them, some of them were sent to concentration camp and that includes my uncle, but my uncle who eventually married my aunt and he wasn't Jewish. </sentence><sentence id="830">I didn't explain that part, but at any rate, he ended up in concentration camp at one point in Jasenovac, and they would take them either to camp and sometimes they would hang them or kill them in some other way just in town, and I do have a very vivid image of going with one of our cleaning ladies to the main square and I wasn't supposed to see it. </sentence><sentence id="831">She was holding her hand on my eyes, but I saw it. </sentence><sentence id="832">There was a body hanging on every one of the trees around the square, and I remember people saying -- they were -- because they were Partisans, that's why. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="842">Q: Now, when you saw something like that, and you saw the dead body, was that different for you then when you were in the midst of this fighting? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="844">A: Well, yeah, that -- because the fighting was sort of like a "Star War" kind of thing like a game, and I didn't really -- I don't think I understood too well at the time what is the result of all this shooting, but I was scared to death when nobody was with me, and I cried a lot. </sentence><sentence id="845">So, there were times when I was very scared. </sentence><sentence id="846">But, we played war so much, you know, when I was a child, that's the game we played. </sentence><sentence id="847">You played -- you played with, like I remember playing with dried corn stalks. </sentence><sentence id="848">You would -- you know when they were cut off? </sentence><sentence id="849">And they were supposed to be fed to the cows, and we use those to battle each other in play war. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="856">Q: And what kind of war was it? </sentence><sentence id="857">Middle age war or contemporary war? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="860">A: No, no, it was contemporary war. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="862">Q: So, you used guns? </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="866">Q: And were you Germans and Croatians or what? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="868">A: No, we were not Germans and Croatians. </sentence><sentence id="869">We were Ustashe and Partisans. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="872">Q: Ah-ha! </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="874">A: No, we didn't have anything to do with Germans. </sentence><sentence id="875">The Germans -- I never saw a German. </sentence><sentence id="876">All during the war, I never saw a German. </sentence><sentence id="877">We had our own Germans, our own Nazis. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="882">Q: What side did you play on? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="884">A: Oh, well, you always wanted to be the Partisans. </sentence><sentence id="885">Somebody had to lose, and somebody had to win. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="888">Q: And did the Partisans win all the time? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="890">A: In our games, yes, in our games, yes. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="896">Q: Did you go "bang-bang, you're dead" or what? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="898">A: Yeah, and the boys would usually take the upper hand and the girls would lose. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="900">Q: Was it girls against boys? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="902">A: Sometimes. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="904">Q: Really? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="906">A: Sometimes, sometimes. </sentence><sentence id="907">There was an empty space across the street which belonged to the church, and it was -- they just started building it, but they never finished building it. </sentence><sentence id="908">So, it was sort of empty, and you could hide inside there, and that's where we often played our games, and also in our backyard we had sort of a shed. </sentence><sentence id="909">It was built rather than a shed. </sentence><sentence id="910">It was sort of attached to the structure, and in that structure we had a press for pressing grapes to get wine, and that was otherwise pretty empty. </sentence><sentence id="911">That was also a good place to play. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="924">A: No, no, that belonged to the Vrancic family. </sentence><sentence id="925">The Vrancic family had a house that was built by my uncle's father, and they came to Ludbreg when he was -- when that father was very young. </sentence><sentence id="926">So, it was in the mid-1800s. </sentence><sentence id="927">They were well educated and very old Croatian family. </sentence><sentence id="928">They count their ancestors to something like the 12" century where there were two famous Vrancic people. </sentence><sentence id="929">There was the Cardinal, and then there was an inventor, a fairly famous inventor by that name, and then the mother's family was called Svagel, and they were nobility, minor nobility, nevertheless, they had the PL, which is the approval of a in their name, and the silver has that and so on. </sentence><sentence id="930">And they established themselves in this town, and they had a dozen children, none of whom survived who remarried. </sentence><sentence id="931">They all died fairly young, not the children necessarily, some yes, but fairly -- sort of as teenagers or young people, and as my memory goes, there were only two survivors and they were already in their fairly old age. </sentence><sentence id="932">One of them was Vika and the other was Ludva, and Vika remained single and died in the middle of the war, and I remember her quite well. </sentence><sentence id="933">Ludva was the person who was extremely well-known in that town. </sentence><sentence id="934">He was -- he had been a mayor. </sentence><sentence id="935">He was a organizer of the sports club. </sentence><sentence id="936">He was the organizer of -- he was the head of the soccer club even though he never played soccer. </sentence><sentence id="937">He organized everything in that town. </sentence><sentence id="938">He was especially having to do with music. </sentence><sentence id="939">He loved music. </sentence><sentence id="940">He played the violin. </sentence><sentence id="941">He organized two different kinds of orchestras. </sentence><sentence id="942">He was the heart of that town in terms of any kind of cultural life. </sentence><sentence id="943">When he fell in love with my aunt, and he, of course, this was a Croatian Catholic family, and my aunt was the daughter of the rabbi, not exactly the right combination for the times, forever, but certainly not for that time. </sentence><sentence id="944">And he was ten years older than she, and they knew each other especially from the bank because he was a director of a part of another bank, and she worked there. </sentence><sentence id="945">And, again, I know that only from stories. </sentence><sentence id="946">I asked him many times afterwards, "So, why didn't you get married for such a long time?" </sentence><sentence id="947">Because they got married in 1937, I think, or 1939, I'm not too sure. </sentence><sentence id="948">I should know that, but anyway, and he always told me, "Well, she was very happy living with her family, with her parents, and I was fine living with my sister and my mother. </sentence><sentence id="949">There was no need to get married." </sentence><sentence id="950">Well, I rather doubted that was how it was, but that's how he always said it. </sentence><sentence id="951">But I'm sure that my grandparents did not -- were not thrilled their daughter going with a Catholic person. </sentence><sentence id="952">However, in all the pictures of the family for a very long time, he's always present. </sentence><sentence id="953">So, it wasn't like he wasn't accepted totally, and I think by the time the war was imminent in Europe, and they knew what was happening, they decided to get married. </sentence><sentence id="954">So, they got married. </sentence><sentence id="955">They actually had to go to Hungary to get married because you couldn't get married in a civil ceremony in Croatia or Yugoslavia, that is, and neither of them was converting to anything. </sentence><sentence id="956">So, they got married in a civil ceremony. </sentence><sentence id="957">So, the house that we basically had lived was the Vrancic house, and then they and my other aunt, the Appler family, decided to build a house of their own, but it was within the same compound, the same land base. </sentence><sentence id="958">So, that's how we ended up having these two houses that were next to one another, and the other one was supposed to be a big two-story house with a store on the bottom for my uncle, a small apartment in the back, which is we ended up living and these people who often hid me lived there, and then there was supposed to be two apartments upstairs, and that never got finished, of course, before the war. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="995">Q: Is this why there's a kind of confusion in you about where you were? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="997">A: Exactly. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="999">Q: Because everything was so close that you can't remember. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1001">A: Exactly, exactly. </sentence><sentence id="1002">So, I sort of have memories of Vika living by herself in that big house, in that one house. </sentence><sentence id="1003">We were living in an apartment, and I don't know at one point that was. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1007">Q: So, it's confusing? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1009">A: It's very confusing as to where I was living at what time because we did move around, but only within those three houses sort of, and my grandfather, I think, I spent the least time there, and of course, I was the youngest so that I remember that the least, and I remember the Vrancic house the best, because Vika eventually died during the war, and she died I think while my uncle was in concentration camp, and I remember seeing her dead, that was more scary than some of the battles because I ran into the house and nobody told me she was dead and there she was. </sentence><sentence id="1010">But then once she died and was buried and we were always in that house from then on, and that's, you know, I remember, that's -- we were set then in that house from then on. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1020">A: Not being there, very much. </sentence><sentence id="1021">Being taken away, no. </sentence><sentence id="1022">I must not have been present. </sentence><sentence id="1023">But not being there, yes. </sentence><sentence id="1024">I remember that Giza was very sad and very upset much of the time. </sentence><sentence id="1025">I remember that we were allowed to make packages and send them, and I remember very well that she was making packages. </sentence><sentence id="1026">I remember her making sort of vats of this roux. </sentence><sentence id="1027">This was what was being sent, roux. </sentence><sentence id="1028">And so you -- you made this brown mass which would then congeal and solidify, and then he would put -- he would use that to put in the water to make sort of a soup. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1038">Q: He was where? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1040">A: He was in Jasenovac. </sentence><sentence id="1041">He was Jasenovac, and eventually when he would return -- luckily I found out, I mean, he was lucky that he returned, but he saw my father there. </sentence><sentence id="1042">So, my father was there for also for quite awhile. </sentence><sentence id="1043">He was taken with a number of other non-Jews from Ludbreg, and they were there, I can't remember for how long, but at least a year, I think, and I don't know why, I've forgotten, but certainly I talked to him afterwards, but I don't have a good memory of how long he was there. </sentence><sentence id="1044">But I do know all the stories he told me when he returned of how and why he survived, and basically they found out that -- well, they knew -- that he was a banker, and so they put him to work in an office in Jasenovac to balance their books, to work on the books, and so that he didn't have to be out in the rain and snow and people, there was one person in the office who was an Ustashe but not one of those -- not one of those that went around killing people necessarily, and he was reasonably kind to him. </sentence><sentence id="1045">In fact, after the war, I have definite memories of Stricek sending packages to him because later on, he was in jail, I mean, yeah, in jail for many years after the war. </sentence><sentence id="1046">But this is so -- the one thing that saved him was that. </sentence><sentence id="1047">The other thing that saved him was that he was always, as I told you, an organizer of things cultural, and they wanted to have, the Ustashe wanted to have entertainment. </sentence><sentence id="1048">So, he organized a chorus, and he collected anybody that he knew. </sentence><sentence id="1049">So, there were some nieces of his -- second niece because he didn't have brothers and sisters, cousins, two cousins" daughters were there -- he collected all these people and they created a chorus. </sentence><sentence id="1050">So, of course, he claimed to have to practice if they wanted to have a good performance. </sentence><sentence id="1051">So, that saved them also from having to work so hard, and they'd sometimes allow them access to some more food. </sentence><sentence id="1052">He said my father, on the other hand, worked very hard. </sentence><sentence id="1053">Nevertheless, my father survived until the very end. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1068">Q: He did? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1070">A: Yes. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1072">Q: But didn't your father sing? </sentence><sentence id="1073">So, how come he didn't get into the chorus? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="1076"> A Well, he, yeah, he may have, but that's -- I think, in fact, he did, but there were people that they didn't want to -- that didn't allow them to be collected because people who were young and strong, they made them work. </sentence><sentence id="1077">I think that my -- Stricek remembers my father working with bricks, and carrying stones and bricks and things, but he was much, much younger. </sentence><sentence id="1078">Stricek at that point, he was born in 1885, he was old, and he had this family of people who were dying with weak lungs at a moment's notice, and he was -- he would have never made it. </sentence><sentence id="1079">So, anyway, at one point, they released that group and they all came back to Ludbreg. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1084">Q: Now, was that surprising? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1086">A: Yes and no. </sentence><sentence id="1087">I was very surprised at that for much of my life until very recently when I was working on the Jasenovac files. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1090">Q: At the Holocaust Museum? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1092">A: Yes, at the Holocaust Museum, and I found out that that was -- that was very much a norm, that a lot of people especially those who were not Jews or Serbs, but were Croats who were just thought to be Partisan sympathizers and so on, that they were coming and going. </sentence><sentence id="1093">There are many testimonies that I have listened to now, and much material that I had seen, that people would say that they were released, and even Magda, we were talking to Magda. </sentence><sentence id="1094">She was saying how people were collected to a camp in Zagreb and they were released to go home and get their clothes or something, and it seems that while they were extremely cruel, within Jasenovac, that they were also very disorganized, and sometimes people would come and go and they were constantly sending people from one place to another. </sentence><sentence id="1095">I believe that was the most amazing thing that I found in reading the Jasenovac material, to what extent people were constantly being moved from Radiska to Jasenovac to Lepoglava, spending times on trains going back and forth, sometimes being released. </sentence><sentence id="1096">It's amazing, and we haven't quite figured out. </sentence><sentence id="1097">Lucie and I are both very surprised, and we haven't quite figured out what is the basis of that except that we feel that there was not a total organization. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1120">Q: She was denounced as what? </sentence><sentence id="1121">As a sympathizer? </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1126">Q: As a Jew? </sentence><sentence id="1127">But wouldn't she have been listed as a Jew? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1130">A: She was, but people weren't paying that much attention to that. </sentence><sentence id="1131">She's on the list because the picture I have of the list, she's on it. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1134">Q: They weren't doing very much with it? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1136">A: No, they weren't doing anything, but at that moment, I don't know whether it was a particular person, a particular person who was in charge, even -- it was towards the end, they were already losing the war. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1180">A: That was very upsetting. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1182">Q: Does that bother you in a way that the others would not because you were so little? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1184">A: Yeah, they all bothered me that they would be going away. </sentence><sentence id="1185">I just didn't know how going away, you know, what -- you know, you go away, you come back. </sentence><sentence id="1186">| think with her, I already had a sense that perhaps she won't come back, that bad things were going on, that people die. </sentence><sentence id="1187">I think at that point, I- </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1193">Q: Do you think you understood what death was? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="1195"> A I think, well, yeah, I've seen -- I saw a lot of death since then, all the battles, all the dead people. </sentence><sentence id="1196">You know, living nights -- oh, I didn't tell you about one night when there was a big battle and the big mill which was just a little bit more than a block from us was set on fire by the Partisans. </sentence><sentence id="1197">That was awful. </sentence><sentence id="1198">People crying because -- all over the street -- because everything, all the wheat or corn, whatever they had that was to sustain them for the year was in the mill ready to be milled and it all burned down. </sentence><sentence id="1199">The smell in the town for a long time, the smell hung around of this burnt stuff, and people who were, you know, I, at the point, I understood -- I understood what it means to die, or to be dead. </sentence><sentence id="1200">So, I remember being upset, and I remember Stricek being very upset for a long time afterwards. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1207">Q: Did he say anything to you? </sentence><sentence id="1208">Does he tell you that he has tried to find her? </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1221">Q: Was he a loving person to you? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1223">A: Very, very, he was one of the sweetest people that you could imagine. </sentence><sentence id="1224">Not only to me, he was Stricek, which is dimunitive [sic] for uncle, to the entire town, and because I called him that, everybody called him that. </sentence><sentence id="1225">He is referred to as Stricek Ludva by everybody, and there is -- there is a monograph, well, there is a history of Ludbreg published by a Mrs.Winter, and it came out about two years ago, and there are sections on a variety of topics including Jews of Croatia, oh, Jews of Ludbreg, but there is a few people have their own chapter, and there is a chapter on him with pictures, and it's Nas Stricek Ludva, which means "Our Uncle Ludva", that's what he was. </sentence><sentence id="1226">Our house was always open and full of people and company and he was -- he was -- he was the most loving person you could imagine. </sentence><sentence id="1227">I was extremely lucky, extremely lucky. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1240">Q: He was the social one. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1242">A: He was the social one, yeah. </sentence><sentence id="1243">She was much quieter, and, of course, she -- I only knew her in really bad times, where I knew him afterwards, after the war, when his true self came forth, you know? </sentence><sentence id="1244">So, it's interesting because one of the things that this Mrs. Winters says, she says, "All the good things...", she was, by the way, very famous, a very well-known person in the Partisans during the war, and she considered herself a historian, and I am sorry, very sorry that she died before I could talk to her because she writes very nice things including about him, including the fact that he adopted me and my brother after the war, and then she says things like, in one sentence she says that even that was not, that he lost so much during the war, and then in the end he even lost me because I married this in quotes: "rich Jew", which made me just wrinkle because my husband was anything but rich, and that I left and left him there, which of course wasn't the case. </sentence><sentence id="1245">Yes, I left, but very much with his -- with his approval, and he knew he was quite elderly and he knew that he wanted me to have as good a life as I possibly could. </sentence><sentence id="1246">And he did everything in his life to make my life as good as possible. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1253">Q: So, do you remember liberation as liberation? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1255">A: Yes, yes, I do. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1257">Q: What was it like? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1259">A: What I remember most is columns and columns of Ustashe being marched through the town and being taken who knows where, and all of us standing outside and looking at these people and these forced marches that they were on. </sentence><sentence id="1260">I don't know where they were going and to where they were going, and there wasn't anybody that knew, but everybody sort of standing around and these people were hungry and they were thirsty and here and there people gave them a little water, but other than that, people just stared as they were walking by, and so all of a sudden the tables were reversed and everybody was saying, "They deserve it." </sentence><sentence id="1261">And that is what I remember most is this, you know, the conquered people walking by. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1265">Q: Were they yelling at them? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1267">A: I don't remember yelling. </sentence><sentence id="1268">I think, in fact, there was quite a lot of silence, sort of, we were just staring at them. </sentence><sentence id="1269">There were huge number, there were thousands of people being marched by, what looked to me like thousands. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1273">Q: Were they going north? </sentence><sentence id="1274">Do you have any recollection? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1277">A: They were going -- I remember which way they were going in Ludbreg, and they were going east. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1279">Q: East? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1281">A: East. </sentence><sentence id="1282">So, because I mean, we were between -- Ludbreg is between two larger towns, Koprivnica and Varazdin, and Varazdin's to the west, and Koprivnica to the east, and they were going across the bridge, across the river toward Koprivnica. </sentence><sentence id="1283">What happened after that, I don't know, but you know, that was -- </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1305">Q: Only Jewish Croats? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1307">A: Yes, I did not know any red heads, and so there was a time that Pavelic came to town. </sentence><sentence id="1308">I think it was towards the end sometime, I don't know exactly why he was invited -- he was a speaker. </sentence><sentence id="1309">Well, all my friends were going. </sentence><sentence id="1310">I wanted to go too, to see, and I was told absolutely not, and I remember that I was told I could look -- we had a stone fence, and I could look across the stone fence, peer out. </sentence><sentence id="1311">It was in the summertime I think, but I had to wear a hat on my head because you don't want any strangers not noticing you with this red hair, and my brother also had red hair. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1317">Q: I was going to ask you if he had red hair. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1319">A: Yes, the two of us had red hair, and we kept waiting for someone in the family to have red hair, but my grandson has slightly reddish, but it's my -- the males in my family seem to have red beards, but I'm the only redhead female so far. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1321">Q: It was really flaming red? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1323">A: Yeah, very red hair yeah. </sentence><sentence id="1324">So, that was a real liability, and peasant women would come into town and tell me horrible stories. </sentence><sentence id="1325">I remember one telling me, one time -- I don't know if it was during the war or not, but I remember she told me, "If you ever go to Varazdin", the bigger town, "be very", or Zagreb, my goodness, ""be very careful not to go near any kind of a place where there is a pharmacy because, you know, they might catch you and press you and make medicine out of you." </sentence><sentence id="1326">You know, there were -- in the small towns, these kind of prejudices and misinformation are rampant. </sentence><sentence id="1327">So, I knew that my red hair was some kind of a liability and I was to hide it all times, and I hated it, too. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1567">Q: This is before the came -- before the brother- </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1569">A: [have a feeling that it was before they came, and so, you know, there was a great tug of war, and I never heard from either for a very long time. </sentence><sentence id="1570">I think they were very angry and upset. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1573">Q: Now, were they angry at you? </sentence><sentence id="1574">They were angry at-? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1577">A: Well, they were angry at my uncle, but it -- it manifested itself with the fact that I never heard from them again. </sentence><sentence id="1578">However, the person that I did hear from eventually, but I don't remember how soon after the war, I heard from another uncle who survived, another of my father's brothers. </sentence><sentence id="1579">So, in my father's family, there were six children, and one sister and two brothers survived, and this one brother was in Bergen-Belsen and then was rescued out of Bergen-Belsen and went to Switzerland, and he married Magda, and they had one child a seven-year-old child or so when I heard from them. </sentence><sentence id="1580">So, maybe he was -- maybe he was about five, six at the time. </sentence><sentence id="1581">So, it must have been, I think that child was born sort of deg45, deg46. </sentence><sentence id="1582">So, I heard sort of into the "50s more or less continually from them, and remember very vividly getting a package from them, a ball point pen where you could see through the plastic. </sentence><sentence id="1583">That was so exciting, and a red plastic little purse like that, and a box of Frigor chocolates, my box of Frigor chocolates, very exciting. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1591">Q: Frigor? </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1605">Q: Let's talk a little bit just about this tragedy with- </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1607">A: With my brother? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1609">Q: With your brother. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1611">A: Now, there we were having survived the war, and it was September and everything was going fine, and it was time to go and have -- and collect grapes, have a grape harvest, and we were at the grape harvest, and the day after my brother was sick, and it just seemed to be sick like children get sick. </sentence><sentence id="1612">And then his temperature went up and up and up, and then it turned out that two other children in town apparently had scarlet fever, and it turned out it was scarlet fever, but it really wasn't diagnosed in time, and -- in time for the doctor to say, "Go to the nearest town," which was 25 kilometers from us, or "Let's go get penicillin someplace," and apparently he had a weak heart, and he was sick for three days and he died. </sentence><sentence id="1613">It was quite a tragedy. </sentence><sentence id="1614">It was a tragedy for me, even then, and I was old enough to realize it, I don't think I was nearly as affected as Stricek was. </sentence><sentence id="1615">I don't think he ever got over his death. </sentence><sentence id="1616">He just adored that child. </sentence><sentence id="1617">He adored me, too, but I think he really adored my brother. </sentence><sentence id="1618">And I was -- the whole town mourned. </sentence><sentence id="1619">It was really sad. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1629">Q: Really? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1631">A: Yeah. </sentence><sentence id="1632">It was very sad. </sentence><sentence id="1633">It was just, you know, I think scarlet fever is a bad disease even now, and at that time I think there was just no -- we had no antibiotics. </sentence><sentence id="1634">It was right after the war, and nobody was alert enough to realize that you could die that fast from something like that, you know? </sentence><sentence id="1635">You just go, "Oh, the kid is sick. </sentence><sentence id="1636">He has a high fever." </sentence><sentence id="1637">So, it was bad. </sentence><sentence id="1638">It was tragic. </sentence><sentence id="1639">So, after that, I was an only child, and with not a single blood relative remaining within Yugoslavia. </sentence><sentence id="1640">So- </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1651">Q: Did you feel almost like Ludva was as good as a blood relative? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1653">A: Oh, yeah. </sentence><sentence id="1654">I never -- no, I'm only making a statement, a general statement, but it wasn't that I felt that he was any different then a blood relative. </sentence><sentence id="1655">I really felt like he was my father. </sentence><sentence id="1656">And the only time that I used to think how sad it was that I didn't have my parents, and I know that sounds terrible because people often ask me that, you know, "How did you feel about your parents?" </sentence><sentence id="1657">but, because I didn't know them, and I didn't have that experience, it was only theoretically that I missed my parents. </sentence><sentence id="1658">Aunt Magda gets very upset when I say that. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1665">Q: It makes perfect sense. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1667">A: It makes sense. </sentence><sentence id="1668">The only time that I would, you know, feel sorry for myself, was when something would happen that I would get punished for something, and then I would say, "If my mother were alive she wouldn't do XYZ," you know, like I don't know. </sentence><sentence id="1669">If we had succession of cleaning ladies and housekeepers. </sentence><sentence id="1670">We had some very nice housekeepers, some people who were very nice to me. </sentence><sentence id="1671">But if | would get punished or had to clean my room or whatever I had to do, I would say, "If my mother was alive, I wouldn't have to be doing this." </sentence><sentence id="1672">Of course, I would have. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1679">Q: Yes, would you say that out loud? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1681">A: No, but I would think that to myself, feeling sorry for myself. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1683">Q: Now, you said at some point this afternoon, that your father actually survived the war. </sentence><sentence id="1684">Is that the case? </sentence><sentence id="1685">Or up to the end of the war? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1689">A: From what I was told by people -- a person who apparently witnessed my father's death, is that at the end -- at the end of Jasenovac, there were many outbreaks. </sentence><sentence id="1690">There was a major one at one point. </sentence><sentence id="1691">I keep reading about that in all the records. </sentence><sentence id="1692">But, apparently, there was confusion and they were killing people en masse and so, people were trying to escape and there was -- it seems that my father and a few other people escaped at the very end, and that they went someplace into the woods, and then came down -- came close to a village looking for the food, and that they were surprised by a German, I think, German patrol, or Ustashe patrol, I'm not sure. </sentence><sentence id="1693">And, then he was shot. </sentence><sentence id="1694">So, that's the most unfortunate, that he was able to survive until the very end, and then not make it. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1701">Q: This is going to sound like an odd question, but do you think that if your parents had come back, you would have felt about them the way that you did about the two brothers who came? </sentence><sentence id="1702">Just like, "Who are you?" </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1705">A: Possibly, but I think I understood parents. </sentence><sentence id="1706">I understood - </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1709">Q: You understood? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="1711"> A Yeah, I understood the concept. </sentence><sentence id="1712">I understood that, and I think Stricek would have understood and would have -- would have given me away. </sentence><sentence id="1713">Yeah, given me away, I mean, he could have kept me. </sentence><sentence id="1714">You know, I was, to him, basically a grandchild because my aunt -- my aunt, who was his wife, as I said, was 15 years older, then he was 10 years older than my aunt. </sentence><sentence id="1715">So, there was a 25 year gap. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1721">Q: Between your parents and him? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1723">A: Yeah. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1725">Q: So, how old do you think he was at the end of the war? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1727">A: So, he was born in 1885. </sentence><sentence id="1728">I'm very bad at math. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1731">Q: So, he's 45 or 50? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1733">A: In his 50s, right, and so -- oh, when did I feel sorry for myself for not have had my parents? </sentence><sentence id="1734">For example, he was fairly strict. </sentence><sentence id="1735">When I was a very little child, I could do anything. </sentence><sentence id="1736">I could climb walls if I wanted to, but as I got older and older, then restrictions remained, you know. </sentence><sentence id="1737">I had to be careful about this and that, and boys and so on, and then I was always -- I would always say, "Well, you see, he's so old, he doesn't understand anything. </sentence><sentence id="1738">If I had younger parents, they would have understood." </sentence><sentence id="1739">Nonsense, of course, but, you know, that's -- it's a good way of looking at it. </sentence><sentence id="1740">So, I always used to say, "I'm going to have my children very young so that I'1l understand them better." </sentence><sentence id="1741">We'd have to ask my children how I did. </sentence><sentence id="1742">I did have my children very young, but I don't think that that was necessarily what happened, but I always worried about him getting married, for example. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1753">Q: And what would happen? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1755">A: And what would happen, and there was some possibilities. </sentence><sentence id="1756">We had some very appropriate housekeepers at times. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1759">Q: What did you think would happen? </sentence><sentence id="1760">That they would not want you there? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1763">A: No, no, no, I didn't think that. </sentence><sentence id="1764">I was just jealous. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1767">Q: You liked having him to yourself? </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1771">Q: When you think back now, does it surprise you that someone who is 55 years old would want to adopt a little girl? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1773">A: Well, I don't - </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1775">Q: Or, was he just very special? </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2303">A: Yes, so that was the only issue -- that was the issue, but I promised, I promised solemnly that I would finish school, that I would go back to school, and when I came to the States, I thought, oh, God, starting all over again. </sentence><sentence id="2304">I started university in Zagreb, first I had a year. </sentence><sentence id="2305">Then, I started in Switzerland, and I had a hard time because I was having to study in French and I had studied English and German before and Russian but very little French. </sentence><sentence id="2306">I learned French, and I came here, and I thought, "Goodness, now what?" </sentence><sentence id="2307">And, so I got pregnant instead. </sentence><sentence id="2308">So, I had my daughter, and that was nice because I was sometimes feeling lonely. </sentence><sentence id="2309">I mean, then, my husband was a super-wonderful person, the very best, but I went from one wonderful person who took care of me, to my aunt and uncle in Switzerland, to Dan, who could've been -- who was everything that my uncle had been, just really nurturing and he was nine years older than I and had had his PhD and he was marrying this sophomore who doesn't know from beans and coming to this new country. </sentence><sentence id="2310">So, it was quite an experience to me. </sentence><sentence id="2311">And so, sometimes -- and there was nobody else here -- so sometimes I was lonely. </sentence><sentence id="2312">It was good to have my daughter. </sentence><sentence id="2313">Then, when, Elliott, my son, was born a year and a half later, when he started going to school, I did go back to school. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2334">A: It was, let me think when I was born in -- I think it was something like six years. </sentence><sentence id="2335">I could not go back earlier because, even if I had had money, because I didn't -- did not want to return without the American citizenship, maybe it was less than that, and I applied for it as soon as I could, which I was three years after I was here. </sentence><sentence id="2336">So, I had a year in Switzerland, and then I had three years here before I could apply, and then it took them a year to give it to me because I came from a Communist country and we were in the post- McCarthy era and they investigated me to no end, demanding why I hadn't protested when I had to join the Communist Youth of Yugoslavia. </sentence><sentence id="2337">Can you imagine? </sentence><sentence id="2338">If I'd protested, I'd be in jail. </sentence><sentence id="2339">So - </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2348">A: I was also a kid, right. </sentence><sentence id="2349">So, it took them a year, and as soon as I got it, then I asked for a release from the Yugoslav citizenship, which I got. </sentence><sentence id="2350">Then, I went back because it was still very, very difficult to leave the country, and then I went to back and went already with the two kids and my husband and it was wonderful. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2354">Q: And is this the first time they" ve met your husband? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2356">A: He met my husband, yes. </sentence><sentence id="2357">He couldn't come to the wedding. </sentence><sentence id="2358">I mean, he could have -- he could have possibly come. </sentence><sentence id="2359">He could've gotten a visa, et cetera, et cetera. </sentence><sentence id="2360">It would've taken time. </sentence><sentence id="2361">It took me six months every time to get a visa, but he was really, at that time, feeling his age. </sentence><sentence id="2362">He was not ever strong particularly, and at that point he was barely leaving the house anymore, and he really felt like he could not leave the house, I mean, go on such a trip. </sentence><sentence id="2363">And so, he wasn't at my wedding, which of course, was a pity, but it's sad. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2372">Q: It must have been wonderful for him to see the grandchildren. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2374">A: Yes, yes, yes, that was wonderful. </sentence><sentence id="2375">We had a super time. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2378">Q: Did you? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2380">A: Yeah, really a good time, and we stayed a few months. </sentence><sentence id="2381">It was really nice. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2384">Q: Really? </sentence><sentence id="2385">Fabulous! </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2392">Q: So, the kids got a sense. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2394">A: The kids, yes, and Wanda still has a good sense of it. </sentence><sentence id="2395">Elliott was a little too young to remember a lot, but Wanda, I think, does remember. </sentence><sentence id="2396">She was then in kindergarten. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2400">Q: Now, a lot of people think the Holocaust changed them. </sentence><sentence id="2401">In a way, I suppose you think you didn't go through the Holocaust. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2404">A: Sometimes, yes. </sentence><sentence id="2405">It took me a long time to understand that I'm a Holocaust survivor. </sentence><sentence id="2406">I never classified myself as such until very recently, when people told me, "Of course you are a Holocaust survivor." </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2410">Q: And, what does that -- does it mean something? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2412">A: Right now, it does. </sentence><sentence id="2413">It means -- it mean more and more. </sentence><sentence id="2414">I understand -- I've met now other people who didn't go to camp, and, you know, we think of them now as Holocaust survivors. </sentence><sentence id="2415">I used to think that a Holocaust survivor means someone who has gone through a concentration camp, which I was extremely lucky not to have gone through. </sentence><sentence id="2416">On the other hand, how do you define Holocaust? </sentence><sentence id="2417">There was Holocaust all around me. </sentence><sentence id="2418">I just have happened to have been at the right place at the right time, or all the wrong time I was in the right place not to be swept -- swept up with the rest. </sentence><sentence id="2419">So, I was just super-lucky in every way. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2428">Q: Except for the losses. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2430">A: Except for the losses, people losses. </sentence><sentence id="2431">The losses, the losses, yeah. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2434">Q: Even though you were little it was - </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2436">A: There's a sense of loss, and you realize it more after I had children, I became much more aware of the losses. </sentence><sentence id="2437">And I think at that point, you can put yourself in the other shoes -- not what it did to me, but what must it have done to my mother and my father to have your child taken away, to not know what's going to happen to that child, to be stuck some place and you don't know where your children are, whether they're dead or alive, all of that -- you become aware of that and internalize it, and think of it in a different way. </sentence><sentence id="2438">So, that's, you know, that's -- you can understand what it means to lose a child, and now I can understand what it means to lose a spouse, which is the saddest thing for me right now, still. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2442">Q: Dan died in "54? </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2450">Q: It still is. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2452">A: Yeah, yeah, and that's a kind of loss that I think I can understand sometimes people who --I was a child, so, I can see the child-parent relationship and what it would be like for my parents, but then, you know, Stricek mourned Giza forever and ever, and I can understand that very well. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2454">Q: Now? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2456">A: Yeah, and he mourned my brother terribly forever. </sentence><sentence id="2457">So, later on, you realize it, and yeah, I suppose, I now understand it what it means to be a survivor, and it's not the easiest place either. </sentence><sentence id="2458">I think I cope well, but that's it. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2462">Q: You also seem to have enjoyed life in many ways. </sentence></p></dialogue>
