girl was wearing pants, only skirts. </sentence><sentence id="548">And he picks up the skirts and on the...on the...on the silky panties he gives 25 with the whip. </sentence><sentence id="549">When he gave me the 25 I went to him and begged him not to hit my sister. </sentence><sentence id="550">She is only 14 years old. </sentence><sentence id="551">She will not be able to take it, the 25. </sentence><sentence id="552">I was biting my...my lips not to scream, not to give him the satisfaction when he was hitting me, but then I went to him and I kissed his hand and I begged him, "Hit me once more and don't hit my sister." </sentence><sentence id="553">But they kept me by the wall and they started to hit my sister. </sentence><sentence id="554">Then I was screaming to get off my sister, but my sister didn't get 25 because every whip she was so young, a child 14 years, every whip was with blood. </sentence><sentence id="555">So he gave her...and she...she told me just last week, she had only six. </sentence><sentence id="556">I didn't know how many, but..but she had only six times. </sentence><sentence id="557">But we couldn't sit a long time later. </sentence><sentence id="558">And she...she was laying always, when she went in bed, she was laying on the...on the belly. </sentence><sentence id="559">But the next day, we had to go...we had to go off anyway to work, so

was winter. </sentence><sentence id="563">So he hit me with his cane, so he broke on me the cane in few...in few pieces. </sentence><sentence id="564">And...and then he called me to the office and he says, "Tomorrow you will have to bring me other cane because I broke the cane. </sentence><sentence id="565">If not I will...I will kill you tomorrow." </sentence><sentence id="566">So the whole...when I came back to the ghetto, the whole ghetto was looking the cellars and the...for a cane to bring me the cane and... because...and they brought me about 10 canes. </sentence><sentence id="567">So beautiful, some of them were silver things what the people left what they were sent away..to give him and I gave him the whole thing...10 canes because he broke on me the cane. </sentence><sentence id="568">Such things! </sentence><sentence id="569">They degraded us so, I was not caring anymore, but I promised my mother that I will take care the rest of my family so I...I didn't care to be killed already. </sentence><sentence id="570">Then... then my brother, my last brother, was sent away. </sentence><sentence id="571">And this brother...and this brother what I saved his life, he came one time home and he says, "Mina, I heard...I heard that they will go to...to liquidate woman in ghettos. </sentence><sentence id="572">I will not let myself anymore tear apart.
