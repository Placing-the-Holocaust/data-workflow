</sentence><sentence id="3891">Four guys were pushing, prisoners, Jewish, death guard -- it s-seemed like standard procedure. </sentence><sentence id="3892">They'd appeared from the nowhere, they were coming closer and closer, nobody touched them, nobody told them anything. </sentence><sentence id="3893">Came to the ditch -- went to the ditch, put the cart -- I think they even got it somehow into the ditch and grabbed the little guy who had died first, no problem, two guys lift him up, bango on the [indecipherable]. </sentence><sentence id="3894">Grabbed the second guy -- they needed all four of them to lift up the heavy guy. </sentence><sentence id="3895">They had problems lifting up the heavy guy, so finally the [indecipherable] got him and the one, two three, all seven, turned the cart around, marched away. </sentence><sentence id="3896">Death cart. </sentence><sentence id="3897">Standard instrument of picking up the dead during the Nazi regime. </sentence><sentence id="3898">Now, not even the commies in the Spanish Civil War were doing things like that. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3988">A: Why did he do it? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3990">Q: Why? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3992">A: Was he a German German? </sentence><sentence id="3993">Was he a Nazi German? </sentence><sentence id="3994">Had he lost his mind? </sentence><sentence id="3995">Or, my [indecipherable] finale -- my latest conclusion; he had been so brainwashed by his own system that we [indecipherable] because he had been made officer in the Dachau camp in 1938 -- he had been so brainwashed to have believed, like many Nazis, they had become master of life or death of the untermensche, and that he was responsible to no one. </sentence><sentence id="3996">And the tragedy over that is evidently the tragedy of seven dead Jewish people, innocent as they were, especially, but tragedy that nobody brought it to trial. </sentence><sentence id="3997">Two days later, the officer of commanding school said, what has happened, has happened. </sentence><sentence id="3998">If you survive the war, if you win the war, we are not accountable. </sentence><sentence id="3999">If you lose the war, you're going to be dead anyway. </sentence><sentence id="4000">So you got away scot-free. </sentence><sentence id="4001">And we in our deep ourselves, including Barouka, who claimed in Ravensburg that he had been in the hospital, he had never been there, and the judge accused him -- accused him of lying directly into the face of modern German democratic law, right? </sentence><sentence id="4002">Even Barouka said it was wrong, what had happened. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="4014">Q: Who was Barouka? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="4016">A: This is no -- Barouka Kuno, one of the witnesses -- </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="4017">Q: Uh-huh. </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="4018">A: -- who was quite close to me. </sentence><sentence id="4019">He was a decent guy. </sentence><sentence id="4020">I was counting on him to back me up. </sentence><sentence id="4021">Suddenly he looks at me, he says, Lallier, you were a traitor. </sentence><sentence id="4022">This never happened. </sentence><sentence id="4023">So -- so, we went through the last four weeks of the war, totally, totally having -- I had totally lost belief in any trace of humanity on the part of the Germans. </sentence><sentence id="4024">So just look at the sequence. </sentence><sentence id="4025">Hanging all those Serbs. </sentence><sentence id="4026">Massacring the partisan women. </sentence><sentence id="4027">There was one more [indecipherable] massacring the partisan women. </sentence><sentence id="4028">Anyway, I'll -- I'll become -- come to they murdered -- killing -- oh, t-talking about human rights and that. </sentence><sentence id="4029">And that -- oh yes, killing all kinds of partisan, burning the villages, and then seeing this guy killing seven unarmed, half starved people in their tattered rags, could only have meant that the guy had suffered dementia, which is legally excusable, they put a guy like that in a nuthouse, right? </sentence><sentence id="4030">Or the ultimate evil condition of believing that his destiny was to be the ultimate judge over the life or death of people, especially [indecipherable] defenseless people. </sentence><sentence id="4031">So he, to me -- Viel was the -- remains the ultimate example of the evil that the Nazi system can inculcate in human minds, making them believe at the individual level that not only Adolf, but they as their emissaries had the right to kill on sight, without being accountable to anybody. </sentence><sentence id="4032">Now, counter argument, as I learned from the critics at Ravensburg, a Waffen SS officer will never do a killing like that unless he's ordered to. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="4049">Q: Who said that? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="4051">A: The defense lawyer. </sentence><sentence id="4052">Now, he raised the question that was Viel ordered by the superior officers in -- still living in Prague to do the killing to find out how the cadets would react. </sentence><sentence id="4053">Would they react like true Nazis and clap? </sentence><sentence id="4054">Or would those be weeded out who may have negative inclinations. </sentence><sentence id="4055">Because the SS officer corps will need to have undoubtedly component members who are ultimate Nazis to whom what Hitler says is the absolute right. </sentence><sentence id="4056">I have no answer to that because the commanding officer eventually lost his life, the last day of the war in Prague, but the question was raised at the court, you see? </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="4065">A: Yeah? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="4067">Q: Either way, whether Viel did it on his own, or he did it because he was ordered, does it really make a difference? </sentence></p></dialogue>

but prefer a country of peace. </sentence><sentence id="5399">Even though the country was supplying all the napalm the -- America needed to bomb the hell out of Vietnam. </sentence><sentence id="5400">So I came back home, came across some of my refugees that I brought here, including the guy who had opened the coffee shop, who gave me a permanent table like in Vienna. </sentence><sentence id="5401">Adalbert, whenever you come -- in Hungarian -- this is your table, I give you my personal services. </sentence><sentence id="5402">And he was very grateful. </sentence><sentence

liked that. </sentence><sentence id="5405">So that was 1957. </sentence><sentence id="5406">I went to the United States, lived in New York for three years, 1960 to 1963. </sentence><sentence

id="5411">So he got me a Brooklyn summer job [indecipherable] college, 1962 in the summer -- 1961 in the summer. </sentence><sentence id="5412">And he said, I prefer you to stay in the United States

hoping that eventually the maker, in the Christian tradition St. Peter, will look at me and say, oh Adalbert you old rascal, you didn't do anything, did you? </sentence><sentence id="5422">But you at

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="5500">A: I don't reflect about that, it's a matter of just sentimentality. </sentence><sentence id="5501">The Rabbi Poupko tells me, if you had decided to talk, you wouldn't be here witness to a crime, and a criminal would remain unpunished, and maybe a whole system would therefore remain unpunished. </sentence><sentence id="5502">So in a certain sense, he'd say, Lallier, be practical about thing. </sentence><sentence id="5503">You may have decided not to talk because you knew you had a higher purpose than that. </sentence><sentence id="5504">You had to become a witness to something awful that had happened, and that was what your life was about. </sentence><sentence id="5505">But even though it intellectually sounds -- sounds very satisfying, to stand there and to look at the man killing, right in front of my face, seven innocent people one at a time, it's a horrendous experience. </sentence></p></dialogue>
