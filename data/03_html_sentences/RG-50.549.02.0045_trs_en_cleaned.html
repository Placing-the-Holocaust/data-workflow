somebody, not on our own. </sentence><sentence id="287">So finally, my husband couldn't get a job, so somebody recommended the [indecipherable] work he does, a lot of Jewish and Polish people open up a cleaning store. </sentence><sentence id="288">For that you don't need money. </sentence><sentence id="289">You take an empty store, you buy an old sewing machine. </sentence><sentence id="290">I
