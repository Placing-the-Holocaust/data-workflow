" </sentence><sentence id="414">Cause I was brought up in a very warm and loving family my parents had. </sentence><sentence id="415">So it was hard for me. </sentence><sentence id="416">And [ all the time thought, "When my parents come back, I'll appreciate them more. </sentence><sentence id="417">And if my brother comes alive, I'll never get married. </sentence><sentence id="418">Never. </sentence><sentence id="419">Take care of him all my life, as long as I live." </sentence><sentence id="420">But it didn't happen. </sentence><sentence id="421">It didn't happen, so I can't do anything. </sentence><sentence id="422">And it's still... when people are with their children, are complaining, it hurts me. </sentence><sentence id="423">Because, thank God, they have normal children and parents. </sentence><sentence id="424">They have old mothers, old fathers. </sentence><sentence id="425">My mother was 43 and my father 41 when they died. </sentence><sentence id="426">So it's very young. </sentence><sentence id="427">And my brother was 17 or 18. </sentence><sentence id="428">He had nothing from life. </sentence><sentence id="429">So it's very painful. </sentence><sentence id="430">And sometimes, you'll remember...

With so much respect for my parents, that I saw somebody slapping my father. </sentence><sentence id="466">I...I couldn't believe it. </sentence><sentence id="467">But it was... it was very painful. </sentence><sentence id="468">Very painful. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="958">A: The problem was that I lived day-to-day. </sentence><sentence id="959">Because sometimes the man called me, wanted to know my real name. </sentence><sentence id="960">But I was not stupid. </sentence><sentence id="961">I told him that's my name. </sentence><sentence id="962">But one time, I had a very big problem. </sentence><sentence id="963">And my "Aunt" that kept me was very angry. </sentence><sentence id="964">I went to a girlfriend to play. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="965">And I shouldn't have gone; because in the front of the house of that girlfriend was a big truck, and they had just picked up Jewish people. </sentence><sentence id="966">And that boy who was sitting in the truck knew me. </sentence><sentence id="967">He wanted to go with me to my "Aunt" Paulette--her name. </sentence><sentence id="968">And "Aunt" Paulette didn't want to accept. </sentence><sentence id="969">When he saw me, he told the Germans, "She is Jewish. </sentence><sentence id="970">Put her in the truck with me." </sentence><sentence id="971">But when the German went down, I was gone. </sentence><sentence id="972">I was very fast. </sentence><sentence id="973">I was gone; but for three days, I was very sick. </sentence><sentence id="974">Like shock. </sentence><sentence id="975">I was so nervous. </sentence><sentence id="976">I was so afraid. </sentence><sentence id="977">How a person can....
