<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="29">Q: Your siblings? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="31">A: I have a sister. </sentence><sentence id="32">She died two years ago and she was two and a half years older than I was and two and half years actually made quite a difference at that time in Germany. </sentence><sentence id="33">I continued going to a Jewish school, the local school, and she went to a Jewish school in Kolon, a high school, and so our lives were quite a bit apart and quite a bit different later on in life. </sentence><sentence id="34">We were quite different I think in personality, too. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="39">Q: When did she leave for school? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="41">A: There were three of them that went together, three friends from Esson, people her age, children her age. </sentence><sentence id="42">And they left at about eight in the morning and came back by train again five o'clock in the afternoon. </sentence><sentence id="43">She commuted by train every day. </sentence><sentence id="44">Our lives were quite different because I went to the local Jewish school still at that time. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="49">Q: Did you have a lot of religious ritual in your own home? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="51">A: We had quite a bit but there again I must say my father was a very modern kind of person and he really didn't force us to go when we didn't want to go. </sentence><sentence id="52">I mean certain things we This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="53">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="54"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection had to go like the high holidays but on the whole if we really didn't want to go to something or do something he let it be and didn't really insist on it. </sentence><sentence id="55">On the other hand, being children of rabbis or being the wife of a rabbi is not an easy job because you're always scrutinized. </sentence><sentence id="56">I think the expectations of a rabbi aren't real and the rabbi's family equally -- you're supposed to be a role model and be perfect and so if we did go to the synagogue and so forth it was expected that we behave especially well and be a model. </sentence><sentence id="57">Looking back I think being associated -- being part of a rabbi's family is quite a strain on the whole family. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="67">Q: Was that imposed by your own family or more by society? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="69">A: I think that's how it is because much, much later in life in this country my sister married a rabbi also who took over my father's congregation actually and it was the same. </sentence><sentence id="70">And I see it here even now with rabbis. </sentence><sentence id="71">I think the expectations are very great and you expect sort of perfection from everything they touch including the wife and the family. </sentence><sentence id="72">Although I think with the wife it's getting a little bit better with the wives now can have more of a life of their own and not insisting that it's not a package deal entirely that they have to go on leading their own lives a little bit. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="77">Q: Tell me a little bit about what you mean about your father being very modern? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="79">A: Very -- he was not a black and white kind of person. </sentence><sentence id="80">This is the way it's written, this is the way it had to be. </sentence><sentence id="81">He could see different interpretations and people varying the scriptures or the commandments to go with the modern times and what they had to do. </sentence><sentence id="82">Another thing that just came to my attention recently, when he was a young rabbi and just started apparently there was a discussion in the congregation between the senior rabbi -- he was the junior rabbi then -- the senior rabbi and the congregation about the role of the Polish Jews in Esson in that time and the senior rabbi was saying that the Polish Jews should assimilate and learn to speak proper German and should dress the way the rest of the population did and that the way they were acting was bringing on anti-semitism and my father -- this is a newspaper article that I just got -- my father disagreed and said no it was all right for them to keep their own culture and that was not the thing that was bringing on anti-semitism and that it's okay to maintain your own culture and your own environment. </sentence><sentence id="83">I think that's a more modern approach, more open minded. </sentence><sentence id="84">Open to different ideas, open to the world around you and seeing how Judaism fits into that. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="91">Q: How was he received by the community and his modernize, was that unusual? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="93">A: Well, apparently very well and of course as a child what I remember is that he was adored by everybody because everybody respected him, but even looking back now in the articles that I read about it, that I have come across recently, it seems to have gone over okay with most of them. </sentence><sentence id="94">Now what he was able to do, the Polish Jews had their own little congregation because they worshipped a little differently than the other German Jews and he was sort of able to build to a bridge between the two cultures and I think that's a very worthwhile enterprise and was very well received and certainly served everybody well in those times. </sentence><sentence id="95">He was also very instrumental in building what was a time  http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection place for the young people, a big, big building that was established oh about "33 or "34 for the Jewish youth in Esson. </sentence><sentence id="96">It had a big kitchen, cafeteria, lots of room for meeting, big huge gymnasium and this was to serve the youth of Esson, the Jewish youth, but actually the whole community as other things became more and more restrictive the whole community used that building extensively and he was very instrumental in getting that done. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="102">Q: What about your mother? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="104"> AX My mother was wonderful. </sentence><sentence id="105">My mother was what a was supposed to be in  http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection it was also a stressful time because that's actually when my father had to work the hardest. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="109">Q: Did you always go to his sermons? </sentence><sentence id="110">Was the family always present? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="113">A: No, actually we were not always present, and that was an okay thing. </sentence><sentence id="114">My mother was. </sentence><sentence id="115">My mother felt that she had to, but we weren't always there, no. </sentence><sentence id="116">He gave us actually the freedom to come and go as we chose within reason. </sentence><sentence id="117">Holidays or anything big we would be there but otherwise we had sort of a choice. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="123">Q: Did you take on any of the religious feeling or the sense of religion that your father had? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="125">A: I think I did, I think I also took on his doubting at the same time that I took on the religion. </sentence><sentence id="126">Unfortunately part of being the daughter of a rabbi is that you see too much of the congregation and I got really turned off by institutional religion. </sentence><sentence id="127">I just too much of it, but that's more in this country than actually in Germany. </sentence><sentence id="128">In this country -- in Germany the rabbi didn't have to worry about getting paid or anything like that because part of it came out of the tax money which was then given back to each religion so it was a much stabler kind of job. </sentence><sentence id="129">But in this country, of course, he built up a congregation and he had to see that the money comes and all these things that a rabbi shouldn't have to worry about, but in this country they do. </sentence><sentence id="130">So, I associate congregations sort of with a lot of stress a lot of in-fighting and not too positive actually I'm sorry to say. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="137">Q: Was he rabbi at the synagogue from the time that you were born? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="139">A: Yes, before I was born actually and until we left. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="141">Q: What do you remember about the synagogue? </sentence><sentence id="142">Were you impressed by it? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="145">A: Oh, it was a beautiful, beautiful place and on the high holidays the women sat upstairs. </sentence><sentence id="146">I would be with my mother and downstairs the men were and they had high hats and they had their own places where they could put them then and so forth. </sentence><sentence id="147">It was a very, very beautiful building and very impressive and very awe inspiring really. </sentence><sentence id="148">I remember I guess it was one Yom Kippur and you talk about who shall die in the next year and who shall live and so forth and so forth. </sentence><sentence id="149">I remember sitting upstairs with my mother and getting very concerned and very worried and worrying that she might die soon and I kept saying that I hope that she would live until I was at least 16 or 17 which at the time seemed like an ancient age to me. </sentence><sentence id="150">And she assured me that yes she thought she would. </sentence><sentence id="151">Yes, it was a very impressive kind of thing. </sentence><sentence id="152">It certainly carried me along during that time. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="161">Q: What about your home life? </sentence><sentence id="162">Did you play at home a lot with friends? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="165">A: We played at home a great deal. </sentence><sentence id="166">We had when we moved to the to the  http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection friends and they visited back and forth quite a bit and I think I was slow in making friends and had few friends but they were good friends probably. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="170">Q: Do you remember realizing at a particular point that your being Jewish separated you somehow from many other people in the town where you lived? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="172">A: Well, the first time that happened is when I was pretty young, four or five years old or something and when we lived in this nice part of Esson, the very affluent part with big back yards and we liked to play in the back yards and my sister and I and sometimes one of her friends also and we were playing there and the house next door was owned by a family who had one son and he was usually playing there by himself. </sentence><sentence id="173">So, after a while, after watching him a few days and so forth we started a conversation and he seemed very receptive and we got to be very good friends actually. </sentence><sentence id="174">Then he got the clever idea that we should carve a hole in the fence so that we could go back and forth between the yards and we had a big sandbox in our yard which he liked and he could get at readily and he had sort of berries and things in his yard which we didn't have and -- also for hide and go seek you had double the area to play in. </sentence><sentence id="175">That was a great thing to do. </sentence><sentence id="176">Then it went along very, very well and then one day we came down and the thing was boarded up and we couldn't understand so we kept shouting Harmine, that was the boy's name, to come to the window and he wouldn't come and we didn't see anything. </sentence><sentence id="177">Actually we thought it was all a mistake that somebody probably the gardener or something had seen the hole and didn't know that we had permission from both parents to have that and that's it. </sentence><sentence id="178">It shouldn't be this way, I better do something about it. </sentence><sentence id="179">So, we thought it would be taken care of shortly. </sentence><sentence id="180">Then a week or two passed by and we kept shouting for Harmine from the yard and we even had the audacity to go out on the street and yell for him. </sentence><sentence id="181">Nothing happened. </sentence><sentence id="182">He never came to the big window. </sentence><sentence id="183">Finally we approached my mother and asked her to find out what was going on and she really didn't want to do that too much. </sentence><sentence id="184">She didn't like to interfere in relationships between children but she said all right if I see the lady I'll speak to her. </sentence><sentence id="185">So, another week passed by and she said yes, I saw Mrs. Schmidt but she was just too busy. </sentence><sentence id="186">I didn't have a chance to talk to her. </sentence><sentence id="187">Finally one day she came and she said I did see Mrs. Schmidt and she was crying and she was really sorry but she said what had happened is that Harmine had joined the Hitler Youth and at first they thought that was fine and everything was all right and then one day he came home after a meeting and he said he just didn't want to have anything more to do with Jews and he wouldn't have anything more to do with us. </sentence><sentence id="188">They should right away board up that hole in the fence. </sentence><sentence id="189">Not only that, that his parents should have no contact with my parents and shouldn't say hello to them, shouldn't do anything with them. </sentence><sentence id="190">Shouldn't talk to us certainly and if they continued doing that that he would report the parents to the authority. </sentence><sentence id="191">Mrs. Schmidt was in tears when she said that to my mother because they had been -- not close friends, but you know, cordial, and said hello and chatted for a bit you know on and off and she said she's sorry. </sentence><sentence id="192">She was afraid of her son and of what he would do. </sentence><sentence id="193">So, she really had to say this is it. </sentence><sentence id="194">There was to be no further contact. </sentence><sentence id="195">And of course I was aghast. </sentence><sentence id="196">Here I was still the same person. </sentence><sentence id="197">My sister was still the same person. </sentence><sentence id="198">We had a wonderful time. </sentence><sentence id="199">We actually shared very intimate family secrets and all This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="200">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="201"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection sorts of things and all of a sudden from one day to the next there was this barrier and he couldn't speak to us anymore. </sentence><sentence id="202">It was beyond comprehension and I was really upset and it's something that you just -- I couldn't figure out what was going on and why that should happen. </sentence><sentence id="203">So, that was the first time that something happened. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="238">Q: Had you ever when you were playing with him had he ever said anything about you being Jewish? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="240">A: Never. </sentence><sentence id="241">It never came up. </sentence><sentence id="242">Religion had never come up. </sentence><sentence id="243">We never discussed it. </sentence><sentence id="244">We were busy -- he had a pretty good imagination. </sentence><sentence id="245">We were making up games and different things and so forth. </sentence><sentence id="246">We were busy with different games. </sentence><sentence id="247">Then he told us things about his family, what they were doing. </sentence><sentence id="248">You know how kids are, complaining about the parents and so forth. </sentence><sentence id="249">We would do the same, but there was never any talk of any religion or anything. </sentence><sentence id="250">It didn't seem to matter. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="262">Q: Were you aware that there was a difference between your family and Harmine family? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="264">A: Not at that time, no. </sentence><sentence id="265">I think actually at that time my parents still had a lot of non-Jewish friends too. </sentence><sentence id="266">So, we were in contact with non-Jewish people at that time. </sentence><sentence id="267">Our governess, the people who took care of us were not Jewish. </sentence><sentence id="268">SO, so no I didn't consider the problem at that time. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="274">Q: Do you have further instances, further memories? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="276">A: Well, the only other thing that happened while we were living in that house is my sister and I took piano lessons from a Jewish piano teacher who was supposed to be very good or so they said at the time and we had just started maybe three or four months. </sentence><sentence id="277">Then all of a sudden he couldn't come anymore and we asked what had happened and first it was oh well, he's not well this week and then it turned out though that he had been arrested and so I asked my mother why would they arrest somebody like that. </sentence><sentence id="278">What did he do, and my mother said from what she could gather he didn't do anything it was just that he was Jewish and that Jews were suspect and that they had arrested him because they suspected him of doing something subversive and so I didn't -- I asked whether that happens quite often and my mother at that time said while it does happen apparently my father was arrested when I was just a baby and apparently there had been a letter that had been forged but had his signature denouncing the government so they had arrested him for a day and then released him, but then again brought home the idea that being Jewish was something different. </sentence><sentence id="279">You were more suspect certainly and authorities looked on you differently than they would on somebody else. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="284">Q: Did you have any understanding of why that was or any rationale for that? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="286">A: No, and I don't think I questioned it except that that is the way it is. </sentence><sentence id="287">It think that's the one thing how easily -- of course I didn't know anything differently. </sentence><sentence id="288">I grew up in that atmosphere and how easily you accept it. </sentence><sentence id="289">This is the way it is. </sentence><sentence id="290">That's all you know and so This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="291">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="292"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection you know you expected that to be the way the world runs. </sentence><sentence id="293">So, no I didn't question it. </sentence><sentence id="294">I just took it for granted that that's the way things are. </sentence><sentence id="295">So, then well my parents also became very uncomfortable in that neighborhood and we moved in the , the parish house which was adjoining the synagogue. </sentence><sentence id="296">It was really part of it. </sentence><sentence id="297">It was a big building. </sentence><sentence id="298">It was a triplex. </sentence><sentence id="299">three stories actually. </sentence><sentence id="300">Then I heard more and more stories of my friends and friends of theirs being beaten up on the street because they were Jewish and yelled at because they were Jews or ridiculed because they were Jewish and so | began to realize that that kind of thing did happen and was afraid of going outside. </sentence><sentence id="301">Not that it happened to me personally although they did yell Jew or something and point across the street but I was certainly never beaten up or anything but just hearing that constantly made you very, very aware that the streets were not a safe place to be. </sentence><sentence id="302">And our own life became more and more restrictive although I didn't realize this at the time, but my parents had the good sense to see to it that we were more or less in a Jewish environment all of the time so we didn't come in contact with these dangers. </sentence><sentence id="303">I went to a Jewish school. </sentence><sentence id="304">My friends were all Jewish. </sentence><sentence id="305">By that time their friends were all Jewish only and they didn't have any contact with anybody else. </sentence><sentence id="306">One of the nicer things that happened through this is that the people who helped us, our household help and the people who helped to take care of us had not been Jewish up to now and now we had Jewish help and most of them were young girls who were preparing to go to Israel, Palestine at the time. </sentence><sentence id="307">This was part of their training to learn to take care of a household and children and all that kind of things. </sentence><sentence id="308">Actually for us it was much nicer because they were a lot more fun than the people we had been with before so that was a very positive thing for us. </sentence><sentence id="309">We went to the , the place for the youth and joined youth groups and there  http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection There were lots of stories that went around, more and more stories of people being deprived of their profession or their stores being closed or signs outside that people shouldn't be there, Germans shouldn't buy there from Jewish stores, and this kind of thing. </sentence><sentence id="310">But they were removed from me personally. </sentence><sentence id="311">They were things that I heard and that I took in but in my own little environment it felt relatively safe and okay at that time. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="341">Q: So were you able to forget then that this was going on for greater parts of your daily life? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="343">A: Yes, for most of the time, except when I hit the streets then I was more careful and I would keep in mind all the things that I'd been told. </sentence><sentence id="344">For most of the time it was what I considered a normal life or that's the only thing I knew and it seemed fairly rich life. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="347">Q: Why did your family make the decision to move to the house? </sentence><sentence id="348"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="351">A: Not very much and as I say that's part of the thing that the family wasn't as close as it could have been over there. </sentence><sentence id="352">They were busy with their things and we were doing whatever we were supposed to be doing but not as much as later on when we came to this country for instance. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="355">Q: What about in school, were you taught about the laws after Nuremberg were created? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="357">A: No, of course I was in a very low grade and I think what they tried to do is keep things as normal as possible. </sentence><sentence id="358">They sort of tried to hide the abnormalities that were going on around us and to maintain the normalcy as much as possible. </sentence><sentence id="359">So, actually what I heard was more from other children than any teacher saying anything ever. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="363">Q: They would tell you what sorts of things? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="365">A: The children? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="367">Q: Yes. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="369">A: Well, they would tell me mostly what I remember was about somebody being beaten up. </sentence><sentence id="370">Meeting somebody and being beaten up by other children. </sentence><sentence id="371">Usually at that time that was the main complaint or ridiculed or pants ripped down, things like that. </sentence><sentence id="372">But the teachers tried to sort of maintain a semblance of normalcy through it all. </sentence><sentence id="373">That's the amazing thing and I guess that's a survivor mechanism, you know, you don't accentuate the abnormal but sort of try to keep it as normal or stick to the normal part as much as you can. </sentence><sentence id="374">And they did in school. </sentence><sentence id="375">They stayed away from most other things except the subjects. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="383">Q: Did you like school? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="385">A: Well, at first I hated it. </sentence><sentence id="386">It was very hard for me to adjust to school, to being away from home and to adjust to school. </sentence><sentence id="387">Then I rather liked it. </sentence><sentence id="388">I wouldn't say I was crazy about it, but I rather liked it. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="393">Q: What sorts of -- what were your favorite things to do? </sentence></p></dialogue>

class="Answer"><p><sentence id="496">A: The next major thing that happened was the deportation of the Polish Jews, of Jews that were born in Poland and that was a shattering moment in my life and certainly took away any kind of security that I had up to then. </sentence><sentence id="497">That -- I remember that day vividly. </sentence><sentence id="498">It started early in the morning and I woke up and instead of the usual breakfast being prepared and so forth I heard all sorts of phone calls. </sentence><sentence id="499">People coming in and out and so forth. </sentence><sentence id="500">Then my parents said that as far as they could gather at that point, that they were collecting all the Jews of Polish decent and didn't know what they were going to do with them but they were gathering them and they were all in the school yard and they were herding them together there and nobody knew what was going on. </sentence><sentence id="501">The telephone was ringing as more people reported somebody else being rounded up. </sentence><sentence id="502">So my mother informed us that there was not going to be any school. </sentence><sentence id="503">Actually there was school for my sister who was in Kolone and she had left for school already but that I wasn't going to have any school that day which was great. </sentence><sentence id="504">That my father and my mother and the sexton and his wife and everybody would be busy that day and that I should go downstairs and play with the sexton's children. </sentence><sentence id="505">They had an old grandfather who usually stayed in his room but that was enough supervision if anything terrible happened, he could take care of us, and that they would be gone trying to help the Polish Jews in whatever way they could. </sentence><sentence id="506">So, I went downstairs to my playmates and they had heard of somebody being rounded up and we'd throw out names and we had no idea really what was going on or how serious it was. </sentence><sentence id="507">The grownups seemed excited and seemed worried so we thought it must be serious but we had no idea actually what was going on. </sentence><sentence id="508">We were by ourselves down there and lunchtime came and nobody showed up and nobody told us anything and we were wondering so we prepared lunch and fixed lunch and then things got to be very, very boring and so we decided to play hide and go seek which was our favorite game at that time. </sentence><sentence id="509">Since everybody was gone we could use the basement of the parish house which also connected with the basement of the synagogue so it was a huge, huge thing with tunnels going all ways and very, very little lighting. </sentence><sentence id="510">It was really a spooky kind of place and perfect for hide and go seek. </sentence><sentence id="511">We weren't really supposed to play there. </sentence><sentence id="512">That was sort of forbidden territory but we'd been there before and we thought everybody's gone, this would be a good day to explore all the tunnels that we hadn't explored in the past. </sentence><sentence id="513">So, we went down there and played and I must say we forgot -- or at least I forgot all about what was going on with the Polish Jews or anything else that was going on. </sentence><sentence id="514">We were wrapped up in our games. </sentence><sentence id="515">Then we suddenly became aware that there was another person. </sentence><sentence id="516">There was somebody else down there. </sentence><sentence id="517">First the boy, my friend, saw him first and then the rest of us saw it and we stealthily crept up there to see who it was and what was going on, who'd be down there. </sentence><sentence id="518">As we came close this person turned around and he was frightened, absolutely frightened, petrified and garbled something which we couldn't understood. </sentence><sentence id="519">We on the other hand recognized that it was one of our Jewish teachers, teacher from our Jewish school and we couldn't figure out what he was doing. </sentence><sentence id="520">He was just shoving and pointing the other way for us so we decided we better leave him alone, he's not quite right in the mind. </sentence><sentence id="521">He was sort of strange anyway we thought, but stranger than usual. </sentence><sentence id="522">So, we decided he wants to be left alone. </sentence><sentence id="523">He obviously doesn't want us here so we better go and we thought it's probably time for us to check upstairs because we didn't want to be This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="524">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or

and couldn't figure out what this teacher was doing there and why he was acting so strangely and so frightened. </sentence><sentence id="526">We couldn't understand even what he was saying. </sentence><sentence id="527">We got upstairs and then the parents of my friends, the sexton and his wife came back and they were sitting there and they were very depressed. </sentence><sentence id="528">They were tired too. </sentence><sentence id="529">They were tired and very depressed and telling all the things that they had done. </sentence><sentence id="530">Apparently the Polish Jews had been rounded up and they couldn't gather any of their things together so anything they could throw into a suitcase if a suitcase was handy they could take, but they were only given five or ten minutes. </sentence><sentence id="531">Once they got to the school yard, they found all sorts of things that they were missing, so the rest of the Jewish population was busy that whole day scrounging around trying to give them the necessities at least that they would need for a trip, which obviously they were going to take. </sentence><sentence id="532">Also, to get some food to them, lunch and so forth. </sentence><sentence id="533">Then, just before the sexton and his wife came back, it had been announced that all the Polish Jews were to go to the train station, to the platform, and they were all marched down there and it's then that everybody found out that they were supposed to be shipped back to Poland. </sentence><sentence id="534">Everybody was just devastated by the event. </sentence><sentence id="535">These were some of our close friends. </sentence><sentence id="536">Now, the teacher that we had -- well, some of our close friends were caught in that and then the parents asked what we'd been doing and my friend said that we had been down there in the basement and that we came across the teacher, the Jewish teacher and what was he doing down there. </sentence><sentence id="537">The parents became very upset that we had been down there and what we had seen and they rushed to the phone and called my parents and after talking to them my friends parents came back and said that my parents wanted me upstairs to talk to me. </sentence><sentence id="538">I thought it was something to do with being in a place where we weren't supposed to play and I went up there and | already knew what I was going to tell them and the reasons why this had to be and when I got up there, both my father and my mother were there to talk to me and that was very rare that my father would bother to get involved in this kind of thing. </sentence><sentence id="539">They had asked what had happened and I told them that we had seen this teacher acting very peculiar, very strange and they got very, very serious and they said what we had seen was very dangerous if we would divulge it. </sentence><sentence id="540">It would be very dangerous, not only to the teacher but to our family and to everybody else and that what had happened was early in the morning when all these people were calling in saying that the Polish Jews were being rounded up and this family was rounded and this family was rounded up, my father somehow thought of this teacher and was able to contact him before they arrived at his house and had said that he could hide in the basement. </sentence><sentence id="541">So, it was obviously imperative that nobody knew that he was there and that it would be very dangerous if anybody found out for instance that my father had contacted this man and sort of given him a sanctuary there for a little bit. </sentence><sentence id="542">So, it was made very, very clear that under no circumstances should I divulge what I had seen and where he was and so forth. </sentence><sentence id="543">I was just frightened to death, frightened to death of the whole thing realizing for the first time I think, I was realizing what had really happened to the Polish Jews because up until then I really hadn't fathomed it. </sentence><sentence id="544">It was sort of first they were herded together in the school This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="545">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="546"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection 3 yard and so forth and it was only after this all happened and they really were put on the train that I realized the tragedy of it all. </sentence><sentence id="547">So, I was overcome by that. </sentence><sentence id="548">I was also frightened that somehow in my sleep or some way I would give way to what I had seen and that he was there and I just wish I'd never been there and the responsibility of keeping the secret just became a great burden to me. </sentence><sentence id="549">I was just hoping I wouldn't tell anybody without meaning to. </sentence><sentence id="550">So, then it was then really after listening to the other parents and to my parents that I realized the full impact of what had happened to the Polish Jews. </sentence><sentence id="551">It was already late afternoon, it was Friday night, so we got ready for the synagogue and we dressed up as we usually did and I think everybody who is Jewish was gathered there and everybody was crying and trying to console each other. </sentence><sentence id="552">Now, this I don't know. </sentence><sentence id="553">It has been told to me that my father gave a very stirring sermon sort of saying that the Polish Jews that this is just the first chapter, that similar things would be awaiting us. </sentence><sentence id="554">I was really too tired. </sentence><sentence id="555">I think I fell asleep actually in the evening and afterwards when they told me about the sermon I really didn't believe it. </sentence><sentence id="556">I mean the Polish Jews was one thing but to us, to my family that that would happen I really didn't believe it or couldn't believe it. </sentence><sentence id="557">I think there were quite a few German Jews who at that time still didn't believe it. </sentence><sentence id="558">It's just hard to picture that this kind of thing happens to you. </sentence><sentence id="559">So after that day, there was no sense of security that anybody had after that anymore because if you can take such a mass of people and uproot them within a few hours and shove them of to another unknown part after that we thought that things could happen. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="633">A: No, it was just what the sexton and his wife was telling us and then what my parents had said what had happened, but apparently every able person who had time was there at the school yard doing the same thing that they were doing, gathering things for the Polish Jews that they needed, providing food for them. </sentence><sentence id="634">So, my father tells this story that one of the Polish Jews that he was helping, handing him some food said but doctor who's going to do that for you when your time comes? </sentence><sentence id="635">I think my father at that time realized that this was the beginning of the end. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="660">A: Just that there was great fear and I guess I was more leery of anybody that wasn't Jewish when I went out. </sentence><sentence id="661">There was just a greater feeling that things might go wrong and I don't think there was a radical change except a change in how you personally felt, you know how each person felt. </sentence><sentence id="662">They had seen just great savagery done to great fellow Jews and after that they were not certain of their position, a great uncertainty and a great fear. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="687">A: Yes. </sentence><sentence id="688">In fact, when I was writing the memoirs I realized how close the deportation of the Polish Jews is in time to the crystal night. </sentence><sentence id="689">To me in my mind in my memory it seems like half a year or a year whereas it's a little less than a month actually between them. </sentence><sentence id="690">But, that's not the way I remember it. </sentence><sentence id="691">As a child I remember it just being a long span of time between the deportation of the Polish Jews and crystal night. </sentence><sentence id="692">That was the next big chapter and after that there was no doubt as to what you had to do. </sentence><sentence id="693">You had to escape. </sentence><sentence id="694">I mean there wasn't any -- after the Polish Jews I still as a child thought well it's them but not me, they wouldn't do that to German Jews. </sentence><sentence id="695">That was my as a child that's how I felt. </sentence><sentence id="696">But obviously after crystal night it became obvious that all Jews were the victims. </sentence><sentence id="697">We were at stake. </sentence><sentence id="698">So, that was -- well apparently my sister remembers and I'm quoting partly from my sister's memories now and not only my own. </sentence><sentence id="699">My sister remembers that the evening before in the evening the my father got a phone call and he tells the same thing and it was an anonymous caller who somehow warned him that during the night there would be parades. </sentence><sentence id="700">There would be a procession and there would be marches and that somehow they were going to be against the Jews and that the building, the synagogue might be in danger. </sentence><sentence id="701">That's all that they said. </sentence></p></dialogue>

and things that would upset us greatly or make us very fearful were really talked about as little as possible. </sentence><sentence id="724">So, I did not know. </sentence><sentence id="725">Apparently my father got this phone call during our meal time and came back very agitated and the meal continued and then my mother told us that a good friend of hers who was also a -- who took a very special interest in me or a nurse by the name of , was going to spend the night with us. </sentence><sentence id="726">We went to bed as usual and  http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection 6 an SS person and he was just smashing everything in sight. </sentence><sentence id="727">We had glass doors and glass windows and a lot of figurines and he was just smashing things and kicking things and our orders though they kept pushing no no you've got to go, you've got to get out of here. </sentence><sentence id="728">So, we ran down -- as we were going down to the bottom floor, we saw the flames from the synagogue coming over to our staircase and they were already on the staircase as we were going down. </sentence><sentence id="729">And down on the first floor also was the sexton's father, the old gentleman who always lived with them and he was in his long white nightgown just standing there petrified. </sentence><sentence id="730">They did the same thing with him that they did with me, they were just pushing him out the door. </sentence><sentence id="731">Then one of the most frightening things was as we came outside, they were paving the streets with these cobblestones and they were throwing these stones through the windows and the sexton and family apparently when they first heard the gestapo coming and were told that they had to leave had ordered some taxis for us and the taxis were across the street. </sentence><sentence id="732">Somehow we had to get across that street where they were throwing the cobblestones and not get hit by them. </sentence><sentence id="733">I was just frightened to death and there was no way that I could see or that we could see doing that and they kept throwing and suddenly somebody said they're just children, let them go. </sentence><sentence id="734">And they did stop and we crossed the street and they resumed right away to throw the things so we were able to cross the street which when we were standing there with all those stones coming right where we had to walk across seemed like an impossible thing. </sentence><sentence id="735">Then I was still unwilling to really let go because I really thought that my parents were in that building still but when we got to the taxi there they were. </sentence><sentence id="736">They had come out by another exit and so we all went to the Jewish nurse's home where there were three Jewish nurses living together, and the sexton's family and us we went there and we were absolutely -- as I say, I still think I had not taken in, even though I lived through it, I didn't really live through it until about a day afterwards until it sank in what had really happened. </sentence><sentence id="737">I was sort of pushed this way and pushed that way and I remember -- the only thing I really remember, there were two things I remember as being terribly frightening. </sentence><sentence id="738">The one thing was that I thought that my parents were still in the house, and the second thing was the cobblestones and how to get to the other side of the street and not get hit and those are the two things that vividly stand out but the rest of it I think I was just like a sort of robot, was doing what I was told to do but not really taking in too much of what was going on. </sentence><sentence id="739">Then the taxis took us to the nurse's home. </sentence><sentence id="740">Then in the course of the day we heard that the synagogue was just the first Jewish house to be destroyed but they were going to every Jewish home in Esson and taking the males and taking them off to concentration camps. </sentence><sentence id="741">Often destroying the whole house, often injuring the people and so when these reports came in my father realized that what he should do -- since they didn't know where he was because he had escaped, we had left the building before the order to arrest all Jewish men had come through, so they didn't know where he was and he took off and for the next two weeks he was gone. </sentence><sentence id="742">He was actually in different consulates in different cities and would call in from time to time that he was okay but he was still not arrested. </sentence><sentence id="743">So, he was gone and we were sitting there and as more and more reports came in we felt that -- and I especially got very frightened then and thought okay, they did our house but they haven't been to the nurse's home yet. </sentence><sentence id="744">They haven't been here, so when are they going to come, and what are they going to do this time when they come because one of the stories This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="745">It is not the primary

that still sticks out in my mind is that one somebody in Esson whose home they had visited and the husband when he came out and said what are you doing here or something like that they took a pencil and stuck it through his eyeball and that memory still is in my mind something vivid like that. </sentence><sentence id="747">We heard other stories and so it was very, very difficult for me when night time came to go to bed and I had nightmares and it was really got to the point that I was thinking in the evenings okay let them come, let's get it over with. </sentence><sentence id="748">It's done. </sentence><sentence id="749">They'll only visit this place once and when it's done, it's done and it was very hard for anybody to reassure me that we would not be visited. </sentence><sentence id="750">My mother and the sexton's family and I guess a lot of other Jewish families tried to call the police from time to time, very naive but you try anything you can and the police were considered the good guys as compared to the SS and to see what houses were on the list for that night. </sentence><sentence id="751">Of course they could get no answers and could get no protection but they tried. </sentence><sentence id="752">I remember every evening them dialing the police and trying to find out. </sentence><sentence id="753">This went on for about a week or more and as I say I was just petrified -- it seemed having that in front of you seemed much worse to me, much more fearful than having gone through it when I was sort of in neutral and really didn't take it in, what was happening. </sentence><sentence id="754">But once I realized what had happened and then having to face that again some of the things that I had heard just seemed unbearable. </sentence><sentence id="755">So, all of us were living there together. </sentence><sentence id="756">There were ten of us by then living together in a place meant for three so we were all doubling up in beds, doubling up

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="934">Q: Did you have hope? </sentence><sentence id="935">Were you focused on getting out of the country at that time? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="938">A: Yes, completely. </sentence><sentence id="939">Well, I think everybody realized at that time that the only hope was to get out. </sentence><sentence id="940">We weren't going to make it. </sentence><sentence id="941">There was no way you could survive. </sentence><sentence id="942">I don't think there was any doubt then in anybody's mind, even the ones who had denied many things before, didn't read the tea leaves very well, were sure that that was the time that you had to get out. </sentence><sentence id="943">There was no other way. </sentence><sentence id="944">And so I remember having to go -- there were two ways you could get out, by quota or like my family did, if you had a special visa because you had a special profession and had a job waiting for me. </sentence><sentence id="945">We had both. </sentence><sentence id="946">We had a quota which was coming up fairly soon and then we were able to get the other thing also, but the quota would have been earlier. </sentence><sentence id="947">I remember having to go to Studtgard to the American consult as a family to see if the quota, the number would work. </sentence><sentence id="948">I remember the responsibility I felt of myself that somehow I was supposed to behave, give the right answers, do the right thing and that was up to me to carry this thing off and I remember when it didn't work, the number didn't work. </sentence><sentence id="949">We came the other way, that when the quota thing ended they said no this is not going to work, I thought that this personally was somehow my fault, that i had probably done something wrong. </sentence><sentence id="950">Not made a good impression or not smiled the right way or whatever it was that this didn't work. </sentence><sentence id="951">So there was a -- I think everybody felt a great deal of responsibility for trying to get out and also we felt very much that we shouldn't bother our parents with anything, or any adult for that matter because they were all -- first of all they didn't have time for it, really they didn't at that point and they were so preoccupied with just the basic necessities of making things go from day to day and trying to make plans for getting out. </sentence></p></dialogue>

obviously. </sentence><sentence id="1073">When we landed here this relative of ours, the one that rescued us actually, was there to meet us. </sentence><sentence id="1074">My parents had actually been studying English for a year, year and a half, found out they really couldn't understand a word. </sentence><sentence id="1075">They didn't speak very much and this relative of ours was a very well to do lady. </sentence><sentence id="1076">She had a black maid and was very fancy and she took us to her apartment and we had lunch there and it was really very uncomfortable I think for everybody even though we were very, very grateful to her but the communication and the lifestyle and I guess we didn't know what was expected, what was good manners, what was the right thing to do and what was the wrong thing to do and all those things. </sentence><sentence id="1077">Then there was another very wealthy person who lived in Esson who had left before us and they had a big house in Scarsdale and they said that after we arrived we could stay with them for a while until we decided what we were going to do. </sentence><sentence id="1078">So, we moved out to their house. </sentence><sentence

way my family talked about them I always felt it was like the king or something like that, some exalted person and we were going to live in their house. </sentence><sentence id="1082">I was also concerned was I doing the right thing, was I doing the wrong thing and so I had a meal there and I remember them saying well, we suggested that we help with washing up and so my sister and I went into

do, they use soap on the dishes. </sentence><sentence id="1084">We hadn't done that at home. </sentence><sentence id="1085">I don't think it was a very comfortable time for my parents either even

been attempted many times and they have failed. </sentence><sentence id="1089">But he was going to do it. </sentence><sentence id="1090">Of course he had the synagogue of this rabbi who he was

this was a terrible hardship and I really admire them for that because it was such a change, especially for my mother. </sentence><sentence id="1102">She never complained about it though, just took it that that's the way things are. </sentence><sentence id="1103">I remember there was no money. </sentence><sentence id="1104">I remember that since they were borrowed things we were supposed to be very careful about them, but there was no desk either so I was doing -- we were in school by that time, and I was doing homework and somehow I was writing in ink and I put an ink spot on the cover of this down cover and we tried to get it out and we couldn't get it out. </sentence><sentence id="1105">My mother was just beside herself and I felt terrible and when our own stuff came then we finally
