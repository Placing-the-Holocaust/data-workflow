<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="19">Q: Could you tell me something about your parents? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="21">A: Well, my parents -- of course, to me they were the best parents in the world. </sentence><sentence id="22">My mother was a housewife. </sentence><sentence id="23">My father made a living for her. </sentence><sentence id="24">And we were a happy family with two other children. </sentence><sentence id="25">There was three of us, a brother, we were two sisters. </sentence><sentence id="26">And we had a beautiful family. </sentence><sentence id="27">We had a large family, uncles and aunts, grandparents, niece and nephews, nieces, cousins. </sentence><sentence id="28">Unfortunately, all of them were killed by the Germans, by the Nazis actually. </sentence><sentence id="29">And there's very little, very few of us left at the present time. </sentence><sentence id="30">And what is there to talk about? </sentence><sentence id="31">We had a wonderful home. </sentence><sentence id="32">We had a beautiful home. </sentence><sentence id="33">We had a beautiful life until World War II came around and this is when our problems started and our life was destroyed. </sentence><sentence id="34">But we survived, minus my father, my aunts, my uncles, my cousins, my grandparents. </sentence><sentence id="35">It's just the four of us who survived. </sentence><sentence id="36">And where do we start talking about our lives? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="53">Q: Tell me what happened when the Nazis came in? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="55">A: When they came in we tried to escape. </sentence><sentence id="56">We thought perhaps we would go to White Russia which supposedly, you could be safe there, but it was too late. </sentence><sentence id="57">After two days of traveling, we had to turn back and we came back to our town. </sentence><sentence id="58">At that time the Nazis had already fencing in about 20 blocks or so -- and all the Jewish people had to move out of their homes and go to live in that area. </sentence><sentence id="59">And had some distant cousins living there, so we moved in with them and we lived with them. </sentence><sentence id="60">My father since he spoke many languages, he was taken by the  Nazis as an interpreter. </sentence><sentence id="61">And so he would work during the day and come home at night to the ghetto. </sentence><sentence id="62">The rest of us -- I would --I stayed home. </sentence><sentence id="63">My mother and my sister were taken to work to labor camps every day and brought back in the evening. </sentence><sentence id="64">While living there, of course, life was very harsh, very hard. </sentence><sentence id="65">We could not go out of the ghetto. </sentence><sentence id="66">You were supposed to stay inside. </sentence><sentence id="67">The minute we moved into the ghetto we had -- they put up the yellow stars on each one of us. </sentence><sentence id="68">We always had to walk around in the streets with a yellow star, one in the back and one up front. </sentence><sentence id="69">Frightening it was, but that was part of our lives and we existed like this for a few months until one morning very early we heard knocking on the doors and the windows and yelling, you know, "Get out! </sentence><sentence id="70">Get out! </sentence><sentence id="71">Get out!" </sentence><sentence id="72">So quickly we got dressed and we walked out of the house that we were staying in. </sentence><sentence id="73">The Gestapo was there and they told us all to go in a certain direction. </sentence><sentence id="74">My mother put on me my beautiful rabbit coat that I had, a rabbit coat and a hat. </sentence><sentence id="75">And we started following the other people, and they took us to a large building. </sentence><sentence id="76">It must have been a factory and they told us to get undressed. </sentence><sentence id="77">And they would make you take off the jewelry and everything, any valuables that you had on you. </sentence><sentence id="78">They undressed -- they told us to get undressed. </sentence><sentence id="79">We all did. </sentence><sentence id="80">The women remained with the underwear only, and the men in their shorts. </sentence><sentence id="81">And my mother wasn't fast enough to take off her gold earrings, so she was hit by a Gestapo with the handle of a rifle and she fell down. </sentence><sentence id="82">We picked her up. </sentence><sentence id="83">And all of us -- there were a few hundred of us -- we were all already undressed, and we had to form lines outside. </sentence><sentence id="84">It was a cloudy day, very cloudy, and a very fine drizzle was going down. </sentence><sentence id="85">And all the women were so embarrassed that they were without anything on top that they all covered their breasts with their hands. </sentence><sentence id="86">And they made groups and we started walking the street following the other people. </sentence><sentence id="87">As we were passing some of those streets and there were some Ukrainians who were cheering as we were walking by. </sentence><sentence id="88">They were applauding and cheering. </sentence><sentence id="89">But this, this what was done to us. </sentence><sentence id="90">We kept on walking silently without saying anything until we were out of the city. </sentence><sentence id="91">And on the roads going towards where they were taking us, there were rows on both sides of Gestapo and German Shepherds. </sentence><sentence id="92">And we kept walking and the drizzle was coming down and I was so scared. </sentence><sentence id="93">I was so afraid that I developed diarrhea. </sentence><sentence id="94">But you are not allowed to talk so I didn't tell my mother anything. </sentence><sentence id="95">We just kept on walking and walking. </sentence><sentence id="96">And then my mother said, "Children, you have to pray to God." </sentence><sentence id="97">And we did. </sentence><sentence id="98">And as we were walking a black cat crossed the street and somehow somebody said, "Okay, now you know where we are going. </sentence><sentence id="99">We are going to be killed." </sentence><sentence id="100">But my mother said to us, "Don't think that way. </sentence><sentence id="101">Don't think that way." </sentence><sentence id="102">And we kept on walking. </sentence><sentence id="103">When we got to the field and that was an abandoned slaughter house, there were mountains of clothing from the people before that were killed and their clothing was taken off there. </sentence><sentence id="104">They told us to stand in line to wait to be killed and at that time the sun came out and the day was beautiful. </sentence><sentence id="105">The sun was shining. </sentence><sentence id="106">The skies were blue. </sentence><sentence id="107">And so many people standing naked in that line waiting to be killed. </sentence><sentence id="108">And my mother was looking around and she saw this tall Gestapo man. </sentence><sentence id="109">Very, very tall. </sentence><sentence id="110">And she took a chance by walking out of the line and walking towards him and asked him, "Do they kill non-Jews here." </sentence><sentence id="111">And he looks at her and he says, "You're not Jewish?" </sentence><sentence id="112">And she says, "No, I'm not." </sentence><sentence id="113">And he said, "Well, what are you  doing here?" </sentence><sentence id="114">She said, "Well, my husband was taken to prison. </sentence><sentence id="115">He is someplace in one of these cities," she said, "and I decided with my children to come and find him to visit him." </sentence><sentence id="116">So we were walking on this road and as they were bringing down the Jews, they took us along and nobody would listen to us." </sentence><sentence id="117">With that, with one of his hands, he took my mother's hand, my hand, and my sister's hand and he took us out of the line and he said, "Come with me." </sentence><sentence id="118">He took us into that abandoned little slaughter house and he told us to sit and wait. </sentence><sentence id="119">In the meantime he told my sister that she should bring some clothing. </sentence><sentence id="120">So he took her to one of those mountains, and she just picked up whatever clothing she was able to get for my mother, for myself and herself. </sentence><sentence id="121">And she brought it in and we started putting on the clothing. </sentence><sentence id="122">There was some other people in that place, and one of them was a lady with a baby in her arms, and she recognized us. </sentence><sentence id="123">And when the Gestapo came in with a Ukrainian, because the Ukrainians were collaborators, and they spoke Ukrainian and Russian and Polish. </sentence><sentence id="124">They spoke -- and they spoke German. </sentence><sentence id="125">So in order for the Gestapo to understand, you know, what we were saying because we're talking to him in Ukrainian. </sentence><sentence id="126">My mother was talking Ukrainian to him. </sentence><sentence id="127">So this lady turns around and says to him, "They are Jews. </sentence><sentence id="128">Why aren't they killed." </sentence><sentence id="129">And so he hit her, and we just sat there frightened. </sentence><sentence id="130">We didn't know what to say. </sentence><sentence id="131">We couldn't say anything. </sentence><sentence id="132">And he took us out. </sentence><sentence id="133">We were already dressed. </sentence><sentence id="134">And he said to us -- he said to the Ukrainian, "You take them to town. </sentence><sentence id="135">You will escort them to town." </sentence><sentence id="136">Because you could not possibly walk on the road back when this was -- when they were walking all the Jews to be killed. </sentence><sentence id="137">So the Ukrainian told us to follow him and we did. </sentence><sentence id="138">As we were walking back, on the side of the street, of the road my mother saw many of our neighbors who were walking towards the slaughter house to be killed. </sentence><sentence id="139">And all she did was sigh because it was very painful to see them go. </sentence><sentence id="140">So the Ukrainian didn't say anything and when we got to the city to town and my mother said to him, "Thank you for bringing us back to town," he said to us, "No. </sentence><sentence id="141">We're not letting you go because you are Jewish. </sentence><sentence id="142">You are Jews." </sentence><sentence id="143">And my mother says, "No. </sentence><sentence id="144">I'm not." </sentence><sentence id="145">He says, "Yes, you are. </sentence><sentence id="146">I saw you, how you sighed when you saw them, the Jews walking that road. </sentence><sentence id="147">And we have to interr...."* My mother started, of course, lying and saying, "no" and tells him the same story that she told the, the Gestapo. </sentence><sentence id="148">And he says, "No, we have to take you in for interrogation and, and then we'll see what happens and then we'll let you go." </sentence><sentence id="149">So my mother said, "Perhaps I can, you know, give you something. </sentence><sentence id="150">I have some..." you know, some things she had saved whatever. " </sentence><sentence id="151">I'll pay you. </sentence><sentence id="152">Just let us go." </sentence><sentence id="153">And he said, "No." </sentence><sentence id="154">He took us to a little jail which was in the city. </sentence><sentence id="155">And we were put in a room maybe was 10 by 10 with other criminals and other robbers and thieves and everything like that. </sentence><sentence id="156">They put us in there. </sentence><sentence id="157">And every day, they would take us a few blocks from that area to a Gestapo office for interrogation. </sentence><sentence id="158">And so they were, you know, asking my mother questions and my sister and, of course, we kept telling them the same story. </sentence><sentence id="159">Nothing -- me they didn't touch. </sentence><sentence id="160">It was just my mother and my sister interrogating to  see if they lied or if they were telling the truth. </sentence><sentence id="161">And they just couldn't find anything out and this was already like three, four days. </sentence><sentence id="162">One day they decided that the only way they will be sure to find out if we are Jews are not is if they interrogate me. </sentence><sentence id="163">And I was about five and a half at that time. </sentence><sentence id="164">So they came to jail and I remember this Gestapo put me on his lap and said to me -- asking me my name which, of course, we changed our names. </sentence><sentence id="165">We changed our identity. </sentence><sentence id="166">We changed everything. </sentence><sentence id="167">And he started telling me what a beautiful little Jewish girl Iam. </sentence><sentence id="168">And I sort of jumped at him. </sentence><sentence id="169">I says, "How can you compare me to a Jewish little girl. </sentence><sentence id="170">I am Christian and I am -- we have nothing to do -- I have nothing to do with Jewish girls. </sentence><sentence id="171">I don't even want to look like them." </sentence><sentence id="172">Well, he kept interrogating me for about an hour and he kept on every second, you know, second word or third word "Jewish little girl, Jewish little girl," and I kept saying you know, "That's not me and we're not and we're just Christians and that's all." </sentence><sentence id="173">Well, after that they realized that you know, they're wrong. </sentence><sentence id="174">That for sure we are from where we told them we were and we were going where we were going, the whole, the whole bit. </sentence><sentence id="175">But then they decided after checking out the town that my mother gave them, there was no one under such a name and the address. </sentence><sentence id="176">There was no such address and so on and so forth -- there was no such people. </sentence><sentence id="177">They realized that there was something not right. </sentence><sentence id="178">So they decided to have us interrogated again. </sentence><sentence id="179">So the next day, we were, all of us, walking on the street going towards the Gestapo office. </sentence><sentence id="180">And of course, there was always a Ukrainian who would be our guard because my mother spoke Ukrainian and one of my sister's friends from school saw her and she said to her, "You are still alive?" </sentence><sentence id="181">With that, the Ukrainian realized that we have to be Jews. </sentence><sentence id="182">And so after he took us -- he didn't say anything, but after he took us for the next interrogation they decided that we have to be killed. </sentence><sentence id="183">We have to be executed. </sentence><sentence id="184">So they brought us back to our room in jail. </sentence><sentence id="185">And the way the jail was situated was one room and then the next room were our guards. </sentence><sentence id="186">So if you want -- had to go to the restroom, you would have to walk into their room, ask for permission and then, you know, either they would go with you because the restroom was outside the building or they would, you know, or they would keep one of us like if I wanted to go to the restroom my mother would go with me, but my sister would remain in the jail. </sentence><sentence id="187">Or vice versa whichever way. </sentence><sentence id="188">There was always one of us had to stay in that room because they were always, I guess, afraid that we'll escape. </sentence><sentence id="189">Well, after hearing between the other inmates that we are going to be killed my mother quickly thought of escaping. </sentence><sentence id="190">And so that evening that we decided to escape we watched the guard that was sitting in the room next to ours. </sentence><sentence id="191">He fell asleep so we couldn't out walk all of us together because we didn't want our inmates to be suspicious of us. </sentence><sentence id="192">So my mother and I started walking out thinking that if he wakes up and asks us where we're going, we going to the restroom and my sister remains in the room. </sentence><sentence id="193">But he did not wake up, and we just walked out and as we were going down the stairs and you're supposed to turn in to go to the backyard to the bathroom the front door was open. </sentence><sentence id="194">And so my mother said, "We go." </sentence><sentence id="195">Now there was somebody standing in front of that door, but as we came closer to leaving it the man just walked away and we ran away. </sentence><sentence id="196">Now, my mother did tell my sister where we're going to be so when she escapes the same way as we did then we will meet in the area where  some of our people -- not our people, our neighbors lived and we decided that's where we're going to meet. </sentence><sentence id="197">And it so happened that as my sister started walking out after we had left --- my mother and I had left. </sentence><sentence id="198">She started walking and he woke up and he said to her, "Where are you going?" </sentence><sentence id="199">And she says, "I'm going to the bathroom." </sentence><sentence id="200">And he says, "Aw, go ahead, your mother's there with your sister." </sentence><sentence id="201">Except he didn't know that we're gone already. </sentence><sentence id="202">And so my sister escaped too. </sentence><sentence id="203">We did meet in the place by the neighbors. </sentence><sentence id="204">And they were hiding us until we decided that the best way to hide will be in our back yard where we had a barn. </sentence><sentence id="205">And so we told one of our neighbors that we'll be in the attic of the barn and so she would once a day bring us something to eat. </sentence><sentence id="206">And the barn was like two stories high. </sentence><sentence id="207">And we didn't know, of course, where my father was because he was going to work as an interpreter. </sentence><sentence id="208">We hadn't heard from him and he didn't know where we were. </sentence><sentence id="209">So here we were in our barn and this neighbor was nice enough to bring us food once a day. </sentence><sentence id="210">But obviously somebody noticed that she was carrying food to the barn, and so one day after about three or four days that we were up there sleeping in the -- you know, in the barn on the what we call it -- the wood and everything -- we just stayed there. </sentence><sentence id="211">Somebody called the SS and they started following the lady. </sentence><sentence id="212">And she realized that, so she started screaming, "Save yourselves. </sentence><sentence id="213">Save yourselves." </sentence><sentence id="214">She never made it to the barn but she was just screaming loud enough for us to hear. </sentence><sentence id="215">So my mother and my sister quickly ran to the other end of the barn of the attic and with their bare hands they broke two panels of heavy wood and we jumped, we jumped. </sentence><sentence id="216">From the two floors we jumped down and we started running away. </sentence><sentence id="217">So by the time the Germans broke into the barn, we were already gone. </sentence><sentence id="218">Now we really hadn't no place where to go so we went back to the ghetto and in the ghetto, there was, of course, the other Jewish people and my father was there. </sentence><sentence id="219">So we were reunited and we were there again about -- let's see, that was in "41. </sentence><sentence id="220">We were together until the second pogrom. </sentence><sentence id="221">Now when they started talking about killing us again, my mother and, of course, with my father, they decided that we have to try and escape from the ghetto. </sentence><sentence id="222">Now the ghetto was always surrounded. </sentence><sentence id="223">It was actually with wires, barbed wires. </sentence><sentence id="224">It was barbed wired and you had guards by the entrances. </sentence><sentence id="225">So my mother and my father decided that we have to escape. </sentence><sentence id="226">We cannot stay for the second pogrom which was a few months later. </sentence><sentence id="227">So we could not escape together. </sentence><sentence id="228">We had to separate. </sentence><sentence id="229">So my mother took me. </sentence><sentence id="230">We were first to escape at night. </sentence><sentence id="231">We just climbed out between the barbed wire and we went to one of our neighbors -- not neighbors, to some friends that we had, Gentiles, which were very nice. </sentence><sentence id="232">Thanks to them, I guess, we're still alive. </sentence><sentence id="233">And then next -- like an hour later, my sister and then we were reunited, my sister and my mother and myself. </sentence><sentence id="234">We waited for my father and he never showed. </sentence><sentence id="235">We didn't know what happened to him, and we couldn't go back to the ghetto either because the following day there was another pogrom. </sentence><sentence id="236">So after that we were always hopeful that we will find our father. </sentence><sentence id="237">In the meantime, we had to escape. </sentence><sentence id="238"> We had to run away from the city because the second pogrom was already meant to clean out the city -- to clean the city out of Jews. </sentence><sentence id="239">So my mother knew someone. </sentence><sentence id="240">Of course, my mother -- my father also knew this gentlemen who was a motorman on one of the trains. </sentence><sentence id="241">And she paid him off, he should smuggle her and my sister out of the city. </sentence><sentence id="242">Now, like I said before, we didn't know where my father was. </sentence><sentence id="243">Now she could not take me along because "A" I was too little and it was very, very cold. </sentence><sentence id="244">It was in the wintertime. </sentence><sentence id="245">And it was very cold and the clothes that we had really wasn't warm enough. </sentence><sentence id="246">So she made arrangements with a Gentile lady that she should hold, you know, keep me in her house until the spring. </sentence><sentence id="247">And then in the springtime this gentlemen who smuggled my sister and my mother out of -- to Romania that he will come and he will take me, too, and bring me to my mother. </sentence><sentence id="248">The lady agreed, and my mother gave her whatever we had, you know, just to make sure that I'm safe. </sentence><sentence id="249">She lived -- she had two of her grandchildren living with her. </sentence><sentence id="250">They did not know that I was Jewish. </sentence><sentence id="251">And I don't look Jewish either. </sentence><sentence id="252">And so she kept me in back of her house. </sentence><sentence id="253">She had like a little room, a pantry and that -- this is where I used to stay and I used to sleep. </sentence><sentence id="254">In fact that pantry was so infested with, with mice that at night, I used to cover myself with a, with a blanket that she gave me and feel those mice crawling all over me. </sentence><sentence id="255">My mother had left before. </sentence><sentence id="256">But before she left she told me that she has to go away with my sister and she gave me a hundred rubles and she told me that in the springtime this gentlemen whom I knew will come and he'll bring me back to my mother. </sentence><sentence id="257">That it's only going to be a little while and I'm safer staying with this lady and her grandchildren here. </sentence><sentence id="258">My mother left, but before she did I cried. </sentence><sentence id="259">And I said, "I have a headache. </sentence><sentence id="260">Don't leave me." </sentence><sentence id="261">But she said she has to go. </sentence><sentence id="262">I guess I understood. </sentence><sentence id="263">And so she gave me the hundred rubles and I remained in the lady's house. </sentence><sentence id="264">With her grandchildren, I used to play. </sentence><sentence id="265">After two weeks the lady became a little panicky and she was really afraid to keep a Jewish child in the house because the Germans notify everyone that if a Jew is found in their house that their house will be burned and the family will be killed. </sentence><sentence id="266">You know, the whole thing. </sentence><sentence id="267">So she was really afraid. </sentence><sentence id="268">And so she told me I had to leave her house two weeks later. </sentence><sentence id="269">Well, at that time I was infested already with lice because nobody gave me a bath and I slept in the same clothes and I lived in the same clothes and I lived in that pantry with the mice. </sentence><sentence id="270">And so I walked out of the house. </sentence><sentence id="271">And the first thing I did was go into a -- to a store --a religious article store and I bought a big cross and I spend my hundred rubles. </sentence><sentence id="272">And then I was so infested with the lice that my head, my skin was all rashes and bloody from scratching it so much. </sentence><sentence id="273">And so I felt that I really needed help and I remembered this lady whom my parents were friendly with and I remembered that we used to visit them every so often. </sentence><sentence id="274">That it's quite a bit outside the city. </sentence><sentence id="275">I  didn't remember the address and I didn't remember the name. </sentence><sentence id="276">But I just remember how we used to walk. </sentence><sentence id="277">And I -- that's how I walked. </sentence><sentence id="278">And I made it to the house. </sentence><sentence id="279">And it was winter and cold and the snow was snow maybe five, six inches of snow. </sentence><sentence id="280">And I made it to her house and as I got to her gate her dog started barking so she came out to see who was at the gate and she sees me and she says, "My God, Come in quick. </sentence><sentence id="281">Come in quick." </sentence><sentence id="282">And she takes me to her barn because obviously she must have noticed that I have lice crawling all over me. </sentence><sentence id="283">So she wouldn't take me into her house but she took me into the barn and she -- quickly she took off my clothes and put on other clothes and she said to me, "Where are your parents?" </sentence><sentence id="284">I said, "Everybody is killed. </sentence><sentence id="285">Everybody is dead." </sentence><sentence id="286">Because I wanted her to have pity on me. </sentence><sentence id="287">And so she did. </sentence><sentence id="288">She took me to her bathroom. </sentence><sentence id="289">She shaved off my head. </sentence><sentence id="290">She gave me a bath. </sentence><sentence id="291">She gave me a glass of hot milk and a piece of black bread. </sentence><sentence id="292">And I ate it so fast that I got so sick that she thought I was dying. </sentence><sentence id="293">And she couldn't call a doctor and she had to pull all her shades down. </sentence><sentence id="294">Nobody should see that she has any strangers in her house. </sentence><sentence id="295">And she had a son who was at school and she didn't want the son to know either because the son did know me and he knew that I was Jewish. </sentence><sentence id="296">So she gave me a bath and, and she put on one her -- of her white gowns on me and it really felt good because I felt clean. </sentence><sentence id="297">And she put some Vaseline on my head and she kept me in her bedroom for a week, a whole week. </sentence><sentence id="298">Now her son didn't know that until one day about three, four days later he said, "Why is your bedroom door locked and the shades are down?" </sentence><sentence id="299">And so she felt that she had to tell him, otherwise he might, you know, he might talk about it on the outside and then they'll send the SS and this is what's going to happen to them. </sentence><sentence id="300">So one evening she sort of surprised him. </sentence><sentence id="301">She said to me, "Come in, I want you to see my son and I want him to see you." </sentence><sentence id="302">And when I walked in, he almost died because I was wearing her white gown and my head was shaven. </sentence><sentence id="303">And he just became so wild, but she said to him, "Don't you ever tell anyone that you've seen Frima." </sentence><sentence id="304">And he said, "I promise, I never will." </sentence><sentence id="305">And so I stayed with her for another week. </sentence><sentence id="306">In the meantime, like I told you when she gave me that milk and the bread and I got so sick, she didn't know what to do. </sentence><sentence id="307">So her husband and the lady whom I'm very grateful to, she was giving me enemas because | was already blue in my face. </sentence><sentence id="308">I couldn't talk and I was stopping -- I was slowing down with my breathing. </sentence><sentence id="309">That's how sick I got. </sentence><sentence id="310">Well, after the war she told my mother that as she was trying to save my life she said, "At the same time I was thinking where am I going to bury your child. </sentence><sentence id="311">I mean nobody supposed to know that there's a Jewish kad in my house." </sentence><sentence id="312">But anyway, I guess, God was very good to her and was good to me. </sentence><sentence id="313">After a few enemas, I'm finally -- I woke up and I was stronger and I was able to talk. </sentence><sentence id="314">And after staying a week with her, she said, you know, she can't keep me any longer because she was also afraid that people might become suspicious -- her neighbors. </sentence><sentence id="315">And so here I am without a place to stay, without a home to go to. </sentence><sentence id="316">And I knew I couldn't go back to that lady who told me to leave the first place. </sentence><sentence id="317">So I decided that since she had under her house, she had a little -- like a little opening with a door, where her dog used to sleep that that's where I'm going to sleep too together with her dog, without her knowing it. </sentence><sentence id="318">And so what I used to do is walk around during the day. </sentence><sentence id="319">Just walk during the day and go to some of the people that I knew and they would give me a piece of bread or give me a potato and I would continue walking and  0 walking and walking. </sentence><sentence id="320">And then at night when it was already dark in the lady's house and it was quiet, I would sneak in. </sentence><sentence id="321">And the dog knew me and he loved me and he didn't even bark. </sentence><sentence id="322">So he used to lie on my legs, keep me warm, and that's how I slept through the night until also very, very early in the morning, I used to get up and pray to God, of course, and put on my kerchief and start walk out from the -- from the -- under the house and just walk the streets again. </sentence><sentence id="323">And one day as I was walking through the same streets that I walked before I heard a couple of young boys saying, "Gee, she might be a Jew because I've seen her walking here once before." </sentence><sentence id="324">Well after I heard this, I never walked in that area again. </sentence><sentence id="325">I just continued walking to different places and different places. </sentence><sentence id="326">And one day I decided to go back in the area where we lived. </sentence><sentence id="327">And we had a cat. </sentence><sentence id="328">It was a Persian cat, beautiful gray, dark gray cat. </sentence><sentence id="329">And I wasn't even near the house, and the cat recognized me and he started following me. </sentence><sentence id="330">Now the Nazis didn't like cats. </sentence><sentence id="331">And as I was walking and the cat was walking after me meowing and meowing, I couldn't pick him up because they knew that most of the Jewish people had cats. </sentence><sentence id="332">And so I wouldn't pick up my cat. </sentence><sentence id="333">And I just kept walking and he followed me until I was passing the building from the kindergarten. </sentence><sentence id="334">And there were two guards sitting outside and they saw my cat following me and they killed him. </sentence><sentence id="335">They killed my beautiful cat. </sentence><sentence id="336">And I just kept walking as if I didn't know anything and as if I -- the cat did not belong to me. </sentence><sentence id="337">And so I continued walking for about six months. </sentence><sentence id="338">And that was my daily life, sleeping with the dog, walking during the day. </sentence><sentence id="339">And one day when I came back to sleep with the dog, I saw a light on in the lady's house and so I imagined they might be awake and therefore I should not go in, you know, go under the house. </sentence><sentence id="340">So next to her there was a bombarded house. </sentence><sentence id="341">There was only four walls. </sentence><sentence id="342">Nothing in it. </sentence><sentence id="343">Full of rubbles and wood and stones and everything. </sentence><sentence id="344">That's where I lay down, between the rubbles and I -- in order to keep warm because it was winter I would blow in my breathing the hot air into my jacket -- in that little jacket. </sentence><sentence id="345">I wore a little jacket, a little skirt, and I had somebody's stockings and that's how I stayed through the night there. </sentence><sentence id="346">And, of course, the next morning I did the same thing. </sentence><sentence id="347">I walked out. </sentence><sentence id="348">And I walked again. </sentence><sentence id="349">Then the way that my mother told me that sometimes in the springtime that this gentlemen will come and pick me up and bring me to her, so I knew that when he'll come and ask the lady for me, she'll tell him she doesn't know where I am because she did not know where I am. </sentence><sentence id="350">She did not know that I was sleeping under her house with her dog. </sentence><sentence id="351">So when April came around, I would just circle the area in the neighborhood so when I see him I would, you know, get in touch with him and he'll be able to take me to my mother. </sentence><sentence id="352">And that's exactly what happened. </sentence><sentence id="353">He came once and she said she doesn't know where I was, but then somehow he decided to come again because my mother told him that this is where I'm going to be, that she is going to keep me until he will, you know, he will come to pick me up. </sentence><sentence id="354">And so one day as soon as I was in that area, I saw him and that's how we met. </sentence><sentence id="355">Now he made arrangements and late at night the following day he took me to a train station  1 and he hid me in one of those cars full of coils. </sentence><sentence id="356">And then in the middle of the night, he transferred me to a different train and he just told me to lie on one of the cars, which were transported. </sentence><sentence id="357">There were German jeeps transported to Romania. </sentence><sentence id="358">I met another girl. </sentence><sentence id="359">She was about 10 years my senior and he was smuggling her also. </sentence><sentence id="360">So the two of us were lying on this open car full of jeeps and without knowing that in one of the Jeeps there was a German sitting. </sentence><sentence id="361">He was the watchman. </sentence><sentence id="362">And, of course, the gentlemen didn't know either that, you know, the, the car that we were on that there was danger. </sentence><sentence id="363">And so we're traveling through the night towards Romania. </sentence><sentence id="364">Now Romania, although it was occupied by the Germans, they had some kind of agreement that the Jews will not be killed. </sentence><sentence id="365">They will live in the ghettos and work, but they will not be killed unless they're on the outside of the ghetto. </sentence><sentence id="366">Alright? </sentence><sentence id="367">So it was sort of a little safer for the Jewish people to, to be. </sentence><sentence id="368">We traveled through the night and then at dawn, I hear a door open. </sentence><sentence id="369">And the two of us are lying there. </sentence><sentence id="370">Now she had a Jewish accent. </sentence><sentence id="371">So although I was a little younger, I told her not to speak. </sentence><sentence id="372">She has to be quiet and they really wouldn't know anything. </sentence><sentence id="373">And we'll just make believe we're sleeping. </sentence><sentence id="374">And we hear, you know, the Germans with those boots, those high boots, just stamping. </sentence><sentence id="375">He was -- came over to us and we just made believe that we don't, we don't know anything. </sentence><sentence id="376">But we were sleeping. </sentence><sentence id="377">But, of course, he kicks me in my back and I made believe I just woke up and he kicks her and he starts yelling in German and I do not speak German. </sentence><sentence id="378">But since I spoke Yiddish I could understand a little bit, but, of course, I wasn't going to speak to him in Yiddish so I just kept saying to him in Russian that we, we lost my -- we lost our mother, and we're looking for my mother and whatever. </sentence><sentence id="379">Anyway, he was furious. </sentence><sentence id="380">He kept yelling in German, and I kept talking to him in Russian and crying, you know, "My mother. </sentence><sentence id="381">My mother. </sentence><sentence id="382">My mother." </sentence><sentence id="383">Well that was early in the morning and then about an hour later or so we were coming closer to the town to the city where we were supposed to get off. </sentence><sentence id="384">Well, he was so furious. </sentence><sentence id="385">The train stopped and he made us walk down from the train into the fields. </sentence><sentence id="386">So although I was begging and I was crying and both of us were crying, he wouldn't hear of it. </sentence><sentence id="387">He just told us to get off and he kicked us off, and there we are. </sentence><sentence id="388">And we're standing there and crying and crying and I kept on begging him and begging him and finally I changed his mind. </sentence><sentence id="389">He told us to come up again. </sentence><sentence id="390">And so it didn't take too long. </sentence><sentence id="391">After that we arrived at our destination, and my mother wasn't there. </sentence><sentence id="392">Nobody was there. </sentence><sentence id="393">But some people with whom my mother was were there, and this gentlemen who was smuggling us, he brought us to the house where he was supposed to meet my mother so she can pay him. </sentence><sentence id="394">Except the head of the ghetto threw my mother out and my sister because he knew that my mother had some gold pieces which she had saved to pay the gentlemen who smuggled me. </sentence><sentence id="395">And the head of the ghetto wanted that money, of course, for the Gestapo. </sentence><sentence id="396">So he threw them out of the ghetto. </sentence><sentence id="397">And so when I came there my mother wasn't there any longer. </sentence><sentence id="398">My sister wasn't there. </sentence><sentence id="399">And the people told me, you know, that my mother went to another ghetto which was a couple of hours from that area. </sentence><sentence id="400">So they took me to the head of the ghetto and he was Jewish and his wife -- they had no children and I was crying and asking him, "Where's my mother. </sentence><sentence id="401">I want to be with my mother. </sentence><sentence id="402">Take me to my mother." </sentence><sentence id="403">And he said -- and he was trying to convince me that my life will be so much better if I stayed with them and I won't be  2 missing anything and I'll have dolls and I'll have toys and I'll have everything. </sentence><sentence id="404">And I kept saying, "I want my mother. </sentence><sentence id="405">I want my mother. </sentence><sentence id="406">Please get me back to my mother." </sentence><sentence id="407">So finally he said, "Okay." </sentence><sentence id="408">And they -- there was what do you call it? </sentence><sentence id="409">Horse and buggy going every -- once a day to different little towns where, you know, some of the people lived there. </sentence><sentence id="410">So he got me on one of those little, little coaches with a horse. </sentence><sentence id="411">There were few men, and I was the only child with them. </sentence><sentence id="412">And as we were traveling through the fields, there were always, always like groups of --I don't know if you call them bandits or whatever. </sentence><sentence id="413">They were always used to look for Jewish people and beat them up and take everything away from them cause that's -- I guess, that's how they made a living. </sentence><sentence id="414">I don't really know. </sentence><sentence id="415">Well, they stopped our carriage and they started taking all the men off, because they knew we were Jewish. </sentence><sentence id="416">When I saw this, I jumped off the carriage and I kept running, running toward the fields. </sentence><sentence id="417">Now this was springtime. </sentence><sentence id="418">And at that time the harvest, they build those what do you call them? </sentence><sentence id="419">You know, they bunched up the harvest so there was a little -- like little tents and I hid in one of those, and I was sitting there and thinking, "Where do I go from here?" </sentence><sentence id="420">And I was praying and then hours -- a couple of hours later I heard horses coming in my direction. </sentence><sentence id="421">And I was sure that they were looking for me, and that they were going to get me. </sentence><sentence id="422">So I decided before I run to different haystacks -- exactly haystacks -- I should look out and see, you know, what is happening. </sentence><sentence id="423">Well, when I looked out I saw the carriage, the wagon with the horse, and the men on it. </sentence><sentence id="424">And so I ran towards the wagon, and they were, of course, very happy to see me and they kept saying how those bandits were looking for me because they noticed a little girl and I had escaped. </sentence><sentence id="425">So they were very angry because those men were beaten. </sentence><sentence id="426">Everything was taken away from them. </sentence><sentence id="427">And they were all injured, all beaten, but anyway they took me up and they hugged me and they kissed me. </sentence><sentence id="428">And we finally made it to a little town where my mother was -- were assembled a couple hundred of Jewish people there. </sentence><sentence id="429">And that was before Passover. </sentence><sentence id="430">And when the word passed around that a wagon came with some men and a little girl, my mother and my sister knew that it had to be me so, of course, they ran out to greet me. </sentence><sentence id="431">And that little town, they was -- it was so little that actually the Germans knew where the Jews lived so they didn't have to surround it or, you know, put up barbed wire or anything like that. </sentence><sentence id="432">We lived in one room with this Gentile man. </sentence><sentence id="433">We had one cot and all three of us slept on it. </sentence><sentence id="434">And there was -- then there was another mother and a daughter that slept on another cot. </sentence><sentence id="435">We worked in his fields to pay him for sort of rent so my mother and my sister worked on the field and I worked on the field. </sentence><sentence id="436">My job was digging out potatoes and carrying them to his warehouse, and for this I would get a loaf of bread a day. </sentence><sentence id="437">That was very good. </sentence><sentence id="438">We are very lucky. </sentence><sentence id="439">We remained living there for about a year, at least a year -- I'd say 40 -- deg42 -- for about a year. </sentence><sentence id="440">And we kept working and then the day before we were liberated, the Germans had dug another grave, a mass grave to kill all of us, like the Final Solution. </sentence><sentence id="441">And the day before their plan, the Russians were bombarding the city -- the little town and there was street  3 fighting going on and we were saved except for those Jewish people who either got killed because their homes were, you know, where they stayed. </sentence><sentence id="442">It wasn't their homes, but wherever they lived, either the house was bombarded or because of the street fighting or whatever. </sentence><sentence id="443">Well, we were lucky to survive. </sentence><sentence id="444">And we went back to look for our father. </sentence><sentence id="445">And all we, the news we had is that he was seen with two Gestapos walking the street, down the street and we never heard from him. </sentence><sentence id="446">And we didn't know that you know, all my aunts and uncles and grandparents and cousins, they're all killed. </sentence><sentence id="447">And we started to build up a new life. </sentence><sentence id="448">My mother was the widow who tried to put our lives together. </sentence><sentence id="449">And so she was selling and buying and selling and trying to make a go of it. </sentence><sentence id="450">The shoes that I was wearing -- we couldn't afford to buy anything, so I would go between the destroyed buildings and rubbles and pick up rope and with a crochet needle I would crochet slippers and then put a piece of cardboard. </sentence><sentence id="451">And these were the shoes I wore. </sentence><sentence id="452">And, God, that's how we lived until we decided that everyone else is dead, no one is left, that we have to start a new life, and just leave Europe. </sentence><sentence id="453">And so we joined other Jewish people who hoped that we can escape to Germany. </sentence><sentence id="454">That was the end of the war. </sentence><sentence id="455">We can go to Germany, and from Germany perhaps we can go to different countries. </sentence><sentence id="456">And so we did. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="859">Q: Okay. </sentence><sentence id="860">This is a good time for us to break. </sentence><sentence id="861">We're getting ready to change the tape now. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="867">Q: Okay, we're rolling. </sentence><sentence id="868">Why don't you tell me about leaving your father at the ghetto? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="871">A: When my mother and father decided that we should escape before the second pogrom, I did not want to leave. </sentence><sentence id="872">I wanted to stay with my father or whenever he'll escape I'll go with him. </sentence><sentence id="873">And so I was crying and I said, "Papa, I don't want to go without you." </sentence><sentence id="874">But he insisted. </sentence><sentence id="875">He said, "You must go. </sentence><sentence id="876">You go with Mama." </sentence><sentence id="877">He says, "I'll follow you. </sentence><sentence id="878">Don't worry. </sentence><sentence id="879">I'll follow you." " </sentence><sentence id="880">I swear," he said, "We'll meet again." </sentence><sentence id="881">And so I listened to what he had to say and I believed him. </sentence><sentence id="882">And so I, I went with my mother and we escaped. </sentence><sentence id="883">We made it out of the ghetto. </sentence><sentence id="884">And my father was, was left behind and we just don't know what happened to him except for the fact that people said they saw him walking down the street with the Gestapo. </sentence><sentence id="885">So, so we never heard from him and nobody ever saw him alive. </sentence><sentence id="886">That was the end of my father's life. </sentence><sentence id="887">And that was bad. </sentence><sentence id="888">Anyway, we have to get back to where we left off. </sentence><sentence id="889">I wanted -- when my mother came to pick me up when I arrived in the little town, they were all preparing -- baking Matzos for Passover at that time. </sentence><sentence id="890">And my sister went and, you know, took me from that wagon and walked me to the house where my mother was with the other people baking the Matzos, and my mother, of course, took me in her arms, put me on her lap, and started looking on me, checking me out, if I was okay. </sentence><sentence id="891">And suddenly she sees a big cross and she says to me, "My child, mayn kind." </sentence><sentence id="892">What is that?" </sentence><sentence id="893">And I says, "Mama, I wanted to live so I can tell you what I went through and I wanted to make sure that nobody is suspicious of me, so I had to buy the cross and make believe that I'm Christian. </sentence><sentence id="894">She took it off and she gave it to one of the priest in that town where we lived and that was the same cross that I used to take off at night when I went to sleep or when I prayed to God and then put it on in the morning. </sentence><sentence id="895">It was really big. </sentence><sentence id="896">It was a very big cross. </sentence><sentence id="897">And then walk around the streets so everyone can see that I have it so nobody would be suspicious of me or have any doubts that I'm anything else but a non-Jew. </sentence><sentence id="898">And this was my life for about six months until the day that I came to see my mother and my fa-- and my sister. </sentence><sentence id="899">And after the liberation -- after we were liberated, we went back and-- </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="929">Q: How did you get from Romania back to the Soviet Union. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="931">A: Again, we were going from town to town, from city to city, with wagons, with trains, with whatever was available and we just made it back. </sentence><sentence id="932">But we were very lucky that the day before the execution of all the few Jews that lived in that town, that we were liberated. </sentence><sentence id="933">And it was a terrible experience seeing the fighting in the streets and the wounded soldiers. </sentence><sentence id="934">We used to pull them into the houses and, you know, wash them and then change their socks and then and bandage their, their wounds. </sentence><sentence id="935">And these were the ones who, who, thanks to them, we  5 survived. </sentence><sentence id="936">And then when we got home, most of our home -- house was destroyed, so my mother worked very, very hard selling, dealing, making dollars, and with her own hands, she put together the home again. </sentence><sentence id="937">You know, like she painted it and she plastered it and she did everything. </sentence><sentence id="938">And then we decided that we have to leave, that we weren't safe any longer. </sentence><sentence id="939">So through different, you know, different papers and different channels, my mother got us out of Russia to Poland. </sentence><sentence id="940">And then from Poland we took a train. </sentence><sentence id="941">We took a train to Stuttgart. </sentence><sentence id="942">Yeah, Stuttgart. </sentence><sentence id="943">And we traveled for a few days. </sentence><sentence id="944">There were other -- yeah, some Jewish people. </sentence><sentence id="945">And we made it there. </sentence><sentence id="946">And then we were supposed to be smuggled from that area from Poland towards Germany in a truck. </sentence><sentence id="947">So, gosh, that truck was full of people. </sentence><sentence id="948">So many! </sentence><sentence id="949">Some was sitting. </sentence><sentence id="950">Some were lying on the floor. </sentence><sentence id="951">When we got to the border and the guards wanted to inspect the truck to see, you know, what was in the truck. </sentence><sentence id="952">Of course, certainly, they did not think of people, the driver -- he stopped and as the guards were coming to open up and see what was doing, he took off. </sentence><sentence id="953">And they started, of course, shooting, but he kept going zigzag, so he was not hit, and we, we made it to Germany. </sentence><sentence id="954">And then there, of course, they had already the displaced person camps and they gave us a place. </sentence><sentence id="955">We stood in Berlin for a little while, and then from Berlin they would send people to different cities. </sentence><sentence id="956">So we stayed for maybe a couple of weeks in Berlin cause during that period I got sick there also. </sentence><sentence id="957">That's a different story. </sentence><sentence id="958">And when I got better they sent us to Bavaria, which had the DP camps, displaced person camps. </sentence><sentence id="959">And there, there we lived, you know, in one room, but we were liberated and we just went on with our lives. </sentence><sentence id="960">There were schools set up, and I went to the school where I learned Hebrew. </sentence><sentence id="961">And the rest of the family, everyone was working and making a couple of dollars. </sentence><sentence id="962">And then, this is a long story short, but I said I'm making a long story short and then we went to -- from Germany. </sentence><sentence id="963">We stayed in Germany for about two and a half years. </sentence><sentence id="964">Then we went to France. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="999">Q: How did you get from Germany to France? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1001">A: We went by train. </sentence><sentence id="1002">We took a train in Munich, and we went to France, to Paris. </sentence><sentence id="1003">We stayed in Paris for about six months. </sentence><sentence id="1004">During that period I used to we weren't working, so during that period, I used to go collect food and clothing for the Moroccan Jews who were very poor and they lived in Paris in a very isolated area. </sentence><sentence id="1005">And every week I used to bring clothing and food. </sentence><sentence id="1006">And since I was young and I was able to get around Paris and whoever needed anything or a place, you know, to go someplace and didn't know, I would, you know, I would sort of take them around. </sentence><sentence id="1007">I was their guide. </sentence><sentence id="1008">And then while there, they were talking about another war. </sentence><sentence id="1009">That was really frightening to us. </sentence><sentence id="1010">So, we decided that instead of coming to the United States where we had to wait for a visa and it was a waiting period and we were so scared that we decided to go to Cuba. </sentence><sentence id="1011">And there I had an aunt. </sentence><sentence id="1012">She quickly made out the papers for us -- the necessary papers and did whatever was necessary and we went there. </sentence><sentence id="1013">And lived there until I decided to come to the United States. </sentence><sentence id="1014"> 6 </sentence></p></dialogue>
