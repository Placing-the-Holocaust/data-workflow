<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="79">A: To be honest about it, I -- I don't -- I -- I -- on the map I could locate it, but I don't remember the name, whether it was Shwabingin or whether it was nearby [indecipherable] where -- that wa -- it was -- it was not very far out from -- from Munich, but I would say about a hundred miles or so and that's -- that's where we were and that's where Feldifing, the DP camp also is, close to Munich. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="97"> USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0032 6 </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="98">A: Well, we -- you know, it's a funny thing nowadays, in 1999, I would say, things are more electronically and -- equipped. </sentence><sentence id="99">Those days it was word to mouth and it worked very good, I must say, because people were constantly on the move. </sentence><sentence id="100">Everybody was looking for somebody and traveling and moving and meeting. </sentence><sentence id="101">And everybody had the story to tell, and that's how we found out from people that we met, who told us about that particular camp and we pursued to find out who, if any of th -- our friends or acquaintances from the camp were in the -- in that particular camp. </sentence><sentence id="102">I was not in Dachau per se, in the main camp, but I was in a satellite camp, that we were transported in that particular train. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="108">Q: So it sounds like, for a period there, before you went to the DP camp, you and your brother were sort of on your own? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="110">A: That's right, that's right. </sentence><sentence id="111">We were isolated from any news and from any friends or people of Jewish contact, and that's why my brother traveled into Munich, to see what is going on there and o -- upon his return, we waited a week or so and then we decided that it would be better for us to be where the Jewish population is, despite the fact that we could have had a very substantial German factory and property from the Nazi that was -- evacuated the house, which we occupied after his leaving. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="114">Q: Well, tell me about that. </sentence><sentence id="115">Wa -- This was after you'd been interrogated? </sentence><sentence id="116">How did you end up where you did? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="120">A: Well, after we left the -- after we left the DP camp -- not the D -- the interrogation, see, and we were told -- we told the commander that we would like to be on our own, and USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0032 7 not in the POW camp, he instructed the lieutenant to take care of us and to give us some accommodation. </sentence><sentence id="121">And he took us into the marketplace and comma-commanded to meet the mayor from the town. </sentence><sentence id="122">And he met the mayor of the town in a short while and he instructed the mayor, without any doubt, that he has three Jewish survivors and they are not going to sleep on the street and to provide us with a comfortable home and food and all that. </sentence><sentence id="123">And as -- they gave an -- an -- an hour's time. </sentence><sentence id="124">And we waited an hour and then he came back and he said that he found a home for us which -- and he's going to take us there and give us a woman to care for us and provide us with anything that we want and need, which actually took place. </sentence><sentence id="125">After we took the house, we looked around, there were three bedrooms and we took all the beds, pillows and all that into one bed and for the first time in our life, we slept comfortable and warm, and it was the first time that we really slept in -- un-undescribable. </sentence><sentence id="126">Now, this house became the meeting point for the Jewish soldiers that were in that particular camp, the POW camp. </sentence><sentence id="127">There was also a detachment from the Israeli army there, as prisoner of war, who served as the English army. </sentence><sentence id="128">And I would say that it was -- it was a comfortable time that we spent there with these people who had an opportunity to meet us and they brought us army rations and it was quite remarkable. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="139">Q: That is remarkable. </sentence><sentence id="140">I mean, this was very soon after -- </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="141">A: Days -- Days after, days after. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="143"> USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0032 8 </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="144">Q: So you had gone from being a prisoner on a packed transport train, to being completely on your own, in a house with -- I mean, I'm just trying to imagine what that must have felt like, to make that leap so quickly. </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="145">A: Well, it just felt like -- like being newborn and you started your life over from the beginning and you met people, and you -- that you never figured you're going to meet again, and -- you know, and it was a camaraderie, it was -- unde-undescribable. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="147">Q: Did you trust? </sentence><sentence id="148">I mean, you were still among German people at this point. </sentence><sentence id="149">Did you trust them? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="153">A: Well, to be honest about it, I trusted them as far as ca -- I can throw them, which isn't very far, but a -- I -- I -- Is -- I sort of felt I had the upper hand at this particular time, because I knew that the American had everything un -- occupied and I -- I felt that there was very little that they could do, in order to do anything physically, or any other which way. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="155">Q: Did you -- Did you witness any treatment of how the POW's were being treated by the al -- </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="156">A: No, no, it was -- it was afte-after the war, there were na -- no German soldier's occupation visible. </sentence><sentence id="157">The American were in hundred percent control and all you can see is what -- what I knew were -- how -- how a camp, the concentration camp looked like, it didn't look like a concentration camp, but it looked like a camp and you know, one camp or the other, there's no -- not much -- any big difference. </sentence><sentence id="158">The only thing different was that they had bunks, which we didn't have in the camp, and they were treated different </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="162">   USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0032 9 than we were, and there was -- there was a difference in the camp, in the treatment and the accommodations that they had in the POW camp than I had in -- in the concentration camp. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="164">Q: Did you see any collaborators or perpetrators being tracked down -- rounded up, anything like that? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="166">A: No, I didn't. </sentence><sentence id="167">I didn't see anything of that nature. </sentence><sentence id="168">Although, in Munich, the -- there were some Jewish kapos. </sentence><sentence id="169">That means Jewish people who obtained preference of ser -- supervising the Jewish working force and -- and used their force by beating Jewish people as well as the Germans. </sentence><sentence id="170">And if they came and were recognized, they suffered the consequences. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="176">Q: What do you mean? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="178">A: Well, you know, if somebody came in there and the -- the -- and somebody recognized them, and people suffered under the -- under their treatment, they had now an opportunity to get even with them. </sentence><sentence id="179">So, to what extent I cannot describe, because sometimes they were brutal and sometimes they were not as brutal. </sentence><sentence id="180">So it -- it all depended upon the -- the force. </sentence><sentence id="181">It could have been two people, it could have been 10 people who -- who were together and suffered, you know, and they got even with them. </sentence><sentence id="182">But it was, in my opinion, the -- in my o -- in my opinion, legitimate and it was r-right to -- for the revenge. </sentence><sentence id="183">So, it didn't happen very often, so, you know, it is -- it is a matter of -- that the card -- the card have turned. </sentence><sentence id="184">You know, it is a -- a fact that the people never thought that they going to face the -- the facts, and the day of judgment came. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="185">   USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0032 10 </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="186">Q: This was in Munich, you said? </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="187">A: Yeah. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="189">Q: And you -- you saw -- you saw this? </sentence><sentence id="190">Did you witness some of the [indecipherable] </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="191">A: At occasions I did, yes. </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="192">Q: Can you think of one that you remember, in particular? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="194">A: Well, the -- I -- [remember two or three of them in Munich, you know. </sentence><sentence id="195">In Munich, it was a -- a point, you know, a meeting point and that was the Munich museum. </sentence><sentence id="196">And th-the Jewish people met there, because it was a very large place where you could congregate. </sentence><sentence id="197">It was not within the traffic, it was out of the -- out of sight and that's where people met and it was known all over Europe. </sentence><sentence id="198">So even people from Italy and Poland, or whatever, you know, they heard about and that's -- if they looked for somebody, that's where they went to see and meet people. </sentence><sentence id="199">And that's where -- where these things happened, you know, and it didn't take much, because there were a lot of people there, to create the -- the -- you know, tumult. </sentence><sentence id="200">And that's -- that's where it happened. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="208">Q: Go ahead, sorry. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="210">A: Now, it -- it also happened at the Jewish office in -- in -- in Munich, where people met to register for certain purposes, and there was also a meeting point there, so it also happened there, but not very often. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="212">Q: Uh-huh. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="214">A: It happened more at the Jewish mu -- at the -- not Jewish, but at the museum in Munich. </sentence><sentence id="215">So, it was a very knowledgeable point and it was very well done, I must say. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="216">   USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0032 11 </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="217">Q: What -- What would happen when they were recognized? </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="218">A: Well, they were physically attacked and beaten and that's all. </sentence><sentence id="219">They were not shot or killed or some like that. </sentence><sentence id="220">But they were beaten up. </sentence><sentence id="221">They got their -- their point -- their -- their point across in that -- that respect. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="226">Q: D-Do you remember hearing of them say anything in -- to justify or defend themselves, to how they'd behaved? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="228">A: Well, naturally they -- they -- everybody who gets attacked or something like this, always says something to defend themselve, but the -- the main issue was that they said, you know, "We were just prisoners like you and somebody had to do it, and we were selected, so we had to do it." </sentence><sentence id="229">But, you know, there's a difference, like the same thing with the Germans, that you can do something, and you can do it two ways. </sentence><sentence id="230">You can do it just to do it or you can put some personal hatred and force behind it and make it worse than it could be. </sentence><sentence id="231">And that is the issue and that's what they did, because the same thing the Germans, I mean, they we -- they were soldiers, but they were soldiers to defend themselves, but to go and put the personal atro-atrocity in the -- in -- in the -- in the movements, in the facts, that what killed so many people. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="249">Q: How long did you stay there and how did you -- di -- wa -- did you have money? </sentence><sentence id="250">How did you get by? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="253">A: Well, at that time, money was no object, because we didn't get any money. </sentence><sentence id="254">We didn't need any money because the food we needed to live on, we got from the soldiers and from the German, t -- who had to look for our well being, so that part, there was no -- no need for. </sentence><sentence id="255">We -- We got some shirts and dresses and all that from the POW, which at the time, one shirt was enough. </sentence><sentence id="256">We didn't live like -- like you live today, that you change your shirt every day. </sentence><sentence id="257">And our job for the time after the war, where there was nothing available and everything that we had was -- for us was appreciated and grateful, because we were in the camp, we had only one shirt on for months and months and months and we were full with -- with the lice and all that, so i-it was hundred percent improvement. </sentence><sentence id="258">So we sort of kept -- kept going. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="265">Q: All right. </sentence><sentence id="266">Were you -- Do you remember what it was like? </sentence><sentence id="267">Do you remember the first thing you ate that tasted good, after having such horrible, horrible, and virtually no food during the war? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="271">A: Well, we were very lucky, because in the POW camp, there was a doctor and he told us and warned us not -- not to eat too much and to overeat, because our stomach was not in -- in the condition to absorb a lot of foods and especially not any fat food. </sentence><sentence id="272">So we took  USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0032 13 that -- took it under advice and we contained ourselves to dairy products and -- and it worked, because -- well, it didn't work with me, but it worked, because I later on found out that I had -- have a peptic ulcer and when I came to the United States, I found it out and, you know, and -- but, by and large, a lot of people died after the war, from being fed by the English army, more food and fat food than they should have had. </sentence><sentence id="273">So there was a lot of people that died after the war, on account of the liberation and eating things that th- their stomach was not equipped to handle. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="278">Q: Do you remember what you ate? </sentence><sentence id="279">Anything come to mind, that -- </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="280">A: Well, Late like a -- the -- like you call today, oatmeal and grits -- grits, and pudding and milk. </sentence><sentence id="281">A lot of cheese. </sentence><sentence id="282">Not much butter, and eggs and a lot of vegetables. </sentence><sentence id="283">And that helped me to stay a little bit healthy than the -- than the other people were after the liberation. </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="284">Q: Yeah. </sentence><sentence id="285">Did you mention something about a Nazi factory? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="288">A: Yes, there was a -- there was a farm attached to this house -- not directly to, but it belonged to the house and there was a wood -- wood sawing factory, belonging to the owner of the house and that was up for grabs, because the -- he liquidated it -- not liquidated it, he left the -- there -- vicinity of his -- you know, na -- in other words, he escaped the -- the consequences of being a big German officer or whatever in -- in the town. </sentence><sentence id="289">So, they said, "Well, he's not going to come back, maybe he's dead," and so on, so on. </sentence><sentence id="290">But it was just after the war by hearsay and I don't know how it would have worked out once a nephew would have returned or something like that. </sentence><sentence id="291">But, I would have had the    USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0032 14 good chance, if I would afford it, to -- to be the owner of it, because he was a high ranking German. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="296">Q: Do you know about how long you stayed in that house, before you left for the DP camp? </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="300">Q: Okay. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="302">A: Because it started to get a little nudgy to be by ourselves and in those days there was no television or anything of that nature that we knew or seen what's going on in the world, other than the radio and the contact with the army personnel, which at that time already, has dwindled down to people were -- were being repat-repatriated back to England and America and it got less and less people. </sentence><sentence id="303">And the camp was just about to being resol -- dissolved, and wefe -- we seen the trend and seen that we would be -- is only -- would only have association with -- with a German at that -- at that particular time, we didn't care much about it, to be with the Germans. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="306">Q: So, it was your brother who found out about the -- about the DP camp? </sentence><sentence id="307">He went to Munich and found out about that? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="310">A: Well, he went into Munich, like I mentioned before and he met some people that we -- knew about it. </sentence><sentence id="311">And they said, "What are you doing out there? </sentence><sentence id="312">You are all by yourself, why don't you come and join us," you know, and -- and that's what we did. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="433">Q: It did? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="435">A: Yes, it did. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="437">Q: You had -- You had mentioned in your videotaped interview that you chose to get on a transport train out of one of the camps, because you had heard your father would be coming to that camp and you couldn't bear to see him mistreated? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="439">A: No, actually, actu -- actually, I was in the camp when I found out that my father is in that next transport that's supposed to come into the camp. </sentence><sentence id="440">And knowing what I said then, I say that again, that you know, to be together with your father and see the atrocities that are being done to people, and not be able to defend yourself, I personally -- the type of a person that I am, I don't think that I could s -- could stand still and -- and watch it. </sentence><sentence id="441">So, I choose to leave that camp and go to -- I -- I choose -- there was an opportunity, let's put it that way, which it was, you know, to leave the camp and go to another camp and not be USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0032 20 together with my father. </sentence><sentence id="442">And here, again, I must say, you see how news travel, without -- without electronic help. </sentence><sentence id="443">Without a radio and anything else, you see? </sentence><sentence id="444">It just -- that -- if you have a name and you are known, and people know you, or something like that, word gets around and that's how I found out about it. </sentence><sentence id="445">Again, you know, that my father is on the transport, you know. </sentence><sentence id="446">And is -- is bound -- is bound to be at the same camp, which actually happened. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="466">Q: Did he say why? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="468">A: Well, I -- He didn't have to say why, because this is self explanatory, because about the -- the living conditions, the -- the way it was -- you were subjected to certain punishments sometimes, because you didn't work fast enough and you didn't do -- walk fast enough and all -- all kind of things, you received beatings from the German guards. </sentence><sentence id="469">So, you know every time you see somebody get sent, you know it's -- it's like -- like you get hit yourself, because you had to be a -- a witness of it and you know, it is like one Jew is -- is like your -- your brother, you know, and you feel that -- the -- the pain you go through by being treated that way. </sentence><sentence id="470">So, it is a -- a natural instinct. </sentence></p></dialogue>
