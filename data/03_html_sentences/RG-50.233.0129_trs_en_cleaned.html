double floor. </sentence><sentence id="580">We could not go with him because we were Jews and he was a Pole, and transporting Jews would have caused him problems. </sentence><sentence id="581">I went by myself and a number of other people who would try to cross the border with someone who knew the area and also knew when the guards were changing. </sentence><sentence id="582">We made it across the

"He is beyond reproach, you don't have to worry. </sentence><sentence id="585">When you get there, he'll wait for you and he'll have it for you." </sentence><sentence id="586">Sure enough, when I went back to Chisava, he told me where he's going to be. </sentence><sentence id="587">There was only one beer joint. </sentence><sentence id="588">He said, "I'm going to be in that beer joint." </sentence><sentence id="589">I went over to him and he had that stuff for me. </sentence><sentence id="590">I paid him and I made arrangements that I'm going to use him again next time.

lacking. </sentence><sentence id="596">But the farmers had it in abundance. </sentence><sentence id="597">They're putting it away and hoarding it. </sentence><sentence id="598">For the sugar, we got all that stuff that we needed. </sentence><sentence id="599">I took off that stuff that we got and we hid it. </sentence><sentence id="600">A few days later, I had a message that my grandmother was very sick and she was not expected to live another day. </sentence><sentence id="601">I filled a knapsack with a number of provisions. </sentence><sentence id="602">My father and my grandmother were
