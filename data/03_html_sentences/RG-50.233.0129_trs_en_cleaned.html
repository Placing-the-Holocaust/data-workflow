they're called protectorate. </sentence><sentence id="252">Germans were hoping that eventually the public was going to be voting for them to remain over there. </sentence><sentence id="253">I went

and then I started on the way back. </sentence><sentence id="259">The way back was a little harder. </sentence><sentence id="260">We had to hire somebody who would transport the sugar and make sure that that the sugar was not going to be seen. </sentence><sentence id="261">He put some sheep in the wagon and hid the sugar under that double floor. </sentence><sentence id="262">We could not go with him because we were Jews and he was a Pole, and transporting Jews would have caused him problems. </sentence><sentence id="263">I went by myself and a number of other people who would try to cross the
