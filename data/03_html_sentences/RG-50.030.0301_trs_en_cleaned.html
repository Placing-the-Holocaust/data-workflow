<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="23">Q: 1940. </sentence><sentence id="24">Can you tell us what that was like? </sentence><sentence id="25">You were a very young man. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="29">A: This was my first post. </sentence><sentence id="30">I had applied -- see, I had applied for the foreign service already earlier, but I wasn't ready with my exam. </sentence><sentence id="31">And at Uppsala, I studied law, and in the meantime I was drafted; I was in the military service. </sentence><sentence id="32">So I had difficulty in finishing this, but I just finished in time in December 1939, when the war broke out between Finland and the Soviets at that time. </sentence><sentence id="33">A dramatic period. </sentence><sentence id="34">And the war had already started. </sentence><sentence id="35">And the beginning of World War II had already started, of course. </sentence><sentence id="36">So the Swedish Foreign Office knowing that I was applying for entering the service, they said, "Look, here. </sentence><sentence id="37">We have -- we need staff now. </sentence><sentence id="38">So we could present you as a trainee to Berlin in January." </sentence><sentence id="39">And so I just got out of the military service, and I just happened to finish my law exam. </sentence><sentence id="40">So I was sent in January 1940 to Berlin to help at the commercial department in the Swedish Embassy. </sentence><sentence id="41">So I was working there the whole spring and went home then in June, the same year, to apply and to go through the exam for the foreign service. </sentence><sentence id="42">And I managed to get through that and returned then to Berlin where I stayed on till summer "41. </sentence><sentence id="43">And I returned to Stockholm exactly the This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="44">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="45"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection day when Germany invaded, so in June, midsummer "41. </sentence><sentence id="46">So from there on, I stayed on another year in Stockholm. </sentence><sentence id="47">But in Berlin, it was, of course, for me, for a Swede never having been out in war and all that, it was quite a new situation, all that. </sentence><sentence id="48">And it wasn't so much all of the bombing and fighting, that didn't happen then because all over Europe was then slowly being dominated by the Germans. </sentence><sentence id="49">Not during the spring, but as you remember, in April they invaded Norway, Denmark in a big operation when they took over all of Europe. </sentence><sentence id="50">So during this first half-year when I was there, it was very, very little of wars, things which reminds me of the war. </sentence><sentence id="51">There were some British airplanes coming in now and then and dropped some bombs on Berlin. </sentence><sentence id="52">And so we had to go around in the shelters and so on. </sentence><sentence id="53">But it was, of course, hard to get food and it was also a very severe winter that 1940 and so on. </sentence><sentence id="54">So it was in a way then kind of a hardship for all the people in Berlin, all of them. </sentence><sentence id="55">But it was not destroyed and not -- those bombs didn't cause very much damage really. </sentence><sentence id="56">But it was a psychological thing, which is very interesting. </sentence><sentence id="57">There came one British airplane in during the night, say, at midnight and forced the whole population down in the shelters. </sentence><sentence id="58">And then Hitler was, of course, furious that the Air Force couldn't stop these people coming in. </sentence><sentence id="59">And so everybody was sitting there in the shelters. </sentence><sentence id="60">And then after an hour, they went up again to continue to sleep. </sentence><sentence id="61">And then after two more hours, another airplane came from Britain and started to drop some bombs and forced the whole population again down in the shelters. </sentence><sentence id="62">So that was a kind of psychological warfare, in a way, which was very frustrating for the people in Berlin. </sentence><sentence id="63">Then they started to know that now something is coming here, and this is only the beginning, which was the fact. </sentence><sentence id="64">But then, you see, slowly the Germans took over, and I was there -- I was there in April when we sent the first -- I think it was end of March, we sent the first dispatch or the code telegram to Sweden about the German planning. </sentence><sentence id="65">That was very -- I was there sitting in my room on a Sunday when they telephoned from the embassy. " </sentence><sentence id="66">Now, you have to come here because you are on duty, and you have to send a code telegram to Sweden, a cipher." </sentence><sentence id="67">So I came there and I remember still that was one of the more dramatic periods of my life at that time. </sentence><sentence id="68">I was waiting for that telegram to come, and my boss said, "Now, in a few minutes you will get the most terrible message you ever have met to send to Sweden." </sentence><sentence id="69">And that was the information we had got through the underground, and This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="70">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="71"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection Kanaris (ph) and those people in Germany who were working against Hitler. </sentence><sentence id="72">And we got through them the whole plan that in a few days, they are going to invade Denmark, Norway -- we didn't know about Sweden, if they were going to touch Sweden. </sentence><sentence id="73">And that's part of a bigger plan to conquer the whole of Europe, including Britain, which they never succeeded. </sentence><sentence id="74">But the whole of France, Belgium, Poland and so on. </sentence><sentence id="75">So I got that in, and I started to put it into this mapping machine. </sentence><sentence id="76">It was at that time a very awkward machine, a modern thing. </sentence><sentence id="77">And I managed to get it through and I went to the post office and mailed that to Stockholm, and then I couldn't sleep, of course. </sentence><sentence id="78">My god, perhaps I had made the wrong sort of -- pushed the wrong button or whatever. </sentence><sentence id="79">So what happens -- what could happen now in Stockholm is that the Germans will invade Sweden tomorrow; and they will not be warned in Sweden because there was a sloppy sort of attache at the embassy who couldn't cipher, who couldn't send the right telegram to Sweden. </sentence><sentence id="80">That will be you can read it in all the history books about this man. </sentence><sentence id="81">It was a nightmare I had. </sentence><sentence id="82">And, of course, they could, and that is the interesting reaction then in Sweden -- "We think you have been nervous in Berlin. </sentence><sentence id="83">I mean, we can't understand why you sort of exaggerate things like that." </sentence><sentence id="84">And they didn't believe us. </sentence><sentence id="85">And then, not till a couple of days before, I would say five days before the invasion, we send a new cable. </sentence><sentence id="86">And then they understood that now, it's serious. </sentence><sentence id="87">Now, it's serious, but that was rather later. </sentence><sentence id="88">You know, we were not prepared at all to defend our country. </sentence><sentence id="89">And Hitler apparently thought that it wasn't necessary to invade Sweden because he could always do that later on. </sentence><sentence id="90">Sweden was always there, and we were delivering iron ore to him. </sentence><sentence id="91">And he was happy with that, and so on. </sentence><sentence id="92">So granted, they conquered Norway, Denmark, and the other countries. </sentence><sentence id="93">So I was then in that situation. </sentence><sentence id="94">Then, we were in administration, we were sitting in the embassy and didn't know from one day or the other if the Germans were going to include Sweden also in the attack towards Scandinavia. </sentence><sentence id="95">And then I also remember another episode which I very much remember is when the brigade or the army, whatever you call it, returned from France marching through the streets of Berlin and how the people greeted them and throwing flowers towards the soldiers and thinking that now, the war is over. </sentence><sentence id="96">And the war had just started, you know, which they couldn't understand that. </sentence><sentence id="97">The war had just started. </sentence><sentence id="98">And they marched, these troops marched up and lined up outside the big palace. </sentence><sentence id="99">The This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="100">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="101"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection Villa Platt (ph) was the name, and out on the balcony came Hitler. </sentence><sentence id="102">And he was greeted then by the masses saying "Heil, Hitler" and all of that. </sentence><sentence id="103">I was standing there and everybody did this, that salute, so I thought I better do that. </sentence><sentence id="104">Otherwise, I don't -- but I had forgotten one thing. </sentence><sentence id="105">I had still my hat on, and then a man right behind me gave me a blow like that so my hat flew away, I don't how long, because you shouldn't stand facing the Fihrer with a hat on. </sentence><sentence id="106">So that was that atmosphere, you know, of sort of he had more or less hypnotized the whole population. </sentence><sentence id="107">He was the -- I mean, the savior, the Fiihrer and all that. </sentence><sentence id="108">So that gave me the first impression; I saw how terribly this system had infiltrated in the whole population. </sentence><sentence id="109">And then after that came also the persecutions of the -- the Jewish persecutions and all that and so on. </sentence><sentence id="110">One didn't notice so much of it in Berlin because they did it in a very clever, secret way. </sentence><sentence id="111">But I remember that I had a housekeeper, a Jewish lady, who came to -- I was a bachelor at the time -- to clean up my apartment. </sentence><sentence id="112">All of a sudden, or one day, she didn't come. </sentence><sentence id="113">She just disappeared. </sentence><sentence id="114">So they disappeared, just like that, and were brought to the extermination camps or whatever. </sentence><sentence id="115">Only at that time, it wasn't very much known in the world, I would say. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="206">Q: Were you getting reports about what was happening in Germany and then what was happening outside in terms of the persecution . . . </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="208">A: Ya. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="210">Q: . .. </sentence><sentence id="211">not just the war? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="214">A: Yes, we didn't very much, say, in 1940. </sentence><sentence id="215">We didn't know very about it then -- or "41, I didn't know other than there was discriminations against the Jewish people and so on. </sentence><sentence id="216">But the first real report we sent -- I wasn't there then, I was then in Budapest -- was sent in "42. </sentence><sentence id="217">You see, there was the big conference in Wannsee in the beginning of "42, when the final solution was decided upon. </sentence><sentence id="218">And then towards the end of that year, the world started to know about it. </sentence><sentence id="219">I know that the Americans knew about it; also, the Swedish. </sentence><sentence id="220">The American government knew about it, the Swedish government and all that; because we had a diplomat at the Berlin Embassy, a good friend of mine, who on a train in, say, October "42 met an SS officer who came up and said, "I have to tell you. </sentence><sentence id="221">I can't stand it any longer." </sentence><sentence id="222">And he told him the whole story about the gas chambers. </sentence><sentence id="223">And that we This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="224">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="225"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection reported home to Sweden in "42. </sentence><sentence id="226">So, for sure, from the autumn of "42, the Swedish government and the Americans got the same report, and the Swiss and all. </sentence><sentence id="227">From that on, most of the governments in the western world knew what was going on. </sentence><sentence id="228">I think that is important to say because to -- knowing how little they did, or they did nothing. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="245">Q: Did you know about the euthanasia killings in Germany? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="247">A: About the what? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="249">Q: About the euthanasia, when they were doing so-called mercy killings in Germany in the hospitals, in the mental hospitals? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="251">A: I didn't know at that time. </sentence><sentence id="252">I think we got to know about that later. </sentence><sentence id="253">I didn't know anything then at that time, no. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="257">Q: When you said you were in this situation watching the Fiihrer and watching everybody respond to him and you almost raised your hand in a "Heil, Hitler," but, fortunately, you were stopped, what were you thinking? </sentence><sentence id="258">Were you frightened and thought you would have to do it because somebody . . </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="261">A: Why, they would have killed me. </sentence><sentence id="262">Oh absolutely. </sentence><sentence id="263">There saying such -- what do I say -- excited, what you call, hypnotical (sic) situation. </sentence><sentence id="264">They were spellbound. </sentence><sentence id="265">They were spellbound by this man. </sentence><sentence id="266">So if you said anything against him or if you did anything to him, you would have been killed on the spot by the mass of people, by the crowd. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="273">Q: When you met ordinary Germans during this period, did they -- were they hypnotized even outside of that situation when there were crowds? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="275">A: Well, they -- not hypnotized, but they were all indoctrinated in a fantastic way. </sentence><sentence id="276">I mean, this Goebbels must have been absolute, remarkable professional in the way of spreading this information or indoctrinating people. </sentence><sentence id="277">Imagine, at that time there was no television. </sentence><sentence id="278">There was just the spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="279">There was the radio, of course, and the newspapers, but that was enough. </sentence><sentence id="280">I was living at that time at the pension, where I was sitting around the table with the Germans and old people and how the day after the invasion of Norway and Denmark were so happy. </sentence><sentence id="281">They said, "Look, aren't you happy?" </sentence><sentence id="282">Looked at me, "Why?" " </sentence><sentence id="283">Because we have saved, we have saved your This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="284">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="285"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection neighbors from being invaded by the allies, by the British. </sentence><sentence id="286">And now, they are going to be free people, and, of course, under our control. </sentence><sentence id="287">Anyhow, we have saved them from this imperialist sort of western powers." </sentence><sentence id="288">This whole attitude was so all over. </sentence><sentence id="289">There were no exceptions from that theory. </sentence><sentence id="290">And, of course, it was part of it and so forth that they were also perhaps -- even if they thought that it was absolutely the wrong, the right version of it, they were scared to say something against it. </sentence><sentence id="291">Because then they knew what was going to happen. </sentence><sentence id="292">So everybody was -- I mean, even the officials in the foreign service with whom I had to deal, they were all the same. </sentence><sentence id="293">They never doubted. </sentence><sentence id="294">When you came up to the foreign office, I was dealing with the commercial things, always the same salute. " </sentence><sentence id="295">Heil, Hitler," like that, you know. </sentence><sentence id="296">I never said, "Heil, Hitler." </sentence><sentence id="297">Never in my life. </sentence><sentence id="298">So that was the way of greeting people. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="324">Q: What sort of an impression -- you were a very young person and certainly had not experienced this kind of form of government, this kind of oppression. </sentence><sentence id="325">What effect did this have on you in your mid 20s, late 20s? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="328">A: Well, that's -- of course, it was very strange for me to encounter such a system. </sentence><sentence id="329">Of course, it was, but that is also very dangerous because without knowing if yourself, you get indoctrinated. </sentence><sentence id="330">If you every day hear the same thing in radio, read the same thing in the paper, hearing people speaking about the same thing, about how victorious we are and how we are going to conquer the whole world, and all that and so on, and Hitler is a fantastic man. </sentence><sentence id="331">He has given us jobs and all that and so on. </sentence><sentence id="332">So I sometimes had the impression that I have to go to Sweden now for some vacation to breathe, to listen to other opinions than this. </sentence><sentence id="333">I mean, this is remarkable how you can get influenced without knowing it yourself. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="340">Q: Did you see any persecution of anybody? </sentence><sentence id="341">Beatings in the street or... </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="346">Q: Nothing? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="348">A: No, I didn't see anything like that. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="350">Q: How did it happen that you were sent to Budapest in 1942? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="352">This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="353">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="354"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="355">A: Well, it so happened because I was then off to Berlin dealing with the Hungarian affairs in the foreign office with the commercial matters, and there were delegations from Budapest coming. </sentence><sentence id="356">And we were negotiating with them, and we saw that Hungary is a potential sort of delivery of our goods we need. </sentence><sentence id="357">Foodstuffs, and all that. </sentence><sentence id="358">Hungary was and still is an agricultural country, you know, so then they wanted to send someone who already got some experience in these negotiations. </sentence><sentence id="359">So I was sent to Budapest mainly because they needed someone for this job. </sentence><sentence id="360">So I was participating in the negotiations there. </sentence><sentence id="361">The Swedish delegation coming out, I was a member of that. </sentence><sentence id="362">And we tried to -- you know, that old system of negotiations about trade that if we give you some steel, you give us some apples. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="371">Q: Bartering? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="373">A: Bargaining like that. </sentence><sentence id="374">Bilateral sort of trade which doesn't exist any longer happily enough. </sentence><sentence id="375">So that was my job from 1942 when I came in November "42 to Budapest onwards till, say, till "43, "44.Beginning of "44 and so on when it wasn't very much -- you didn't notice very much of the war then in Budapest at that time even if Hungary was an ally to Germany, you know. </sentence><sentence id="376">But the Hungarians, first of all, they didn't like -- of course, nobody likes war, but they were forced into this war. </sentence><sentence id="377">And it was also perhaps rather easy for the Germans to force them to get into the war on their side because this all goes back to the first world war, you know. </sentence><sentence id="378">The injustice of the first world war, which I think after the second world war, people had -- the western powers and learned much more how to treat those who have defeated. </sentence><sentence id="379">That after the first world war, they decided to more or less exterminate Germany, or they -- Germany, they put on the shoulders of Germany those enormous debts in all the war. </sentence><sentence id="380">And they on the map sort of drew up new lines, lines for new states like Czechoslovakia, Yugoslavia, and so on. </sentence><sentence id="381">And they cut off then artificial borders, but they didn't think of that now, we are placing a great minority of people on the other countries, within the other countries" borders. </sentence><sentence id="382">So Hungary, they took away from Hungary two-thirds of their territory after the first world war and gave it to the neighbors. </sentence><sentence id="383">So that was still -- that was always in the mind of the Hungarians, this feeling of revenge. </sentence><sentence id="384">We have to get back our territory. </sentence><sentence id="385">And, of course, when they joined Germany in the second world war, that was their hope and that goes back, everything, which This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="386">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="387"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection doesn't prevent history to take it away again after the second world war. </sentence><sentence id="388">So that's how it went, you know, with those countries. </sentence><sentence id="389">So that was very sad that people who didn't understand the history of Europe and all that, the statesmen at that time, I think they caused very much all the reasons for everything for the second world war. </sentence><sentence id="390">All the fault which was made during after the first world war, more or less, caused the second world war, I think. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="412">Q: What was your daily life like in Budapest during those two years before the occupation by Germany in "42 and "43? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="414">A: Well, it was, as I told you, it was going on as usual. </sentence><sentence id="415">The Hungarians had, of course, participated in the war already, but they lost their whole army in the battle on the east front at the beginning of 1943. </sentence><sentence id="416">And after that, they said to themselves, "Never, we are not going to be active any longer in this war." </sentence><sentence id="417">So when the Germans -- and then during this period and when I was there, "42 till "44, when Germany invaded, the life went on more or less as usual. </sentence><sentence id="418">We had our trade negotiations with them, and Budapest looked rather peaceful. </sentence><sentence id="419">There had been no bombing to speak of from the Russians or from any of the enemies. </sentence><sentence id="420">And the Hungarians are people who enjoy life, and I was sitting at the cafes there and listening to the Gypsy music and so on and so on as it always had been in Budapest, this beautiful city. </sentence><sentence id="421">And then this situation, of course, completely changed in March "44 when the Germans decided to invade Hungary because of two reasons. </sentence><sentence id="422">The first was that they wanted to force the Hungarians to fight now more actively on these fronts against the Soviets. </sentence><sentence id="423">And, secondly, that they have to start off also with the final solution, which they hadn't done. </sentence><sentence id="424">There was, of course, anti-Semitic feelings in Hungary, as there had always been. </sentence><sentence id="425">And also part of the explanation that is also part of what happened after the first world war when -- you see, in Hungary to do business wasn't -- a gentleman couldn't do business. </sentence><sentence id="426">That was the Jewish people who had the business in their hand, they thought. </sentence><sentence id="427">They were sitting on their estates, you know, and had their castles and the upper class and all that is one. </sentence><sentence id="428">And they left all the business in the hands of the Jewish people, and also many Jewish people were then in those professions as doctors, as architects, and all those professions. </sentence><sentence id="429">So when Hungary then lost two-thirds of that territory, all the -- or most of the Hungarians were sitting out on this land which was taken over by neighboring countries. </sentence><sentence id="430">This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="431">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="432"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection They moved into Budapest to that center, and then they found that all professions more or less were taken by the Jewish people in Budapest. </sentence><sentence id="433">And so that, of course, increased the anti-Semitics in Hungary. </sentence><sentence id="434">But they never came to that extreme that they tried to exterminate the whole race in terms of to find a solution like the Germans had. </sentence><sentence id="435">So that led, of course, to the situation that the people, the Jewish people in other countries in Europe like in France and Poland and Germany, if they could, they fled to Hungary because they said, "Well, look, there is a country which is still is free." </sentence><sentence id="436">It was in the paper it was independent even if it was allied to Germany, but they knew, everybody knew that they hadn't come to any persecutions in that big scale as all that had been done in Germany and France and Poland and so on. </sentence><sentence id="437">So the population in Hungary increased to 800,000 people, living 600,000 in the countryside and about 200,000 in Budapest. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="463">Q: The Jews, you're talking about? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="465">A: Huh? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="467">Q: Jews? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="469">A: Jews, Jewish people. </sentence><sentence id="470">Jews. </sentence><sentence id="471">And so that was one of the purposes. </sentence><sentence id="472">The second purpose was then for the Germans to invade Hungary to force them now to bring the final solution to Hungary. </sentence><sentence id="473">That was the purpose. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="479">Q: Had Jewish people's lives changed very much during the period of the alliance with the Germans? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="481">A: Pardon? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="483">Q: Did the life of the Jews change very much during the period of time prior to the occupation? </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="765">Q: Can you tell us about the first time you did it? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="767">A: Well, it was one of the days just after the invasion when I was sitting at home, and then came one of my friends. </sentence><sentence id="768">He was Jewish head of one of the big Swedish companies in Budapest. </sentence><sentence id="769">He was coming and he was hiding his star with a portfolio like this (indicating). </sentence><sentence id="770">And he said to me "Per Anger, you have to help me." </sentence><sentence id="771">I said, "Is this a new situation?" </sentence><sentence id="772">I said, "We have instructions to help Swedish citizens, and we have no instructions to help any other nationals. </sentence><sentence id="773">That's against every international law and all that." </sentence><sentence id="774">So I don't know what to do, but after I thought of it for a while, I said, "I give you a provisional passport." </sentence><sentence id="775">And then not only to him, but to his wife, to his daughter, and to all the grandchildren. </sentence><sentence id="776">So the whole family got provisional passports, and I said -- I was waiting for some reprimands from Stockholm, but they, fair enough, they approved afterwards. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="787">Q: Did you write a report to them to say what you had done? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="789">A: Oh, ya. </sentence><sentence id="790">Certainly, I do that. </sentence><sentence id="791">I describe the situation and all that, of course. </sentence><sentence id="792">And then we worked in that sort of direction, more or less. </sentence><sentence id="793">We gave them -- we couldn't keep provisional passports too many, but we invented these certificates. </sentence><sentence id="794">We established sort of certificates saying that the holder of this certificate has just applied for Swedish citizenship, and until he gets that he is under the protection of the Swedish government. </sentence><sentence id="795">The document had stamps and everything on it, you see. </sentence><sentence id="796">And also, we got authorization from Sweden to give visa to people who could show that they had relatives in Sweden and all that and so on, and to them we gave this. </sentence><sentence id="797">Also, identity papers saying that the holder of this paper has got visa to Sweden. </sentence><sentence id="798">Until he is able to travel to Sweden, he's under This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="799">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="800"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection 5 the protection of the Swedish government. </sentence><sentence id="801">I mean, a completely legal document according to international law, but the Nazis, you know, there were many of those Nazis who were illiterate, and they were very impressed by papers with stamps and all that and so on. </sentence><sentence id="802">So we got many examples of how those people -- many of those people were saved from being deported through showing these papers, so even to own them. </sentence><sentence id="803">We issued around 600, 700 of those papers and these people were saved. </sentence><sentence id="804">But, you see, the numbers of those people increased the whole time, and we couldn't cope with it. </sentence><sentence id="805">We were only, as I told you, a handful of people in the embassy. </sentence><sentence id="806">So that comes to the new situation; then we ask for more staff from Sweden. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="825">Q: At this time, were other groups, were other legations, the neutrals, also writing out provisional passports like this? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="827">A: Well, there was, of course, the Swiss already had the British interests. </sentence><sentence id="828">You see, in all the wars, the first world war, the second world war, both the neutral countries like Switzerland and Sweden have taken upon them to protect the enemies" interests. </sentence><sentence id="829">In other words, you can't keep your embassy in the enemy's capitol. </sentence><sentence id="830">So, for instance, in Budapest, the Swiss had the American and the British interests and to hold their buildings and citizens and protected them, you see. </sentence><sentence id="831">And we had other countries like Holland, Finland, we even had the Soviet Union's interests in Budapest and so on. </sentence><sentence id="832">So they were under our protection. </sentence><sentence id="833">Now, Switzerland had the British interests and the British had this old system with Palestine certificates which the Swiss took over, enabling people to immigrate to Switzerland -- to immigrate to Palestine. </sentence><sentence id="834">Afterward, Israel, but Palestine at that time. </sentence><sentence id="835">And that was, of course, very restrictive because the British were not very anxious to increase that quota because their interests, their relationship with the Arabs and all that. </sentence><sentence id="836">And so that's a long story and so on, but didn't prevent the Swiss from going on and issuing those papers. </sentence><sentence id="837">So I think that was the start for the Swiss, was the Palestine certificates, and if they then changed that into the same protective passport as we had -- I don't remember, but I think they did the same thing. </sentence><sentence id="838">Finally, they copied us, like the others, like the Spanish people and the Portuguese and so on. </sentence><sentence id="839">So I think they more or less followed in our footsteps. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="862">A: At the very beginning, I don't think that they did very much because I don't think -- they couldn't do very much trying the same way perhaps as we did. </sentence><sentence id="863">I can't tell you how they succeeded because we were so occupied with our own problems. </sentence><sentence id="864">So we had -- from that time, I don't remember very much of what they did, just the first days. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="928">A: Well, he was the -- like I said from the beginning, the cultural attache because he was teaching Swedish at the university and all that. </sentence><sentence id="929">So we appointed him cultural attache at the embassy, and he was a very good man. </sentence><sentence id="930">Had a fantastic feeling for his fellowman and a great idealist and so on. </sentence><sentence id="931">He - - I would say that he was the man who pushed us very much to do something, because he knew, he knew much more than we did about the Hungarian situation. </sentence><sentence id="932">He had lived there for all the years, so he had a feeling more than we what was coming on. </sentence><sentence id="933">So he insisted very much from the very beginning that, of course, this is good what we are doing here, but we need more staff. </sentence><sentence id="934">We need more help. </sentence><sentence id="935">And why don't we ask Count Bernadotte (ph) to come to Sweden, to come to Hungary with a Red Cross delegation to try to do something? </sentence><sentence id="936">Now, that failed because Bernadotte (ph) never got visa to go to Hungary. </sentence><sentence id="937">The Germans refused to have a relative of the Swedish monarchy on the battlefield there. </sentence><sentence id="938">They couldn't see that, so that never happened. </sentence><sentence id="939">But we raised the question in Stockholm that we need more staff. </sentence><sentence id="940">And that's how -- and not only for that purpose, but also for safeguarding the other countries! </sentence><sentence id="941">interests, you see. </sentence><sentence id="942">So I went home -- well, I don't know did you say tell this chronological order or not, but Wallenberg comes first. </sentence><sentence id="943">And then I went home in August with my wife and our baby, left them home to get staff, more staff for taking care of these other countries" interests, you see. </sentence><sentence id="944">So this little embassy of five people grew to quite an enormous organization. </sentence><sentence id="945">We had the ambassador who was very loyal to this action and very -- I mean, for us it This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="946">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="947"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection 8 was a great thing, and for Wallenberg also, of course, that he was staying on. </sentence><sentence id="948">It gave our embassy a prestige which the others didn't have. </sentence><sentence id="949">The Swiss Ambassador, when it started to -- the bombs started to fall, he went to Switzerland. </sentence><sentence id="950">The Portuguese left; the Spanish Ambassador left; all of them left. </sentence><sentence id="951">So the only one remaining was -- of course, the Vatican representative, he was there and our ambassador. </sentence><sentence id="952">So we could always -- we always had this base of a strong embassy with an ambassador and all that, which guaranteed legality of our existence and all that and so on. </sentence><sentence id="953">So that was how our situation was. </sentence><sentence id="954">And then I went home to get all these people for the special section for the foreign interests. </sentence><sentence id="955">So we had the original embassy, where I was sitting in the middle as a coordinator, more or less, to start with, to coordinate the enormous department _ established. </sentence><sentence id="956">The Red Cross, which Langley was basing, was leading, we had the Save the Children, a lady called Asta Nielsen (ph), she was also in the Red Cross in a way or Save the Children Fund. </sentence><sentence id="957">That was the three, we had this big department for the foreign interests. </sentence><sentence id="958">We had one special section for buying all the foodstuffs and all that on the black market outside Budapest for the houses where we had all the people hiding and all that and so on. </sentence><sentence id="959">So this became really quite a big organization. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="993">Q: Tell me one thing about Langley. </sentence><sentence id="994">Did this happen prior to the arrival of Raoul Wallenberg? </sentence><sentence id="995">Did he put signs on buildings that said, "Under the protection of the Swedish Red Cross"? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="999">A: Uh-huh, ya. </sentence><sentence id="1000">He was very well-meaning. </sentence><sentence id="1001">He tried to help, and the problem with him was, of course, that he wasn't that well organized, so as soon one come and asked for help, he said, "Oh, here, you have a passport or Red Cross," and so on, and he took under his protection hospitals and churches and all that and put on the sign "This is under protection of the Swedish Red Cross." </sentence><sentence id="1002">And, you see, this became kind of inflation of those papers, and so it became difficult for him in the long run to defend all these. </sentence><sentence id="1003">So this was a headache for us very often to rush out when the Nazis invaded one of his hospitals, for us to rush out and try to stop these Nazis from doing something like that. </sentence><sentence id="1004">But he helped many, and he saved many people, so he should have all the credit for that. </sentence><sentence id="1005">But the problem was, as I say, that he never knew where to stop. </sentence><sentence id="1006">I mean, there was also discussions I had with Raoul Wallenberg later on, "We can't give protective passports to the whole Budapest population because then they will have no value. </sentence><sentence id="1007">So we have to hide ourselves behind a This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="1008">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="1009"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection 9 bureaucracy." </sentence><sentence id="1010">But we were able to show, the Germans could come in and look at our files and see those people had protective passports. </sentence><sentence id="1011">Because this man has a cousin in Sweden. </sentence><sentence id="1012">This person is married to a Swedish girl. </sentence><sentence id="1013">This man is head of big Swedish -- so those criteria were very important to keep and to have as a kind of a protection against accusations that were going around. </sentence><sentence id="1014">So it was a well organized bureaucracy which helped us. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1055">Q: Mr. Anger, Raoul Wallenberg arrives July 9th, 1944, right? </sentence><sentence id="1056">You knew that he was coming. </sentence><sentence id="1057">You had been asked about him. </sentence><sentence id="1058">What did you think about the presence of Raoul Wallenberg coming to Budapest? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1063">A: Well, first they asked us. </sentence><sentence id="1064">We are intending -- the foreign office cabled us, we are intending to send Raoul Wallenberg to Budapest in this one Italian mission. </sentence><sentence id="1065">We didn't know the background then about the negotiations in Stockholm between the American Embassy and the Jewish -- well, congress on one hand and this foreign office on the other. </sentence><sentence id="1066">But we only got the message "We are intending to send Raoul Wallenberg. </sentence><sentence id="1067">We want your comments." </sentence><sentence id="1068">And I said to the ambassador, "Of course, this couldn't be better because I know him, and I know he's the right man." </sentence><sentence id="1069">So, of course, they would never have sent him if we had said, "No, for heaven's sake, don't send Wallenberg." </sentence><sentence id="1070">But that was never the question, so he came as you said on the 9th of July to Budapest. </sentence><sentence id="1071">Late, of course, too late, but that was not his fault. </sentence><sentence id="1072">Nobody's fault. </sentence><sentence id="1073">Of course, the whole countryside was already evacuated and so on. </sentence><sentence id="1074">So once he was appointed, he traveled day and night to come as soon as possible to Budapest. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1091">A: Well, he came there to the embassy where we were in full work trying to issue those papers I told you about. </sentence><sentence id="1092">The whole garden of the embassy was full of people who were lining up there. </sentence><sentence id="1093">Who knows who they were, and trying to issue those different certificates and so on. </sentence><sentence id="1094">And there he comes, and as I describe it in my book, he comes then with equipment rather odd for a diplomat. </sentence><sentence id="1095">He's carrying sleeping bag and a knapsack and the revolver, and he was very proud to show me this This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="1096">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="1097"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection 1 revolver. </sentence><sentence id="1098">And, of course, I knew that everyone in the embassy had a revolver somewhere lying. </sentence><sentence id="1099">But the man coming was like this (indicating) and he joked. </sentence><sentence id="1100">He had a good sense of humor, also, Raoul Wallenberg. </sentence><sentence id="1101">So you see, this only -- it gives me more courage to have this in my pocket. </sentence><sentence id="1102">He never used it, of course, never. </sentence><sentence id="1103">But he had it with him and so on. </sentence><sentence id="1104">And the sleeping bag and all this equipment was very -- this came to use, of course, later on. </sentence><sentence id="1105">Which he had this kind of a mission, of course, that he had been in the military service in Sweden like I, and we had met there, so he knew what it was to sleep under a tree and all that and so on. </sentence><sentence id="1106">So he was perhaps thinking of a situation where we were going to be bombed out and all that and so on. </sentence><sentence id="1107">So he had this sort of equipment with him, and then he saw all this activity around. </sentence><sentence id="1108">He said, "What are you doing here?" </sentence><sentence id="1109">I briefed him; I gave sort of a description of what we are doing, and he saw the documents. </sentence><sentence id="1110">And that is typical for him with his inventiveness that he more or less on the spot said, "Well, it's very good. </sentence><sentence id="1111">But I think of an idea -- I have idea one could perhaps make them more spectacular, these certificates." </sentence><sentence id="1112">Same reading as I had once upon a time invented myself, but now a document with a Swedish emblem, the Swedish coat of arms on it in blue and yellow colors and the ambassador's signature and stamps and so on. </sentence><sentence id="1113">It made it more like an official document, an authentic Swedish passport in a way. </sentence><sentence id="1114">So that was his first -- the first action was to invent this. </sentence><sentence id="1115">And then another quality he had was that he was very good negotiator. </sentence><sentence id="1116">I knew that because he had been in Budapest before 1942, "43 negotiating for his firm in Stockholm about trade. </sentence><sentence id="1117">And I followed him there to see how he negotiated about this quota of foodstuffs coming from Hungary to Sweden and so on. </sentence><sentence id="1118">So I discovered there that he was a good negotiator. </sentence><sentence id="1119">That also came to use because he then started to negotiate with them, the new government, about these passports. </sentence><sentence id="1120">And he got the approval of, say, 4,500 passports. </sentence><sentence id="1121">And also the approval to have these people living in houses under our protection. </sentence><sentence id="1122">That was his first action, to say, and... </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1158">A: That was his idea. </sentence><sentence id="1159">That was his idea. </sentence><sentence id="1160">Oh, yes, it was because, you see, there were so many empty houses because Jewish people had been living in their apartments. </sentence><sentence id="1161">And then the first step was, of course, to put on the yellow star on your clothes, and the second, that you could be </sentence></p><p><sentence id="1162"> This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="1163">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="1164"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection 2 identified. </sentence><sentence id="1165">And then you had to go together in houses with the yellow star on it, and they had to leave their rooms, you see, and being concentrated in special houses. </sentence><sentence id="1166">And the next step after that was, of course, to be brought to the general ghetto in the city, and from there on to Auschwitz. </sentence><sentence id="1167">That was the sort of procedure in a way. </sentence><sentence id="1168">But it's interesting then that prior to his arrival, I was in charge of the embassy one day when the cablegram came from the King of Sweden, the old king, Gustavus V, that he appeals to halt, to stop all these deportations. </sentence><sentence id="1169">So I delivered that, and I remembered that my ambassador was on leave and I telephoned him, and he said, "Oh, I'll come with you, then." </sentence><sentence id="1170">So we dressed up in morning coats, you know, that you have when you meet Head of State, as is rather peculiar situation in the middle of the war, you know. </sentence><sentence id="1171">This long tails and all that and high top hats, and went to Horthy and presented the message from the king. </sentence><sentence id="1172">And Horthy looked at it and he said, "Oh, this is terrible. </sentence><sentence id="1173">I can't believe that my compatriots are committing themselves those crimes, and I'm so unhappy about all this and that." </sentence><sentence id="1174">And he sent a message back to the king in Sweden, saying that he was going to do his best. </sentence><sentence id="1175">And he actually stopped deportations from -- it was too late for the ___,_but he stopped deportations from Budapest. </sentence><sentence id="1176">They had just came to the surroundings. </sentence><sentence id="1177">Several areas of Budapest had already been evacuated. </sentence><sentence id="1178">I was myself there and saw it, but when it came to Budapest itself, it stopped because of all this intervention. </sentence><sentence id="1179">So it's this peculiar situation when Raoul Wallenberg had then started off all this action to have people under our protection with passports living in these houses and all that, everything was organized. </sentence><sentence id="1180">And he said, "Well, I've done my job, and no more deportations will take place. </sentence><sentence id="1181">So I better prepare my trip back to Sweden." </sentence><sentence id="1182">This was in August, the end of August, I think. </sentence><sentence id="1183">The beginning of September, perhaps, when the new situation later on comes when after the revolution when the , the Hungarian Nazis take over. </sentence><sentence id="1184">Then, comes the real job, and it's -- you think in terms of nine months when Raoul Wallenberg was there, from July to January, and of those nine months, he used the first month just to organize things. </sentence><sentence id="1185">But the real rescue operations where he also went out to the railway stations and all that -- I was very often with him and all that and so on. </sentence><sentence id="1186">It was a concentrated work of three months where he saves all those people. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="1187">This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="1188">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="1189"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection </sentence></p><p><sentence id="1190"> 3 </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1191">Q: Let's talk about this period between July and October just a little bit. </sentence><sentence id="1192">When he came, did he have a formal mission that he announced to you, or was it very clear what he was supposed to do from some papers that you had received before? </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1193">A: Well, he had a clear mandate from the foreign office. </sentence><sentence id="1194">He had negotiated or had already started negotiating in a clever way with the foreign office, and got a mandate to operate quite independently, but under, of course, the cover of the embassy and subordinated, of course, to the ambassador. </sentence><sentence id="1195">And in the case of the ambassadors delegating me under my sort of command in a way, but we were sort of equal and good friends so that was no problem at all. </sentence><sentence id="1196">So the edict was quite clear that he could perform as he thought would be the most useful, most -- the best one to save as many people as possible. </sentence><sentence id="1197">That he used then unconventional methods and all that, that was hard -- I mean, you see, it was in a way very typical situation was this: That I was sitting there at the Oder (ph) Swedish Embassy and everybody was sort of respecting an embassy and all that and so on. </sentence><sentence id="1198">I was a diplomat; my boss was a diplomat, all that dramatic status. </sentence><sentence id="1199">Raoul Wallenberg was a businessman, but he was also given diplomatic status, no doubt about that. </sentence><sentence id="1200">So he had the same -- from the international law, from that viewpoint, he had the same status and the same protection as we had, but being more or less a freelance or having his own department and all that. </sentence><sentence id="1201">We closed our eyes very often when he did things which a diplomat never does. </sentence><sentence id="1202">Bribe people, like that, you know, to save people's lives or doing things out of the ordinary and so on. </sentence><sentence id="1203">And we thought that was a good way of organizing the work. </sentence><sentence id="1204">That he goes "Oh, look, here. </sentence><sentence id="1205">With the embassy we are not doing that," and so on. </sentence><sentence id="1206">And we don't know about anything illegal and so on and so on and so on. </sentence><sentence id="1207">There you come to a question, which I don't know if you would like me to talk about now. </sentence><sentence id="1208">And that is the relationship between Sweden and Germany. </sentence><sentence id="1209">How on earth, why did they accept this, the Germans? </sentence><sentence id="1210">That's a good question. </sentence><sentence id="1211">Shall we talk about that? </sentence><sentence id="1212">That is, of course, there you have a country or a city, in this case, completely under the command of the Germans, but having a puppet government. </sentence><sentence id="1213">The German and Hungarian government who is in charge whom they could handle as they -- I mean, they could decide anything, the Germans. </sentence><sentence id="1214">They could fire the government; they could do anything. </sentence><sentence id="1215">But they let this government act because for the image of Germany it was in a This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="1216">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="1217"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection 4 way good to show that we are -- haven't occupied Germany, Hungary to enslave them, to have them. </sentence><sentence id="1218">They are a free country, and they have their old government, and they have all that and so on. </sentence><sentence id="1219">That is their relationship between the Hungarians. </sentence><sentence id="1220">Now, but how could they accept then that the Hungarians went on and made agreements with Sweden about the Jewish people who they liked to extinguish, to exterminate? </sentence><sentence id="1221">And then comes this situation into the picture that Germany was very anxious, especially towards the end of the war, to have a breathing hole up in the north. </sentence><sentence id="1222">Have a neutral country there with whom they could negotiate. </sentence><sentence id="1223">They could have their spies there, of course, and all that. </sentence><sentence id="1224">That was -- all the people, both sides, were happy to have Switzerland and Sweden because they could meet and they could -- sort of a country which was not involved in the war. </sentence><sentence id="1225">And some authors, and I'm not quite sure that I share all this opinion entirely and so on, but the fact is that towards the end of the war the Germans tried, even first the underground in Germany tried, those people who were fighting against Hitler tried through our people in Sweden through the Wallenbergs -- that's the relatives of Raoul -- to get contact with the allies. </sentence><sentence id="1226">Not with the Soviets, but with the others, with the British and the Americans. </sentence><sentence id="1227">Tried to get contact with them through us to say this: That why couldn't we try to make a deal here now, and we will try to do something?

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1455">A: Well, the first people were those whom I had given these provisional passports or these certificates, that was the base, so to say. </sentence><sentence id="1456">Now, there were perhaps 20 people or whatever to start with, and then it increased because we had given them many more. </sentence><sentence id="1457">But then -- and they organized it. </sentence><sentence id="1458">They were very good organizers, those people. </sentence><sentence id="1459">They were heads of Swedish companies. </sentence><sentence id="1460">They had great experience in dealing with people and all that and so on. </sentence><sentence id="1461">So they knew how to organize an office. </sentence><sentence id="1462">So he had lots of offices, though. </sentence><sentence id="1463">One office, say, for administrating the houses. </sentence><sentence id="1464">One office for scrutinizing the applicants, the applications for passports and so on and so on. </sentence><sentence id="1465">And one This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="1466">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="1467"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection 8 part was for the provision of medicine and organizing the medical help to these houses, and one for providing with food stamps and all that and so on and so on and so on. </sentence><sentence id="1468">So towards the end of this operation, I think that he had about 400 people, Jewish volunteers who were all working. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2178">A: Well, you see, this also I think contributed to the suspicions, the Russians! </sentence><sentence id="2179">suspicions because he very proudly he told them the story about the future here now will be that I, Swedish diplomat and all that, I am going to stay on and I am going to reorganize this humanitarian action. </sentence><sentence id="2180">I'm going to see to it that the family will be reunited. </sentence><sentence id="2181">That the property is put back to the Jewish people, and all that and so on. </sentence><sentence id="2182">And some author has said that he was politically naive. </sentence><sentence id="2183">And my answer to that is weren't we all very naive, the whole western world? </sentence><sentence id="2184">I mean, we accepted the Soviets because they helped to defeat the Nazis. </sentence><sentence id="2185">And when I came home to Sweden, when I told the people that I'm completely convinced that the Soviets had arrested Raoul, that how could you say things like that about the Soviets, our great helper? </sentence><sentence id="2186">They have helped us to defeat the Nazis, the Nazi system and all that and so on. </sentence><sentence id="2187">And the whole western world said the same thing till 1948, at least, until Prague situation then. </sentence><sentence id="2188">So we all thought -- we thought ourselves as soon as the Soviets arrive, we will reestablish our embassy here. </sentence><sentence id="2189">We will continue our work. </sentence><sentence id="2190">Never happened. </sentence><sentence id="2191">They didn't want any foreigners to remain on the territory which they were going to occupy. </sentence><sentence id="2192">So all the embassies were taken away like that. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2234">A: Well, it was all certainly a combination of all this that he -- first, we had the protective passports. </sentence><sentence id="2235">The people lodged in our houses, that's one thing. </sentence><sentence id="2236">But once that was done, it was the question to try to save more people than that. </sentence><sentence id="2237">And also to find if by chance some people without a passport had been deported or were on the way to be deported, you see. </sentence><sentence id="2238">So that became a routine in a way to check on that when the trains were leaving for Auschwitz or the death marches later on, of course. </sentence><sentence id="2239">So that was complementary to this first more or less organized sanction by the government and all that; that was one thing. </sentence><sentence id="2240">The other thing was to try to -- I had hoped to help people who were on the way to be deported and then comes, of course, the big risky operation which Raoul Wallenberg didn't form himself, but indirectly through his presence. </sentence><sentence id="2241">You see, it's also interesting with Raoul Wallenberg which is very well described by Levi in the first book which appeared just after the war. </sentence><sentence id="2242">He says something like that Raoul Wallenberg became the observing eye, so to say, which -- the conscience. </sentence><sentence id="2243">He became kind of a something which the Nazis feared in a way that his mere presence stopped them from going still further in a way sometimes. </sentence><sentence id="2244">And an example of that is, of course, that when one of the collaborators, I don't think that Raoul Wallenberg was present himself, heard that the Hungarian officers were going to blow up the whole, so to say, international -- our houses in This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="2245">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="2246"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection 3 their desperation because they couldn't deport any people any longer because, you see, they were just being encircled by the Russians. </sentence><sentence id="2247">Then he took upon him to say in Raoul's words that Raoul Wallenberg is sending a message to you, General Schmitthuber (ph), who was the last remaining army general. </sentence><sentence id="2248">I mean, not SS, but the army general in Budapest.

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2317">A: Well, I don't know -- well, I heard his name many times now and so on. </sentence><sentence id="2318">And he was the Spanish sort of charge d'affaires, they called him. </sentence><sentence id="2319">He called himself an ambassador, I think. </sentence><sentence id="2320">Like Hungarian Count Pongras (ph), whom I knew very well, he called himself Ambassador of Portugal. </sentence><sentence id="2321">Of course, when those ambassadors left, they gave over everything to locally employed people, which they knew, so they took over. </sentence><sentence id="2322">And it's interesting to see how in the documents which also are produced in Levi's book when we made joint interventions for the government, they were signed by , my boss, by Lutz (ph), or Feller (ph) was my opposite, a young , Count Pongras (ph) and so on, Ambassador of Spain. </sentence><sentence id="2323">And so there were always a sort of a joint -- very often joint interventions from the neutral countries. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2331">Q: Can you explain what that means for people who don't know what that means when you say "a joint intervention"? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2333">A: Well, that we all go together. </sentence><sentence id="2334">I mean, that we go together, the four or three or four or five, the neutrals presented -- go together to the foreign office and present a paper signed by all of us that we protest against this action you have taken against whatever, our nationals or against people under our protection and so on. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2374">Q: Talk to me a little bit about neutrality and what that means and what you felt given all that you saw about your government's own neutrality. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2376">A: Well, you see, the neutrality is a concept which has been very much discussed, of course, especially now in Sweden in this completely new situation today. </sentence><sentence id="2377">But neutrality for us during the war was, of course, that we tried not to take sides, not to be in the middle. </sentence><sentence id="2378">A very egotistical sort of policy that you try to save your life, your own country. </sentence><sentence id="2379">That's perhaps quite natural in a way, and so on, but neutrality speaking of the time during the war, of course, if you are smart and you have adapted a little bit, changed it a little bit. </sentence><sentence id="2380">So I think that the Swedish government was very anxious towards the end of the war to be more pro-allied than they were just at the beginning of the war. </sentence><sentence id="2381">And that's no longer, I'm not -- no one should be astonished about that kind of a situation. </sentence><sentence id="2382">So from having had given in for the Germans in the beginning when we didn't know if they were going to invade us or not, it was permitting trains with soldiers through Sweden, German soldiers and all that, and delivering iron ore to them and so on. </sentence><sentence id="2383">At the time we diminished all this like that, so towards the end of the war we didn't give the Germans any favor whatever. </sentence><sentence id="2384">We were more favorable towards the allied countries and so on. </sentence><sentence id="2385">And I'm sure that that was also part of our -- well, the political, it was. </sentence><sentence id="2386">Of course, humanitarian. </sentence><sentence id="2387">Of course, this was help for the Jewish people, but I think it was well in line with our policy towards the end of the war that we show up. </sentence><sentence id="2388">Look here, what we have done for you. </sentence><sentence id="2389">We have helped the Jewish people, and we have been fighting against the Germans, the Nazis in Hungary, and all that. </sentence></p></dialogue>

" </sentence><sentence id="2425">Well, we'll see to it that they put a J in the passport." </sentence><sentence id="2426">And those people were stopped at the borders of Switzerland, the borders of Sweden, because the Swedish trade unions, the Swedish doctors, one special one person in the Swedish government was anti-Semitic. </sentence><sentence id="2427">They said we -- and the Jewish people themselves and that is terrible. </sentence><sentence id="2428">The Jewish people in Stockholm said, "Don't let any" -- quoting him now the whole time, as you understand, in his book. </sentence><sentence id="2429">They were saying according to his words that "For God's sake, don't let any Jewish people come into Sweden because there will be a Jewish problem in Sweden." </sentence><sentence id="2430">You see, that reflects the whole atmosphere in Europe or in the United States or wherever you are in the world. </sentence><sentence id="2431">I mean, in Israel, In Palestine, they know pretty well what's going on. </sentence><sentence id="2432">Six million people at Auschwitz and all that and so on. </sentence><sentence id="2433">And they had in Israel the problem to create the state. </sentence><sentence id="2434">To create the State of Israel, they wanted to be on good terms with the British, and the British were in the dilemma that they didn't want to have too many Jewish people coming to Palestine because there would be conflict with the Arabs. </sentence><sentence id="2435">This is policy the whole time, the whole time, see, which stopped the possibility of taking in more Jewish people at that time to Palestine. </sentence><sentence id="2436">So if you ask and I'm quite straightforward to you in this question, because | think that the whole world, the whole world is guilty in this situation. </sentence><sentence id="2437">And how then he describes then how we comes further in this situation. </sentence><sentence id="2438">This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="2439">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="2440"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection 7 When the war breaks out, Sweden was in a very great danger to be occupied by the Germans. </sentence><sentence id="2441">1942, when we reported that the gas chambers existed and when Roosevelt got the same report in America, there was great anti-Semitic feelings here, so there was not published at all anything from the government about these gas chambers. </sentence><sentence id="2442">Sweden, the same thing. </sentence><sentence id="2443">But if I talk about Sweden, I think we could have sort of brought out this to the public in, say, in 1943, when you could see that the war is not going to be won by the Germans, and after Stalingrad and all that and so on. </sentence><sentence id="2444">And as Koblik says in his book, he means that if Sweden, a neutral country, or Switzerland, a neutral country, would have published in big headlines what's going on, it would perhaps have given the Germans second thoughts. </sentence><sentence id="2445">That they would have not stopped, but slowed down this whole action. </sentence><sentence id="2446">And above all, he says in his book it would have given the Jewish people an information from neutral countries, where they must tell the truth, after all, about this and would perhaps have given the Jewish people a more feeling to resist. </sentence><sentence id="2447">You might take all this what I have told you now, I'm not saying that it's my opinion at all like that, but I think it's very interesting that an American author, an American historian puts forward all these arguments here against the whole world which did nothing to help. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2511">Q: Do you think that had Auschwitz been bombed, that these Hungarians would have been killed in Auschwitz? </sentence><sentence id="2512">I mean, what did you think about the argument about that? </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2541">Q: You, in an interview at Uppsala, commented on a question that a filmmaker had asked you that had one of you returned from Budapest, not just Raoul Wallenberg, what do you think would have been the feelings, the understandings of what everybody did? </sentence><sentence id="2542">I think the question has something to do with when one person is taken and other people who have also done many things came back, does that enlarge the reputation of Raoul Wallenberg, because he was the one who obviously suffered after the war in a way that the rest of you didn't. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2545">A: Well, I think that the mere fact that we all stood up behind Raoul Wallenberg, and even if we were not -- every person were not engaged 100 percent like Raoul Wallenberg in saving people like that, at least at the beginning we had so many other things to do, and we were working day and night, especially before he came, of course. </sentence><sentence id="2546">But after he came, for me, the main task was to keep this together. </sentence><sentence id="2547">I mean, it could have easily ended up in a big catastrophe if he made mistakes which would have, after all, frustrated the Germans that much that they would stopped everything, you see. </sentence><sentence id="2548">This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="2549">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="2550"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection 9 So there was a balance the whole time, and I think because that we had this big organization, because we had an embassy with a reputation of being correct and that and having the relations with Germany and all that, Raoul Wallenberg with all what he did and so on, he could never have acted on his own alone, never. </sentence><sentence id="2551">So even if he and every person didn't do the same job as he did, the mere fact that he was there, that the embassy was there, that was the whole base for his action, you see. </sentence><sentence id="2552">So we both helped each other in one way or another as much as we could. </sentence><sentence id="2553">So, I mean, did the question you asked was -- I don't. . . </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2563">Q: Well, I think what the filmmaker was asking was if all of you had been caught by the Russians, as you were, you then were sent back. </sentence><sentence id="2564">If all of you had been caught and not sent back, would everyone's reputation have been different? </sentence><sentence id="2565">Would there be this -- in other words, there is a way in which people understand the situation in Budapest as one hero, and that's clearly not how it was. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="2569">Because alone Raoul Wallenberg could not have possibly have done what he did, right? </sentence><sentence id="2570">So I think his question to you has to do with the reasons why the reputation is so much larger than other people's. </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2571">A: Ya. </sentence><sentence id="2572">Well, I think I understand what you mean. </sentence><sentence id="2573">And, of course, suppose that nobody had come back. </sentence><sentence id="2574">Of course, still Raoul Wallenberg would have got most of the credit. </sentence><sentence id="2575">Of course, he did the job more than we did, but I think that we would have been recognized also for being his supporters and the base for his action. </sentence><sentence id="2576">I think especially in the perspective perhaps not the first day after the discovery, but in a perspective now with all historians looking to this, I think they would have today to say that today we would still be there somewhere or killed or died. </sentence><sentence id="2577">Today, they would have analyzed the situation, and they would have come to this conclusion, as I told you. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2585">Q: Were you a balance for him, both as a person and as representing a more -- well, the Swedish Embassy because he was not trained as a diplomat? </sentence><sentence id="2586">He wasn't coming there to be a diplomat. </sentence><sentence id="2587">Was there a way in which you... </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2591">A: Ya, of course, that was part of my job to balance between -- of course, when he came first, the other staff, I mean, the other people in the embassy, for them it was a very strange situation. </sentence><sentence id="2592">Here's an outsider coming and he takes over and he acts on his own, and this is being an arms operation This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="2593">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="2594"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection 0 and what's going on here? </sentence><sentence id="2595">I remember when I came back from Stockholm in August, I'd been home with my wife and all that and came back with some more people, __--_and so on for helping, Asta Nielsen. </sentence><sentence id="2596">Wallenberg had already been in action then for a month when I came. </sentence><sentence id="2597">And the whole embassy building was filled with Jewish applicants in the garden and all over, and he was distributing passports to all of the people. </sentence><sentence id="2598">And the staff were upset, and I said, "Now, take it easy, take it easy. </sentence><sentence id="2599">I'll talk to Raoul about this." </sentence><sentence id="2600">And when he heard my arguments, he understood completely what I was aiming at; namely, that if we now established a big rescue operation in the embassy here along those lines you are thinking of, we will not have any possibility to act as an embassy any longer with our ordinary work, and we won't be recognized any longer as the Oder (ph) Swedish Embassy. </sentence><sentence id="2601">We will be a big rescue kind of station here, so, please, now, you have to organize this another way. </sentence><sentence id="2602">And he understood immediately what I was aiming at. </sentence><sentence id="2603">So he had these volunteer people and they established his office on the Pest side and so on. </sentence><sentence id="2604">So the whole situation calmed down. </sentence><sentence id="2605">And then after that, the whole staff completely understood the situation and especially when I continued my discussions with Raoul and said, "You have to stick to these criteria the whole time because we have to have vis-a-vis the Germans a correct bureaucracy for what we are doing. </sentence><sentence id="2606">And we can't give away protective passports to anyone like that, at least not now in the beginning when everything is comparatively calm here and we can work in all quiet," and all that and so on. </sentence><sentence id="2607">Which didn't prevent him, of course, towards the end when everything was falling into pieces and all the bombing and all that that he could distribute protective passes to anyone he wanted to help. </sentence><sentence id="2608">That was the next situation when you couldn't lose anything on doing that. </sentence><sentence id="2609">But the whole start, it was absolutely necessary to make that along as corrective lines as possible. </sentence><sentence id="2610">As correct as possible. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2631">Q: And he had no trouble understanding that there had to be. . . </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2633">A: Oh, no. </sentence><sentence id="2634">Oh, no. </sentence><sentence id="2635">Oh, no. </sentence><sentence id="2636">He understood it completely. </sentence><sentence id="2637">So, but that was a part of my diplomatic training, and he being a clever businessman making business and all that, you see, in his way of acting. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="2638">This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="2639">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="2640"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection 1 </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2641">Q: How did you understand his passion for wanting to come over to Budapest to save Jews? </sentence><sentence id="2642">Did he ever explain what -- it's not the most usual decision to make. </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2643">A: No, I understood it in a way. </sentence><sentence id="2644">I understood it because I knew from years before in Stockholm when we were both young and all that that he always stood up for young people who were badly treated by their comrades and all that. </sentence><sentence id="2645">And in the military service also, we were together there. </sentence><sentence id="2646">He always stood up for weaker people, and he also had this kind of enthusiasm for helping and ideas and inventiveness and all that. </sentence><sentence id="2647">So from that I understood in a way -- understood it, perhaps not 100 percent. </sentence><sentence id="2648">That I understand now much better when I'm reading -- I read the letters between him and his grandfather where you see how his character develops and how he comes here to the United States and he studies at Michigan University and how he wholeheartedly accepts the American way of life, the freedom, democracy and integrity of man and all that. </sentence><sentence id="2649">And with those impressions, he then comes to Hillefors where he meets the first Jewish refugees, and I'm absolutely convinced that when he saw this, that they were unheard of stories, that he said to himself, "I have to do something. </sentence><sentence id="2650">Absolutely, I can't be passive. </sentence><sentence id="2651">I have to do something for helping." </sentence><sentence id="2652">And then it so happened that he comes to Stockholm and works with a Jewish businessman there, and he gets the story from Budapest what's happening there and so on and so on. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2663">Q: When you helped Mr. Wall (ph) who came to see you that night, would you say that your -- not appreciation of the problem -- but your decision to help came from him coming to that door, and then you -- sort of the door would not close anymore in a certain way? </sentence><sentence id="2664">This was not a plan in your head that you were going to go out and save the Jews either? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2667">A: No, because it came that early, so I hadn't faced the situation really. </sentence><sentence id="2668">But he described it to me, of course, and the following days we saw it. </sentence><sentence id="2669">We saw how they were queuing up outside. </sentence><sentence id="2670">We saw that this is very serious. </sentence><sentence id="2671">Absolutely. </sentence><sentence id="2672">So that's no doubt how you get more and more involved in this, how it grows and all that. </sentence><sentence id="2673">And I was asked in Philadelphia when I was there in November, we discussed at the symposium or whatever what characterized a humanitarian. </sentence><sentence id="2674">That is really not an easy question to answer, you know. </sentence><sentence id="2675">So I could only exemplify it by telling the story about Raoul Wallenberg and saying that I think in Raoul Wallenberg's case, he was born humanitarian in a way, This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="2676">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="2677"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection 2 because he had these feelings for always helping in schools. </sentence><sentence id="2678">He helped the weaker children there who were terrorized by the stronger ones and all that, and it's also interesting that this one man who was with him -- his name now was Pleti (ph) or something -- who was with Raoul Wallenberg in the car when they were going to and Raoul disappeared. </sentence><sentence id="2679">And he said just as they were leaving "Oh, no, I can't follow you because I don't know where my parents are now. </sentence><sentence id="2680">I have to find them." </sentence><sentence id="2681">So he left the car and saved his life, of course, in doing that. </sentence><sentence id="2682">And he told the story that they met, they knew each other from the beginning from prior years in Switzerland where they were studying at the same school and this little Pleti (ph) was a small little boy, Jewish, weak, and how the older people, the stronger boys, they were terrorizing him. </sentence><sentence id="2683">And then Raoul Wallenberg went straight up to him and said, "Don't be afraid. </sentence><sentence id="2684">I'll protect you." </sentence><sentence id="2685">So he protected him against the others, you see. </sentence><sentence id="2686">So having heard all these stories, I came to the conclusion that he was born the humanitarian in a way, and I told the audience that. </sentence><sentence id="2687">And if you apply that on other people on myself and so on, I don't call me humanitarian. </sentence><sentence id="2688">But if you would call me humanitarian, I would say that I became that when I was facing the situation. </sentence><sentence id="2689">That I didn't have sort of -- I wasn't born that way, I don't think so. </sentence><sentence id="2690">I can't judge myself, but we all who have faced the situation like that, how could you have done nothing? </sentence><sentence id="2691">I mean, you had to, you had to. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2717">Q: When you went back -- you were kept for what, a month, two months by the Russians? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2719">A: Ya, we were kept, say, from the beginning of February till the beginning of April. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2721">Q: How were you treated? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2723">A: Well. </sentence><sentence id="2724">Correct. </sentence><sentence id="2725">And that was also the peculiar situation that the Soviets had two armies. </sentence><sentence id="2726">One army occupied Pest, that was the Marshal or General Maddenowsky (ph) and conquered Pest in one month before they took over, the Russians took over Buda. </sentence><sentence id="2727">In Buda was another general, his name was Turbuchon (ph), and they didn't see eye-to-eye; they were rivals. </sentence><sentence id="2728">So they never communicated between themselves, see. </sentence><sentence id="2729">And on the Buda side, we had no signs of being out helping Jewish people. </sentence><sentence id="2730">We had no houses with Swedish flags on and all that. </sentence><sentence id="2731">But Maddenowsky (ph) when he came to Budapest, every second house were hanging a Swedish flag, and people going around with Swedish passports. </sentence><sentence id="2732">So apparently he became first very, very frustrated and annoyed about all this This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="2733">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="2734"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection 3 and so on, and he said the Swedes must be very suspicious people and all that. </sentence><sentence id="2735">So he never communicated to Turbuchon (ph) and say, "Look, here, if you see any Swedes there, take them. </sentence><sentence id="2736">Arrest them." </sentence><sentence id="2737">Because -- and at our side there were no signs that we have done anything but being a Swedish Embassy. </sentence><sentence id="2738">I think that explains perhaps why they didn't bring us, take us to prison. </sentence><sentence id="2739">They arrested us, they interred us, and they had us under a guard for a couple of months. </sentence><sentence id="2740">But then they decided to send us home to Sweden contrary to what happened to Raoul. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2759">Q: And the response of the Swedish government in trying to get Raoul back? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2761">A: Ya. </sentence><sentence id="2762">Then, of course, they lost so much time when they thought the whole time that Raoul was under their protection. </sentence><sentence id="2763">And this is also an interesting story how coded documents which have not been found, you know, tells the story how he was arrested -- no, first of all, how the foreign office in Moscow according to instructions which all foreign offices in the world were following; namely, the Swedish government had before the war, before this happened in Hungary, given a list to the foreign office with all our names. </sentence><sentence id="2764">And saying if you meet these people, take them under your protection because they are Swedes, Swedish diplomats. </sentence><sentence id="2765">So immediately when the Soviet army found Raoul Wallenberg, according to the instructions they reported back to the foreign office. </sentence><sentence id="2766">And so they called for the Swedish Ambassador and they ticked off Raoul Wallenberg, he's safe. </sentence><sentence id="2767">He is? </sentence></p><p><sentence id="2768">Oh. </sentence><sentence id="2769">And then they were happy, but they had not heard a word about us, you see. </sentence><sentence id="2770">So in Sweden they started to wonder and asked, "What has happened to the others?" </sentence><sentence id="2771">They thought one day Raoul Wallenberg would come back, but the others? </sentence><sentence id="2772">Not till we came home then in April they understood that now something must have been happening here to Raoul, and they started to ask and so on and that. </sentence><sentence id="2773">Then it's interesting to ask the question how on earth could they report they had found Raoul Wallenberg and tell him that he's under good care and all that and the same time arrest him? </sentence><sentence id="2774">And that is the lack of communication then between the Soviet Foreign Office and the KGB. </sentence><sentence id="2775">Where the KGB had decided to arrest him, but they hadn't told the foreign office about that. </sentence><sentence id="2776">And they became furious, of course, when they heard that the foreign office had already told the Swedes that they had found Raoul Wallenberg because the following day, they arrested him. </sentence><sentence id="2777">We got the message on the 16th of January, and they arrested him on the 17th. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="2778">This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="2779">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="2780"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection 4 </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2781">Q: Did you think that the government of Sweden did enough to try and get Raoul Wallenberg back? </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2782">A: Not the first -- I would say, as I say in my book, the first two years are the lost years. </sentence><sentence id="2783">Well, of course, they should have acted in much forceful way. </sentence><sentence id="2784">They could have -- I mean, they had, after all, got the message that he was there, that they had found him, and they should have pushed that. </sentence><sentence id="2785">And they should have demonstrated that, should have used much harder language and so on, but they didn't. </sentence><sentence id="2786">They didn't. </sentence><sentence id="2787">And that is very, very sad story, and that is also part of foreign policy and all that. </sentence><sentence id="2788">The Soviets had won the war. </sentence><sentence id="2789">They were now going to dominate the whole Baltic Sea, and we had come closer to them as neighbors than before. </sentence><sentence id="2790">And one should not do anything to irritate them. </sentence></p></dialogue>
