<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="9">Q: And will you say something for me about your family background, what your father did, and your mother, and what you remember? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="11">A: My father was a banker, Mother was born in Nuremberg and was the first girl in Germany to take the Ivy tour which is the matriculation when that exam became open for girls. </sentence><sentence id="12">And she came to London after her marriage when she was very young. </sentence><sentence id="13">She was still 17. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="17">Q: What was the atmosphere in your home like in your early years? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="19">A: It was very... it was marvelous. </sentence><sentence id="20">We were in a home which Father's parents had owned previously. </sentence><sentence id="21">It was an enormous 20 room house with a billiard table in I remember, and yes we were happy there. </sentence><sentence id="22">It was in the north of London in Hampstead and Father moved from banking after the war to importing glass from Czechoslovakia. </sentence><sentence id="23">He joined a firm which imported glass. </sentence><sentence id="24">Yes, it was very as far as I can remember, a congenial atmosphere. </sentence><sentence id="25">Nearly 85 years ago now, so I don't know how much one genuinely remembers from one's childhood. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="33">Q: Now, you traveled to Germany when you were fairly young, did you not? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="35">A: Well, we traveled to Germany on holiday because Mother's relatives were still in Nuremberg. </sentence><sentence id="36">Mother's mother was still in Nuremberg and brothers and sisters were still over there. </sentence><sentence id="37">And of course when Hitler arrived on the scene, so the family that had been still in Germany started to come over to England and of course Mother and Father were able to help them not only to come over but to...to look after them. </sentence><sentence id="38">They all stayed with us to start with before making their separate ways in the world. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="43">Q: How would you describe.... were you aware of Hitler from the beginning of his rise to power, and did you know anything about him? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="45">A: I think we did, because when Hitler came to power in 1933 I was 24 and I... from my youth I think I've always been very politically conscious and always very left wing and I joined all kinds of things which would have been protesting against things like Hitler represented. </sentence><sentence id="46">Yes, I think we were very aware of it from early on, especially having gone through the first world war also where you had that... not anti-semitic feeling, but This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="47">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="48"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection certainly anti-German feeling in the country. </sentence><sentence id="49">Later on, one had not only the anti-semitic but the anti-German feeling together. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="57">Q: When you were... before you become a London stock broker, correct me if I'm wrong, you had traveled to Germany to study banking? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="59">A: Yes. </sentence><sentence id="60">Well, Father, as I said, had been a banker, and he thought that my career should be in banking, and that a little travel would do me good, and I was in a bank in France for a year and then six months with a bank in Hamburg and then six months for the bank in Berlin, and I would have gone on to do banking over here in the States were it not for the big crash occurring in "29, and so Father thought it was about time I came home, instead of him spending money on me, and some of my own. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="63">Q: Were you interested in banking? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="65">A: Yes, I think I was interested in banking and finance, yes. </sentence><sentence id="66">I dare say I would have accomodated myself to any other profession I'd be put in, but banking seemed to suit me quite well, yes. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="69">Q: What are your recollections from those months that you spent in Germany, political recollections? </sentence><sentence id="70">Did you witness persecution? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="73">A: When I was in Germany which would have been in 1930, I have no political recollections at all really. </sentence><sentence id="74">I mean I did banking, I made a lot of friends. </sentence><sentence id="75">I was good at fencing and I was both in Hamburg and in Berlin in the local fencing club, and met a lot of friends there-- and in fact I even fenced for Germany. </sentence><sentence id="76">At that time in 1930, there was a big match against Denmark, actually. </sentence><sentence id="77">I was on their team and I also owned a boat on the Wansee and spent the weekends boating. </sentence><sentence id="78">So at that time there was no -- I mean I wasn't interested in politics as such at that time and it was of course prior to... it was three years before Hitler even came on the scenes. </sentence><sentence id="79">So, no I wasn't in any way politically interested at that period. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="87">Q: When would you say that your political awareness was focused? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="89">A: Well, I mean in England I was always politically aware of politics, but local politics, British politics. </sentence><sentence id="90">And it was really only slowly, after 1933, when the implications of what was happening in Germany were known, that I became kind of interested in that. </sentence><sentence id="91">Because, as I say, I was always very interested in politics, and my friends were always very interested in politics, and we were all pretty well left-wing and we used to have meetings and discuss things so that really directly Hitler became a factor in European life. </sentence><sentence id="92">Yes, we were very interested in that, very. </sentence><sentence id="93">We became more so as he became more aggressive and took over more of Europe. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="99">Q: Can you describe your friendship with Martin Blake? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="101"> This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="102">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="103"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="104">A: Well, Martin Blake had always been a friend of mine. </sentence><sentence id="105">He was a master at Westminster School in London, and he and I shared lots of interests, but chiefly political interests. </sentence><sentence id="106">We also liked winter sports, and he took a party of children to winter sports every year in Switzerland, and I accompanied him which had the advantage of, for very little trouble or expense of energy, we got a free holiday. </sentence><sentence id="107">And, we were very close. </sentence><sentence id="108">We were always together and nearly always with other people who were discussing politics in some way or other reasonably left wing politics because there was a lot going on at that time as Hitler became more and more influential in Europe. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="114">Q: Do you remember any of your discussions? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="116">A: Well, not in detail really no. </sentence><sentence id="117">They were anti- Hitler, though. </sentence><sentence id="118">I can't remember the details. </sentence><sentence id="119">The politics in England at that time were so complicated. </sentence><sentence id="120">You had the people who were very frightened about the rise in Hitler, and yet one of the biggest left-wing movements was the Peace Pledge Union which in a way was contrary to what was going on in Europe. </sentence><sentence id="121">So, it was a very curious period, which was highlighted later on, of course, by the way Chamberlain and other people dealt with the rise of Hitler. </sentence><sentence id="122">They were also very schizophrenic about it. </sentence><sentence id="123">They didn't really know how... how to handle it. </sentence><sentence id="124">They still thought that... that this idea of peace could be maintained and... Very difficult to discuss the feeling in England at that time, because there were of course a lot of people like there were in every country, because of the rise, just because of the rise of left wing influence who were becoming more and more right wing. </sentence><sentence id="125">So, there were crowds of people in England who at that time were very right-wing, as epitomized by Oswald Mosely and his people, whom I actually knew quite well at that time. </sentence><sentence id="126">He was in our fencing club, Sir Oswald Mosely. </sentence><sentence id="127">He seemed quite inoffensive when he was fencing but he commanded quite a political clout later on. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="140">Q: Did you have particular ideas after the rise of Hitler of what should be done, what you wanted to do or that you felt you should do something in response? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="142">A: Well, I think in a democracy the individual always feels rather powerless, you know. </sentence><sentence id="143">You could feel it and talk about it and discuss it but except voting for a government there was nothing one could really do about it. </sentence><sentence id="144">My political awareness of Hitler really was only crystallized when I got to Prague and really saw for myself. </sentence><sentence id="145">One could see individually what was happening from time to time but there was little one could do about it. </sentence><sentence id="146">I mean, one is very powerless really, the individual in a democracy. </sentence><sentence id="147">And yes, we discussed it and we discussed the dangers of it, at the same time as this peace pledge movement was going on, so it was very curious situation at that time. </sentence><sentence id="148">But there were lots of people in England who weren't that much frightened by Hitler at the time, you know, who felt that the danger wasn't Hitler at all. </sentence><sentence id="149">The danger was Russia. </sentence><sentence id="150">And a great many people at that time I don't think ever thought that we would really be in conflict with Germany, because they thought that the politicians would be adept enough to see that the Germans fought Russia and not us. </sentence><sentence id="151">In the event, of course, they fought both, but not in the order we expected. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="162">Q: Now, Martin Blake, at this time, was working with refugees, was he not? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="164"> This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="165">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="166"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="167">A: No, no, Martin Blake really had nothing to do with refugees at all. </sentence><sentence id="168">Martin Blake knew a lot of people politically as well as of course his work for the school and he was very friendly with one lady Doreen Wariner who was the representative for the British Committee for Czechoslovakia and was given the job of going out to Prague and heading a movement to try and save those who had arrived in Czechoslovakia and were politically endangered since the Germans... when the Germans... if the Germans arrived. </sentence><sentence id="169">That was of course after the... Hitler marched in Sudetenland. </sentence><sentence id="170">And he rung me up one day just before he was setting off for Prague and said, "Look, I've cancelled my trip to winter sports so yours is cancelled too. </sentence><sentence id="171">I'm in a rush-- I can't tell you what's going on but meet me in Prague and I'll tell you," and that's how I got to Prague. </sentence><sentence id="172">I really didn't know what I was in for when I left. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="179">Q: When was that? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="181">A: When was that? </sentence><sentence id="182">That was Christmas "38, "39. </sentence><sentence id="183">I don't know the actual dates anymore. </sentence><sentence id="184">That was Christmas "38, "39. </sentence><sentence id="185">And I went out and met him, Blake, one evening, I knocked him up at the hotel Sroubek and he told me what was happening. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="191">Q: What did he tell you? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="193">A: Well he told me that there was all these people who had come into Czechoslovakia mostly after the Germans marched into Sudetenland, and that they were the Jews, they were the writers, they were those who were on Hitler's blacklist, and I think there were five separate groups, all of whom were endangered, and the job of Doreen Wariner and the British Committee was to try and rescue them and get them out to England. </sentence><sentence id="194">And at that time, of course, they were... a lot of the people were living with friends or relatives whom they knew in Czechoslovakia but a lot of them were already in camps. </sentence><sentence id="195">And I went "round the camps to see what was going on, together with actually two ladies who were given into my custody to look after whilst I did these tours, and one was Eleanor Rathbone, the member of parliament, and the other was the Reverend Rosalind Lee, who was the head of the Unitarian church. </sentence><sentence id="196">And we toured "round these camps in the dead of winter and snow. </sentence><sentence id="197">It was all rather cold and pathetic to see what was going on. </sentence><sentence id="198">And I suppose that's when my final... when more of my ideas about really what was going on in the continent were formed. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="205">Q: Were these camps all located near Prague? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="207">A: The ones we saw were located near Prague. </sentence><sentence id="208">I remember we went by car but whether we hired a taxi or whether we were moved around I really can't remember but they were, yes, in the vicinity of Prague. </sentence><sentence id="209">They were Nissenhunt (ph) camps, and very over-crowded, and very nasty places for continuous living. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="213">Q: Do you remember what you saw there, anything in particular stand out? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="215">A: What, at the camps? </sentence><sentence id="216">This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="217">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="218"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="223">Q: Yes. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="225">A: No, I can't remember except that on my way out to Prague I met a gentleman called Mr.Hails who said he was out there to do business. </sentence><sentence id="226">He was in the motorbike business... I think he was going to buy motorbikes, and I said that he couldn't really know what as going on in Europe if he thought he could buy motorbikes at this particular time in Czechoslovakia, and he said, "Well what are you doing?" </sentence><sentence id="227">and I said, "I really don't know at the moment, but this will be my address, and if you've got time come and visit me." </sentence><sentence id="228">And he visited me the second day I was there and I took him "round the camps. </sentence><sentence id="229">And in talking to him actually I found out that he was the Mr. Hails who instigated the Atlantic Blue Ribbon for the big boats, so he must have been in that kind of business. </sentence><sentence id="230">And going round the camps, he suddenly disappeared, and I went back to look for him. </sentence><sentence id="231">He was on one of the beds crying his eyes out. </sentence><sentence id="232">He was not knowing what he was going to be in for; he hadn't really expected that I would take him into that kind of situation. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="242">Q: So, would you say that most people weren't aware that these camps existed? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="244">A: I shouldn't think in England that anybody was aware of it all. </sentence><sentence id="245">I don't really know. </sentence><sentence id="246">I should think a lot of people in Prague must have known about it, yes, but whether it was known in England I don't know. </sentence><sentence id="247">I mean, we were... obviously everybody knew that the Germans marched into Sudetenland. </sentence><sentence id="248">Everybody in England said, you know, "This is Hitler's last ambition, and he's not going to do any more." </sentence><sentence id="249">When I was over there and found out that in marching into Sudetenland not only meant that they were marching into that part of Czechoslovakia which was chiefly inhabited by Germans, but all their defenses were in that line too, so from that moment on Czechoslovakia was pretty defenseless in any case. </sentence><sentence id="250">And of course Prague was full of Germans already. </sentence><sentence id="251">We were followed "round the whole time by the Germans. </sentence><sentence id="252">So one could see what was going on. </sentence><sentence id="253">I wrote home and said, "Look, this is happening," they either didn't want to or didn't believe that what we were actually seeing there meant what we were perfectly certain that it meant: that the Germans were on their way. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="264">Q: Where were you staying? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="266">A: I stayed at the Hotel Sroubek which we stayed at when we were over in Prague four or five years ago, when we were... I got the Freedom of Prague and met Havel and had lunch with Dubcek. </sentence><sentence id="267">It was all very exciting. </sentence><sentence id="268">We stayed at the same hotel that I had been at in 1939, right in central Prague. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="272">Q: And was Martin Blake staying with you there as well? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="274">A: No, he didn't. </sentence><sentence id="275">I think he was already dead -- </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="278">Q: No, at the time. </sentence><sentence id="279">In "38. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="282">A: He was in the Sroubek, yes. </sentence><sentence id="283">This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="284">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="285"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="290">Q: Now, will you describe to me how you became aware that you were going to be working on this issue of refugees in Prague and how you came to that decision? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="292">A: Well, as I said I went round the camps and I was told of the people whom the British Committee were trying to get out. </sentence><sentence id="293">And every day I met up with Doreen Warriner to discuss what was going on and we usually met at one of the big hotels, the Alcron, and discussed what was going on. </sentence><sentence id="294">Usually there were one or two men sitting not far away, and she had to say to me in German, "Until that gentleman disappears we better discuss the weather." </sentence><sentence id="295">You could be as rude as you'd like to the Germans as English people at that time, because we certainly didn't, and I mean, they certainly, I don't think, at that time ever thought they were going to be at war with England. </sentence><sentence id="296">And we of course hoped they wouldn't. </sentence><sentence id="297">And in conversation she said, "There are all these children, you know, who should be got out, but the British Committee just can't do anything about it at all. </sentence><sentence id="298">They're far too overworked with the business of trying to get out the political refugees, the writers and all those people endangered," and said to me, "Look, if anything can be done, perhaps you'd like to try and do it," and that's really how it started. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="306">Q: Were you aware at that point that England had made the decision to let in a certain number of children? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="308">A: No, I hadn't got a clue. </sentence><sentence id="309">I found a gentleman who came out from England, Trevor Chadwick, who said that if it was possible to bring children out, he'd given up his job as teaching in Swannage (ph), he'd run the office in Prague. </sentence><sentence id="310">And I said, "Well, I've not got a clue whether you can bring children into England, but stay there, and I'll go back to England and find out if anything can be done." </sentence><sentence id="311">And so, I mean, when I left Prague nobody had any idea that anything would really transpire. </sentence><sentence id="312">In the end it didn't prove very difficult. </sentence><sentence id="313">The Home Office said, "Under certain conditions," which they laid down, "you can bring in as many children as you like." </sentence><sentence id="314">So, the Home Office made no difficulties at all. </sentence><sentence id="315">Getting children into other countries was more difficult. </sentence><sentence id="316">We got a few children into Sweden whilst I was still in Prague, but later on I don't know if that movement continued. </sentence><sentence id="317">But we didn't bring out children to anywhere else except into England. </sentence><sentence id="318">We tried to get children into America but that wasn't possible at that time. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="330">Q: How did you try to do that? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="332">A: Well I have letters with a lot of the important people in America at that time and they all gave excuses -- no it's not fair to say excuses -- they gave reasons why they couldn't allow children to be brought into America at that time, which makes pretty sad reading when you read these letters at the present day. </sentence><sentence id="333">But still, that was... I mean bringing over 600 children was something I suppose, but many more could have been brought over had we... had we had more time as well, of course. </sentence><sentence id="334">I don't think a lot of people realized the urgency which we felt was there. </sentence><sentence id="335">Having been in Prague, one could almost feel that it was any time the Germans could march in. </sentence><sentence id="336">Back in London, of course, that urgency wasn't there at all. </sentence><sentence id="337">This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="338">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="339"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="348">Q: And you were in Prague for three weeks? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="350">A: I was in Prague about a fortnight. </sentence><sentence id="351">That was as long as my holiday allowed, and even then I was getting letters: Why did I want to spend time in Czechoslovakia when I should come back and make money for my firm on the stock exchange? </sentence><sentence id="352">There was no-- certainly not in the city-- there was no real feeling of either urgency or things should be done, you know. </sentence><sentence id="353">It was rather the, generally the Chamberlain attitude, you know: putting oneself out for a little country far away with which we had no genuine obligations. </sentence><sentence id="354">The major factor of Hitler versus Europe wasn't really in people's minds at that time, despite what Hitler had done up to then. </sentence><sentence id="355">And I think there were lots of people who would have obviously far preferred to maneuver Hitler to fight against Russia first than for us to take up the cudgels. </sentence><sentence id="356">After all, there had been plenty of time for England and France and the West to take up against Hitler, but before then there was plenty of occasions, as he had been nibbling away at various parts of Europe, that we could say, "Enough, and no further." </sentence><sentence id="357">I mean, by the time we took a stand on the Polish issue most of Europe had been already absorbed, or a lot of it anyway. </sentence><sentence id="358">So, I suppose historians will be writing about that for a long time: whether or not it could have been done differently. </sentence><sentence id="359">I don't think that people, certainly in England, realized the danger. </sentence><sentence id="360">They always thought they could negotiate with Hitler, that in a way he was a smaller menace than what was happening elsewhere in the world. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="372">Q: What was the date... do you remember the first... How did you get the first transport out of Czechoslovakia? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="374">A: Well, I was only then, when I came back to England I was working on the stock exchange, which luckily was a job which finished at 3:30 in the afternoon so I could go back and carry on trying to... to make arrangements for bringing children over. </sentence><sentence id="375">And as I say, the British Committee for Refugees from Czechoslovakia didn't give me... weren't able to give me either office space or any help whatsoever. </sentence><sentence id="376">And I just had note paper printed with their name on it, and put under, "Children's Section," worked from my private home up in Hampstead. </sentence><sentence id="377">And the Reverend Rosalind Lee whom I mentioned, sent me the first 100 pounds to pay for correspondence and everything and we got newspapers like Picture Post to write articles saying that we were looking for guarantors and that we were looking for homes where these children would be looked after until the end of war. </sentence><sentence id="378">And this started to trickle in, and, as we got people who would take children, so we sent them lists of children and even photos of children, and got them to choose children, and we then sent these out to Trevor Chadwick in Prague, who then arranged for the transport and the getting the children together, whilst we arranged for the people who were receiving the children to arrive at Liverpool Street Station to receive them. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="384">Q: Can we go back to Prague for just a little while and will you tell me about how you started the operation going, you came to the realization that the children needed help and then what did you do? </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="393">Q: When you were in Prague, the end of 1938 and the beginning of 1939 what did you do after you realized that the children needed help in escaping Europe? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="395">A: Once I told Doreen Warriner that if it were possible to do it I would try and do it and knowing that when I came back to England I would have to go back to work, the thing was to arrange the set up in Prague which could go into operation should I be successful when I got back to London. </sentence><sentence id="396">The person who was in charge -- I put in charge then was Trevor Chadwick but there was a Mr. Barozetti who was secretary to Doreen Warriner and he kind of ran the office in which Trevor Chadwick had space. </sentence><sentence id="397">The first job of course was as I said there were five committees in Prague at that time, was to get one central list. </sentence><sentence id="398">I mean you can't work from five lists and try to pick out who are the most important people or the most urgent cases. </sentence><sentence id="399">They were very diffident of course to give up their lists and having such a very short time in Prague I had to use kind of black mail tactics bringing up eventually I think it was the communist committee saying that I had one list on which I would work and the others could join if they wanted to, otherwise none of the lists would be considered. </sentence><sentence id="400">So within a couple of days we got a joint list and we discussed at that time how the office in Prague would have to work if I could be successful in London. </sentence><sentence id="401">So, it was all a bit hairy fairy and nebulous and it may happen and it may not. </sentence><sentence id="402">But there was an awful lot to be done in Prague if it did come off. </sentence><sentence id="403">They'd have to get all these children together. </sentence><sentence id="404">They'd have to get exit permits from the -- well, when I left Prague of course it wasn't the German authority because the Germans only arrived in March, but the time we really got going the Germans were in charge because they arrived in March 1939 and then of course they had to get exit permits from the Germans for these children to leave. </sentence><sentence id="405">They then had to arrive with to get a train and then they had to arrange for escorts to go with the train. </sentence><sentence id="406">They then had to find out from  http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection handicapped children, lame children, or blind children. </sentence><sentence id="407">For children and animals, the two most easiest things to get sympathy and raise money. </sentence><sentence id="408">So, it went slowly but it did work. </sentence><sentence id="409">We never got obviously as many guarantors as we wanted but we didn't have an awful lot of time to work on them and when we got the guarantee for a reasonable number of people we'd do the paper work and send it out to Prague and Prague then had all the job of arranging the trains and the escorts and the money and dealing with all the parents and getting the children onto the train. </sentence><sentence id="410">It was quite an operation in Prague. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="428">Q: When you're compiling lists of the children, did all five committees end up cooperating? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="430">A: Well, as I say, we told each individual committee eventually that we can't work with five lists, and before I left Prague they had agreed to coordinate and make one list and I think there was already one list before I left. </sentence><sentence id="431">So, the people in Prague did work on that one list. </sentence><sentence id="432">Obviously it wasn't only people who were on that list who came out. </sentence><sentence id="433">I mean there were people very likely who weren't on the list who heard of this operation going on and wanted to send their children away. </sentence><sentence id="434">I mean, how can you tell which are really the most urgent. </sentence><sentence id="435">I mean I suppose any Jewish child at that time was the most urgent politically of course, it was more difficult to decide and that one had to rely on the committees to do. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="442">Q: Were you present when the decisions were being made and were you involved in the decision making process? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="444">A: I was only concerned with the decision making process in the end product of where the children were going. </sentence><sentence id="445">I mean I was in England so I couldn't in any way influence who came. </sentence><sentence id="446">That was decided in Prague by Trevor Chadwick and with the aid of other people who were working there. </sentence><sentence id="447">I suppose the records which I've got here that 92 percent of the children were Jewish so that 8 percent were either on Hitler's blacklist or were communists or were writers or were children of that type who were in danger, and I think we've hardly made any of them who ever saw their parents or relatives again. </sentence><sentence id="448">Very few, very, very few. </sentence><sentence id="449">So, I suppose that in itself shows -- I mean whatever Jew that was brought out was the right Jew wasn't it. </sentence><sentence id="450">They were all in danger. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="458">Q: While you were in Prague, did you interview any parents, children? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="460">A: I was usually had people in my hotel room in Prague whilst I was shaving in the morning and usually followed until I put my head on the pillow at night. </sentence><sentence id="461">But there's very little I can remember about that now, but yes, certainly people the whole time were trying to influence you and leaving crates of pilsner beer behind. </sentence><sentence id="462">Well, you can imagine they tried to use what influence they could. </sentence><sentence id="463">I don't think we really, to be quite honest, took any notice of it. </sentence><sentence id="464">You couldn't. </sentence><sentence id="465">You have to be very tough in charitable work. </sentence><sentence id="466">Feel soft hearted in charitable work it becomes impossible. </sentence><sentence id="467">You really got to treat it as a business and we had these lists and we went by them. </sentence><sentence id="468">It's very likely that some people threw influence from knowing people or in some way or another got on the list ahead of other This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="469">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="470"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection 0 people who were just as deserving, but it was impossible. </sentence><sentence id="471">You can't sort it out like that. </sentence><sentence id="472">The same as in social services today isn't it. </sentence><sentence id="473">Lot's of people get on the lists that shouldn't. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="490">Q: When you returned to England you were working as a stockbroker by day and working out of your home at night? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="492">A: Yes. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="494">Q: Did you feel that you were living two lives? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="496">A: It's only difficult to ask me how I felt 50 odd years ago, but no I don't think so. </sentence><sentence id="497">I mean I just left one office and went home and did the other work. </sentence><sentence id="498">It didn't seem strange to me at the time. </sentence><sentence id="499">I had the police corp on me. </sentence><sentence id="500">I remember asking why I had that enormous correspondence with Czechoslovakia from a private house, but I think I was far too busy to entertain those kinds of thoughts at that time. </sentence><sentence id="501">It was two different lives. </sentence><sentence id="502">I mean people mostly on the stock exchange or a lot of people on the stock exchange I didn't talk to about what I was doing. </sentence><sentence id="503">I mean nearly all of them or most of them had completely different political views and opinions to mine so there was really no point in discussing it. </sentence><sentence id="504">They couldn't help in any way. </sentence><sentence id="505">At least some of them whom I was more friendly with very likely gave me some money for the running of the office, but I can't really remember those details any more. </sentence><sentence id="506">You see this story didn't exist for 50 years at all until suddenly the whole thing became public. </sentence><sentence id="507">That's why all these children are meeting themselves for the first time and some of them are making new friends. </sentence><sentence id="508">Some of them meeting people they didn't know existed and some of them even finding relatives. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="522">Q: So people just if they knew considered it perhaps a quirk or some particular interest but didn't inquire into it very extensively? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="524">A: Well, there was no common denominator where they could. </sentence><sentence id="525">150 children coming over and disbursed all over the place in England. </sentence><sentence id="526">Nearly all of them not finding their parents any more. </sentence><sentence id="527">Some of them kept in touch with each other but there was no organization or anything which in any way brought them together until five or six years ago when the story about the children broke. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="532">Q: Your colleagues didn't inquire into it either? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="534">A: I don't think when I left the city at 3:30 most of the people knew what I was doing in the evenings. </sentence><sentence id="535">I don't think so. </sentence><sentence id="536">There was certainly nobody I knew in the city who in any way helped me with what I was doing with regard to the children, nobody at all. </sentence><sentence id="537">It was two existences, separate, self contained. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="542">Q: Did your skills as a stockbroker aid you in doing this work? </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="594">Q: Will you describe your relationship with the Jewish community in Britain as they knew that you were doing this work? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="596">A: Thad no connection with the Jewish community in England because I was brought up as a Christian. </sentence><sentence id="597">I was baptized and I was brought up as a Christian. </sentence><sentence id="598">My parents were Jewish but completely non-religious and I think that we were treated as rather a curiosity. </sentence><sentence id="599">We didn't fit into either community. </sentence><sentence id="600">I mean the Jewish people thought we kind of opted out and at that time the Christian community must have thought -- I don't know I'm putting ideas into their minds now, it's rather a curious Christian with a German-Jewish name. </sentence><sentence id="601">So, we really didn't fit into anybody and I suppose it was this kind of schizophrenia which made up a lot of my character at that time. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="608">Q: Was the Jewish community aware that you were working to rescue mostly Jewish children from Czechoslovakia? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="610">A: I suppose they were but I was very much -- it was very much me and one or two people who were doing this. </sentence><sentence id="611">I wasn't assisted -- I mean the British committee for Refugees from Czechoslovakia I know a great number of those were yes, run by the Jewish people but I was quite separate to them, although I used their name until right to the end of the period in I think it was July, August when they said yes, you've been so successful now you better come and join us and they gave me a room at Bloomsbury House. </sentence><sentence id="612">But until then I got no money from them and no assistance from them. </sentence><sentence id="613">In the various committees throughout the countries for whom most of the guarantees for the children came, I would imagine a lot of those were run by Jewish people, yes. </sentence><sentence id="614">But I was only in touch with them by correspondence so I never really met them in that way. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="620">Q: Did the British Refugee Committee give you permission to use their name? </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="633">Q: Were there any repercussions? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="635">A: There was nothing they could do about it. </sentence><sentence id="636">The only repercussions were as I say after we had been doing that if you like illegally for nearly five months they then said this organization calling themselves the British Committee for Refugees from Czechoslovakia Children's Section is somebody who calls himself Nicky Winton calling himself honorary secretary we declare that they're now part of our organization and we became then a kind of accepted part of the group. </sentence><sentence id="637">Before it had been accepted in that way, in a kind of legal way, it had been accepted by everybody who knew no better. </sentence><sentence id="638">People out in the country getting a letter from the British Committee Children's Section had no reason to believe that it wasn't the British Committee as such. </sentence><sentence id="639">So, it worked quite good. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="645">Q: When you say we did you have any help writing these letters? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="647">A: Thad a lady, a girl, who came to help me who had been working for the Christian council and she came every evening and she did all the typing, who in fact later on married Martin Blake. </sentence><sentence id="648">I don't think we had anybody else. </sentence><sentence id="649">We were really just the two of us. </sentence><sentence id="650">It was really a question of keeping the flow of correspondence going and getting the information in from Prague, getting pictures of the children so that when somebody would take a child we could send them photos and ask them to pick a child, it's unfortunate commercial way of doing it. </sentence><sentence id="651">Perhaps that's where my stock exchange upbringing came in, but it speeded things up at the time and we felt that speed was of the essence. </sentence><sentence id="652">End of Tape 1 Tape 2 </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="660">Q: I had just asked Mr. Winton if he would like to say anything else about his relationship with members of the Jewish community in Britain and what their response was to this work you were doing? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="662">A: Although most of the children we brought out were Jewish I was only looking for families who looked after children. </sentence><sentence id="663">I wasn't concerned at all whether these children went to Jewish or non-Jewish families and this was largely due to the fact that I think that those people had been out in Prague and those people knew what I was doing, Martin Blake and Doreen Wariner and all that were very conscious of the urgency which one could see out there. </sentence><sentence id="664">There was no question when we were looking for a family to look after the children that a Jew should go to a Jew or a non-Jew should go -- it seemed to us at that time perhaps because I'm non-religious myself I don't know but it seemed to me completely secondary. </sentence><sentence id="665">The chief thing was to save the children. </sentence><sentence id="666">This was a not a view shared by everybody because there was one organization in England which was called The Barbican Mission and they took quite a number of children. </sentence><sentence id="667">I don't really know how many. </sentence><sentence id="668">I mean not an extraordinary number but quite a few children, and they were in This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="669">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="670"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection 3 existence I found out later, I had no idea at the time merely to convert good Jews into good Christians which even when I heard it didn't really alarm me very much because after all they were saved. </sentence><sentence id="671">And I thought the most important thing was to save the children rather than save the religion. </sentence><sentence id="672">But I did have a deputy in my office once of rabbis who came in and really told me something for the first time something that  http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection 4 now. </sentence><sentence id="673">She's 90. </sentence><sentence id="674">You see, a lot of them -- of the ones we know where the guarantor is still alive, they're very faithful in keeping in touch. </sentence><sentence id="675">Of course, one must admit that a lot of the children weren't happy where they were sent and there was an after care department in fact when the war started that Mother looked after which tried when children had problems to get the problems settled or get new guarantors for them. </sentence><sentence id="676">But I certainly don't assume and one cannot assume that every child we brought over went into a home and was well treated and was happy. </sentence><sentence id="677">A lot of them we know were. </sentence><sentence id="678">We certainly know some that were not, who were badly treated and used as servants. </sentence><sentence id="679">But quite frankly at the time I didn't think of it and it really doesn't concern me very greatly now. </sentence><sentence id="680">I mean you're bound to have some who weren't happy and all one can say is that they are still alive whereas most of the other children aren't. </sentence><sentence id="681">One knows that the children were targeted as much as the grownups because the last transport was due to leave at the beginning of September. </sentence><sentence id="682">It would have been our biggest. </sentence><sentence id="683">250 children, an enormous amount of work. </sentence><sentence id="684">Can you imagine getting 250 children from all over the place onto a station in Prague and then getting 250 guarantors to organize that they should all be at Liverpool Street Station at a certain time to receive the people whom they had taken. </sentence><sentence id="685">Then, of course, war broke out. </sentence><sentence id="686">The transport was cancelled and as far as we've heard from people who should not know a single one of those children survived. </sentence><sentence id="687">So, as I say, I think when you do charity work as I said before, you've got to be pretty tough and if you were concerned more with the fact of are they going to be happy than have they got somebody who will feed and clothe them, you wouldn't bring over nearly as many. </sentence><sentence id="688">I mean the whole operation would really be different. </sentence><sentence id="689">We tried to and all the people who all these committees I talked to around the country they told us that they would not send us any person who would take a child unless they them so to a very great extent they were , but it doesn't mean to say that some don't  http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection 5 </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="724">A: All of them, all of them. </sentence><sentence id="725">Yes, I was at Liverpool Street Station when every transport arrived which was near to organized chaos as you'll ever get. </sentence><sentence id="726">And that in the name went well. </sentence><sentence id="727">One always has stories of those that got left behind on the platform because there was nobody to pick them up, but they were all looked after eventually. </sentence><sentence id="728">And again, the only trauma that we ever had I'm afraid was with the orthodox Jews. </sentence><sentence id="729">One of the transports arrived on a Saturday and they wouldn't sign for the children and they wouldn't carry their baggage and you can imagine what we felt like. </sentence><sentence id="730">You know, when it was something that seemed to us so unimportant, immaterial, insignificant, but you couldn't let a child go until you had some kind of paperwork to say somebody had got them, and there they were taking the child and no we can't sign it's Saturday. </sentence><sentence id="731">So, I led Mother onto them then and she usually dealt with the situation. </sentence></p></dialogue>
