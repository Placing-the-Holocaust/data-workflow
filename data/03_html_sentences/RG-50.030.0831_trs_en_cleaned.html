class="Question"><p><sentence id="2">Q: I am Leslie Swift, speaking on behalf of the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum, on September 20", in New York, and I am speaking to Benni Korzen. </sentence><sentence id="3">And I would just like to start by asking what can you remember -- I know you were very young at the time that all of this happened. </sentence><sentence id="4">Can you tell me a little bit, if anything, that you remember from before the war? </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="5">A: Sure. </sentence><sentence id="6">I was five, five and a half when, as a result of a very chao -- chaotic and unplanned-for rescue operation, where people got together who had never been involved in saving anybody, decided to get together, save their Jewish neighbors. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="7">And so at -- at five and a half years, oh you know, I -- you're old enough to know what's going on, and I remember everything that I -- the highlights. </sentence><sentence id="8">But let me just go back and -- and also just explain that I was born in -- in Denmark, and from ninet -- from April -- Denmark was occupied by Germany, April of 1940, and for three years, a little more than three years, for reasons that anybody whose -- knows about history, the Germans pretty much left the population, including the Jewish population of Denmark, sort of alone. </sentence><sentence id="9">One reason was that the German war machine, you know, took advantage of the fact that in Denmark there was a huge production of butter and bacon and all ho -- and stuff like that. </sentence><sentence id="10">So it made sense not to cause any trouble there. </sentence><sentence id="11">Then, something happened in August and September of  ontectnetbnancedjushetnney for father Hlonmalberabouttfiseetecion Interview with Benni Korzen : September 18, 2015 deg43, as a result of which things changed. </sentence><sentence id="12">And essentially, orders came from Berlin to round up and arrest all -- and, you know, remove all of the dangerous Jews, and bring them down to concentration camps. </sentence><sentence id="13">Anyway, the -- what -- what happened to me was, my parents, in those chaotic days, which were in October of 1943, not knowing exactly what would happen, they decided to place me with a non-Jewish family, a colleague of my father, they were both lawyers, and they fer -- they thought that would be the safer thing to do. </sentence><sentence id="14">And as it turned out, it -- you know, it -- it worked out. </sentence><sentence id="15">I was there, and I stayed there for six to seven weeks, and then one night somebody came and picked me up and took me acor -- you know, during the middle of the night, and I ended up on a boat, and was sailed across to Sweden, where my father had been nervously waiting for a few days. </sentence><sentence id="16">And we then ended up in Stockholm, and stayed there until May, 1945, when we then went back to Denmark. </sentence><sentence id="17">There are some details that -- that -- along the way that I think are important to nat -- to -- to know. </sentence><sentence id="18">What happened between 19 -- April "40, and August, or so, 1943, was this relative calm. </sentence><sentence id="19">Then, the -- basically Eichmann decided, and the order came from his office to, you know, not -- no longer, you know, leave the Jews alone. </sentence><sentence id="20">What happened then factually, was that a low ranking -- I think he was a trade attache at the German embassy in Copenhagen, saw a telefax come in that wi-without any sp -- you know, that -- that gave him the information  ontectnetbnancedjushetnney for father Hlonmalberabouttfiseetecion Interview with Benni Korzen deg September 18, 2015 that there was a -- a Gestapo order now, to round up the Jews. </sentence><sentence id="21">He decided, without telling anybody, to tell a Danish friend, who -- whom he knew was -- wa-was, you know, a person who -- who would take that information. </sentence><sentence id="22">And that person took it to a high ranking politician, who went to the rabbi, and said, listen, this is about to happen. </sentence><sentence id="23">And the rabbi -- and the rabbi said, I don't believe that. </sentence><sentence id="24">And there -- th-the reason why he didn't believe that, was that the king, King Christian the tenth, had, from the time Denmark was occupied, given out many signals that all added up to, nobody touches anybody, because -- as long as I'm the king. </sentence><sentence id="25">And -- and he would sort of demonstrate his attitude by when he took his morning ride, horse ride, through the streets of Copenhagen, whenever he was then saluted by German soldiers, he would simply turn his head away, ignoring them. </sentence><sentence id="26">And so, for three years -- three and a half years, everybody felt that with the king in charge, nothing bad would happen. </sentence><sentence id="27">And that led to the rabbi's reaction. </sentence><sentence id="28">However, wi -- faced with the very sh -- harsh information, he then -- the rabbi then changed his mind, and at a certain sermon -- evening in the synagogue in Copenhagen, word came out and spread like -- like i-i-instantly. </sentence><sentence id="29">The Jewish population at that time was a little under 8,000, and 90 percent or so, lived in Copenhagen. </sentence><sentence id="30">So it was a very easy way to -- through -- not through anything, other than word of mouth, for everybody to be reached. </sentence><sentence id="31">And that's -- that's when this come -- sort of chaotic and spontaneous --  https://collections.ushmm.org

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="171">A: No, I-- I - that may have been part of -- of the thing, but I think more to the point was that the producer of the CBS documentary, you know, had a personal interest. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="172">He thought this was a very important story to show his viewers, and it -- it became -- it was part of what was then the Sunday morning -- CBS had Sunday morning -- this before cable and anything. </sentence><sentence id="173">And so the public affairs-type service that was given mostly by CBS -- and NBC, and AB -- ABC and NBC did not do the same thing. </sentence><sentence id="174">So they had a whole department of -- of people on fi-- on 11", and 57" Street, in the production office. </sentence><sentence id="175">And -- and they did whatever they thought was important. </sentence><sentence id="176">And  ontactrefieannedjustanmiang er hither btemelortabnattfiexaliaton Interview with Benni Korzen 8 September 18, 2015 so, they told this story because they wanted th-the American -- the American viewers to see it. </sentence><sentence id="177">And it was broadcast twice, because it did make -- it was the first time a--a TV program had done this. </sentence><sentence id="178">Books had been written that -- before, and many ca-came afterwards, dealing with the same subject, so -- </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="179">Q: And do you -- do you know any other people who were rescued? </sentence><sentence id="180">I mean, is there any kind of community that you maintain because of, sort of that shared experience, or you're just an American now, or -- </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="181">A: A few, but bi-- because I have a very large family; my father is one of seven, my mother one of four, it was mo -- it was more [phone ringing] I'm sorry about this -- it was more -- </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="182">Q: Oh, that's okay.

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="210">A: [have a very clear memory of spending something like an hour on a fast moving boat, because what also happened was in October -- in November of 1943, pretty much all the Jews had been crossed -- ha-had crossed to Sweden, and so those -- th- the transports then took care of -- had people such as -- on the boat it wa -- it was a-- an RAF pilot who had parachuted over Denmark, and he had to get -- be gotten out. </sentence><sentence id="211">The Royal Air Force, you know, the British air force. </sentence><sentence id="212">And there were some other people. </sentence><sentence id="213">So, later on, while I was still six or seven, and we talked about th-the -- the  https://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection Interview with Benni Korzen " September 18, 2015 crossing, I -- I wi-- my father said something, and I said, well, it was me and the other saboteurs that -- that crossed th-the water. </sentence><sentence id="214">I -- and because it was sort of a--a very -- it was the first time I'd bid -- bid -- been on a -- on a boat of that type. </sentence><sentence id="215">It may have been the first time I'd e-e -- been on a boat, ever. </sentence><sentence id="216">You know, as a five year -- and a half year old boy, I was very excited about how it worked, and -- and since, at that time, unlike before, during the really chaotic days in -- in -- in October, where s- sometimes young children were a -- you know, given sleeping pills, or whatever, to make sure that they would not make noise, this was different. </sentence><sentence id="217">And I guess th-the -- Mr. Kerr(ph) took a chance. </sentence><sentence id="218">I guess he talked to me, and the way I responded made him believe that it was not necessary to -- to, you know, give me an injection to -- for -- for me to keep quiet. </sentence><sentence id="219">So, by the time we arrived in -- near Helsingborg in Sweden, which is across from the shortest distance from Denmark, I've -- as we moved into the harbor, along the -- the side, I-- I saw my father from the boat, and he was there with -- I think with a policeman, nervously pacing back and forth. </sentence><sentence id="220">So that's what I do remember. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="233">Q: And -- and do you remember getting off the boat, and then seeing your father and being reunited, or -- </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="234">A: Well, th-the mi -- the image I remember is, as we moved into -- towards, you know, like maybe 25 yards before the boat actually moored. </sentence><sentence id="235">And then what  ontectnetbnancedjushetnney for father Hlonmalberabouttfiseetecion Interview with Benni Korzen 6 September 18, 2015 happened, I don't remember, but obviously what -- what did happen was that we took a train, my father and I, to Stockholm, where we reunited with my mother. </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="236">Q: Right. </sentence><sentence id="237">I-- I--1--TI just asked that question because I'm the mother of a couple of six year old boys, and I can't imagine, you know, being that person who was waiting for your child to arrive, and -- </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="238">A: Yeah. </sentence><sentence id="239">And one reason why, during the interview where I discover -- where everybody discovered that the boat had -- actually had me on board, what actually happened was that the man who walked in with a severe limp, because he'd been injured during the war, where his fellow -- Mr. Kerr(ph) was almost killed, when he was introduced to me, and remember the last name, which is somewhat unusual, there -- the -- the reason why he remembered that was that my father had, as a gift, made -- given him a silver cigarette -- he was a smoker -- and had engraved in it, a thank you note from him, last name being Korzen. </sentence><sentence id="240">So, the name had sort of se -- was a name that this guy -- </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="241">Q: Remembered. </sentence></p></dialogue>

</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="252">A: What happened then, where basically people put themselves at -- at risk, and -- and many died, is an example that sort of stands as a, you know, role model for human behavior. </sentence><sentence id="253">Now, what we're witnessing these days, having to do with refugees, and -- and immigration, and people trying to escape alive from either war, or related horrible -- horrible to human situation, i-i-is -- is the opposite. </sentence><sentence id="254">And it would be very nice if this example, which is not really that known, could be, let's say, elevated a-as the role model to -- for everybody to -- to -- to imitate. </sentence><sentence id="255">How that is to be done, remains to be seen. </sentence><sentence id="256">Obviously, it -- it would take -- it would take a -- an attitude that is the total opposite of what's happening right now. </sentence><sentence id="257">This is 19 -- this is 2015, where, as we witness the debate about who we are, and what we should do, and what we should allow, the -- the -- the -- as I see it, the idiocy of doing the opposite of what this country is all based on. </sentence><sentence id="258">This country is based on having people come here, and then start a life that ends up making a country as good as it can be, because of the people. </sentence><sentence id="259">So there -- so therefore the -- whenever the opposite is being advocated, that to me sounds like it's based on idiocy, it's based on ignorance, and anything we can do to counteract that, w-we -- we all have, I think, a responsibility to do. </sentence><sentence id="260"> ontactrefieannedjustanmiang er hither btemelortabnattfiexaliaton Interview with Benni Korzen 0 September 18, 2015 </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="261">Q: Thank you. </sentence><sentence id="262">Okay, can we cut for a minute, and let's -- [break] Can you tell mea little bit about what you remember from life before the Holocaust, you know, did -- was your family religious?
