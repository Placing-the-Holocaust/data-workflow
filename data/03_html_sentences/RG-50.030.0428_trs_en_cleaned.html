<body><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1">Q: ... get you to state your name and where you were born . </sentence><sentence id="2"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection enlisted in the army in September of 1942 and was discharged in the summer, I think it was in August of 1946. </sentence><sentence id="3">So I spent four years in the army. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="8">Q: If you can, talk a little bit about before the war actually interrupted your studies, what were you hearing about what was going on in Europe and how was it a part of your consciousness? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="10">A: Well I can actually remember the day that war was declared in September of 1939. </sentence><sentence id="11">We were still in the country, the family was just able, my father was just able to send the family away to the country so the kids shouldn't have to put up with the city and I can actually remember the, the war starting. </sentence><sentence id="12">At that time I was 16 years old, so that there was a consciousness of a teenager. </sentence><sentence id="13">As with most of the people here at that time, as I recall it, it was a distant thing, we knew the war was going on, I mean, you, we heard about the bombings, we knew the war was going on, we knew that the refugees were coming here or starting to come here, but very frankly knew very little about the nuances of it, we knew very little about the ships that were turned away, the one that went to Havana and was turned away. </sentence><sentence id="14">This came later. </sentence><sentence id="15">If I speak of it now, it's because of something that I'd read about, but at the time it was a war that was in Europe, you know, the war's in Europe again and I guess, particularly at 16 and being involved in track and girls and things like that, I really thought very little about the war. </sentence><sentence id="16">We followed it, you couldn't help but follow it, it was in the headlines all the time. </sentence><sentence id="17">So we knew about the Magino(ph) line, we knew about the problems of the bombings of England and so on and until America entered the war, for us it was happening in another place. </sentence><sentence id="18">We were not, at the time, as knowledgeable as we are now about what was happening in the concentration camps and with the Jews. </sentence><sentence id="19">We knew of course, about Kristallnacht, we knew about Hitler. </sentence><sentence id="20">In fact I remember as a child, listening to Hitler, I remember that they broadcast here, in the United States, they broadcast some of the speeches and I remember, whether it was from Nuremberg or some other place, the absolute electricity of this man when he spoke and This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="21">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="22"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection I must say I hear the patterns with some of the people we have around the United States now, you can actually hear the patterns, you can hear if you've studied the patterns and the things they were said, without getting into the politics of the United States, you could begin to hear how he enthralled the people. </sentence><sentence id="23">Later on I was to see Nuremberg, later on I was to see the stadium, later on I was to see the films of all of these, these rallies, but we actually remember them and I can remember to this day, sitting in the little foyer that we had in an apartment in the Bronx and listening to this man. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="40">Q: Any other memories about that, perhaps that your father might have had or your mother? </sentence><sentence id="41">Your father might have still had family in Russia or any concern there might have been in the family for Jews in general or specific people that you knew? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="44">A: Well I think, without being religious Jews, we all, always did have and still do have a feeling of being Jewish. </sentence><sentence id="45">My father did not have family there. </sentence><sentence id="46">Yeah. </sentence><sentence id="47">So that we have always felt a very deep feeling of Judaism without being religious Jews. </sentence><sentence id="48">My father did speak of other pogroms. </sentence><sentence id="49">He was brought up in area where the Cossacks were very, very active and her remembers the raids in the little town of Puniaman(ph). </sentence><sentence id="50">I found out much later in life that I was one thirty-second Cossack, which was something that destroyed my brother when he heard it. </sentence><sentence id="51">We don't know where the great, great, great, great grandfather was the rapist or whatever it may have been, but we were one thirty- second Cossack. </sentence><sentence id="52">In terms of Europe, from 1933 say, until the war began and I was much more involved certainly, in listening, we really had very, as I recall, very little discussion about it. </sentence><sentence id="53">And that may have been very normal in the family, I just don't remember very much. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="64">Q: You enlisted, why did you, what were your reasons? </sentence><sentence id="65">Do you remember speaking to your family about it? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="68">A: Oh yeah. </sentence><sentence id="69">I, as a matter of fact I enlisted because, there was a war, they were beginning to draft people, my father had spent, I guess a year and a half or so in World War | as an infantryman. </sentence><sentence id="70">He This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="71">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="72"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection was wounded three times. </sentence><sentence id="73">The third time he was wounded they wanted to take his leg off because of gangrene. </sentence><sentence id="74">And that's an interesting story in that he then refused to sign the paper. </sentence><sentence id="75">And he wouldn't sign the paper and the gangrene receded. </sentence><sentence id="76">He said, "I came into this world with two legs, I'm going out with two legs." </sentence><sentence id="77">The gangrene receded. </sentence><sentence id="78">My father, from 1918, never went to a doctor, until he was 83 years old and hurt himself working in the dress business, a bolt of cloth had fallen on his wrist and I made him go to the doctor and the doctor said, "Well Mr. London, when was the last time you visited a doctor?" </sentence><sentence id="79">He said,"1918." </sentence><sentence id="80">And the doctor said, "Well, you're none the worse for it." </sentence><sentence id="81">My father said to me, "Don't ever get in the infantry. </sentence><sentence id="82">Do anything to get out of the infantry." </sentence><sentence id="83">And he had gone through three wounds and the trenches and of course, as every soldier he only told funny stories about how his mother sent potato pancakes overseas, you know and they arrived like rocks, but he never told about the terror and the horror of it, but he did communicate to me that it was pretty awful. </sentence><sentence id="84">And so I enlisted in, I actually enlisted in the enlisted reserve in May of "43 and was in the signal corps, I enlisted in the signal corps. </sentence><sentence id="85">And that probably, that and also getting pneumonia when my unit went overseas to go to D-Day, saved my life, I was in the hospital with pneumonia, so. </sentence><sentence id="86">But that was the basic reason I enlisted was I knew I would be drafted, but I thought I might just as well enlist and get some kind of a background and that signal corps background in fact, was the thing that created a career for me later on. </sentence><sentence id="87">So I enlisted and I went to, into the army where several things happened. </sentence><sentence id="88">One, to make me understand more about anti-Semitism, because in the Bronx particularly and I left the Bronx at 17 and pretty much at 19 I enlisted. </sentence><sentence id="89">In the Bronx you got very little of it, the Bronx was very heavily Jewish. </sentence><sentence id="90">I was now coming into the United States army, a democracy of sorts, or fighting for a democracy, where I began to come into anti-Semitism in both it's subtle and it's overt forms. </sentence><sentence id="91">It was obvious if you were going to be in the army you were going to get it. </sentence><sentence id="92">I mean the anti-Semitic jokes that suddenly started to be told around me while This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="93">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="94"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection someone turned and says, "Well, I don't mean you, I don't consider you Jewish," when after all, I am Jewish, is one thing. </sentence><sentence id="95">The second thing was that I, after two years, went to OCS. </sentence><sentence id="96">I had gone all the way from... </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="128">Q: What's OCS? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="130">A: Officer Candidate School. </sentence><sentence id="131">I had gone from private to PFC and then they busted me back to private because they didn't have enough room for a PFC you see and I decided I was going nowhere after two years. </sentence><sentence id="132">Luckily I was teaching in school, I was teaching at officer, at officer school as a private and a PFC, I was teaching colonels and generals and like an idiot I kept volunteering to go overseas with them. </sentence><sentence id="133">I wanted to go to New Guinea, I wanted to go to Europe and nobody would let me go, I was one of eight people who had a top secret clearance with the United States army, teaching this course, so nobody would let me go. </sentence><sentence id="134">I finally decided the only way to get out of this would be to go into Officer Candidate School. </sentence><sentence id="135">So I applied for Officer Candidate School and again , in speaking of the, the anti-Semitism in the army, I was in a company, I was first sergeant in a company of 250 officer candidates. </sentence><sentence id="136">There were 13 Jews and two blacks and I, as first sergeant, was allowed to pick my roommate. </sentence><sentence id="137">You see, the barracks were made up and if you've seen barracks, they were made up of 60 beds, double decker and one squad room. </sentence><sentence id="138">The squad room was where there were two beds and the first sergeant and one other non-commissioned officer would be in the squad room, so you had a private room. </sentence><sentence id="139">And so I had to become very friendly with a man from Washington D. C. named Bob MacNeil(ph), who happened to be one of the two blacks and having been brought up on the Bronx, I mean I was on a track team with all kinds of people, it made no difference to me and he was the only guy who seemed to understand inner city thinking and was getting the same kind of battering from the others that I was getting, so in front of a company of 250 men, the man was Lieutenant Coyne(ph), Lieutenant Coyne(ph) said, "Mr. London," I said, "Yes, This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="140">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="141"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection sir." </sentence><sentence id="142">He said, "As first sergeant you can choose anyone you like to spend the next three months in the squad room with you" and I said, "Mr. MacNeil(ph) sir," so in front of 250 men, I picked one of the two blacks, in 1943 or "44. </sentence><sentence id="143">This was pretty much unheard of. </sentence><sentence id="144">Two things happened, several things happened. </sentence><sentence id="145">Number one, the day before graduation, 12 of the 13 Jews were washed out of school, I always say, quite by accident, 12 of the 13 Jews were washed out and one of the two blacks. </sentence><sentence id="146">The only two people left of that entire group starting, were Bob MacNeil(ph) and me. </sentence><sentence id="147">At the dance, at the graduation dance, Cheryl, who is my wife of 50 years now, as you know and I knew then, I met her when she was 17 and was still in college, came to Fort Monmouth(ph) to attend the dance and Bob had a friend, a woman named Lua(ph), attend the dance and they had dance cards in those days, you actually had a dance card so that you signed up for the dance and I signed up for a dance with Lua(ph) and she was black also and I, I went on the dance floor with her when our turn came and that was fine and then came the time for Bob to dance with Cheryl and as she got on the floor with him, the floor emptied and all the colonels sitting up on the balcony looked like they were getting nauseous and they were leaning over and Bob said, "Do you want to stop dancing?" </sentence><sentence id="148">You got to remember, this is in the 40's and she said, "No." </sentence><sentence id="149">And they danced. </sentence><sentence id="150">Nothing ever happened, I was then assigned and then came an interesting thing. </sentence><sentence id="151">For two years in the army, I was assigned to black troops. </sentence><sentence id="152">I went down to the south and I trained with black troops, I went overseas with 4000 black troops. </sentence><sentence id="153">I went to a black replacement depot. </sentence><sentence id="154">I was then shipped to a replacement company, picking up wire behind Mauclauck's(ph) third army, the 258 signal light construction company, which is a black company. </sentence><sentence id="155">I said to a black friend of mine, "I have a feeling that after that incident at, in OCS, they put N on my service record for Negro." </sentence><sentence id="156">She said, "Maybe they put nigger lover on your service record, NL." </sentence><sentence id="157">And that was, but it turned out to be one of the great, great army experiences. </sentence><sentence id="158">I mean, if you had to have a great army experience, this was it. </sentence><sentence id="159">So This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="160">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="161"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection all of this comes as a background of meeting middle America in all of this and being much more aware of how our own people felt about Jews, about blacks. </sentence><sentence id="162">I mean, being so isolated in the Bronx, I guess I, it was another opening experience. </sentence><sentence id="163">Now, then when I went to Europe and I was there about the time of Nuremberg, I did not see combat by the way, I was very lucky on that, for four years in the army, never to have seen combat was very lucky and again I thank my father for having been in the signal corps and taking, oh there was one funny thing by the way, which may or may not have anything to do with this but when I graduated from Officer Candidate School as a second lieutenant, I was sent back to the school again as a student, where I had written the examinations and I had taught for several years, which is a typical army thing. </sentence><sentence id="164">I was now a lieutenant taking a course with examinations I had written. </sentence><sentence id="165">I did very well. </sentence><sentence id="166">In fact on one I think I got one question wrong once because I, I sloughed. </sentence><sentence id="167">When I went to Europe with the occupation forces then, I went through Belgium and then on 40 and eight trains out to, to Graffenau(ph) in  http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection Europe with me in Salzburg, where I was station manager of a radio station, KOFA on the American Forces Network and then went to Berlin with her as Program Manager of American Forces Network, Berlin. </sentence><sentence id="168">And we spent the two years, we were there during the airlift and the Russian blockade. </sentence><sentence id="169">Things, as always happened, it's, when you're in a situation, it seems to be a lot less important or a lot less threatening than it is to people who are reading about it in the Washington Post or the New York Times. </sentence><sentence id="170">And though we were blockaded and we did have an airlift when the Russians turned the power off at 11 o'clock at night, we lit candles, it was that simple. </sentence><sentence id="171">We flew out in 1948 on C47 planes, with our German Shepherd on our laps, you see and then came back to the States. </sentence><sentence id="172">So this was the story, essentially condensed, about these years. </sentence><sentence id="173">Do you have any other questions on this? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="222">Q: Mm-hm, if you want to talk a little bit about becoming aware of Nuremberg, you were in Europe, particularly what did people say about it, what were your thoughts about it and anything about Albert Speer because after all, you eventually did interview him and we'll get to that, but in terms of having a background. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="224">A: Very good question because a lot of what my feeling were with Albert Speer later on and my experience with him had to do with the things that had happened then. </sentence><sentence id="225">I was aware of Nuremberg, I knew what was going on at Nuremberg, I followed it very, very closely. </sentence><sentence id="226">So a lot of what I, I felt at that time, or a lot of my experience at that time had a lot to do in turn with my feelings about Speer. </sentence><sentence id="227">Now I was not day to day involved in what was going on at Nuremberg. </sentence><sentence id="228">I knew what was going on at Nuremberg, I passed through Nuremberg at the time of the trials, I knew the trials were going on, I saw the tanks outside, I knew what was going on at Nuremberg, however, at that time an interesting thing happened, I was still in the army and I was in Salzburg and Cheryl was due to come over and we were setting up, we had a , akind of a castle with a moat type  http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection of thing, where we had eight Americans and 12 German servants, Austrians, I thought it would always, Cheryl said she thought it would always be this way, you see and, and one of my best friends was a man named Dixie Howell. </sentence><sentence id="229">Dixie Howell was a member, is a major, is a member of the engineers and I guess I was angry at what had happened, I realized that if Germany had won the war I would be dead, I . </sentence><sentence id="230">And so one day, since he was the engineer, he used to build the  http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection 0 happen again and look what's happened. </sentence><sentence id="231">And I, Albert Speer I didn't even know. </sentence><sentence id="232">I knew Goring, I knew Goebbels, I knew Himmler, I knew all of the names I should have known. </sentence><sentence id="233">Speer was a non- entity to me, if you had mentioned Albert Speer to me at that time, I probably would have said, "Yeah, isn't he, isn't he the minister of armaments, maybe." </sentence><sentence id="234">And I say that in 20/20 hindsight, I don't know. </sentence><sentence id="235">At 21 or 22 years of age, it's hard for me to tell you now. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="250">Q: If you can go back to the hangings a little bit, set that scene, what about the first time that you went and how often did you go and how many people were hung at a time and how long would you stay? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="252">A: I only went to three, maybe four and then, as with everything else, I mean it's, it isn't a, terrible to say, a novelty, but essentially it's, you know, remembering the time, remembering what we had just been through, it was a part of, a part, death was a part of life and remembering or, I remember there was another thing and you'll be talking to people who were dealing with refugees, Europe was in turmoil, this was not the way it is now, you did not get on trains, the trains had no windows, people were trying to find other people. </sentence><sentence id="253">If you traveled from one place to another, people were crowding onto planes, I saw, I saw, this is something that just came back to me, I remember GI MP's shooting into the air to keep people from getting onto the GI car because the other cars were so crowded where people were going from Frankfurt to Berlin, from Berlin to Nuremberg to find, to Munich to find their relatives. </sentence><sentence id="254">Remember, everybody was a displaced person, including the Germans. </sentence><sentence id="255">And so you went from, from place to place as an army person and you had your own cars, all of with the windows bombed out. </sentence><sentence id="256">My first time to Vienna I sat, in the middle of the winter, with windows, with four blankets around me. </sentence><sentence id="257">I mean this was the way people traveled. </sentence><sentence id="258">When you look in context of what Europe was at that time, where when the train stopped and people got off and relieved themselves at the side of the tracks and got back on the train, these were pretty terrible times, so a This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="259">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="260"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection 1 hanging was part of life in this whole thing. </sentence><sentence id="261">Now, how often did I go, I can remember three, there may have been a fourth and I stopped. </sentence><sentence id="262">I didn't get a kick out of it, I went because it was something to go to. </sentence><sentence id="263">There was a courtyard. </sentence><sentence id="264">It was a very, very dimly lit courtyard. </sentence><sentence id="265">There was a scaffold in the middle and there was always, interestingly enough, whether I call it an honor guard, but a guard of GI's who were standing at the side, as I recall there may have been 10 or 12 in two rows and they were the witnesses to it and the, the sentence was read out in both German and English, it must have been in English too, because I remember what they were and there would be, a typical one would be somebody who had taken two GI's prisoners and had, had killed them, had shot them and was found guilty by a court and was hanged. </sentence><sentence id="266">Then the hoods were put over their heads, there were usually two at a time, both trap doors were sprung at the same time, there's a priest and then I guess the thing I remember always is the bodies being put in the coffin and one person being too log for the coffin and I would leave. </sentence><sentence id="267">It took half an hour. </sentence><sentence id="268">And then probably went to breakfast. </sentence><sentence id="269">I mean this is the way it was, you see. </sentence><sentence id="270">So ina sense this was as cold blooded as anything else that's ever been done, but it was again taken as part of what the daily life was at that time, you had trials, there were trials all over Germany. </sentence><sentence id="271">In Bavaria I went to trials with people who had done, I can barely remember, I remember doing drawings of a priest who was brought up on trial and the people pleading for him and I used to send these drawing back to Cheryl, I still have the drawings. </sentence><sentence id="272">You went because this was how Europe was coming out from the war. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="296">Q: And your thinking about it in terms of not being disturbed by it was that these people committed crimes and they had to pay for it? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="298">A: Yes and at the same time that you knew that a lot of Americans had committed crimes. </sentence><sentence id="299">I mean they were not the only ones who shot prisoners and I guess the people who say we, you won therefore, do have a point. </sentence><sentence id="300">At the same time we won therefore, thank God, you see. </sentence><sentence id="301">But I guess, This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="302">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="303"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection 2 you know, I guess that it all came back to me later on, when we started to discuss Nuremberg and when we started to talk about my going to interview Albert Speer. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="312">Q: Let's talk about that. </sentence><sentence id="313">In the interim, you became a film maker. </sentence><sentence id="314">I don't know if you want to sort of just quickly bring us up to that and then to the point where you got an assignment to interview Albert Speer. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="390">Q: How did you prepare yourself emotionally to meet him in a somewhat open way? </sentence><sentence id="391">And was that your goal or did you say to yourself, well I'm going to have opinions about this man and I just, I'm not going to get rid of them, I'm just going to put them to the side. </sentence><sentence id="392">How did you prepare yourself to do that? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="396">A: That, it's again, talking to yourself and saying you know, what is your attitude going to be and I had done enough interviews to say, okay, for the moment, though I have an emotional context in this one, I am just not going to ever show hostility and by the way, there is later, we'll talk about his reaction to me and my reaction to him, after ten days, because he was very perceptive about how I felt and I was very perceptive about what he was doing. </sentence><sentence id="397">So it was a hands off thing, I mean it was no Albert-buddy, Mel-buddy thing, you have to understand that and that too is a part of our relationship that we can talk about. </sentence><sentence id="398">I arrived in Heidelberg(ph) and my client Alma arrived there, I think that day later or the next day, I don't recall, but the first thing we were to do was to meet Albert Speer at the hotel and we were to go to dinner. </sentence><sentence id="399">And I was excited, in a strange way, I mean after all, it's if you'd said you're going to meet Adolf Hitler I would be excited in a strange way. </sentence><sentence id="400">This was not just meeting

we were in Heidelberg(ph). </sentence><sentence id="410">Everybody in the restaurant was at least 50 or 60 years old. </sentence><sentence id="411">The owners, as I recall were at least 60 years old and therefore were of his generation. </sentence><sentence id="412">He had chosen a restaurant where the greeting would be absolutely the top greeting that he could get, it was the great customer coming in of any restaurant, here is one. </sentence><sentence id="413">I, that was the first startling thing, was that these people still admired and probably adored this man and that was a little shaky, contrasted with the fact that from that point on, everywhere else we went in Heidelberg(ph), whether it was to have a Coca-Cola in a small bar or in the case of my client Alma, having her hair done one day, every time we walked into a place, the young people walked out. </sentence><sentence id="414">The word got around town and this is ironic, the word got around town that friends of Albert Speer were there. </sentence><sentence id="415">This Jewish friend from the Bronx was therefore ignored by most of the people who were in their 20's and 30's. </sentence><sentence id="416">Alma's

there were several times that we had dinner with him. </sentence><sentence id="420">Most of the time we did have dinner at his home, which was also a strange experience. </sentence><sentence

politics were quite different from his. </sentence><sentence id="424">I have a feeling also, after 20 years in Spandau, he had a great, great distance from the children, I think there was an emotional distance. </sentence><sentence id="425">That was a feeling, I mean, you never know. </sentence><sentence id="426">His wife Margaretta was the classic, well -meaning, polite German frau.

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="472">Q: And who wrote down the questions and structured the interview? </sentence><sentence id="473">Were you involved in that, was that your client, did you have a sense that there were any subjects that were skirted? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="476">A: I set up the questions basically, with my client, but basically they were, they were based on the book and also on questions that I had had all these years. </sentence><sentence id="477">I mean now, finally, I have a chance to, I have a chance to speak to Hitler's number two man and I'm going to ask him questions, which becomes a difficult thing, because he had spent his 20 years, let's go back to Nuremberg, the man at Nuremberg and if I may, the question I had, if I go back, if I can just digress for a minute is why was Goring sentenced to death, okay? </sentence><sentence id="478">Well, he was a very well known man and VonShurak(ph) and all the people there, why were they sentenced to death and why did two or three of them get away with 20 years on Spandau? </sentence><sentence id="479">My feeling then, as my feeling now, even after meeting him, is that he should have been hanged too. </sentence><sentence id="480">But a very interesting thing came up, I asked him a question that I think was the key and Gidda Serany(ph) in her book Albert Speer; His Battle with Truth, brings it up, I think it's on page 167 and I would like to read to it to a moment. " </sentence><sentence id="481">The New York Times, when he died, printed an obituary and an editorial, both of which said Albert Speer was the only man in Nuremberg to say he was guilty. </sentence><sentence id="482">Sitting on a lawn in Heidelberg(ph) I asked them the question which started, you were the only man at Nuremberg to say you were guilty. </sentence><sentence id="483">He stopped me at that point and said, I didn't say I was guilty, I said I was responsible." </sentence><sentence id="484">And for all the years I have been going over the nuances between guilt and responsibility and obviously there is a big difference and in Gidda Serany's(ph) book, she tries to, in a sense, come up with the answer as to why Speer did not get sentenced to death. </sentence><sentence id="485">In Nuremberg the most amazing thing happened and it was a documentary the other night that covered it. </sentence><sentence id="486">Every single one talked about how he did not This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="487">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="488"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection 8 know this had happened. </sentence><sentence id="489">Every single one said, well, no, yes he was doing his job, but all this was happening beside him. </sentence><sentence id="490">Speer was the only man who admitted he knew something about it. " </sentence><sentence id="491">Speer was not," she says, "Speer was not, as is sometimes claimed, the only one of the accused at Nuremberg to feel and admit to guilt," by the way, she uses the word guilt and I questioned her on that, "but his admission, even though much too generalized, was remarkable, because he was the only one, who by making it, risked fatally influencing the court's sentence, which for the others who accepted guilt, Hans Frank, Alfred Rosenberg, Olendoff(ph) was inevitable." </sentence><sentence id="492">He was the only one who said he knew any of this was going on. </sentence><sentence id="493">He knew that slave labor was being used and in a sense, he was the only one then who stood apart from all of the others, because if you hear their excuses, I mean this is absolute insanity that these people claimed that nothing went on, when a man who was in charge of the concentration camps didn't know what was going on in the concentration camps, so that, whatever the reasons, he was always quick to say that he had not admitted guilt, but responsibility and I wrote a letter to the New York Times as you know, which covered that and it's always been a very key point in my feelings about Albert Speer. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="514">Q: How did you come to understand how he differentiated between the two? </sentence><sentence id="515">Why did he stop you when you asked that question, say, "No, I didn't say guilt.". </sentence><sentence id="516">I mean, what was the difference to him? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="520">A: The difference to him was that if he had said he was guilty, even at that point, even after the fact, then he was as guilty of doing it, or having a guilt for having done it as all of the others. </sentence><sentence id="521">By saying responsible, he was one of the people who had it happen. </sentence><sentence id="522">And I think there's just that thin level. </sentence><sentence id="523">In other words, I see it as very much the same, if you want to know the truth, but it was this very thin level that I think he felt, in his own mind. </sentence><sentence id="524">The problems that I had with Albert Speer and I must give Gidda Serany(ph) for her book is that she spent four years with him, I spent 10 days. </sentence><sentence id="525">When I left, and we'll go back to the other things later, but when I left, he asked my client how she thought </sentence></p><p><sentence id="526"> This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="527">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="528"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection </sentence></p><p><sentence id="529"> 9 we had done and she said, "Well, Mel's interviewed before and I think we got everything and as you know, we were out to do a series of short films which would be put in the Huntington-Hartford museum." </sentence><sentence id="530">And he said, "It's a funny thing about Mel," he said, "he hides everything he feels behind a sense of humor." </sentence><sentence id="531">And I said, "Would you like to feel my feeling about Albert Speer?" </sentence><sentence id="532">She said, "Yes." </sentence><sentence id="533">I said, "He hides everything he feels behind 20 years in Spandau." </sentence><sentence id="534">This man had had 20 years to come up with all the answers. </sentence><sentence id="535">You talked about Hitler and the Jews, Hitler hated the Jews, you talked about anything about slave labor, he had all of the answers. </sentence><sentence id="536">He had written his book, I saw the original manuscript, which was written on tiny scraps of paper about three inches wide and jagged edges. </sentence><sentence id="537">Wherever he could get paper he wrote this entire book. </sentence><sentence id="538">I know also that the book was changed substantially when it came from German to English. </sentence><sentence id="539">He had the 20 years, he knew he would be talked to after he got out and he was difficult. </sentence><sentence id="540">I did, if I, was I able to break him down at one point?

And this is all before the war really got under way, this was all in the early days and as a 29 year old, if you look at the people who follow the presidents, who follow the congresspeople, look at all your young people, some of them are really very arrogant. </sentence><sentence id="560">I've seen people come in to an airport and say, "Yeah I want a car because I'm with Jimmy Carter's entourage." </sentence><sentence id="561">And they're 22 years old going on eight, you know and you can understand at 29 this man was suddenly recognized by the head of state. </sentence><sentence id="562">So we went to the drawings that he had done and we did a film on architecture in a totalitarian society and I think the thing that amazed me is if I was startled by Hitler's drawings, which were so bad, I was even more startled by the scale of everything that goes on in a totalitarian society. </sentence><sentence id="563">Going back to the demonstrations at Nuremberg in the 30's, with the torchlights, and I did see that, that stadium, it's an incredible stadium. </sentence><sentence id="564">Going back to the stadium at Nuremberg, going back to everything they ever built, which was always larger than the person, everything that Speer designed, which was going to be in Berlin, right after Germany won the war was on a scale that belies imagination. </sentence><sentence id="565">For example, a dome which would be on the Unterdinlinden(ph) and would hold 100,000 people. </sentence><sentence id="566">Just a dome. </sentence><sentence id="567">And then the Unterdinlinden(ph) would now be made into a military avenue of about 48 lanes wide, with cannon on each side. </sentence><sentence id="568">Everything he showed me was totalitarian, was fascist. </sentence><sentence id="569">It's what Mussolini did, it's what Hitler would do and this man involved himself in things that were beyond This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="570">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="571"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection 2 imagination in terms of scale. </sentence><sentence id="572">I mean a skyscraper's a skyscraper, when you talk about a dome, under which 100,000 people can stand comfortably, you're talking about a pretty big dome. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="714">A: Yeah, I would never know what was going on inside of Albert Speer, he had learned to control that and whether he did or not, I know that in future interviews, like in this latest book, he had learned to back off where he didn't want to answer and even if you pursued it, he would go only so far. </sentence><sentence id="715">Did he have an inner turmoil? </sentence><sentence id="716">I don't know, I don't know. </sentence><sentence id="717">I don't know if the man felt that he was sorry he was ever convicted, he was sorry they had ever lost, I have no idea and I would never know this of Albert Speer. </sentence><sentence id="718">He handled himself very well in those interviews. </sentence><sentence id="719">He did what he was supposed to do, I did what I was supposed to do. </sentence><sentence id="720">If I had to do it all over again, I probably would come up with even more driving questions than I did then because I know a lot more now than I did then and it's very difficult to go into an interview like that as a documentary film maker, having studied everything you can about it and still think that you've covered everything, you can't cover everything. </sentence><sentence id="721">There are the old, I should have, I could have. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="730">Q: Why do you think he did the interview, or why did he do, beyond perhaps the obvious reasons, I mean the man didn't have to do interviews, but apparently he did them somewhat frequently. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="732">A: I think that they, I think a part of it, well first I think Albert Speer did his interviews partially for the reasons that you kind of touched on a moment ago of being able to justify Albert Speer and his background and what he did. </sentence><sentence id="733">Partially because I think he was convinced that if you're going to sell the book and, I mean this is a very pragmatic reason, that you're going to sell your book and you're going to convince people to go buy a book of, the number, several, 600 pages or whatever it was, This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="734">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="735"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection 5 you have to do media tours, you have to do these interviews. </sentence><sentence id="736">I think his publisher had a lot to do with this. </sentence><sentence id="737">I think the publisher both in Germany and McMillan(ph) here in the United States said if you're going to do this book, you are going to have to do interviews. </sentence><sentence id="738">And he did a series of interviews right after that for television and for radio and did them later on, there was a second book, which I was not involved whit and I know nothing about. </sentence><sentence id="739">I had had just about enough at one point, but I think that was it and I do believe that there was a feeling that he was now being recognized. </sentence><sentence id="740">Remember Albert Speer also, if he'd been hanged, would have gone down with Goring and all the rest of them, that would have been it. </sentence><sentence id="741">Albert Speer came out at the end of 20 years in prison and had a chance to be rehabilitated, I don't know if it was that, but to at least to a person again, in the society and with enough clout in the society to be interviewed by the press, to ask his opinions. </sentence><sentence id="742">I don't think in that sense it's any different from any of the people who came up in post war Germany and were interviewed. </sentence><sentence id="743">I think he also was grasping and groping to try to find his way back to his family. </sentence><sentence id="744">I mentioned that the impression I got of his six children, all of whom were born before he went to prison and therefore didn't see him for 20 years except twice a year, were very, very distant and almost isolated from him. </sentence><sentence id="745">I never got the feeling while I was there, in 10 days that there was any great love, the kind of love you see, almost in a physical love, a touching or a kiss, I never saw that. </sentence><sentence id="746">Now that may be only the Germanic thing and he didn't want to show it, so it's hard to tell, it's like you never know the inside of a marriage, but that was the impression I got. </sentence><sentence id="747">I got the impression also that the man who came out of one of the worst of the fascist dictatorships in the world had several children who were very left wing. </sentence><sentence id="748">And I'm sure this bothered him. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="861">Q: How did the experience and perhaps not even immediately, but meeting him, spending those 10 days with Albert Speer, how did that change your understanding of Nazi Germany? </sentence><sentence id="862">Or perhaps of one Nazi? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="865">A: Let's put it this way, I've never understood Nazi Germany, just as I have never understood, I have never understood the kind of destruction that went on in Nazi Germany, almost the engineers at work. </sentence><sentence id="866">I can more easily understand Biafra, I can even understand Vietnam, I can understand Nigeria, I can understand tribal warfare. </sentence><sentence id="867">I don't like it and I think it's horrendous, but I can understand this because people do react this way. </sentence><sentence id="868">Bosnia is the classic example of the problems of 100 years back. </sentence><sentence id="869">But when I look at Nazi Germany and I haven't changed my opinion there, I felt exactly the same way before and I feel exactly the same way now. </sentence><sentence id="870">The anti-Semitism, anti- Semitism in the first place I find difficult to understand. </sentence><sentence id="871">I find anti anything of a group or a race, difficult to understand. </sentence><sentence id="872">But when you look at what Nazi Germany did, with something like, was it 600 concentration camps or places of death, when you look at the use of slave labor, when you look at the deliberate way in which they did this, I still don't understand it. </sentence><sentence id="873">I had known people who left Germany, who are not Jewish, because they understood that this was a country they couldn't live in. </sentence><sentence id="874">If it happened in my country, I have often said I probably would have to leave. </sentence><sentence id="875">So has it changed, did it change my feeling about Albert Speer?

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1091">A: What I think I learned is that a great many people in my generation were not at all sorry for what happened. </sentence><sentence id="1092">The reaction that these people had. </sentence><sentence id="1093">I mean I was fairly aware of it before then, having This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="1094">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="1095"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection 4 worked in Germany several times and having lived in Germany after the war, that the people of my generation were not at all sorry that it happened, were not at all guilty about what happened. </sentence><sentence id="1096">Maintained and retained many of their feelings, probably anti-Semitic and so on, about the Jews, about Germany. </sentence><sentence id="1097">I learned also first hand, that the younger generation, for the most part seem to reject that. </sentence><sentence id="1098">They may not want to hear about it, but they seem to reject it. </sentence><sentence id="1099">The fact that the word got around that we were quote friends of Albert Speer and they'd walk out, meant that that there was their visceral reaction to somebody who was there as a quote friend of a Nazi. </sentence><sentence id="1100">So that even in my mind I have a great division where I go right down the line and say there is a whole group that I have, I may not like listening to their German because it reminds me of that time, but I don't hold them responsible for it. </sentence><sentence id="1101">I find that I have difficulty even today, meeting people of my generation in Germany or who are Germans and are traveling. </sentence><sentence id="1102">I get the gut feeling, over and over again when I go a place like the Algove(ph) or I go to Spain and I see groups of Germans traveling, of my age, I get the immediate feeling and I must admit this, that while the Jews lie in their graves, there's a Jewish term for that, they are out enjoying themselves. </sentence><sentence id="1103">I still have that feeling and I resent it. </sentence><sentence id="1104">Not my feeling, I resent their enjoying it. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1120">Q: What's the Jewish term? </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1143">Q: It's a powerful feeling. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1145">A: Well it's, it comes out as you see. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1147">Q: I mean it's not a feeling that was given particularly by your family, it really came out of your experience as a young man. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1149">A: Yeah, I think it comes deeper than experience as a young man, I think it comes from I am convinced that there is an ethnic depth in people. </sentence><sentence id="1150">I'll give you an example. </sentence><sentence id="1151">When I hear Middle Eastern music and this includes Arabic, Israeli, any Middle Eastern music or Russian music, something deep within me comes to life. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1157">A: Good. </sentence><sentence id="1158">Good feeling. </sentence><sentence id="1159">I mean I happen to be one who can't understand why the Arabs and the Jews fight. </sentence><sentence id="1160">There is a very deep, Middle Eastern, ethnic level there so that I think, my wife Cheryl has the same feeling, I'm not the only one. </sentence><sentence id="1161">Or she'll look at me and all of a sudden I stiffen with pleasure because the music gets to me. </sentence><sentence id="1162">Now that didn't come from my background as a child and it didn't come from what my parents taught me because except for my Bar Mitzvah, I really was not a very good Jew. </sentence><sentence id="1163">But I am a very good Jew as a Jew because that's how I feel. </sentence><sentence id="1164">So there is an instinctive Judaism there, don't ask me to explain it. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1173">Q: Okay. </sentence><sentence id="1174">I actually haven't asked you anything about this and I think there's probably some things you can say about it. </sentence><sentence id="1175">What sense did you get of Speer's relationship with Hitler? </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1190">Q: Even though in your tapes you do talk about that point where Albert Speer gets sick and he doesn't see Hitler for awhile and as he explains it, he's pulled out of his sphere of influence and then when he sees him again, something has changed. </sentence><sentence id="1191">So even after that change, you don't think that he fundamentally changed? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1194">A: No, I don't think he fundamentally changed. </sentence><sentence id="1195">I think this was the, this was the dynamics and I can't speak too you know, authentically, but I think it's the dynamics of what happened. </sentence><sentence id="1196">Remember this whole inner group were always close to Hitler. </sentence><sentence id="1197">You move out for awhile like in any corporate group and then you move in and you've got to work your way back in again. </sentence><sentence id="1198">I think he always respected Hitler. </sentence><sentence id="1199">I don't know how he felt at the end of the war, I don't know how he felt before he died but my feeling was that he was close. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1206">Q: He says in the interview that you did with him that he feels embarrassed, I think, he might have even said shame and he is very halting when he says this, at declaring his admiration for somebody who became such a monster. </sentence><sentence id="1207">So what's going on there, he's using the right terms for Hitler, he's calling him a monster, but he's also saying that he really cared deeply about this man. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1210">A: See, this is the point, when anyone interviews a man like Albert Speer. </sentence><sentence id="1211">Is he saying this because this is politically correct? </sentence><sentence id="1212">That was a term that was not around then. </sentence><sentence id="1213">Is this the answer he expects me to have? </sentence><sentence id="1214">I mean suppose he said to me and this is only instinctive about his feeling about Hitler through the time. </sentence><sentence id="1215">Suppose he said to me, "Oh this man was a monster, I hated him at the end, I'm This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="1216">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="1217"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection 7 glad he was dead." </sentence><sentence id="1218">Do you think I could believe it for one minute? </sentence><sentence id="1219">Not when he was involved with the armaments almost right up until the last minute. </sentence><sentence id="1220">Not until he was the heir apparent, the heir apparent to Hitler if Hitler had been killed. </sentence><sentence id="1221">No, I have a feeling that we're back to his coming up with the answers of 20 years in Spandau. </sentence><sentence id="1222">That's a feeling. </sentence><sentence id="1223">But then again, I'm a very prejudiced man about that whole thing, so you know, in... </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1238">Q: And you were there, you spent 10 days with him, so some of the information that you'd gather about him are feelings and nuances about ways he said things and his body language, that sort of. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1240">A: Well the body language was pretty much the same throughout. </sentence><sentence id="1241">Almost rigid, comfortable. </sentence><sentence id="1242">Comfortable in his answers. </sentence><sentence id="1243">As I say I think he thought about them through all that time. </sentence><sentence id="1244">But in terms of body language, look, he was, there was always the gap between us, let's face it, I mean remember, always the business suits with the ties. </sentence><sentence id="1245">I was doing my job and he was answering the best he had thought about answering through all these years. </sentence><sentence id="1246">I think he had come up with the answers to every one of the questions that I asked him and possibly not what Gidda Serany(ph) did cause she really went in depth, but that any reporter coming there would have asked him. </sentence><sentence id="1247">I found no great revelation in anything I read later on. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1256">Q: Did you understand Hitler any better after you'd done this 10 day interview? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1258">A: No. </sentence><sentence id="1259">You know, I, it's, if, no I didn't understand Hitler any better and I don't think that I could have gotten that out of this. </sentence><sentence id="1260">Probably is one of the world's great monsters, I put with him all the other people who were with him as just as monstrous. </sentence><sentence id="1261">It was not only Hitler, they had to go along with him, they knew what was happening. </sentence><sentence id="1262">I not only don't understand Hitler any better, I don't understand the virulence of the entire group around him, including Goebbels, including Gering, including VonShurack(ph), including all of them. </sentence><sentence id="1263">No, I said before I would never understand the Nazi movement. </sentence><sentence id="1264">Oh, I understand then, I know, understand what it did, I understand everything for This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="1265">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="1266"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection 8 after World War 1, I understand all of the things that happened. </sentence><sentence id="1267">I hear a great many of the things happening today. </sentence><sentence id="1268">The populist thing about look what they did to you in the war and look what the corporations are doing to you, this was Hitler's whole schtick and I understand it after the war. </sentence><sentence id="1269">I understand also the thing of uniforms and Nuremberg and so on. </sentence><sentence id="1270">I can even understand them forming the army, I can even understand them having a war. </sentence><sentence id="1271">What I can't understand is what they did to 20 million people, deliberately. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1286">Q: Did Albert Speer ever bring up some of the delicate questions himself in a way to sort of pre- empt you, perhaps bringing up the issue of what he knew about the Jews, what was happening to the Jews and when? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1288">A: No, as I recall, now remember this is recalling. </sentence><sentence id="1289">As I recall what, the pattern was pretty well set in that unless there was a question he never really volunteered anything, except to bring me in to see Hitler's drawings and the architectural things and the home movies, these were volunteered. </sentence><sentence id="1290">In terms of the answers to the questions, not really. </sentence><sentence id="1291">Now I have not heard the tapes in a while, you'd have to hear that, I really don't remember. </sentence><sentence id="1292">I remember it being a pattern, I had my list and this is pretty much what we went to. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1298">Q: With the things he volunteered, just listening to you just say that right now I'm wondering, was he just trying to show you just another slightly different angle so that perhaps it being more three dimensional for you? </sentence><sentence id="1299">What's your thoughts on that? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1302">A: Well it's hard to say. </sentence><sentence id="1303">Again, I can't remember all the nuances of the time I was there. </sentence><sentence id="1304">He was professional. </sentence><sentence id="1305">It's the best I can say. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1319">Q: Was there a moment in the 10 days that Albert Speer caught you off guard, said something that surprised you, perhaps even did something? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1321">A: Not in terms, I don't remember anything, I'm sure there must have been some times and I'm sure that some of the questions, but you asked the question, the first thing that came to mind was something that has been made very available at this time and in fact I saw it not too long ago on a, on a documentary about the war, which had nothing to do with Albert Speer or Adolf Hitler. </sentence><sentence id="1322">And it had to do with the problems that came up in armaments during the end of the war. </sentence><sentence id="1323">The Germans were the first to develop jet planes, or to develop flyable jet planes, which would have totally destroyed the armada's of the allies, considering everything was a prop plane at the time, the flying fortresses and so on and the P38's and Hitler did not trust the jet engine, it had no propeller. </sentence><sentence id="1324">And therefore, up until the very end, he refused to let them use it. </sentence><sentence id="1325">At the very end he let them use it. </sentence><sentence id="1326">By that time though, Speer could not develop enough planes to make any difference. </sentence><sentence id="1327">But there was a fascinating thing, it's like somebody developing the atomic bomb before us, so of all the things that he mentioned to me, that sticks in my mind as something that I had not heard of and now as I say, has become part of the historians, you know, the historians whole group of books and films and so on. </sentence><sentence id="1328">But that to me, surprised me. </sentence><sentence id="1329">Other than that, in terms of the answers, remember I said my feeling was, through the entire time that he had come up, I could not come up with a question except asking what he said to his wife and his children, in the visits to Spandau, that he would not have thought of before. </sentence><sentence id="1330">A very bright man, a very bright man. </sentence><sentence id="1331">Under some other form of government would have been a brilliant executive possibly, I can't say architect because I was never very impressed with his architecture as I was not impressed with Hitler's drawings, but was bright enough, was presentable enough, was articulate enough. </sentence><sentence id="1332">Certainly spoke English quite well. </sentence><sentence id="1333">Could This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="1334">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="1335"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection 0 have been a really well known, great man in some other country. </sentence><sentence id="1336">But he never really, we never really threw one another. </sentence><sentence id="1337">He never really threw me, I had my questions, I always had to keep my deep feelings buried, which I did and he in turn had thought of every single one of the answers. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1357">Q: Do you think that, do you think that what you were just mentioning, that he's very bright, he could have, he could have just been such a shining star in another country, another government, do you think that might be part of where his sadness comes from? </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1392">Q: You talk about how he sort of gave you what he wanted to, he'd thought these answers out and yet it seems that in a way, it's like his self portrait and that's revealing too, what he does want to say about himself, Albert Speer and what he doesn't, that while you were, you feel that you weren't able to puncture it too much, it's still a self portrait. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1394">A: Of course, this is what he wants you to think, this is what he wants you to feel, he certainly is not going to come out as a self proclaimed monster, which by the way I don't think he was. </sentence><sentence id="1395">You see, yes he used slave labor and he may or may not have been anti-Semitic. </sentence><sentence id="1396">Interestingly enough, I'm not sure. </sentence><sentence id="1397">He may have been one of those, those, apolitical people in terms of his anti-Semitism, I don't know. </sentence><sentence id="1398">Certainly he was not one of the virulent ones, certainly he was not a Goebbels. </sentence><sentence id="1399">On the other hand, he was a part of the hierarchy and you know, the responsibility is there, it's like the responsibility is there. </sentence><sentence id="1400">When you have a doctor and the nurse is hostile to you, the doctor is responsible. </sentence><sentence id="1401">Well it's the same thing here, he's responsible. </sentence><sentence id="1402">I mean he was a top man in this group. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="1403">So yes, he wanted you to feel, as anyone does, a certain way. </sentence><sentence id="1404">He wants to present and to communicate to you how he, Albert Speer feels about it and come out looking pretty, at least fairly good, not as a monster. </sentence><sentence id="1405">Remember also, he was shrewd enough and he was smart enough not to get the death penalty. </sentence><sentence id="1406">And he had to maintain that too, he could not be one of the monsters that was put to death. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="1407">This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="1408">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="1409"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection 2 </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1410">Q: You talk about burying your own feelings. </sentence><sentence id="1411">Was there a time after the interview, in the day or two after, leaving Germany, or even a month or two later, when at some point the feelings surface and what was that like or, or did you basically just erase it somehow? </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1412">A: No, I never erased it and the feeling did surface and after leaving, as with any reporter or film maker, I would like to have had the 10 days again because there were places I think I was too kind. </sentence><sentence id="1413">There were places I felt and still feel that my follow up was not strong enough. </sentence><sentence id="1414">At the same time, it's now 20-20 hindsight, I now know a lot more. </sentence><sentence id="1415">In fact if I were to see him again, I don't want to see him, he's dead, but if I were to see him again, I would have a lot more questions and a lot of them would come from research that's been done by people like Gidda Serany(ph). </sentence><sentence id="1416">I didn't have it at that time. </sentence><sentence id="1417">Remember, he had just come out of Spandau a few years before or a year or two before. </sentence><sentence id="1418">That's another thing that we've got to keep in mind, he came out of prison, he was a prisoner, he came out, he's now with the family, he's in Heidelberg(ph) where half of the town hates him and the other half of the town puts the red carpet down. </sentence><sentence id="1419">He's with his family, he'd not seen Margaretta(ph) for, more than once a month for 20 years. </sentence><sentence id="1420">He'd not seen these kids who grew up without him, some of whom as I say I was sure was left, were left of center. </sentence><sentence id="1421">And so, coming out of prison as any prisoner, aside from the horrendous things that were done by the Nazi regime, coming out as any prisoner, he had a lot to get used to. </sentence><sentence id="1422">And even getting used to sitting down at a table with a group of film makers and his wife and his children and having a dinner. </sentence><sentence id="1423">Always at the head of the table, very stiff. </sentence><sentence id="1424">Very, very stiff. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1461">A: No, I was never intimidated, but I think I knew all the time I spoke to him that I was going to get the answers that he had well prepared. </sentence><sentence id="1462">I was never intimidated because basically you have to remember that deep, deep down, there was the anger and the gut feeling that he still was Hitler's number two man, that it was an experience and it was an experience. </sentence><sentence id="1463">I never, never forgot the fact that I was a Jew speaking to Hitler's number two man on a very civilized kind of a lawn, you know, going in to lunch or dinner in a few minutes. </sentence><sentence id="1464">It's a very weird, surrealist feeling. </sentence><sentence id="1465">But no, I never felt intimidation. </sentence><sentence id="1466">Nor was he the kind of man who intimidated. </sentence><sentence id="1467">Which is another point. </sentence><sentence id="1468">A lot of it had to do with him too. </sentence><sentence id="1469">He was not arrogant. </sentence><sentence id="1470">We think of some, particularly when we see the movies with the Nazi arm bands and you think of the arrogance and the arrogance of the Gestapo and so on, this was not the kind of man he was and he may not have even been that during the war, but I don't know. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1481">Q: Just a moment ago we were talking about the emotion finally coming out, I don't know if it did at one point and we got sidetracked, I want to just come back to that question. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1514">Q: That's what I wanted to ask, I don't know if there's something we haven't touched on that we should say about the interview, about the tapes. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1516">A: The tapes, there's nothing more I can say about the interview or the tapes, I would like to find the other two tapes, remembering that they also were accompanied by film and so it would be interesting to see at this point if one of the questions you asked about came off on film. </sentence><sentence id="1517">Was there any point where he showed any of this other reaction, emotion or whatever it may be, discomfort. </sentence><sentence id="1518">I would have to see the uncut film because even the cut film would only have the correct answers. </sentence><sentence id="1519">But in seeing the uncut film you would know because we went on I don't know how many rolls or how many hours we had. </sentence><sentence id="1520">In order to do 10, 10 minutes films, plus a film on the architecture in a totalitarian regime, which was 10 minutes, you're talking 100 minutes of finished film. </sentence><sentence id="1521">I don't recall This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="1522">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="1523"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection 6 what we shot, we must have had a truckload of film when we went back because we kept rolling through all these things. </sentence><sentence id="1524">Today with videotape, it would be cheaper, but... </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1535">Q: Yeah __ didn't you have to stop for the airplanes? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1537">A: Yes, well every time, every, one day when we were out there, we surveyed it for the first couple of days, it was perfect, the birds were chirping and the first day we were going to film, there was a storm over Frankfort, we didn't know this, all we knew is a jet came over. </sentence><sentence id="1538">Then another jet came over, then another and you know that, that's it for tape and I kept stopping the tape and stopping the film and he said, "Oh," he said, "whenever there's a storm in Frankfort, the planes circle over Heidelberg(ph). </sentence><sentence id="1539">So for about two hours we had nothing but jets circling over Heidelberg(ph). </sentence><sentence id="1540">For a film maker this is death, this is terrible. </sentence><sentence id="1541">Overall it's, look, it's been with me this many years, I still read about him, I still can't get enough about him. </sentence><sentence id="1542">If I see him on television on some film about World War 2, I still sit up and take notice. </sentence><sentence id="1543">Having lived in Berlin right after the war, I know the VonSay(ph) house, I was very involved with that whole area. </sentence><sentence id="1544">As a Jew in Germany, there were, there were lots of problems. </sentence><sentence id="1545">In fact, to show how it works, when Cheryl first came over and to show my anger, we were living in Max Schmelling's(ph), Max Schmelling(ph) was a boxer, was a heavyweight boxer, who was the German champ, who was beaten by Joe Louis and in in Berlin and a woman came to the door. </sentence><sentence id="1546">We had just received a package from  http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection 7 went in and she got a can of salmon and she gave it to the woman. </sentence><sentence id="1547">And we had our first big married fight, because I was so angry that they had starved people, that they had put them in gas chambers, I mean I don't have to go through the whole litany, they had done all these things and she said you can't turn a woman who is hungry away. </sentence><sentence id="1548">So obviously then and obviously even to this day, my gut feeling is, I find it difficult to go back. </sentence><sentence id="1549">I find it difficult to hear German spoken. </sentence><sentence id="1550">I find it difficult to meet someone of my generation who was in Germany in 1940, "41, "42. </sentence><sentence id="1551">Can't help it. </sentence><sentence id="1552">So in that sense I've come away with a very, an even stronger emotional feeling and my speaking to Albert Speer is just one of those little bricks in that whole thing of building how I feel today and I would do it again, as I said to you before. </sentence></p></dialogue>
