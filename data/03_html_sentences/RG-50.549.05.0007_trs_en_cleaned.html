I've learned, very sympathetic to Hitler and was very much involved locally or never... I don't know whether he just took over the business, didn't buy it. </sentence><sentence id="26">But I know there was all the family felt pretty badly about that. </sentence><sentence id="27">And some members of my family never want to go back to Germany. </sentence><sentence id="28">Her two sisters have never gone back. </sentence><sentence id="29">We did a little bit of exploring. </sentence><sentence id="30">My mother, there's a small Jewish cemetery, my mother had a sister who died, a fourth sister, who died early, either when her mother gave birth to her... her mother had been married, her father had married twice. </sentence><sentence id="31">But there is the grave of the young child, who either died, was like a month old. </sentence><sentence id="32">And so that cemetery was still kept in quite good condition. </sentence><sentence id="33">I don't think there was a synagogue there. </sentence><sentence id="34">It's coming back a little bit. </sentence><sentence id="35">But we really did not meet any members of the Jewish community and I doubt if there are any Jews in Oberstein. </sentence><sentence id="36">Because when we did go, we then went to Magdeburg, my home. </sentence><sentence id="37">We had not been to Magdeburg at all, because it was in the East zone. </sentence><sentence id="38">Hamburg was in the West zone and Magdeburg is the next large city down the Elbe River from Hamburg. </sentence><sentence id="39">So when we went back to Magdeburg, they were having, it had been badly bombed in several major raids. </sentence><sentence id="40">It was a town of about three hundred thousand people, an industrial center. </sentence><sentence id="41">We lived in the synagogue, we'll get to this a little bit later, but we had... and the Russians had renamed all the streets, so they were just starting to rename them back. </sentence><sentence id="42">And so we had a little trouble finding, trying to orient the map to show Mother where we used to live and the synagogue we used to live in, where it was. </sentence><sentence id="43">Now there's just a memorial tablet in the location. </sentence><sentence id="44">There was a big office building. </sentence><sentence id="45">But that is gone. </sentence><sentence id="46">But then we, it happened that during the week we were there, they had a memorial exhibit to the Jewish community from Magdeburg in one of the... there's a cloister there. </sentence><sentence id="47">There's a very large cathedral in Magdeburg, which is fairly famous. </sentence><sentence id="48">And there was actually, the week we were there, they were having a, one of these annual conferences of the 3   USHMM Archives RG-50.549.05*0007 4 Protestant gathering in Germany that moves around. </sentence><sentence id="49">All the churches were there and they had booths set up and they had services in the main square. </sentence><sentence id="50">And one of the groups there was a group that was trying to promote better relationships between Germany and Israel. </sentence><sentence id="51">And they, they were not Jewish, but that was the mission of this group. </sentence><sentence id="52">And they pointed us in the direction of some people who knew some of the Jewish folks. </sentence><sentence id="53">Again, we went to see this exhibit and I can get into that with you a little bit, because one of the exhibits involved, it was a diary written by the person who was the Rabbi in the congregation with my father, who had written a diary when they were picked up to go to the Holocaust museum. </sentence><sentence id="54">I mean to go to the concentration camp. </sentence><sentence id="55">So, this is a long winded way of telling you that there, we know there was a Jewish congregation. </sentence><sentence id="56">When we were walking around the city buildings, and we had this...bumped into this woman who was Jewish or who knew the Jewish... had some connection. </sentence><sentence id="57">And she worked in the city hall, worked with the mayor, just happened. </sentence><sentence id="58">And so, it happened when we were walking by that the mayor came out and we spoke to him a little bit. </sentence><sentence id="59">And he said they were just trying, starting, he was interested and glad to meet mother and said the city was starting to put together an event like a lot of other cities had done, to bring the Jewish members of the congregation or for the Jews from Magdeburg, back to Magdeburg for a kind of gathering and reconciliation sort of thing. </sentence><sentence id="60">But I don't think that's happened or she continues to get mailings now from the congregation which is... there was not an active synagogue that we knew of or could find. </sentence><sentence id="61">I think they said there were several hundred families, but we really didn't go out of our way. </sentence><sentence id="62">I've got a book, little brochure at home or here, from that exhibit, which was very touching and very nice. </sentence><sentence id="63">Had a huge wall-sized photograph of the inside of the synagogue where my father was the, where my dad was involved. </sentence><sentence id="64">Anyway there were very few Jews, I think. </sentence><sentence id="65">And it was not an organized congregation yet, but we either didn't bump into them correctly. </sentence><sentence id="66">I mean, we were, it was more of a sight-seeing trip than an effort to dig into records about the congregation sort of thing. </sentence><sentence id="67">Because we also had a limited amount of time. </sentence><sentence id="68">And so we got in the car. </sentence><sentence id="69">I had a car and we did drive over to the section where Mother, my dad and my mom first lived, when we came there. </sentence><sentence id="70">I mean, when they first, when my father first married Mother in Idar-Oberstein and then they moved to Magdeburg. </sentence><sentence id="71">It was a small garden apartment kind of place, a little young couple's new... I'm sure at the time looked very pretty. </sentence><sentence id="72">That area had not been bombed and was still there. </sentence><sentence id="73">It was just much more rundown. </sentence><sentence id="74">I mean it was like going to a building that was 50 years old. </sentence><sentence id="75">But the flower boxes were there and we did manage to... you know, we drove by where they probably lived or near where they, in that community. </sentence><sentence id="76">Remarkable for me to see, because my dad didn't have a car and he bicycled to work every day. </sentence><sentence id="77">People either walked or took bikes right into, in the twenties and thirties. </sentence><sentence id="78">I guess he moved to, well I was born in "31, so he and Mother had been married two years. </sentence><sentence id="79">So it was this very pretty little... it was kind of like being in suburbia and taking a bike, biking into work every day. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="159">Q: Right. </sentence><sentence id="160">Had your father been, you said he met your mother in Idar-Oberstein? </sentence><sentence id="161">Had he been from there or from Magdeburg? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="165">A: My dad was a, he was born in Leer, Ost-Friesland, which is in the northwestern part of Germany, near the Frisian Islands. </sentence><sentence id="166">And I have a family... I was just looking and we have a pretty good family tree on his mother's side of the family, going back to the 1700s. </sentence><sentence id="167">His father was a junk dealer and he had nine brothers and sisters. </sentence><sentence id="168">He had a large family. </sentence><sentence id="169">And then his father, unfortunately, when he was very young, committed suicide. </sentence><sentence id="170">4    USHMM Archives RG-50.549.05*0007 5 </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="177">Q: Your father's father? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="179">A: My father's father. </sentence><sentence id="180">Leaving my mother! </sentence><sentence id="181">with this huge, rather large family when they were... I think at that point he was probably like fifteen or sixteen. </sentence><sentence id="182">And so, he went, spent some years in an orphanage in Hanover and then went on to our equivalent of college, and to be a Jewish school teacher, which when you think back about it, was quite an achievement. </sentence><sentence id="183">He had an older brother, Sammy, and several sisters. </sentence><sentence id="184">He also had a younger brother, who also committed suicide. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="191">Q: Your father's younger brother? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="193">A: Yeah, named Meir, who had an affair, I think with a non-Jewish girl, and decided... which was a no-no in a big way back then. </sentence><sentence id="194">But he had several sisters, Jetta and Martha, both of whom married of all things, butchers in the next communities. </sentence><sentence id="195">And they came to this country. </sentence><sentence id="196">One of them is named Dan de Vries. </sentence><sentence id="197">His wife's name is Martha. </sentence><sentence id="198">They've both died in the last ten years and their son lives in New Jersey. </sentence><sentence id="199">And his wife is actually the woman who published the coffee book for the Holocaust museum. </sentence><sentence id="200">His name is Alan de Vries. </sentence><sentence id="201">He'd been married before, but Judy and he've been married for many years. </sentence><sentence id="202">And then he had this other sister, Jetta Van der Wyck, married Nathan Van der Wyck. </sentence><sentence id="203">They came to this country and had three daughters and she is still living. </sentence><sentence id="204">She's ninety... She's kind of failing, but she's now 90, I guess. </sentence><sentence id="205">Then he had a sister Ola", who was married and went to Argentina and then divorced her husband and came back to New York and lived there until she was about fifty and died. </sentence><sentence id="206">And another sister, Lina", who with her husband went to Israel, early, one of the early settlers in Israel. </sentence><sentence id="207">They moved to a moshay" in Israel. </sentence><sentence id="208">And they have a son, Moshe, who is my age and whom we have visited. </sentence><sentence id="209">I think that's all the sisters and brothers. </sentence><sentence id="210">Two of those families came to this country and lived in New York, in the New York area. </sentence><sentence id="211">And both of them were... well, Nathan was a butcher and he died relatively young in this country, while the girls were still growing up. </sentence><sentence id="212">The... Dan de Vries lived, well he actually outlived Alan's mother, but he lived to be about in his eighties. </sentence><sentence id="213">And I think Martha was right around eighty when she died. </sentence><sentence id="214">But my father, you know this large family, his mother's name was Wexler before she was married to a Rosenberg. </sentence><sentence id="215">And her father and her father's father were fairly prominent rabbis in this northern part of Germany. </sentence><sentence id="216">The Wexler family, that was there. </sentence><sentence id="217">So, there was a very heavy religious influence in my father's family. </sentence><sentence id="218">And my dad was very knowledgeable in Jewish law. </sentence><sentence id="219">He knew the five books of Moses by heart. </sentence><sentence id="220">You could start him in the Torah. </sentence><sentence id="221">If you go into the synagogue, the five books of Moses are in the scroll and you could start my father anywhere and he could give you the rest of the passage. </sentence><sentence id="222">So, he was a Jewish school teacher. </sentence><sentence id="223">When he got his degree, he went to Idar-Oberstein I think originally, probably as a practice teaching. </sentence><sentence id="224">But he came there as a young bachelor. </sentence><sentence id="225">And he met, to be a school teacher. </sentence><sentence id="226">And... or whether a Sunday school teacher in the Jewish school. </sentence><sentence id="227">And he met my mother, who was a student. </sentence><sentence id="228">She was like sixteen when he met her. </sentence><sentence id="229">I think he had another, I think he had a year of school to go. </sentence><sentence id="230">And he came and he went. </sentence><sentence id="231">He was, she said a very jealous man, when she was still going with some other, this Hans or whatever. </sentence><sentence id="232">And she was " JR intended to say that his grandfather's suicide left his grandmother with a large family. ? </sentence><sentence id="233">Married name: Carole Rosenberg 3 Married name: Lina de Vries 4 Moshav (Hebrew: "Settlement"): Israeli cooperative community that combines privately farmed land and communal marketing.5 Married name: Therese Wexler Rosenberg 5    USHMM Archives RG-50.549.05*0007 6 18, I guess, quite young, when they were married. </sentence><sentence id="234">Then he took her back to Magdeburg, where he got a position with the Jewish, with the synagogue and the Jewish... it wasn't the welfare agency, but it was like the United, not United Jewish Appeal... sort of like the Central Kentucky Jewish Organization. </sentence><sentence id="235">He was assisting the, assisted the rabbi as a, not as the cantor, but as the lay leader, with services and with classes. </sentence><sentence id="236">And then he also taught classes to people, to Jews who wanted to go to Israel, in Hebrew, and preparing them to go. </sentence><sentence id="237">And I think he wanted to go to Israel, but my mother did not. </sentence><sentence id="238">She wanted to come to this country, if they were going to leave, because her family was here. </sentence><sentence id="239">And I think my dad really wanted to go to Israel, but they were, like many others, not really, did not think this thing was going to get as bad as it did. </sentence><sentence id="240">So that's where he met her and then brought her to Magdeburg in this little garden apartment, this very pretty, young woman. </sentence><sentence id="241">And then a year later... Mother always likes to kid that I'm a... I don't know if you realize that people who are born in very early October are often New Year's Eve babies. </sentence><sentence id="242">They had a big party. </sentence><sentence id="243">Here I am. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="297">Q: Did you, you mentioned about your father's family being religious. </sentence><sentence id="298">Were you instilled at an early age with a sense of religion, or was there a religious... </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="301">A: We were kosher at home. </sentence><sentence id="302">We had, I suppose in Germany a pretty, what would be called, it wasn't Reform, probably like the Conservative American congregation or family. </sentence><sentence id="303">We had a kosher household, that meant Mother had two sets of dishes. </sentence><sentence id="304">We had all, we had Sabbath. </sentence><sentence id="305">My father being with the synagogue, went there regularly. </sentence><sentence id="306">And I would go with him. </sentence><sentence id="307">But I was only eight. </sentence><sentence id="308">I mean I was really young. </sentence><sentence id="309">I went to the... Hitler, you know, in 1936, I believe, started, was when Jewish children could no longer go to school with others. </sentence><sentence id="310">There was a separate Jewish school system. </sentence><sentence id="311">And my father was actually a teacher, then became a teacher in the Jewish school system, in the Jewish school. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="323">Q: After 1936? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="325">A: Yeah, well when I went to school first in nineteen, let's see I would have been six years old, that's 1937 when I started. </sentence><sentence id="326">I don't know if my father had been... I think he'd actually, he must have been a teacher in that school along with being at the synagogue. </sentence><sentence id="327">I think he must have, that must have been his other occupation, that he was actually teaching school already, besides working in the synagogue. </sentence><sentence id="328">Because when I went to the first grade, it was in the school where he was teaching. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="333">Q: And what did he do in the synagogue? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="335">A: In the synagogue he assisted the rabbi and was a, he taught these classes and he taught Sunday school classes, taught Hebrew school. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="337">Q: He wasn't a cantor though? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="339">A: He was not a cantor. </sentence><sentence id="340">There is, even in this country, a formal training for cantors. </sentence><sentence id="341">He could be the cantor and I think sometimes he spelled the cantor. </sentence><sentence id="342">And a lot of times, Saturday nights, there are at the end of the Sabbath, there are services, which lay leaders lead or when the Rabbi or the cantor sit down, somebody else gets up and takes their place for a while. </sentence><sentence id="343">I think my father could 6   USHMM Archives RG-50.549.05*0007 i do all those things, but his primary occupation was being a teacher in the school system. </sentence><sentence id="344">I'm just, as I'm... you know, you don't always think about these things until you really try to, until you work them through. </sentence><sentence id="345">And so, because his reparation, some of his, I think that part of my mother's social security from Germany is based on his years as a teacher, not just the... not only the congregational status. </sentence><sentence id="346">Though he had probably several years at Oberstein and then Magdeburg being a teacher. </sentence><sentence id="347">Except that there was no other place, by that time the schools were segregated. </sentence><sentence id="348">Mother was not working in Germany during, she basically was a housekeeper at home. </sentence><sentence id="349">And did not have anymore formal training after she finished high school. </sentence><sentence id="350">Did we get off to some subject on that? </sentence><sentence id="351">You started to ask me something. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="367">Q: Started to ask about religion. </sentence><sentence id="368">I was wondering, did you have much of a religious education? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="371">A: Well, as much as you can get from six to eight. </sentence><sentence id="372">Because we, Kristallnacht was November "38, so I was just seven years old. </sentence><sentence id="373">I mean I probably had as much as any child would have in those early years. </sentence><sentence id="374">So you learn a lot of the basic biblical stories. </sentence><sentence id="375">You learn Hebrew to read Hebrew. </sentence><sentence id="376">But when we came to this country and my father then went south, which we can get to, I think we became pretty much Reform Jews. </sentence><sentence id="377">I mean because it was so difficult to be kosher unless...back then, unless you went to great extremes. </sentence><sentence id="378">Possible to do that in New York. </sentence><sentence id="379">So... I don't know if you want to talk about how we got there? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="390">Q: How you got to the South? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="392">A: Or what happened in the Holocaust time, itself, that's about where... </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="394">Q: Let's... I wanted to ask a little bit more about your early childhood. </sentence><sentence id="395">Did you have any siblings? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="398">A: Ihave two siblings, one of them was born in Germany, my brother, Harry, who is now in Chevy Chase, who was then... </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="400">Q: Chevy Chase, Maryland. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="402">A: Maryland, right. </sentence><sentence id="403">And he's the head of the Mortality Statistics Section for the National Center for Vitalstatistics. </sentence><sentence id="404">He's a demographer. </sentence><sentence id="405">Harry was... he's four years younger than lam. </sentence><sentence id="406">And my sister, Joan, is in Raleigh, North Carolina. </sentence><sentence id="407">And she's been an architect for twenty years and then went back to law school. </sentence><sentence id="408">Right now she's holding her breath to see if she passed the bar. </sentence><sentence id="409">But she was an architect for the state for many years and decided she would go back to law school, could be a lawyer. </sentence><sentence id="410">So, hopefully she will know this week whether she passed the bar or not. </sentence><sentence id="411">But my brother, you know when you're that age in the early... the only real recollection that I have any problem about those early, those years together... .[ </sentence><sentence id="412">mean I have some recollection of having been at Idar-Oberstein or with some relatives. </sentence><sentence id="413">We went back with my father. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="449">Q: Not a whole lot. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="451">A: Yeah, I remember only the Kristallnacht, that he was out, that he was with my parents, that we were there together. </sentence><sentence id="452">The earlier years, I can remember visiting relatives--as you probably do or you have images of having been--in Leer and playing in my grandfather's junkyard piles with a cousin, for example. </sentence><sentence id="453">Or being in the house, just little things like that. </sentence><sentence id="454">But I really have very little recollection of my brother and I when we were that age. </sentence><sentence id="455">Or not all, or actually even not too many... four years apart is sort of when you're always one... often you're not in the same school. </sentence><sentence id="456">But Harry was, so he was only four years old. </sentence><sentence id="457">We had... oh yeah, when I mentioned there was another sister. </sentence><sentence id="458">My father had another sister, named Mary(r). </sentence><sentence id="459">And Mary was married and living in Frankfurt. </sentence><sentence id="460">And that's where, when, that's kind of, this is the Holocaust story. </sentence><sentence id="461">I don't know if you want to ask some more about. </sentence><sentence id="462">I don't have much else in terms of growing up that I recall, other than where we lived in Magdeburg. </sentence><sentence id="463">We lived in the house that was adjacent to the synagogue, a big courtyard out front. </sentence><sentence id="464">Had just enough of an incline so that my father could put me on a bicycle and let me roll down the incline, which he hoped he had taught me to put on the brake on, so I wouldn't smash into the other side when I was learning to ride a bicycle. </sentence><sentence id="465">The address was Number 2 Schulstrasse. </sentence><sentence id="466">Zwei C, I think, apartment 2C. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="702">A: I think they rounded up most of... they actually, before they... my father they came for the next day. </sentence><sentence id="703">And I think they took off... they arrested hundreds, maybe thousands of Jewish men. </sentence><sentence id="704">And it was not yet, I don't think they were the only ones to get out. </sentence><sentence id="705">I mean, they had help getting out of the concentration camp, but I think they had not set on this course yet of genocide. </sentence><sentence id="706">I mean, I 11   USHMM Archives RG-50.549.05*0007 12 remember there was this Madagascar Plan about sending the Jews to the Madagascar and getting rid of them and basically eliminating them, before they figured out this Final Solution that they were going to kill everybody. </sentence><sentence id="707">It may have been in somebody's mind. </sentence><sentence id="708">But wait a minute, how did I get on to that? </sentence><sentence id="709">You asked me...? </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="721">A: I think there were a lot of, I mean it was a large congregation. </sentence><sentence id="722">Now the other, that was uh... that diary that I was telling you about when we went back to Magdeburg and they had the exhibit of all the Jewish artifacts? </sentence><sentence id="723">There was an open diary by, the rabbi's name was Wilde, WIL DE, Professor Wilde. </sentence><sentence id="724">He was a PhD. It was a large congregation. </sentence><sentence id="725">He had a very prominent role in the community, I think. </sentence><sentence id="726">He started this diary, saying "There we were. </sentence><sentence id="727">We had all been arrested by the police, a banker and a baker and a rabbi and a Rosenberg. </sentence><sentence id="728">And here we were sitting in the police station, all expecting to go home that night." </sentence><sentence id="729">And I mean, all I could read... it was in a glass case, so it just went that far. </sentence><sentence id="730">He ended up going to England. </sentence><sentence id="731">He also got out safely, but he was even older than my father. </sentence><sentence id="732">I don't know what, I think he just lived out his life in England, in London somewhere. </sentence><sentence id="733">So, there were a lot of people arrested after Kristallnacht. </sentence><sentence id="734">And how many of them... there was a family, there was actually a family living upstairs above us in the synagogue, in this building, like it was just an apartment building, there may have been some offices downstairs, but it was perpendicular to the Temple itself, and then there was this courtyard. </sentence><sentence id="735">There was another family upstairs that was Jewish and they were from Poland. </sentence><sentence id="736">And they came and arrested them about, several weeks earlier. </sentence><sentence id="737">And I think that Hitler, that they were arresting Jews from Poland and shipping them out. </sentence><sentence id="738">I think that was sort of the event probably, although I'll never know, you know, that got my father to thinking it was time to get out. </sentence><sentence id="739">And he had thirty days to get out of the country and I always, what I'm going to tell you now is I always thought he did that after he got out of the concentration camp. </sentence><sentence id="740">But I was reading some notes my wife had made, which I suspect happened right after they arrested the Poles, that he said, "Well how am I going to get out of this country? </sentence><sentence id="741">Or how can we do it at this late date?" </sentence><sentence id="742">And he was told to go to the American Consulate and to get a visa and to go to Hamburg. </sentence><sentence id="743">Why don't I just get those notes? </sentence><sentence id="744">I was just looking at them, and I'll read them. </sentence><sentence id="745">It made a little bit of sense, in that it also had and interest... these were actually from some notes that Jean made when we were on a plane with my mother a few years ago. </sentence><sentence id="746">And let's see... yeah, Daddy then, said Opa was safe... he was, let's see, a teacher in synagogue housing. </sentence><sentence id="747">They, if I have this right, one of the reasons Sammy and his mother were there is that they realized that it was getting to be a dangerous time and they might have to try to still get out of the country. </sentence><sentence id="748">And so mother said she thought that was why their stay was being extended, that they had started realizing they were going to try to get to the United States. </sentence><sentence id="749">And she said he was on a... they were taking a walk with the family when they ran into an acquaintance, who said to them that if they were going to get out it was necessary to go to the U.S. Consulate in Berlin. </sentence><sentence id="750">And my father asked him how to do that and he said, "You should go to Hamburg in the morning and get in line and book four passages to this country. </sentence><sentence id="751">Then when you get those passages, you need to go to Berlin to the Consulate to let them know you've got your tickets." </sentence><sentence id="752">So my father, she said, cashed in his life insurance policy and bought the tickets and got the papers together to get a visa to come to the United States. </sentence><sentence id="753">He sent the visa application, he said, by registered mail to Berlin. </sentence><sentence id="754">Then he went to Berlin and stayed there with his sister Ola and her husband, who was... remember her husband was not Jewish, which was another very... they're the ones who went to Argentina. </sentence><sentence id="755">So, 12   USHMM Archives RG-50.549.05*0007 13 he went there. </sentence><sentence id="756">So he went there, he went on to the office, but they did not find his papers. </sentence><sentence id="757">He showed them the registered mail stub, which was copied and he was told that he would then get the confirmation of the fact that he would be approved to go to this country. </sentence><sentence id="758">He got a letter, eventually he got a letter with the number on a piece of paper, which he kept on his person. </sentence><sentence id="759">And it said, he gave that piece of paper to Sammy, his brother, when the Gestapo picked him up after Kristallnacht and took him to the concentration camp. </sentence><sentence id="760">Sammy in turn gave it to his mother, who took me and went to Mary in Frankfurt. </sentence><sentence id="761">So his mother then... what isn't clear to me, is what happened to Sammy. </sentence><sentence id="762">I suppose they must have arrested him after my father, but I just didn't pay any attention to him because I just wasn't focused. </sentence><sentence id="763">Because they took him off. </sentence><sentence id="764">Because she said, it was actually his mother, who took me off to... Mom said, you know, that she took Harry, who was only four at the time and waited around and went from house, lived with different friends in the community while they were waiting for my father. </sentence><sentence id="765">But he had this little registration number, which as you know, probably from other stories, people were selling their souls and lives for, because they were, it was the quota system that determined whether you were going to make it to this country or not. </sentence><sentence id="766">And we were, we then went, during this thirty-day period they got all their belongings together and filled it in one of these things they call...what's the name of this thing? </sentence><sentence id="767">Where you put everything in a big box that's going to go to the other country. </sentence><sentence id="768">And they packed up all their furniture and it was sent to Rotterdam. </sentence><sentence id="769">And they made their way to Rotterdam, Holland, where we were in this sort of an internment camp. </sentence><sentence id="770">It was actually... I think we went on the train and it was a large, overnight hostelry for people who would otherwise have taken, say, the Holland America Line ship. </sentence><sentence id="771">The boat to this country on a normal, as a tourist trip. </sentence></p></dialogue>

basically always worked at home. </sentence><sentence id="1933">She never worked. </sentence><sentence id="1934">I mean, she was a very traditional mother, in that she was a housekeeper and cooked, did the cooking. </sentence><sentence id="1935">And later on, I think, when my brother and my sister is ten years... my sister was born in 1946!". </sentence><sentence id="1936">So she's fifteen years younger than I am, eleven years younger than my brother and was not initially expected, I think. </sentence><sentence id="1937">But Mom, after my sister was born, a few years later, she finally became, decided she wanted to work, and became a sales lady in one of the large department stores, where she worked for a long time. </sentence><sentence id="1938">And I think it did a lot for her, she had never worked in any store. </sentence><sentence id="1939">But she's a very warm, very outgoing woman and was everybody's buddy. </sentence><sentence id="1940">And so, she was a very good salesperson, but it was a new experience for her. </sentence><sentence id="1941">I think it was an enormous adjustment for her. </sentence><sentence id="1942">And really for Dad. </sentence><sentence id="1943">And so when I, I think... anyway, scouting, during the... we were a little, I suppose people, where else in the South, when you think about it, with this history, being, having people recognize you, elect you to be president of the class or something was quite a nice thing. </sentence><sentence id="1944">But I think scouting, and scouting did a lot of that. </sentence><sentence id="1945">I became an Eagle Scout, and was a counselor in a scout camp for several, in the summers for several years, very close to the scout executive. </sentence><sentence id="1946">In fact, he... this is really kind of off the subject, but it's interesting when we say how things affect your lives. </sentence><sentence id="1947">The scout executive in Gastonia, married a woman, who was a Cherokee Indian. </sentence><sentence id="1948">He was a, his name was Schiele. </sentence><sentence id="1949">He was a park ranger for much of his life, and then he got into scouting. </sentence><sentence id="1950">And he also, during his ranger days, learned to stuff, to make, he was a taxidermist. </sentence><sentence id="1951">He amassed a large collection of animals that he had mounted. </sentence><sentence id="1952">And his wife collected, and together they also collected a lot of Native American things, since she was a Cherokee Indian. </sentence><sentence id="1953">And when we were, in the summer in our camp we put on a large Indian pageant every Thursday night. </sentence><sentence id="1954">The pageant of Hiawatha. </sentence><sentence id="1955">I was Hiawatha for several years and my brother was Minihaha. </sentence><sentence id="1956">They'd put a wig on him and I would paddle a canoe in the lights at night and bring him up. </sentence><sentence id="1957">But Bud Schiele, when he retired, he gave this collection to the town of Gastonia and said, I'd like to start a little museum here. </sentence><sentence id="1958">So, he gave that collection and began a natural history museum, which today is about a square block. </sentence><sentence id="1959">He's no longer there, but they've developed this wonderful museum of natural history with outdoor walking trails and some really beautiful... it's quite remarkable in the sense that it's also twenty miles from Charlotte, which has a very large science museum. </sentence><sentence id="1960">But the point I'm getting to, is that after, when I was at, later went to Duke University, I was a chemistry major before I was a lawyer. </sentence><sentence id="1961">We can talk more about that if you want to. </sentence><sentence id="1962">I've always had an interest in science and in this region here, we are behind, I mean educationally we're still behind. </sentence><sentence id="1963">We've caught up. </sentence><sentence id="1964">But I've always had an interest, as much as a result of that experience and seeing Bud Schiele's museum grow, in starting a science museum here. </sentence><sentence id="1965">And so outside of my work, my major activity has been involved with this organization that we began, and in the last legislature, we finally got two and a half million dollars and we're going to put a planetarium with a very sophisticated projection system out here at the community college. </sentence><sentence id="1966">And the guy, and in fact in our little offices are next door, and we have a picture of the Schiele Museum on the wall. </sentence><sentence id="1967">Because seeing that effort work and flourish in the small town of Gastonia gave me some real thought, idea about the fact that we can do it here. </sentence><sentence id="1968">I think a lot of, I mean I think scouting gave me a lot in terms of values apart from the Judaism that is in my family.

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2048">A: No. </sentence><sentence id="2049">Now, my father, after he did this commuting thing, we eventually, we then moved to Gastonia, where I was in the seventh grade and he... when he began working full time, actually he worked in the little community called Lowell, North Carolina, which is about seven miles away. </sentence><sentence id="2050">And he assisted the rabbi. </sentence><sentence id="2051">Sometimes between rabbis he would do... he often acted as the cantor during services, and he often was on the pulpit. </sentence><sentence id="2052">Sometimes he was not. </sentence><sentence id="2053">During the high holiday services especially, like Yom Kippur, where people pray and they stay in the synagogue all day, the rabbi needs somebody to take turns with. </sentence><sentence id="2054">But he was very close to most of the rabbis that were there. </sentence><sentence id="2055">The rabbi I was Bar Mitzvah was named Bill Silverman. </sentence><sentence id="2056">And we had a, it was a very large group. </sentence><sentence id="2057">I suspect there were as many people who were not Jewish in the synagogue as there were, a lot of friends, and my father had all of his friends from the mill that he worked with every day. </sentence><sentence id="2058">He was, he became an office manager there, after, in addition to his working daily around the, as a shift manager, but he became sort of a supervisor in Mr. Heilbronn's mill. </sentence><sentence id="2059">And then by the time I was thirteen, in the seventh or eighth grade, there were school friends, and mother had friends. </sentence><sentence id="2060">So, it was a very nice congregation in Gastonia. </sentence><sentence id="2061">There were probably fifty Jewish families. </sentence><sentence id="2062">And so I was Bar Mitzvah, and my brother was Bar Mitzvah. </sentence><sentence id="2063">Can't remember who the rabbi was when he was there. </sentence><sentence id="2064">And my sister, nowadays they also have what they call Bat Mitzvahs for girls, where girls go through the same thing. </sentence><sentence id="2065">Or they have what they call confirmation classes. </sentence><sentence id="2066">I think she did that. </sentence><sentence id="2067">We stayed pretty active, but like a lot of other kids who are in the South in high school, after that fourteen, fifteen year old, you sort of... you're there Friday nights, but teenagers, unless they have a real tie to, unless you're in a Conservative or an Orthodox family that is very traditional, which you get away from the Sunday school. </sentence><sentence id="2068">And your next connections with other Jews are... I mean, Charlotte has a large Jewish community and there were a lot of children our age, boys and girls, men and women. </sentence><sentence id="2069">Then when you get to college. </sentence><sentence id="2070">But we had the Bar Mitzvah. </sentence><sentence id="2071">And you know, my father, people were very aware of the Jewish community, I think, in Gastonia. </sentence><sentence id="2072">I was always, in retrospect, after I worked in the Civil Rights Division and after I was in the service, I always felt a little sad that the Jewish community was not a little more assertive about desegregation. </sentence><sentence id="2073">But I think the store owners were all afraid to lose their business. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2121">A: Yeah, we were talking about the Jewish communities in these towns and what they might have done. </sentence><sentence id="2122">| think it's always hard to look back and say, but I think the answer would have been if they had felt they could have done more, they might have done more. </sentence><sentence id="2123">I think that they were in the business establishment just the way... I mean they were living in the South and they were not going to be trail blazers, because they would have been ostracized. </sentence><sentence id="2124">I mean, if you look at what was going on in the South in those earlier years and even later years when I was in the service...well, I was saying in high school, I think there were some times that there were some occasions at high school with kids who were from the, from the black school... there were a few social, not social engagements, but some things were you tended to see each other. </sentence><sentence id="2125">Or if you were working together, where they were stock boys--I worked in department stores for many years--you would run into them. </sentence><sentence id="2126">But it just was a... accepted way of life. </sentence><sentence id="2127">And I have just... it did not really, even in college, I mean you heard more about Jews not getting into the country club, and that kind of stuff. </sentence><sentence id="2128">And that there were incidents from time to time, but it was never, I don't think I was ever conscious of anti-Semitism. </sentence><sentence id="2129">But it was really not until I was in the Service, working with other officers who were African-American, I mean the Service was the first major arena where there was desegregation in this country, the military. </sentence><sentence id="2130">And you know, I have told the story that when I came back from... we brought an airplane back from England one year, by way of Iceland and Greenland. </sentence><sentence id="2131">Came back to New York and then two of us, the radar operator on my plane, I was the navigator, was a fellow named Abe Jenkins, who was from South Carolina, who was black. </sentence><sentence id="2132">And he and I got on the train in New York together to come home. </sentence><sentence id="2133">And when we got to Washington, he got up all of a sudden and said, "I'll see you when we get back." </sentence><sentence id="2134">And I said, "Where are you going?" </sentence><sentence id="2135">And he said, "I'm going to the back of the train, where the blacks are." </sentence><sentence id="2136">And I said, "What?" </sentence><sentence id="2137">And he said, "Yeah you better, that's where, I need to go there, otherwise we're going to have some trouble." </sentence><sentence id="2138">And he did. </sentence><sentence id="2139">And I think it was an incident that changed my life, really. </sentence><sentence id="2140">Because I never... I was really outraged and aggravated and thought we've got to do something about that or eventually maybe I can help to do something about that or whatever the thought was. </sentence><sentence id="2141">But that was... so, it was not easy for... it wasn't going to come without court action and others, but I think that the Jews are no less, those Jewish communities are and the people who are there, are no less, maybe no more to blame than their other counterparts. </sentence><sentence id="2142">But it was their economic circumstances and they were not willing to speak out or if they did, I don't know where they did. </sentence><sentence id="2143">I mean, the few people who did speak out, until there was more of a movement, couldn't stay in their communities. </sentence><sentence id="2144">I mean I worked with a man, a lawyer in the Civil Rights Division, who came from Fort Smith, Arkansas and he started trying to be, I mean he was speaking out and the next thing he knew, he had no law practice left and he was in Washington, D.C. So, it's more easily said than done, but when you think about the history of the persecution in the, that the Jews have had, and the Holocaust and all of the things that are behind us, you... that they've gone through, you would have hoped that Jews would have been more sympathetic to the situation that blacks faced every day. </sentence><sentence id="2145">And not quite as much of a willing participant. </sentence><sentence id="2146">It's easier said than done. </sentence><sentence id="2147">It's just something that bothers me, you know, philosophically it's hard to defend it. </sentence><sentence id="2148">29    USHMM Archives RG-50.549.05*0007 30 </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2180">A: Yeah, right, I think so. </sentence><sentence id="2181">I went to, when I went to Duke, I went to Duke on a scholarship which terminated. </sentence><sentence id="2182">Because I got, the scholarship I was given through a trustee of Duke, who was from Gastonia. </sentence><sentence id="2183">I can't remember what his prominence was, but he was on the Board. </sentence><sentence id="2184">And he died about six months after I went to Duke. </sentence><sentence id="2185">And I had started working in the dining halls and they told me I made too much money and didn't need a scholarship, which might have been all right. </sentence><sentence id="2186">I didn't have any trouble, I just worked my way through Duke. </sentence><sentence id="2187">But he, but Duke had a quota on Jewish students even in those years. </sentence><sentence id="2188">And it was before the years that there were any black athletes to speak of, before Duke had any. </sentence><sentence id="2189">So, I was just sort of thinking back, were there any blacks in my life in those earlier years? </sentence><sentence id="2190">There weren't. </sentence><sentence id="2191">And when I came out of the Service, out of Duke, I went into the ROTC. </sentence><sentence id="2192">And when I was in the military, that was the first time where I have any... and growing up in this country, yeah, thinking back on it. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2206">Q: I wanted to ask you about, when you were talking about your experiences in Boy Scouts, and your earlier years in Gastonia. </sentence><sentence id="2207">I'm wondering if there was ever a conflict between your Jewish identity and your Jewish practice and your social life? </sentence><sentence id="2208">Did people expect you to be Christian and to be participating in things as a Christian? </sentence><sentence id="2209">Was that ever a problem for you? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2214">A: No, it was very interesting, I think. </sentence><sentence id="2215">Because the Scout troop, all the Scout troops were sponsored by churches. </sentence><sentence id="2216">And the Scout troop I was a member of was sponsored by the Associate Reform, ARP. </sentence><sentence id="2217">They were called the Associate Reform Presbyterians. </sentence><sentence id="2218">And I think they'd had two or three other Eagle Scouts from the Jewish community. </sentence><sentence id="2219">And so, the answer is no. </sentence><sentence id="2220">I mean I think they were cognizant of the fact that we were Jewish. </sentence><sentence id="2221">And I don't know that anybody ever tried to sort of convert anyone. </sentence><sentence id="2222">But the troop, when I got to scout camp as a counselor one summer, I was sort of... I wasn't... One of my jobs was to arrange the services and many of the scout troops had ministers along with them or they were their scout masters. </sentence><sentence id="2223">And so, I found myself in the position of being, sort of the associate minister to these folks and I learned all the, many of the hymns. </sentence><sentence id="2224">And as we grew up, I went to church a few times. </sentence><sentence id="2225">I certainly went to that Presbyterian church. </sentence><sentence id="2226">But I think it was just a healthy respect. </sentence><sentence id="2227">I think people in the church appreciated, I mean were respectful of the Jewish community and that religion. </sentence><sentence id="2228">And often times people came to those services. </sentence><sentence id="2229">So, I don't know that, I think, you know, we often, the Schieles encouraged me to do that actually, the scout master. </sentence><sentence id="2230">To be... and I often times did the Vesper services for the campers who were there over the weekend. </sentence><sentence id="2231">And there would probably be not much Jesus, but I would read from the Old and the New Testament and we would sing the hymns that they knew, and it didn't bother me. </sentence><sentence id="2232">Now it might very well have bothered many other, not... other Jewish men might have said, "Well you're just stupid. </sentence><sentence id="2233">What are you doing this for?" </sentence><sentence id="2234">Or you know, "Why are you being a minister in this largely Protestant camp and sort of embracing their way of having a service?" </sentence><sentence id="2235">But I didn't have any problem with that. </sentence><sentence id="2236">My parents didn't have any problem with it. </sentence></p></dialogue>

I mean, as time has gone on it has become much more common than it was. </sentence><sentence id="2282">But then my sister married a young man from Eastern North Carolina, who wasn't Jewish. </sentence><sentence id="2283">They subsequently divorced, but she's had a significant other for many years, who's not Jewish also. </sentence><sentence id="2284">So, I don't know how, you know my father, I assume he came to grips with that. </sentence><sentence id="2285">I think they both felt comfortable about their sons and then their daughter, who were, you know, were sort of achievers in the community and were happy with their lives. </sentence><sentence id="2286">And everybody likes to hear good things about their kids. </sentence><sentence id="2287">And so I don't think they were going to throw up barriers. </sentence><sentence id="2288">I don't know that it was ever verbalized. </sentence><sentence id="2289">I think my father had a very... you know, he was very strong with his own convictions and had some very strong ideas, but again, you know, if your kids go in a certain direction... raising children is as difficult for anybody in school. </sentence><sentence id="2290">And if they pal around with, in a society where very few people are Jewish, to say, "Well, you can't go out with them or you shouldn't go to that camp or you shouldn't do this or you shouldn't do that," it's much harder. </sentence><sentence id="2291">And I think they were always sort of adapting to where we were. </sentence><sentence id="2292">I think. </sentence><sentence id="2293">I mean I think it shows terrific flexibility on their part. </sentence><sentence id="2294">My mother was always much more of a social person, much more than he, which more than my father. </sentence><sentence id="2295">My dad was a pretty private person. </sentence><sentence id="2296">And he was very... he read and he worked and he read. </sentence><sentence id="2297">When he was home, did the dishes, sat down and read. </sentence><sentence id="2298">And he had this enormous knowledge of Jewish history and Jewish religion. </sentence><sentence id="2299">And there were very few people, other than the rabbi, that he really enjoyed having long conversations with. </sentence><sentence id="2300">I mean they were just in a different world. </sentence><sentence id="2301">I mean he would do his work and liked his work in a very exacting way. </sentence><sentence id="2302">But this fellow, when I asked you about Mrs. Hirschfield earlier, the person who volunteered... her husband was a scientist, who came over here and became, and went into the textile work. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2380">A: My brother was a scout. </sentence><sentence id="2381">And he became an Eagle Scout in that same Presbyterian church. </sentence><sentence id="2382">He endured a summer with me that he says he'll never forget, because I was the scout master in charge of the cabin when he was a few years younger and was a camper. </sentence><sentence id="2383">And I induced him to be Minihaha or twisted his arm or the Schieles twisted his arm. </sentence><sentence id="2384">But... so, when... my dad in that way was pretty, I think, tolerant of what we did and just let us do it. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2390">Q: Was being Jewish important to you at the time, from a young age? </sentence></p></dialogue>

I mean, Judaism has been part of me all the way through and I guess I'm pretty conscious of being Jewish. </sentence><sentence id="2396">Not that I think about it every day, but it's a very attractive religion, I think. </sentence><sentence id="2397">It's very simple. </sentence><sentence id="2398">Its principles make a lot of sense to me, if one is going to believe in a higher being. </sentence><sentence id="2399">And people are aware that Iam Jewish. </sentence><sentence id="2400">And I spend some time talking about Judaism, sometimes in schools, sometimes to civic groups or Passover, that sort of thing. </sentence><sentence id="2401">But, I mean, nothing to necessarily flout, it's just the way it is. </sentence><sentence id="2402">And then of course, I said my wife is not Jewish. </sentence><sentence id="2403">But then we have a small Quaker contingent in the mountains that I participate with. </sentence><sentence id="2404">So, we put those two things together, something I probably wouldn't have predicted years ago either. </sentence><sentence id="2405">I'm sure that all of this Holocaust history is very much a part of, or has contributed a great deal to what I've been doing in my later life, in this work that I do and the work I did in the Civil Rights Division. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3008">Q: Did you have any memories of that town? </sentence><sentence id="3009">Of Idar-Oberstein? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3012">A: I may have had some vague memories about the butcher store, because I was so small when we were there, like five and six. </sentence><sentence id="3013">I remember the butcher store sign. </sentence><sentence id="3014">It's hard to tell whether what I remember really had more to do with recollections from pictures than from what was real. </sentence><sentence id="3015">The people I met, who remembered me obviously were contemporaries of my mother or the sisters. </sentence><sentence id="3016">It was a small country town and I think my grandfather was well-known in that area for his being a butcher, an honest butcher and hard working. </sentence><sentence id="3017">It's like Prestonsburg, people who have lived here all of their lives--I mean it was a very well known family, the Schubach family. </sentence><sentence id="3018">So people when I first went there, word traveled pretty quickly, at least in the area where they were and I met a number of people who knew them. </sentence><sentence id="3019">I stayed in the local hotel. </sentence><sentence id="3020">And later when I came back with mother, a second time, you know, I mentioned her friends were there. </sentence><sentence id="3021">But before that... but you always have this feeling generated by the notion that no one there that's still alive, they're all very embarrassed, maybe guilty about what happened. </sentence><sentence id="3022">And I guess most of them would say they didn't know anything about it, just like the people who lived near Dachau and Buchenwald and saw the smoke, and were looking the other way or knew, probably most of them knew what was happening or many people certainly knew what was happening in Germany. </sentence><sentence id="3023">Many were very sympathetic to the whole idea of Hitler and were very supportive of him all the way through, certainly when they thought they were going to win the war. </sentence><sentence id="3024">So, I'm sure I think that I had some of those mixed feelings and wasn't, I was younger then, that interested particularly in trying to 40   USHMM Archives RG-50.549.05*0007 41 dig up a lot of Jewish history. </sentence><sentence id="3025">Well for one thing Magdeburg was not in...

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3045">A: It was in the East zone. </sentence><sentence id="3046">It was in the Russian zone, so we couldn't go. </sentence><sentence id="3047">We couldn't go until the Berlin Wall came down. </sentence><sentence id="3048">So I couldn't go when I was in the Service or after that. </sentence><sentence id="3049">We... I did not go to Leer. </sentence><sentence id="3050">I don't know why I did not really ever try to go to Leer. </sentence><sentence id="3051">My wife, Jean and her mother, when they drove down from Sweden on a European tour, went through there Leer once to see. </sentence><sentence id="3052">I have a film at home that was made by a Jewish film maker about a reunion about the Jewish community from Leer, when Leer hosted the Jewish community for a reconciliation weekend and he happened to be there and made a film of that. </sentence><sentence id="3053">He's in Israel now, I think. </sentence><sentence id="3054">But I have that film and Leer's a little bigger than it was. </sentence><sentence id="3055">Then I have a family history that you can have or a family tree and there's a letter from a distant cousin in Virginia, who sort of got into the genealogy and he went back to a number of these places where my father's mother, the rabbis and traced some of that history back. </sentence><sentence id="3056">And went to Leer and all of those small towns where my grandmother came from and her family came from. </sentence><sentence id="3057">I guess | did not have anything that was really driving me to do that. </sentence><sentence id="3058">I think when you get to be older, you sort of start thinking, somebody... which is one my interests in talking with you, it is important to preserve that history and it's nice to have it and to know about it. </sentence><sentence id="3059">I'm sure it has some impact on all our lives, but I didn't do very much of that when I was in the Service. </sentence><sentence id="3060">There was, I'm sure, still a lot of hostility, feelings, even though my mother and... my father and my mother did go back to Germany. </sentence><sentence id="3061">They went once or twice. </sentence><sentence id="3062">And my dad did not feel, I don't think he was... I mean they went several summers in their retirement to Austria. </sentence><sentence id="3063">And they had been to Vienna on their honeymoon. </sentence><sentence id="3064">So I don't think their feelings were so strong. </sentence><sentence id="3065">And my mother, as I said, kept up her correspondence with some of her friends. </sentence><sentence id="3066">So, anyway, that... </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3089">Q: So what compelled you to go back was kind of, was it just a kind of curiosity to see the place? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="3091">Or did you have any... </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3092">A: Well, the trips to Germany, the formal, were generally military. </sentence><sentence id="3093">We had an airplane. </sentence><sentence id="3094">We were flying into bases in Germany and had business there of one sort or another, training missions. </sentence><sentence id="3095">I didn't really just go there to sightsee. </sentence><sentence id="3096">I mean I was there for a reason and then generally we stayed over, as we did in other European places. </sentence><sentence id="3097">I had some distant relatives in Paris, which I went to see for family connections, who are related to my mother, two older brothers. </sentence><sentence id="3098">But I think there is, you know, and maybe the local explorations were kind of curiosity, but it was more looking at this cathedral or... the towns that I wasn't familiar with, I didn't... I went to Oberstein, I really went to Oberstein, to mother's home town because I happened to be there in survival training in that area and didn't realize how close it was. </sentence><sentence id="3099">I think I was not yet on any...whether I would have gone there otherwise, I'm not sure. </sentence><sentence id="3100">I might have. </sentence><sentence id="3101">I think I had some idea. </sentence><sentence id="3102">I knew mother was still in touch with her contemporaries. </sentence><sentence id="3103">Even though my father had no connections to anybody in Magdeburg. </sentence><sentence id="3104">Most of their friends that were alive had come to this country. </sentence><sentence id="3105">So, there wasn't much reason to go, other than maybe trying to determine what the status was of the Jewish community. </sentence><sentence id="3106">Going to Israel of course was a voluntary, it was a vacation thing for me. </sentence><sentence id="3107">Going to Paris. </sentence><sentence id="3108">I think I didn't go out of my way to go to Germany. </sentence><sentence id="3109">41    USHMM Archives RG-50.549.05*0007 42 </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3131">A: Oh, I think it was a wonderful... it was wonderful to be there. </sentence><sentence id="3132">And I felt really proud of what had been done. </sentence><sentence id="3133">I never... my father was a very strong Zionist. </sentence><sentence id="3134">And I felt very strongly and still do about a Jewish homeland there. </sentence><sentence id="3135">But I didn't really, I think with your parents, I never considered, I think, living far from where my parents lived, either there... I mean sort of staying in Israel while they were here. </sentence><sentence id="3136">Just like in this country, I thought, I went to law school in Colorado one summer and went to other places. </sentence><sentence id="3137">And unless you have the means to get back and forth every weekend or something, you'd want to be... I always thought we belonged in the east. </sentence><sentence id="3138">To be near them. </sentence><sentence id="3139">So, Israel is certainly, Jean went with me. </sentence><sentence id="3140">I'd like to go back again. </sentence><sentence id="3141">It's a great accomplishment. </sentence><sentence id="3142">And it is, it's part of our history. </sentence><sentence id="3143">And it's especially nice to have when you have relatives who are there, I mean they were part of the family, being that close, being my father's sister. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3164">A: I think I always had a very strong feeling about allegiance to America or patriotism. </sentence><sentence id="3165">I mean that goes back to my parents coming here. </sentence><sentence id="3166">You know, I think as you get older, when events like Vietnam happens, you question it the way any other... the value of that action or any other action that the country takes as a nation, intervening in other wars or as a world leader and the limits to which you would want to go, that people go to in the name of... that actions that we take as Americans against other countries, or whatever we do in our official nature. </sentence><sentence id="3167">As an American, I mean, as a responsible citizen should do, but I have certainly never gave it any thought. </sentence><sentence id="3168">I mean, I think as I said, when we were on alert for a week and didn't know whose side we were on, I thought that's not a way I want to spend my life. </sentence><sentence id="3169">I think if it were a little clearer than that I might have stayed in the military just because of the very close associations I had with the people that I was in the Service with. </sentence><sentence id="3170">I mean we were just very, very good friends. </sentence><sentence id="3171">And when you do things together and rely on each other in situations I suppose that are somewhat dangerous, and you become very close. </sentence><sentence id="3172">It doesn't have to be just on the battlefield. </sentence><sentence id="3173">Even when you are doing training exercises that are, that involve some danger, in which you act as a team. </sentence><sentence id="3174">And then you spend a lot of off time together or you're on a base, like a small base out in nowhere in England, you become part of a family in some way. </sentence><sentence id="3175">And so there was, I would have considered that, I just was not... but I decided that I don't know that I'm ready to push the button on Israel for example and start... if we had come in on the other side against Israel, I would have been in a terrible predicament. </sentence><sentence id="3176">And wouldn't want to find myself in that predicament. </sentence><sentence id="3177">And then after I married a Quaker, I left my tennis shoes at the Pentagon Athletic Club and never went back to get them. </sentence><sentence id="3178">You know, I probably have a much more, in some ways a different outlook about the value of violence and the value of military actions to some extent. </sentence><sentence id="3179">It's certainly been moderated. </sentence><sentence id="3180">I wouldn't at all call myself a pacifist. </sentence><sentence id="3181">But I don't know, anyway, that's, I certainly think I would certainly consider myself a very, very much an American citizen. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3200">Q: And when you say you wouldn't call yourself a pacifist, what does that mean? </sentence><sentence id="3201">Does that mean that you... well we'll just leave it at that. </sentence><sentence id="3202">What does that mean? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3206">A: Well, I think, you know, philosophically you obviously, Quakers, if you take that position, take a strong pacifist position, you are in a sense ready to die when someone points a weapon at someone you love and is ready to pull a trigger. </sentence><sentence id="3207">And you're not going to interfere with that sort of situation. </sentence><sentence id="3208">Or you feel that there is never any justification for violent action. </sentence><sentence id="3209">And I don't think I'm in that place. </sentence><sentence id="3210">I mean I think there probably are situations where you may find yourself willing to react violently or to take up arms against somebody else under certain situations, under those situations. </sentence><sentence id="3211">Like a war. </sentence><sentence id="3212">And you use a war to end a war. ( </sentence><sentence id="3213">Laughing.) </sentence><sentence id="3214">I think that's probably still in my, I think it's the last resort, and not one that I would promote, but I don't think I could easily stand by, and stand there. </sentence><sentence id="3215">Of course, I joined the, I was in the Air Force voluntarily, no one drafted me. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3232">Q: In general in the whole... there were some criticisms that were voiced, especially just immediately following the war by Bruno Bettelheim and others that the Jews had gone like sheep to the slaughter. </sentence><sentence id="3233">And that they had not resisted enough. </sentence><sentence id="3234">That this was a problem with the Jewish people, that they were not ready enough to take up arms to defend themselves. </sentence><sentence id="3235">And I'm wondering if you, if you shared that point of view or if you were aware that people thought that, or if you have any thoughts about that? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3240">A: I don't, I am not familiar with that. </sentence><sentence id="3241">And I mean I think it's probably... I don't see how anybody could take that position because the Germans were so, they were armed. </sentence><sentence id="3242">They were so superior. </sentence><sentence id="3243">There were those courageous, there were some of those acts, you know, in several concentration camps where the Jews broke out or had plotted to leave and some did escape. </sentence><sentence id="3244">I don't know the name of those camps. </sentence><sentence id="3245">And there were individual acts of resistance. </sentence><sentence id="3246">I don't think, I don't see how anybody could have said that. </sentence><sentence id="3247">I mean I've read an awful lot about and heard a lot about Jews who were made to sort of cooperate and throw the bodies away, or how much were you willing to do to stay alive? </sentence><sentence id="3248">Because the camps also, the camps themselves were operated in a large part by slave labor, which was pretty horrible, and some of the work that people had to do was pretty horrible. </sentence><sentence id="3249">And they were doing it partly to stay alive or they could have gotten shot under the circumstances. </sentence><sentence id="3250">And I'm sure people right down to the last second feel like, as some would say, I was trying to stay alive and hope everybody would, that people understand it. </sentence><sentence id="3251">Whether you are the person who's going down the list and saying this, and have some decision making about who's going to die and who's going to live, or whether you're out there and, where you're effectively making those decisions, hoping to keep yourself off the list. </sentence><sentence id="3252">Or whether you're actually throwing bodies in a pit or doing some other kind of maintenance work, you're under the gun. </sentence><sentence id="3253">I don't think you can ever, I don't see how any, I mean I do see, but I would never want to be critical of anybody who is doing that when they're essentially forced to do it. </sentence><sentence id="3254">The people who would say go ahead and shoot me, and let somebody shoot them, are heroes of a different sort, I suppose. </sentence><sentence id="3255">And heroines of different sorts, when you do those sorts of things on principle. </sentence><sentence id="3256">And that's how, I guess, principles are established over time. </sentence><sentence id="3257">But it's expecting a lot from someone. </sentence><sentence id="3258">And I think there is an element of forgiveness, generally in our tradition and in other traditions. </sentence><sentence id="3259">You may have to take an extreme measure to save yourself. </sentence><sentence id="3260">You can't expect people to lay down. </sentence><sentence id="3261">So I don't think that anyone could accuse the Jews of being... if that means going like lambs to the slaughter. </sentence><sentence id="3262">I mean they didn't have, most of those, most families weren't armed. </sentence><sentence id="3263">My father never allowed us to have any weapon. </sentence><sentence id="3264">He almost bought me a BB gun once and then somebody had gotten a window shot out in the neighborhood and I never got my BB gun. </sentence><sentence id="3265">But we never had a gun in the house. </sentence><sentence id="3266">And he wouldn't let us have weapons. </sentence><sentence id="3267">That was one of the no-no's, one of the few no-no's. </sentence></p></dialogue>

Israel, this country was very supportive of Israel. </sentence><sentence id="3312">So, I just think probably in our eyes, it might be a stretch to say the country could do no wrong, but pretty close to it. </sentence><sentence id="3313">And that we were ready pretty much to accept the way things were going and felt pretty good about it. </sentence><sentence id="3314">I mean I think we felt, I'm sure my parents felt, my dad, that we had come a long way. </sentence><sentence id="3315">He was working hard, his son was going to college, his younger brother was doing well in school. </sentence><sentence id="3316">I don't think the politics... my father read the paper religiously. </sentence><sentence id="3317">He was a very educated person and he had very strong views of his own about, he was very much of an anti-Communist. </sentence><sentence id="3318">He did not, he always preached that Communism wouldn't work, that you couldn't expect it to and that he thought it was a very repressive system, not only for religion, but for human beings, he thought Communism was terrible. </sentence><sentence id="3319">And, I mean he didn't get out on the street corners, but... he wasn't himself involved in any politics at home. </sentence><sentence id="3320">He voted, he had very strong views, but as I say, he was very much of a private person. </sentence><sentence id="3321">And I think the way in many small, southern towns, politics isn't top of the agenda normally. </sentence><sentence id="3322">I mean you lead a pretty insulated, very provincial sort of life. </sentence><sentence id="3323">Unless you are... especially if you are in a working-class family. </sentence><sentence id="3324">So I don't think I was very politically astute. </sentence><sentence id="3325">I mean, and as I say, I didn't have the first thought about any problem about joining the ROTC. </sentence><sentence id="3326">I guess I might have thought it was a good thing to do, as far as trying to serve the country, you'd get tuition, be able to contribute a little bit. </sentence></p></dialogue>

I think we had three or four African-Americans in our class. </sentence><sentence id="3394">It had all... the first in North Carolina, that barrier had been broken to some extent. </sentence><sentence id="3395">But it was going on, and the Freedom Rides were happening and I think we were all conscious of what was going on. </sentence><sentence id="3396">And Julius was just an exemplary young man, and did a wonderful, was a great model. </sentence><sentence id="3397">Worked terribly hard. </sentence><sentence id="3398">We were, there were a few of us who were good friends, who were friends with him. </sentence><sentence id="3399">There was still... I don't know that it was open hostility, because he was such a quiet guy, and who was always first in his class, so there wasn't, I don't think there was a lot of hostility directed towards him, as such, except the racial. </sentence><sentence id="3400">I mean, people, student body from, law school students are pretty conservative anyway, but the students from eastern North Carolina, who were from the segregated, the Black Belt of North Carolina, were certainly still not, I think, as a group, sympathetic to having the law school desegregated. </sentence><sentence id="3401">We never had any particularly violent, any incidents while I was there. </sentence><sentence id="3402">But anyway, I think that period, it wasn't so much when I was selling chemicals, I mean I was, really had, I think I was just... law school might have been in the back of my mind, but in the Northeast, things were not as clear. </sentence><sentence id="3403">And I was focused on my work and being single and living in Philadelphia and having a good time when I wasn't working. </sentence><sentence id="3404">And it was not a major kind of issue for me. </sentence><sentence id="3405">It was nothing I spent my time on before I went to law school. </sentence><sentence id="3406">And I think law school made you aware of that, especially in the context of my experience in the military, that the South... that we had to do... you know, that things would have to change in the South. </sentence><sentence id="3407">They ought to change in the South, because if you were from places like Gastonia, where I grew up or you liked your hometown, and you liked being a Southerner and you saw the good things that the South had to offer, that this racial situation had to change. </sentence><sentence id="3408">It might have to be forced to make those changes. </sentence><sentence id="3409">But I think I began to think about trying to do something, use, having the law, using the law to help do that. </sentence><sentence id="3410">I don't know that it was all very clear when I first started in law school. </sentence><sentence id="3411">Because I really wasn't sure... I decided to go to law school only... it probably, that may have been in the back of my mind, but I think once I had been selling chemicals for a year, it just wasn't terribly fulfilling. </sentence><sentence id="3412">Or if you're a good salesperson if you like to sell and you like people and can sell anytime. </sentence><sentence id="3413">You can always sell one 3 Julius LeVonne Chambers, 1936--. </sentence><sentence id="3414">Lawyer and civil rights activist, first African-American editor-in-chief of the North Carolina Law Review.46   USHMM Archives RG-50.549.05*0007 47 product or another. </sentence><sentence id="3415">I still had the G.I.

I think that being in law school and remembering my experiences in the Service probably had a lot to do, it just sort of came together as a way of having me ultimately decide that... I mean when I first went to law school I didn't even know if I could get through law school because it was such a big change. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3471">Q: Why did you choose law school in particular? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3473">A: I think I wanted to, well, I wanted to use my head in a... more of an intellectual capacity. </sentence><sentence id="3474">And I thought that, and I liked... I don't know if I took a bunch of interest tests. </sentence><sentence id="3475">I wasn't so sure. </sentence><sentence id="3476">I was doing fine in this sales work. </sentence><sentence id="3477">And I was about to be moved to New York City to take up where, a big area, Long Island, New York, where another representative was getting ready to retire. </sentence><sentence id="3478">You know, I wish I could say, well I wanted to go to law school so I could help, so I could go to work for the Civil Rights Division of the Department of Justice. </sentence><sentence id="3479">But I don't think that was quite the way it was. </sentence><sentence id="3480">I think I wanted to go to law school because it seemed like a good way to... it would be a good skill to have. </sentence><sentence id="3481">It would be a challenge to become a lawyer. </sentence><sentence id="3482">I think I knew enough to know, I knew enough that the legal system was a logical way of thinking. </sentence><sentence id="3483">A lot of people who are mathematicians or who have scientific backgrounds seem to like that. </sentence><sentence id="3484">I had some interest in... I say at one point I thought about even being a rabbi. </sentence><sentence id="3485">And in terms of interests it just seemed to fit with my general outlook on a good way to use the G.I. Bill and to go back to North Carolina and go to school. </sentence><sentence id="3486">It does sound kind of... I was making, I think when I first went to, it was a period of time when a lot of veterans were back in school. </sentence><sentence id="3487">And there was in fact sitting, this nice educational package to do something with, for a few years if you had something in your mind. </sentence><sentence id="3488">If you could afford it. </sentence><sentence id="3489">If you could use it. </sentence><sentence id="3490">It wouldn't pay for everything, but... So it seemed to me, I was single. </sentence><sentence id="3491">It was kind of like... I don't know why my sister decided to go to law school after twenty years as an architect. </sentence><sentence id="3492">I mean it was just, I think it was something like that. </sentence><sentence id="3493">It might be nice to change, do something different. </sentence><sentence id="3494">I could always sell chemicals. </sentence><sentence id="3495">I don't think it had anything necessarily to do with my Jewishness or the Holocaust. </sentence><sentence id="3496">It just was, I think I decided, I mean sales people spend their time going from, if you're traveling, whether it's chemicals or something else, going from one large corporation to another, sitting in somebody's waiting room until they're ready to see you, having, maybe going, having a big lunch, but having an hour or two discuss talking about your product and their product and how they might use it and why they aren't buying as much as they ought to or whether, all the things about your product that are better than the competition's. </sentence><sentence id="3497">And then you go on to someplace else. </sentence><sentence id="3498">And you might stay in nice hotels and eat nice big, eat lots of steaks, looking back on it. </sentence><sentence id="3499">But it isn't particularly challenging and it's not, and you also do not become, you don't have a community. </sentence><sentence id="3500">I think that was one of the things that bothered me too, in Philadelphia when I was thinking back about it. </sentence><sentence id="3501">I remember it bothered me back then to some extent, although I wasn't as conscious of that as lam now. </sentence><sentence id="3502">And that is that the people who I worked with, the executives, worked in Philadelphia, but they all lived in suburbia and suburban communities. </sentence><sentence id="3503">And so they were not at all concerned about the inner city of Philadelphia. </sentence><sentence id="3504">It was not their community. </sentence><sentence id="3505">And so I, which I think, in many of our urban areas gave really rise to the decay, to having those communities go downhill, until you found some rebirth in those communities. </sentence><sentence id="3506">And that's what's nice, of course, about small towns, which is what I prefer anyway. </sentence><sentence id="3507">But, and so I think I was not particularly happy with that way of life, living down, in my sales job. </sentence><sentence id="3508">I think I was looking for 47   USHMM Archives RG-50.549.05*0007 48 something else to do and hadn't really... I had not, there didn't seem to be anything I had a real burning desire to do. </sentence><sentence id="3509">And going back to school seemed like something I wanted to do, but I wasn't sure, probably. </sentence><sentence id="3510">I didn't want to get a Master's in chemistry. </sentence><sentence id="3511">I didn't think I wanted to spend my life... I spent three months in a research lab. </sentence><sentence id="3512">That particular organization that I worked for was a, you know, they were an excellent company. </sentence><sentence id="3513">They were very... and before you even became a sales representative, you were in the labs for three months, working on products with their own laboratory people. </sentence><sentence id="3514">So, you got a sense of what that life is like and what they can do and the sort of support they can give, and so if you're throwing out theories about what might be possible with your product, somebody there could, would be available and that sort of thing. </sentence><sentence id="3515">I think all of that just sort of moved, it just seemed like a good decision. </sentence><sentence id="3516">And after all, since when I went to, if it didn't work out after a year or it didn't work out, I could always do something else. </sentence><sentence id="3517">I didn't have a family attached to me. </sentence><sentence id="3518">But I know, I'm sure, I think that I remember the first couple of months here in law school I wondered what am I doing here. </sentence><sentence id="3519">I was not making any money anymore.

I think, I'm trying to remember whether, I think I had essentially met my obligation. </sentence><sentence id="3526">There was a little money there, but I was interested in maintaining that proficiency. </sentence><sentence id="3527">And was not sort of, you know, kissing the military good bye. </sentence><sentence id="3528">And I belonged to an Air Force Reserve organization in Delaware. </sentence><sentence id="3529">And kept on flying for a year or two. </sentence><sentence id="3530">And then when I came back to law school, when I came to law school, I continued. </sentence><sentence id="3531">And in part it was an income. </sentence><sentence id="3532">At that point it was really partly income and I was a dormitory daddy when I was in law school, keeping, had all of... related to a lot of the Kentucky stuff. </sentence><sentence id="3533">But I was the dormitory daddy I call it, for all the football players at the University of North Carolina. </sentence><sentence id="3534">There are a lot of them and they had a dorm full of players. </sentence><sentence id="3535">And some of them were veterans as well, who were going back to school. </sentence><sentence id="3536">At least two of those years. </sentence><sentence id="3537">So, I think all of that sort of combined to see how it would to go. </sentence><sentence id="3538">And then 1...End of Tape 4, Side A 48   USHMM Archives RG-50.549.05*0007 49 Tape 4, Side B </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="4255">A: Well, she was a very remarkable woman, I thought. </sentence><sentence id="4256">And I read an autobiography about her not too long ago. </sentence><sentence id="4257">She grew up on a farm and was not a very well-educated person, but she was a very, became a very fiery person, and spoke at the Democratic National Convention. </sentence><sentence id="4258">I mean I think she was very disappointed. </sentence><sentence id="4259">I think there was a lot of criticism by the activist blacks at the time, not just in this case, about why the government wasn't doing more. </sentence><sentence id="4260">And so I think she sort of took this loss as one of many losses along the way. </sentence><sentence id="4261">There was a voting rights case in Sunflower County...you know, we were lawyers who spent a lot of time in the community, but we would go back to Washington. </sentence><sentence id="4262">And one of the demands that was never met and probably 3! </sentence><sentence id="4263">St. John Barrett served in the Civil Rights Division from 1957-1967. </sentence><sentence id="4264">56    USHMM Archives RG-50.549.05*0007 57 rightly so, was the blacks wanted more protections. </sentence><sentence id="4265">They wanted federal marshals when they went to register. </sentence><sentence id="4266">And they wanted more lawyers, and Congress wasn't going to do that. </sentence><sentence id="4267">And there was still the question of how much, what do the states do and what the federal government does and the evolving law. </sentence><sentence id="4268">And I think SNCC, we, oftentimes those of us who were there in our coats and ties and with our federal ID badges, some of the more activist people thought we were just sort of window dressing. </sentence><sentence id="4269">And you know, it was not the same as direct action. </sentence><sentence id="4270">And eventually I think Martin Luther King certainly demonstrated that marching and non-violence was the key to success. </sentence><sentence id="4271">That mobilizing blacks themselves, in the march in Selma... I mean I think all of these things that were going on were part of the big picture. </sentence><sentence id="4272">I think the Division had a very prominent role, a very pronounced role that isn't always recognized. </sentence><sentence id="4273">Not just because I was there, because I think we demonstrated that the court, that using the court system was extremely slow and wasn't going to answer this... that we could win one little case at a time, but, and that was doing some good. </sentence><sentence id="4274">And we were starting to... that that was helping. </sentence><sentence id="4275">And it also gave blacks some confidence to win. </sentence><sentence id="4276">But for the broader picture to change, we also helped write the Voting Rights Act of 1965. </sentence><sentence id="4277">That Congress... you had to do more than that. </sentence><sentence id="4278">And I think the civil rights, I think in a lot of these struggles, things like whether it's the Wall coming down or whatever it is, someone, it always seems to take an incident like the civil rights workers" death*?to wake people up, unfortunately. </sentence><sentence id="4279">I mean it's, there are mining disasters that cause the mine safety laws to come in. </sentence><sentence id="4280">The three... the publicity in Selma, in Birmingham with the water hoses. </sentence><sentence id="4281">It all, I think, helped mobilize the country to change things. </sentence><sentence id="4282">We started, I mean I think the conviction of the civil rights workers in 1964, which took a great deal of help by this all-white jury in Mississippi and by, where you had a presiding federal judge, who was clearly a segregationist: Senator Eastland's roommate, Judge Cox**. </sentence><sentence id="4283">I think he said, "This is enough, and he's going to have a fair trial." </sentence><sentence id="4284">And that was a little step along the way. </sentence><sentence id="4285">It took a great deal of work. </sentence></p></dialogue>

I've got some photos I can show you that I still have from, like from Louisiana. </sentence><sentence id="4365">I spent a summer in Bogalusa, where the Klan had been taking a lot of action, was upset because, initially because a relatively moderate congressman had been invited to come to speak: Brooks Hays(tm)*. </sentence><sentence id="4366">And the Klan rallied. </sentence><sentence id="4367">And they threatened to boycott stores that were going to sell to blacks. </sentence><sentence id="4368">And there were a number of civil rights marches during the summer, that summer with James Farmer and others**. </sentence><sentence id="4369">And I was, spent the summer there, basically observing marches, interviewing people and getting the facts together for an action that we were, eventually filed against the Klan in federal court to get an injunction against them from doing, interfering any further. </sentence><sentence id="4370">Again it was tied to voting and to public accommodations and employment. </sentence><sentence id="4371">So in many of these cases in those earlier years I had a... my immediate boss was a fellow named Bob Owen, who was from Texas and who passed away a few years ago*deg. </sentence><sentence id="4372">He was involved in some of those trials. </sentence><sentence id="4373">He was in charge of Mississippi. </sentence><sentence id="4374">There was somebody in charge of Mississippi, somebody in charge of Alabama and somebody...

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="4417">A: The Neshoba County case, there were a number of us who did investigative work, both in the black community... we had a lot of FBI agents. </sentence><sentence id="4418">And initially the Bureau reports turned up a lot of other examples of police brutality. </sentence><sentence id="4419">And when we convened the first grand jury, there were some indictments about other cases, not involving the three civil rights workers, because there was not yet any clear confession to who had done that or what had happened. </sentence><sentence id="4420">The grand jury, 34 Lawrence Brooks Hays, 1898-1981. </sentence><sentence id="4421">Representative from Arkansas 1943-1959. </sentence><sentence id="4422">Special Assistant to President of the U.S. from 1961-1964.35 James Farmer, 1920-1999. </sentence><sentence id="4423">Civil rights leader and advocate for non-violent social action.(c) Bob Owen, 1930-1981. </sentence><sentence id="4424">Served in the Civil Rights Division from 1958 to 1969.58    USHMM Archives RG-50.549.05*0007 59 that one or the second one...

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="4759">A: It was William Eskridge. </sentence><sentence id="4760">I don't know about the son. </sentence><sentence id="4761">Did we meet the son who he was in school with? </sentence><sentence id="4762">Actually I have some pictures at home. </sentence><sentence id="4763">It was not maybe three years ago. </sentence><sentence id="4764">The reason I said he died, I think somebody told me. </sentence><sentence id="4765">One of the school classes in Holmes County, which is nearby, one of the high schools did a little project, they put a booklet together on sort of oral histories about black leaders in their area a few years ago. </sentence><sentence id="4766">And it made its way to one of the legal services people who was living there. </sentence><sentence id="4767">And they sent it to me and there was an interview of Mr. Eskridge, who recalled the case we did. </sentence><sentence id="4768">I guess that's really about it, except about, on this thing... we just saw those situations repeated over and over. </sentence><sentence id="4769">Every county went to wherever the government was involved. </sentence><sentence id="4770">And today in legal services, I mean whenever you have a movement or you have an issue like this, someone is going to, or some group is going to try, is going to stand out initially to see, try to help people get justice, or to see that the right result comes about. </sentence><sentence id="4771">So, you have leaders like, you may never hear about Mr. Eskridge in Carroll County. </sentence><sentence id="4772">You might hear about some of the more prominent, you probably hear about Mrs., some of the people, who went to the national scene, like Aaron Henry in Clarksdale, Mississippi, who was President of the NAACP, also*". </sentence><sentence id="4773">Who's a very prominent figure and who continued to be a prominent figure after these, in later days when the Voting Rights Act was passed and blacks did get the right to vote. </sentence><sentence id="4774">Then if you go to Mississippi today, you see the number of black legislators, who are in the Mississippi legislature. </sentence><sentence id="4775">And that you had some part in, you see how far it's come. </sentence><sentence id="4776">So there are a lot of unsung heroes, I think, like Mr. Eskridge, in all these cases.(r)deg Nick Flannery served in Civil Rights Division from 1958 to 1970. </sentence><sentence id="4777">4 Aaron Henry, 1922-1977. </sentence><sentence id="4778">Became Mississippi state president of the NAACP in 1959.63    USHMM Archives RG-50.549.05*0007 64 </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="4801">Q: I wanted to ask you kind of a general question. </sentence><sentence id="4802">I'm going to try to phrase it clearly, but it might not... take a little while. </sentence><sentence id="4803">You mentioned something earlier about living in the South and how you wanted to live in the South and in a way you were proud of being a Southerner and you were aware of the things that were good and were motivated to be there because of that... to change some of the things that were not as good. </sentence><sentence id="4804">I have kind of the idea that so many Northerners and maybe particularly Jews, who lived in the North, felt that the South was backwards and controlled by the Klan and there would be too much anti-Semitism and too much maybe lack of culture or something, putting it crudely or maybe over-exaggerating. </sentence><sentence id="4805">But I'm wondering what it was that you saw about living in the South that was so positive, that made yourself identify as a Southerner and motivated you in this whole endeavor? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="4811">A: I think it's the same to some extent what you see in small towns. </sentence><sentence id="4812">I think--or the rural areas-- you get this, I mean in a simplistic way, the idea that people accept you for who you are. </sentence><sentence id="4813">Asa salesman I always used to say in the South if you have a customer, they're going to initially assume you are telling the truth and will take you, at face value, what you say, and will welcome you in, and be happy to spend the time of day. </sentence><sentence id="4814">And if you are fair with them, you can have a long lasting relationship as you would with anyone else. </sentence><sentence id="4815">Whereas, if you were in the urban areas of the North, and then again this is very simplistic and probably not true in the sense that you can generalize, but I'm sure it indicates some of the way that I think and others think. </sentence><sentence id="4816">In the Northern, when I was selling chemicals, I think in the North people say "This guy is a salesman, he's out to get us and he's going to be a con man or con woman of one sort or another." </sentence><sentence id="4817">And they have a much harsher attitude. </sentence><sentence id="4818">And maybe because these towns are, these cities are so big, are not interested normally in forming another relationship and welcoming someone from another place that has nothing to do with where they live. </sentence><sentence id="4819">I think the camaraderie of communities, the fact that people are, whether it is a slower pace. </sentence><sentence id="4820">People do have an interest in where they live and in making it, and in the sense of place where they are. </sentence><sentence id="4821">I think that's maybe true of smaller communities across the board. </sentence><sentence id="4822">I'm sure it's true in New Hampshire and Vermont and in smaller places up North, but it was true of the South. </sentence><sentence id="4823">Much has been written about the South, I'm sure you're familiar with literature of the South. </sentence><sentence id="4824">And I think there is some of that commonality. </sentence><sentence id="4825">It's like when I was in the Civil Rights Division, being a Southerner, itself, was probably helpful... it was helpful, I'm sure in many ways, especially in dealing with white officials. </sentence><sentence id="4826">I mean not that you would necessarily be their buddy, but they sure couldn't... There's something about being able to say, "Oh you're from way up there in New York or you're from...you don't belong here." </sentence><sentence id="4827">I mean, the South, I'm not proud of the Confederacy, but it's part of its history. </sentence><sentence id="4828">And to that extent, I think that's why... I mean I like the tradition and the atmosphere and the welcoming of those communities, they were... with my family. </sentence><sentence id="4829">We were strangers in this county, in Spartanburg and in Gastonia, and it became our home. </sentence><sentence id="4830">And I think that it made a great deal of difference. </sentence><sentence id="4831">And I suppose, I don't know, I haven't read as much about that, but we had many associations and many more friends who were not Jewish than the ones who were, probably because of our, because of the economics of the situation. </sentence><sentence id="4832">I mean in a sense you have a sort of a class system, keeping up with the Joneses. </sentence><sentence id="4833">Those people were well off and they were friends in the synagogue and were always very nice, but we weren't... they would, you know, go to Florida, or they would travel, and do things that my family, my parents didn't do, because we couldn't afford it, because they weren't interested in it. </sentence><sentence id="4834">So, I think that's the way it is. </sentence><sentence id="4835">I mean, it's the same way I feel about being here in some ways. </sentence><sentence id="4836">Been here almost thirty years and it's become home. </sentence><sentence id="4837">And I think the people here share that same kind of feeling about their place and 64   USHMM Archives RG-50.549.05*0007 65 their community, and Appalachia, it's different than North Carolina, but it's the same sort of environment. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="4867">Q: Did your work change a whole lot after the Civil Rights Act passed? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="4869">A: In the Division? </sentence><sentence id="4870">Well, we had more work in more areas. </sentence><sentence id="4871">And after I worked in the Deep South, I became a Chief of what was called the Western Section. </sentence><sentence id="4872">I started doing some cases in Texas and in Nevada. </sentence><sentence id="4873">I litigated a case against the Electrical Workers Union in Las Vegas, believe it or not. </sentence><sentence id="4874">They didn't want to let blacks, who were electricians, into the union. </sentence><sentence id="4875">Steel workers in Los Angeles. </sentence><sentence id="4876">In my section in Texas, I didn't have any... well, I did, spent the last two years or three years in a case against the Houston school system. </sentence><sentence id="4877">A big desegregation case involving the Houston school system. </sentence><sentence id="4878">We moved to Houston for several months, prepared this case that I tried. </sentence><sentence id="4879">But it had been an ongoing case in Houston. </sentence><sentence id="4880">And then I was also, I guess I became the Chief of what is known as the Criminal Section of the Civil Rights Division. </sentence><sentence id="4881">Which is the section that has responsibility for the police brutality cases, these conspiracy cases like the civil rights workers. </sentence><sentence id="4882">I didn't, I was in charge of that and had a group of lawyers working with me and for me and the FBI. </sentence><sentence id="4883">And the last thing I did was direct an investigation into the Kent State case. </sentence><sentence id="4884">But that's about the time I left, so I didn't really get involved in very many more trials. </sentence><sentence id="4885">The Houston case took a couple of years, off and on. </sentence><sentence id="4886">I think I was actually the... was I the Chief of the Western Section? </sentence><sentence id="4887">Maybe part of it was still going on when I was Chief of the Criminal Section. </sentence><sentence id="4888">In all these, by that time the Division had gotten a lot bigger and it was sort of a re- organization and I had eight or ten lawyers working under me. </sentence><sentence id="4889">And we were doing cases around the United States. </sentence><sentence id="4890">After the Civil Rights Act and then the Voting Rights Act was 1965, then I was in what we called the Southeastern section, that was Alabama and Louisiana. </sentence><sentence id="4891">And I did spend some time in Louisiana working on the, when they first brought in federal observers to watch elections, because under the Voting Rights Act people could register automatically by signing their name. </sentence><sentence id="4892">In those southern states were covered by that. </sentence><sentence id="4893">Then in 1964, the case that Jean was talking about, we had a case in Selma, Alabama, which was the first... I'm sorry it was 1965. </sentence><sentence id="4894">It was the first case under the Voting Rights Act in Selma, where they were still using paper ballots. </sentence><sentence id="4895">And it was the first election in which black officials, where blacks had been appointed to be election officials. </sentence><sentence id="4896">And it was very interesting. </sentence><sentence id="4897">Jim Clark, who was the Sheriff of Selma and had been such a repressive force in Selma, was running for re-election. </sentence><sentence id="4898">There was a moderate named Wilson Baker.*! </sentence><sentence id="4899">The election officials who were black had never done that and they were counting all these ballots and they wanted to be sure, they were trying to be careful. </sentence><sentence id="4900">And it was taking them a very long time to finish counting the ballots at the end of the day. </sentence><sentence id="4901">And all the boxes had come back in from the white precincts. </sentence><sentence id="4902">And so the executive committee met, which was an all-white, democratic executive committee and they decided they would impound all of the... there must be something wrong, these people are taking too long. </sentence><sentence id="4903">There must be some sort of fraud going on. </sentence><sentence id="4904">So they went out and impounded all those ballots. </sentence><sentence id="4905">And the next day decided that they would, the fair thing to do is not to count the ballots in those boxes at all, just leave them out as a group, which had the effect of not counting probably ninety-five percent of the black ballots that had been cast. </sentence><sentence id="4906">So we filed an action under the Voting Rights Act to require them to count those ballots. </sentence><sentence id="4907">We went to federal court and we got a judge named, whose 4! </sentence><sentence id="4908">On May 3, 1966, Jim Clark and Wilson Baker competed to become Sheriff of Dallas County, Alabama. </sentence><sentence id="4909">Baker was the police chief of Selma at the time. </sentence><sentence id="4910">This race was the first primary election held after the passage of the Voting Rights Act. </sentence><sentence id="4911">65    USHMM Archives RG-50.549.05*0007 66 name was Thomas", who had refused to desegregate the Mobile County, Louisiana schools. </sentence><sentence id="4912">Each year he'd do just a little tiny bit and we'd, the government would appeal. </sentence><sentence id="4913">The next year the Court of Appeals would tell him to do something more and he would only do a little tiny bit. </sentence><sentence id="4914">So, he effectively kept them from being desegregated. </sentence><sentence id="4915">But when we put this case on and I tried this case and John, for a change, John told me the day before the trial, he said, "Why don't you try this case, John?" </sentence><sentence id="4916">We had been putting it together. </sentence><sentence id="4917">He was my assistant, if you will. ( </sentence><sentence id="4918">Laughing.) </sentence><sentence id="4919">The objections, some objections, I put the case on and he did the opening and he also did the closing. </sentence><sentence id="4920">He did a very nice job. </sentence><sentence id="4921">And Judge Thomas said that, he required them to count them. </sentence><sentence id="4922">And he said, "You should not deprive a voter of his right to vote based on what might be a technical mistake by an election official. </sentence><sentence id="4923">And we showed that all the ballots were in the boxes. </sentence><sentence id="4924">There was no fraud. </sentence><sentence id="4925">The number of people who signed in to vote equaled the number of ballots. </sentence><sentence id="4926">There might have been one or two slight differences, but basically we proved that all the ballots were there and what they were doing was perfectly good. </sentence><sentence id="4927">There was no reason not to count them. </sentence><sentence id="4928">So he ordered them to be counted and the result was that Jim Clark was out. </sentence><sentence id="4929">We didn't file the action to get Jim Clark declared ineligible or anything. </sentence><sentence id="4930">We filed the suit under the Voting Rights Act, in order to have those votes counted as they ought to be counted, so that their right to vote was protected and their vote would be counted. </sentence><sentence id="4931">But it was the end of Jim Clark as an elected official in the county. </sentence><sentence id="4932">So, I was always very pleased to have participated in that case. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="4998">Q: What year was that? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="5000">A: That was 1960, probably 1966. </sentence><sentence id="5001">I'd say "65, I think the decision was in "66. </sentence><sentence id="5002">Because the Voting Rights Act was passed in 1965, which really changed everything. </sentence><sentence id="5003">I mean, across the South there were black sheriffs, in these counties that had more blacks than whites or heavy black counties. </sentence><sentence id="5004">I think it was really probably the most important legislation in many ways passed anywhere. </sentence><sentence id="5005">Because it really gave blacks the right to vote and changed the political process. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="5012">Q: Did you have anything to do with writing that legislation, the Voting Rights Act? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="5014">A: I, I mean it wasn't me personally, the Division, the lawyers in the Division, John and our appellate section, Burke Marshall, who was at that time not the Assistant Attorney General, but he was still very... became a professor at Yale. </sentence><sentence id="5015">But the lawyers in the Division and in the hierarchy of the Department of Justice... some of that language, some of that Act was based on the court cases that we had bought. </sentence><sentence id="5016">It said if. </sentence><sentence id="5017">certain percentage of voters had not voted and if they used a test or device, like a literacy test, if these various criteria were met then it triggered the application of the Voting Rights Act. </sentence><sentence id="5018">And if that was triggered, the registration process then involved, meant that they had to allow everyone to register by a very simple procedure. </sentence><sentence id="5019">And if they weren't going to do that at the courthouse, they could do it where the federal observers were. </sentence><sentence id="5020">Or that they did it in the courthouse with federal observers looking on. </sentence><sentence id="5021">It is a forced process that covered virtually the entire South. </sentence><sentence id="5022">There was a challenge to the legality of that, that went to the United States Supreme Court, which was upheld. </sentence><sentence id="5023">I think United States versus Louisiana. </sentence><sentence id="5024">Well no, it wasn't Louisiana. </sentence><sentence id="5025">Then there was also, I was involved with the poll tax. </sentence><sentence id="5026">The Southern states used poll taxes to prevent blacks from voting for many years. </sentence><sentence id="5027">And so I filed an action in Mississippi and then I helped the Assistant Attorney General and put together the case against poll tax in Alabama. </sentence><sentence id="5028">Which was a fair amount of my time. </sentence><sentence id="5029">In 1960... the poll tax (r) According to John Doar, the judge's name was Frank Johnson. </sentence><sentence id="5030">66    USHMM Archives RG-50.549.05*0007 67 was probably the Voting Rights Act of "67, after Selma. </sentence><sentence id="5031">In "68, I think we did that case, in Montgomery. </sentence></p></dialogue>

I mean we didn't have the Kennedys come to our wedding, but everybody, a lot of the people from the Justice Department and the Civil Rights Division and our associates. </sentence><sentence id="5173">So, I think they were really, as a general matter, very pleased with what I was doing as a lawyer and the work I did there. </sentence><sentence id="5174">And the work I did here. </sentence><sentence id="5175">I think they would never, there was always the question of why I did I just not go into a law firm and make a whole lot of money? ( </sentence><sentence id="5176">Laughing.) </sentence><sentence id="5177">Why spend your time doing this public service work? </sentence><sentence id="5178">Which people still don't understand, not only about me, but about a lot of other people who work here and work in other programs. </sentence><sentence id="5179">The work that many people in Social Services do and maybe that people do as writers or artists, where they're trying to live out their life in a way they are comfortable with and like, which may not be financially very rewarding. </sentence><sentence id="5180">But that that's not the test for them and probably it ought not to be the test in my mind. </sentence><sentence id="5181">So, it's hard... so I think they were very, you know, when I received some awards later on for my work here and that sort of thing, parents are always going to be happy with something like that. </sentence><sentence id="5182">But I think my dad was kind of a complicated man when it came to the racial thing, because he worked on a daily basis in his factory and I think saw... was not as ready to believe that if you give everybody a chance, that poverty is like a vicious circle. </sentence><sentence id="5183">If you live in a very poor environment you are going to have illiteracy, you're going to have drugs, you're going to have alcohol abuse and substance abuse. </sentence><sentence id="5184">And if you don't look, if you aren't willing to deal with the causes, and you aren't willing to try to deal with the elimination of poverty at that level, it's easy to say, "These folks are always...they're drinking, they could be... they drop out of school, and it's all their fault." </sentence><sentence id="5185">And the next thing you know... and they're certainly true of... there are more poor white people in this country than there are blacks. </sentence><sentence id="5186">But if you look at it as a Southern phenomenon or where you lived... I think that someone like my father, who had a history in the Jewish community, where we're too often too quick to say, "We were able to take care of ourselves despite all this repression. </sentence><sentence id="5187">We came out of Germany, with only the clothes on our backs and nothing in our pocket and look what we did. </sentence><sentence id="5188">Why can't they do the same thing? </sentence><sentence id="5189">The same thing?" </sentence><sentence id="5190">People say, "Look at Asians, Japanese have come to this country and whose kids achieve, who are motivated to achieve." </sentence><sentence id="5191">69    USHMM Archives RG-50.549.05*0007 70 </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="5226">Q: What's your response to that kind of remark? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="5228">A: Well, I mean, I think it's the same sort of driving force, in a way, that says they are, historically have valued education, and have seen that if you get an education, that you are motivated to succeed and you can be someone. </sentence><sentence id="5229">And I think African-Americans see that, too. </sentence><sentence id="5230">But I think, I think, as I say, part of it is a vicious circle, part of it is, that's what Jean does, sometimes it's one at a time, that people who are born into these poor economic circumstances, we have a whole generation, we have several generations of welfare in Eastern Kentucky and in the South. </sentence><sentence id="5231">And it's hard to break that cycle in a variety of situations, people, and we... I don't know that welfare reform isn't all bad. </sentence><sentence id="5232">It can be done, in my mind, and I think Jean's, in a more humane way. </sentence><sentence id="5233">But people have to have some support systems, and if you come out from, if you have a series of generations where education isn't valued, for example in Eastern Kentucky you could get a very good job mining coal, you didn't need an education for years and years and generations, all you had to do... I mean, it was hard work, dangerous work in some ways. </sentence><sentence id="5234">But it was the kind of work that people knew. </sentence><sentence id="5235">It was all manual labor. </sentence><sentence id="5236">As that ends, people don't have those jobs, and they don't have the options, they find themselves in those situations where there is disparity, they have to leave. </sentence><sentence id="5237">And I think the black, in the South, you have the history of segregation for a couple of hundred years, where you don't have equal opportunity. </sentence><sentence id="5238">Where you have terrible schools, and where you're expected to be a sharecropper, really don't have an equal opportunity. </sentence><sentence id="5239">Then you can't have, those children can't have the expectations of being successful. </sentence><sentence id="5240">Now people debate that nationally. </sentence><sentence id="5241">Black leaders debate that, you hear it all the time. " </sentence><sentence id="5242">We can be successful. </sentence><sentence id="5243">We should not have Affirmative Action." </sentence><sentence id="5244">I think Affirmative Action has been a very successful tool. </sentence><sentence id="5245">But the pendulum has swung. </sentence><sentence id="5246">Now you find Justice Thomas*, and you find black leaders who say, "Affirmative Action is unfair. </sentence><sentence id="5247">It's unfair to whites. </sentence><sentence id="5248">It's unfair in that it gives, we don't need an unfair advantage," or to label it as an unfair advantage. </sentence><sentence id="5249">To some extent it's subjective. </sentence><sentence id="5250">Those are my own feelings about... I think you do have to make additional opportunities available to people who have been historically discriminated against. </sentence><sentence id="5251">We have had it and to try to isolate that advantage to those very few situations where you can actually prove that this company discriminated in this bad way and so they're supposed to overcome that. </sentence><sentence id="5252">But I don't, and I don't think my dad, anymore than anybody else, was... I certainly wish he had been more broadminded about that, I'm just saying he's not perfect, none of us are perfect and he had his imperfections and that was one of them. </sentence><sentence id="5253">As far as philosophically, he didn't go around making speeches about it. </sentence><sentence id="5254">But I think he was still proud of what I was doing. </sentence><sentence id="5255">I think it was easy, he would be the first, among others, he would say, "Well they should be, certainly not prevent people," think it was wrong to try to enforce the right to vote or even the right to go to public facilities or to have the same legal rights as everyone else. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="5297">A: (Talkover.) </sentence><sentence id="5298">It's the same thing. </sentence><sentence id="5299">I mean it is essentially the same thing. </sentence><sentence id="5300">In a different way. </sentence><sentence id="5301">I mean it's the mistreatment of blacks, maybe it isn't genocide, but there were certainly the lynching periods when many blacks were killed. </sentence><sentence id="5302">Not in the scale that we're used to here, that was true in the Holocaust. </sentence><sentence id="5303">But I think it's the same thing that motivates, helped to motivate me to work there. </sentence><sentence id="5304">And work in legal services, where you're essentially trying to do something similar to that on an individual basis. </sentence><sentence id="5305">To provide those opportunities so that people are at least even in the courts and that they can find lawyers to advocate their positions, which they, in the courts, which they otherwise wouldn't be able to do. </sentence><sentence id="5306">And I've said many times, I think it's the mark of, a good mark, one of the things that this country ought to be proud of, is the fact that it does fund programs like ours, so that people, and provide lawyers to low-income people. </sentence><sentence id="5307">And even makes it possible to sue the government if necessary, that biting the hand that feeds you, if you have to. </sentence><sentence id="5308">You don't have to do that as much as we did. </sentence><sentence id="5309">But we don't get the funds that we ought to have, that's regrettable. </sentence><sentence id="5310">Just as regrettable as it was that it took so long to get to the days of the civil rights, it took... Brown against the Board of Education is 1954 and we aren't fully at the end of it yet, with regard to higher education. </sentence><sentence id="5311">It takes thirty and forty years. </sentence><sentence id="5312">Court processes are slow. </sentence><sentence id="5313">But I think it all has to do with human rights, treating people, giving everyone the same opportunity, whether they are young or old, or white or black, or... whoever. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="5339">A: I met Jean in the Civil Rights Division of the Department of Justice. </sentence><sentence id="5340">She was, I was the Deputy of the Southeastern Section, which handled Alabama, Mississippi. </sentence><sentence id="5341">No Alabama and not Mississippi, then. </sentence><sentence id="5342">My section chief was Frank Dunbaugh(tm) and Jean came to the section as a research analyst, which she mentioned to you. </sentence><sentence id="5343">They are now called paralegals. </sentence><sentence id="5344">We call them also administrative representatives here. </sentence><sentence id="5345">They do a little different work in my organization. </sentence><sentence id="5346">But John Doar was invited to speak at Earlham College* in Jean's senior year, or maybe her junior year. </sentence><sentence id="5347">Her roommate, Dorothy, now Landsberg, was then named Shelton, was in charge of the speaking program, and for some reason she had heard about John Doar's work and asked him to come to Earlham to speak. </sentence><sentence id="5348">And he came there and then he, I believe first hired Dorothy for the summer to work for him and he also met Jean. </sentence><sentence id="5349">Or she came to, or she came to Washington. </sentence><sentence id="5350">I don't know whether he hired her then. </sentence><sentence id="5351">They were about, they were the two, I think, the first research analysts. </sentence><sentence id="5352">Dorothy later on after I... and so, Jean came to this section and we began working together. </sentence><sentence id="5353">Of course we were sort of... I was second in charge of the section and she was working on cases, and so | think we once... a group of us went on a skiing trip and that was the first time we had any opportunity to be together socially. " </sentence><sentence id="5354">Cause we were still I guess drawing some lines when we were at work. </sentence><sentence id="5355">She was just a new employee and working under, not directly under me, but with some other lawyers in preparing cases. </sentence><sentence id="5356">What they would do is #4 Frank M. Dunbaugh served in the Civil Rights Division from 1958-1978. </sentence><sentence id="5357">45 Earlham College is in Richmond, Indiana.71    USHMM Archives RG-50.549.05*0007 (2 analyze the documents, like the voting records we brought back. </sentence><sentence id="5358">We similarly started doing the same thing with schools. </sentence><sentence id="5359">Normally in a school desegregation case, someone like Jean might go into the Superintendent's office under a court order or voluntarily and start analyzing where the white students and the black students in the county lived and why they were not being assigned... say, it was pretty apparent in the segregated school systems that you'd have, especially where there was bussing, that black children would need to pass a white school to be assigned to their black school. </sentence><sentence id="5360">And to put those patterns together and to analyze how the school system assigned students deliberately, so that white students would be together and black students would continue to be together. </sentence><sentence id="5361">Or route buses in a way that made sure that schools remained segregated. </sentence><sentence id="5362">So they were really analyzing those records, which they would then present to the lawyers. </sentence><sentence id="5363">And the same thing in employment cases, whether, you know, in a large factory, where you looked at the number of applicants for jobs and determined that a black was passed over, even though, let's say that maybe he had made an application to get to a particular job and the company said, "Well you weren't qualified," in another area. </sentence><sentence id="5364">By looking at several of those situations you could look, you'd only know from the records whether the person who was actually put in had the qualifications or not, or whether they passed over someone who was black, or they didn't, the black who had applied was obviously qualified, or less qualified than the person they hired. </sentence><sentence id="5365">That kind of analysis, which was then given to the lawyers. </sentence><sentence id="5366">So, that's what Jean was hired to do. </sentence><sentence id="5367">And then we, later on when we were, she had worked there about a year... well, let's see. </sentence><sentence id="5368">It might not have even been a year. </sentence><sentence id="5369">When we went to Alabama on this voting rights case, the Jim Clark case, Jean was there with me. </sentence><sentence id="5370">She was involved in some records analysis. </sentence><sentence id="5371">And I almost, we were not yet married, but I almost had to put her on the stand, but I didn't. </sentence><sentence id="5372">And there were a couple of other situations where she ended up in a place where, in a case that I was working on, where we began to suspect that John Doar was deliberately sending her to cases that I was working on, since we had started dating or people knew that we had sort of started dating. </sentence><sentence id="5373">So, after we worked on this case involving Jim Clark, we went over to, it was sort of a night and day affair. </sentence><sentence id="5374">She was telling you that we had this unfortunate situation where Lois Baker, who was our secretary. </sentence><sentence id="5375">We hired the first probably, black secretary. </sentence><sentence id="5376">We had an office in Selma, Alabama. </sentence><sentence id="5377">There was a lawyer from the Civil Rights Division, named Chad Quaintance, who was the first lawyer that we had in a field office. </sentence><sentence id="5378">He and his family moved to Selma and were there. </sentence><sentence id="5379">And Chad hired Lois Baker as a secretary and she was an African- American. </sentence><sentence id="5380">She was the one who had these epileptic seizures. </sentence><sentence id="5381">She was just very young. </sentence><sentence id="5382">I think she was only about nineteen. </sentence><sentence id="5383">I went back to Selma for the thirtieth anniversary of the Selma, of the Voting Rights Act in 1995. </sentence><sentence id="5384">They had a big get-together. </sentence><sentence id="5385">And it happened that I was going to Birmingham for a legal services meeting and one of the lawyers who works in my program, Larry York, and I went over to Selma for a couple of days. </sentence><sentence id="5386">There was a... they have a small voting rights museum there. </sentence><sentence id="5387">There were some people around who we visited and I visited Lois, who had since gotten married and had two, several children. </sentence><sentence id="5388">And we were thinking back...She's the head of the computer section at Montgomery Air Force Base or something at this point in time. </sentence><sentence id="5389">But after that Jean and I went over to Montgomery and helped work on another, on a school case for several days. </sentence><sentence id="5390">It was the statewide school desegregation case, Lee Against Macon County**. </sentence><sentence id="5391">They needed some help. </sentence><sentence id="5392">They were just going to trial and they needed some help in getting the thing going. </sentence><sentence id="5393">And Brian, my roommate, I was living at the time with a lawyer named Brian Landsberg, who

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="5470">A: Well, I was with, actually John Doar, I think partially to see that I got home. </sentence><sentence id="5471">But to assign me, Jean went back to Philadelphia after the Montgomery trip. </sentence><sentence id="5472">And John asked me to go to Charlotte. </sentence><sentence id="5473">My classmate from law school, Julius Chambers, who as I mentioned was my African-American classmate, had gone, was practicing in Charlotte, had become a very well known lawyer, who was eventually, in later years argued the Charlotte desegregation case in the Supreme Court. </sentence><sentence id="5474">But he had started a law firm and was involved in a lot of civil rights activities, and there had been an attempt to bomb his house. </sentence><sentence id="5475">I think the mail... he hadn't gotten hurt, it didn't do a lot of damage. </sentence><sentence id="5476">But the mailbox, there had been some exterior damage. </sentence><sentence id="5477">And we had started an FBI investigation and it looked like it was fairly, clearly to do with the Klan. </sentence><sentence id="5478">And so John asked me to go up there and look into that and maybe talk with the U.S. Attorney's office. </sentence><sentence id="5479">And my friend, Nick Flannery, who had done the Carroll County case with me, a wonderful lawyer, who, when he left the Division went to work for, in Boston with the Center for Law and Education, which was the legal services support center for education cases. </sentence><sentence id="5480">He was the chief trial lawyer in the Boston school desegregation case, if you... then. </sentence><sentence id="5481">But Nick went with me to Charlotte and we started doing some investigation. </sentence><sentence id="5482">And we went out to eat, we were in line going out to eat and I said to Nick, I asked him to hold my place in line, that I would be back in a few minutes and I wanted to make a phone call. </sentence><sentence id="5483">And I called Jean at her house. </sentence><sentence id="5484">I don't know whether I thought well maybe she would come down. </sentence><sentence id="5485">It was just, my family... see Charlotte is only twenty miles from Gastonia. </sentence><sentence id="5486">In fact I don't think, I was staying with Nick in Charlotte and [had not, I'm not sure I had even been home yet. </sentence><sentence id="5487">And I don't know why, whether John sent me there so I'd have a chance to see my folks. </sentence><sentence id="5488">I think he thought, literally being from North Carolina and he knew I knew Julius, that I would have some interest in this case, being from home. </sentence><sentence id="5489">So, I called her on the phone and said, "Will you marry me?" </sentence><sentence id="5490">or, "Don't you think we should get married, since we've been together all this time and seem to get along pretty well?" </sentence><sentence id="5491">We'd actually had been, I mean we had been dating pretty steadily by that time. </sentence><sentence id="5492">Even had taken a trip or two with Dorothy and Brian. </sentence><sentence id="5493">But we had not really talked about taking the plunge, I think. </sentence><sentence id="5494">Jean would, reminds me that I told her, when I first started going out with her, that when we started going out, that I really would not consider marrying someone who was not Jewish. </sentence><sentence id="5495">That I had announced that early on in our dating. </sentence><sentence id="5496">And I must have let that one go by the board. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="5657">A: Well as Jean told you, she was there without me with the both of them facing each other for a little while, so I guess they were a little bit new to each other. </sentence><sentence id="5658">But her father is a pretty extroverted person, who has a lot of interests and was then much younger, quite young. </sentence><sentence id="5659">Was very interested in spiritual things and I think my dad was able to talk to him. </sentence><sentence id="5660">And they got along very well. </sentence><sentence id="5661">And Jean's mother and my mother hit it off really well. </sentence><sentence id="5662">I think Jean's mother had been a secretary and was always doing transcription work of one sort or another. </sentence><sentence id="5663">And in fact, in the last fifteen years or so she would not, well after we were married, Jean's mother wouldn't take a full time job, she worked for Manpower", so they could come down and see Michael or be with the grandson and then the grandchildren. </sentence><sentence id="5664">We were both, in the sense that her father's background was German and was the son of a tailor immigrant family. </sentence><sentence id="5665">His mother was very strong. </sentence><sentence id="5666">He grew up in New York City at a time when much of downtown New York was still farm, farming country. </sentence><sentence id="5667">There are some old letters in her family that I was reading when I was home, where they were describing the winter and it was cold and they'd have to go outside to the outhouse to relieve themselves. </sentence><sentence id="5668">And they were literally living in a farming area where the United Nations Building is now. </sentence><sentence id="5669">But the point was that they were sort of both from old European generation backgrounds, where the fathers were working and more sort of the dominant, and they were making the money and the mothers were at home, and the household was sort of run the way the fathers said it was run. </sentence><sentence id="5670">And in that way, I think, there was some commonality, even if the religions weren't the same and the families got off to a pretty good start. </sentence><sentence id="5671">They didn't stay very long on that occasion and I don't remember, I mean they saw, saw each other periodically and from time to time. </sentence><sentence id="5672">Jean's parents used to, as she said, came to visit us a lot more. </sentence><sentence id="5673">They came down here a lot. </sentence><sentence id="5674">They really took a major interest in their grandchildren. </sentence><sentence id="5675">My parents had moved to Florida and did not really come up, they made a trip up after we moved here from North Carolina, when they were still living in Gastonia. </sentence><sentence id="5676">As I said my father, "65, let's say in 1966... Let's see, we got married in "67. </sentence><sentence id="5677">He retired about that time and they moved to Florida shortly thereafter. </sentence><sentence id="5678">So that we would go see them usually at Christmas. </sentence><sentence id="5679">But they didn't make many trips up. </sentence><sentence id="5680">Right after we moved to Prestonsburg they made a, they drove over, got as far as Pikeville and the four-lane was just being developed, was being blasted open between Pikeville and Prestonsburg. </sentence><sentence id="5681">So they got within thirty miles of home and then had to take a thirty mile detour around the back hollers from Wheelwright and I don't think, I think * Manpower is a national employment agency for temps. </sentence><sentence id="5682">75    USHMM Archives RG-50.549.05*0007 76 that sort of, was enough for them. </sentence><sentence id="5683">Although they moved to Florida, they never really made another big driving excursion up this way. </sentence><sentence id="5684">So I don't know that I have many more, it's one of those things I don't have a lot of... Jean probably recalls better than Ido. </sentence><sentence id="5685">We went back for...after we got married and worked in the Civil Rights Division, when Jean then, when Michael was born in 1970 in April, we had decided then to leave the Division. </sentence><sentence id="5686">That was when the Nixon Administration had come in, and even though I was Chief of the Criminal Section, they were not, pretty much still let me have a free hand. </sentence><sentence id="5687">The Houston school case was one of the last cases that they filed in which the government, which I had written the pleadings in, in which we asked for bussing as a relief. </sentence><sentence id="5688">And they were generally to eliminate segregation, to start bussing black kids across to white schools and whites to black schools. </sentence><sentence id="5689">We didn't get all of that in the relief. </sentence><sentence id="5690">We did pair up some schools and we made some other major improvements. </sentence><sentence id="5691">But they were, in my view, certainly, and others, were retreating on school desegregation. </sentence><sentence id="5692">And it wasn't really... the climate was not what it had been and I, we decided then, I think, that we had been there long enough. </sentence><sentence id="5693">Besides I had been there, was in a very senior position and at that point you're starting to almost price yourself out of the market if you want to make a career change. </sentence><sentence id="5694">You might stay with the government and decide to go, to keep, to go up another notch or two or maybe make more and more money. </sentence><sentence id="5695">Or if you're going to a law firm, in order to get a reasonable salary, too, it was at the point where it was a good time for me to do that. </sentence><sentence id="5696">So we, and Michael had just been born, it was a nice time to take off for the summer. </sentence><sentence id="5697">And we decided then to, we would go ona large camping trip. </sentence><sentence id="5698">We got our little car and the baby carriage, and folded it. </sentence><sentence id="5699">We bought a Peugeot for eight hundred dollars that looked like it had a lot of miles left on it. </sentence><sentence id="5700">And we headed North and we went North along the American and Canadian coast. </sentence><sentence id="5701">We went to the Canadian -- American National Parks, Fundy and all the way along, Cape Breton, out to Cape Breton and Prince Edward Island. </sentence><sentence id="5702">Came back to Quebec and basically got away from it all. </sentence><sentence id="5703">I think I had one call from a firm and decided to leave it, not to bother with it. </sentence><sentence id="5704">And we weren't really sure where, we knew we wanted to do something useful, where I felt I was using my legal talents to somebody's benefit. </sentence><sentence id="5705">And I had talked to some firms and that didn't really excite me at the time, but I think I was just more, we were really more into making the decision to leave, which was a big thing, because we didn't have a job. </sentence><sentence id="5706">But we wanted to get away for a while and we had some money saved up, so we, while I was on that trip one of the... when we came back... what was it? </sentence><sentence id="5707">--Someone left a message for us. </sentence><sentence id="5708">One of my former colleagues from the Division, Terry Lenzner was the head of legal services for the Office of Economic Opportunity. </sentence><sentence id="5709">And he was the one who suggested while we were on this camping trip that we might want to drive through Charleston, West, to come through West Virginia and to Kentucky. </sentence><sentence id="5710">This is by way of answering you about my parents, because they had moved to Florida. </sentence><sentence id="5711">And we were sort of on our way to be at the Jewish, to spend the Jewish holidays with my parents in Florida, which is about this time of year, in September. </sentence><sentence id="5712">So we were off, I think we returned from, we were, went over to Cape Breton and we went back to Quebec. </sentence><sentence id="5713">And it was really cold and we bought a tent heater. </sentence><sentence id="5714">And then we went from there down to Boston and all of a sudden it was ninety-six and we were staying with former colleagues of the Civil Rights Division, who were in graduate school at Harvard, I think. </sentence><sentence id="5715">And they had this small apartment without an air conditioner. </sentence><sentence id="5716">We were burning up. </sentence><sentence id="5717">Well anyway, we started back down and Terry Lenzner got in touch with us and we went through Charleston. </sentence><sentence id="5718">And the program in Kentucky was then associated with this group in West Virginia, called Appalachian Research and Defense Fund, which had been founded by three lawyers, four lawyers, who wanted to start a public interest law firm. </sentence><sentence id="5719">And they had begun some environmental work, but were having a tough time economically. </sentence><sentence id="5720">And they had gotten in 76   USHMM Archives RG-50.549.05*0007 77 touch with Terry Lenzner at OEO and he wanted to, was willing to do some, to fund an organization to do, under the auspices of legal services, to look at some of the symptomatic issues around poverty in the Central Appalachian area. </sentence><sentence id="5721">Out-of-state mineral interests, black lung disease, environmental damages related to coal mining, deep mining and surface mining. </sentence><sentence id="5722">And Paul Kaufmann, who was one of the four, there, of those lawyers--there were four attorneys, Kaufmann was a former gubernatorial candidate and was real active in Democratic politics, had been a private attorney. </sentence><sentence id="5723">And John Boettner, fellow named Ratliff? </sentence><sentence id="5724">and a woman named Naomi Cohen. </sentence><sentence id="5725">And then there was a small group here in Eastern Kentucky of lawyers, who had worked as a group called Mountain People's Rights. </sentence><sentence id="5726">And there was a fellow named Howard Thorkelson, who was from Pennsylvania. </sentence><sentence id="5727">And he had gotten a couple of other lawyers to come down here, although they were not yet licensed and they were having financial difficulties. </sentence><sentence id="5728">So the two of them were sort of interested in working together and getting this federal money through the West Virginia organization. </sentence><sentence id="5729">West Virginia then had a Republican governor, Arch Moore*!. </sentence><sentence id="5730">And he was hostile to legal services, as was the Republican governor in Kentucky, Louis Nunn*?. </sentence><sentence id="5731">So there was a, the West Virginia Technical Institute, was an educational institution, so Terry concocted a scheme whereby he would fund West Virginia Tech, because educational grants were not subject to gubernatorial veto as the other OEO grants were and then they would in turn fund Appalred&gt;". </sentence><sentence id="5732">But anyway, I guess I'm getting a little ahead of myself. </sentence><sentence id="5733">I was just, we were on this camping trip and so we came to Charleston and talked to the people there. </sentence><sentence id="5734">And Paul said, "Why don't you go down to visit with the Kentucky people, because Howard Thorkelson is going to leave and they need someone to replace him and we're going to be funding them. </sentence><sentence id="5735">If you're interested we would seriously consider asking you to take over this group in Kentucky." </sentence><sentence id="5736">So, we came down here and came here to Prestonsburg on an August or a September evening and pitched out tent out there at Jenny Wiley(tm). </sentence><sentence id="5737">Back then, oh actually the campground was at the other end up here near Auxier, at that entrance. </sentence><sentence id="5738">Jean wanted me to go out and make sure there weren't any bears or foxes, she had heard... there wasn't anybody there but us. </sentence><sentence id="5739">It was really after the camping season. </sentence><sentence id="5740">But we met the people who were here and everybody seemed very friendly and we decided to go down and... I had already gotten some names of people, Harry Caudill, who you know wrote Night Comes to the Cumberlands, was on the Appalred Board in West Virginia(r)". </sentence><sentence id="5741">He was a friend of Paul Kaufmann's, I think, and had been very, Kaufmann had put some people from Kentucky on his Board. </sentence><sentence id="5742">He wanted this thing to be more of a regional program because there were so many of the issues were common to the Central Appalachia, and that the state lines really didn't mean anything. </sentence><sentence id="5743">The strip mining problems in Kentucky and West Virginia were the same. </sentence><sentence id="5744">Unregulated strip mining, land owners having their land torn up without their consent, and that sort of thing. </sentence><sentence id="5745">So, I went down and talked to Harry Caudill. </sentence><sentence id="5746">There was a woman, here on Mud Creek they were doing a lot of, they were having a lot of problems around health issues. </sentence><sentence id="5747">Hospitals weren't taking people who couldn't pay. </sentence><sentence id="5748">Eula Hall was her name, she is a good friend, who still works at the, founded the Mud Creek Clinic here in our area"(r). </sentence><sentence id="5749">And I went over into Blackey, Kentucky. </sentence><sentence id="5750">There was a fellow named Joe 5deg Ray Ratliff 5! </sentence><sentence id="5751">Arch A.

Joe was born here in Floyd County, and he was part Indian. </sentence><sentence id="5761">We talked a lot about their history and the problems that he saw, poor people, and that people were getting run over by strip miners. </sentence><sentence id="5762">Because Kentucky's courts allowed mining without, strip mining without land owner approval. </sentence><sentence id="5763">Because these out of state mineral owners had come here in the late 1890s and bought out all the minerals. </sentence><sentence id="5764">We were talking about country people and being acceptance of outsiders. </sentence><sentence id="5765">Have you ever read Harry Caudill's book, Night Comes to the Cumberlands? </sentence><sentence id="5766">Yeah. </sentence><sentence id="5767">Well you know, he describes this situation so well where these land agents for the Northern philanthropists, like Rockefeller and large oil holding and mineral holding companies sent their agents down here. </sentence><sentence id="5768">They would visit these farmers who lived in very remote hollers, where they were farming the mountain hills, really. </sentence><sentence id="5769">And they would come in and tell their stories, and spend the night, talk about all the good things that were going on in the world and how nice this place was. </sentence><sentence id="5770">And then they would present them, they would suggest to them that they ought to go ahead and sell over their mineral rights because it wasn't really any benefit to them that they could see. </sentence><sentence id="5771">No one knew what mining was. </sentence><sentence id="5772">There wasn't any huge deep mine there. </sentence><sentence id="5773">The only use they made of their coal would be to cut into the hillside enough to get the coal to use for heating up their cabins and their homes, which is what most of them did. </sentence><sentence id="5774">You could see the outcrop of the coal and they would run a scraper along the mountain and take out a little bit of coal. </sentence><sentence id="5775">But no one... certainly they were aware as they were in other countries of deep mining methods. </sentence><sentence id="5776">And I'm sure these agents didn't talk a great deal about the possibility of having a huge, deep mine. </sentence><sentence id="5777">This was in the 1890s, 1900s, was before the time of the railroads. </sentence><sentence id="5778">And subsequently the railroads came in once all these minerals had been bought up, I mean they literally bought up all of the mineral ownership in Eastern Kentucky. </sentence><sentence id="5779">And under the common law, the mineral estate is severed from the surface, so what you have left is the land on top. </sentence><sentence id="5780">And they gave them, the deeds they signed as you know, were known as Broad Form Deeds because they were so broad in their language. </sentence><sentence id="5781">They literally gave the owner of the minerals the right to take the minerals and all steps reasonably necessary to build roads and railroads and tram roads. </sentence><sentence id="5782">Whatever might be necessary that's incidental to taking out the coal. </sentence><sentence id="5783">And then they would sign those minerals away. </sentence><sentence id="5784">And the Kentucky courts held that those deeds were so broad that they gave the mineral owner the paramount right to the surface owner, as long as the mineral owner didn't arbitrarily misuse that right. </sentence><sentence id="5785">As long as he mined by reasonable methods and took the coal out by an acceptable method, the surface owner could not object to that. </sentence><sentence id="5786">So those, Joe had one of those old deeds and told me what an awful instrument was, that even though at the time when they executed the deeds, no one could have envisioned these current methods of mining. </sentence><sentence id="5787">Bulldozer, mechanic... and these huge, mechanized equipment that was in use seventy-five years later, that the courts would hold that to be allowable. </sentence><sentence id="5788">In most contract law, the contract applies to those things that are within the reasonable contemplation of the parties, like deep mining. </sentence><sentence id="5789">There was no doubt that if you were going to mine back then you would deep mine to get the coal out. </sentence><sentence id="5790">We never challenged that. </sentence><sentence id="5791">But the notion that they could use a method that was not at all in anybody's contemplation was rejected in other states. </sentence><sentence id="5792">Virtually. </sentence><sentence id="5793">I mentioned West Virginia a while ago, I guess that wasn't really right. </sentence><sentence id="5794">The West Virginia courts had said you have to have landowner consent. </sentence><sentence id="5795">You could get a surface mining permit and you could pay for that. </sentence><sentence id="5796">And that was what Pennsylvania, and Ohio, and many of these others, Illinois, all the other states, courts had said, but not Kentucky. </sentence><sentence id="5797">So Joe, we talked for 57 Joe Begley, 1919-2000. </sentence><sentence id="5798">Former proprietor of C.B. Caudill Store and History Center in Blackey, Kentucky.78   USHMM Archives RG-50.549.05*0007 79 a long time, was pointing out, also how poor people couldn't get lawyers to challenge those deeds. </sentence><sentence id="5799">And they couldn't get lawyers to challenge a permit application if someone applied for a permit. </sentence><sentence id="5800">But there were many situations where he thought it would be just a wonderful thing if we could have lawyers available to represent poor people. </sentence><sentence id="5801">Because he saw these situations coming up so often. </sentence><sentence id="5802">And so, we went on, we went on to Florida to visit my mom and dad and while on the way I think we kind of decided that this would be an interesting opportunity to try to come to Eastern Kentucky. </sentence><sentence id="5803">It would be a worthwhile way to practice law and to provide that opportunity. </sentence><sentence id="5804">There was a lot of interesting work to be done and useful and perhaps important work to do on behalf of low-income clients. </sentence><sentence id="5805">And also to help start this legal services program, which was, had sort of a small beginning in mountain people's rights. </sentence><sentence id="5806">So then we came...decided to come, and we came. </sentence><sentence id="5807">And moved to Prestonsburg. </sentence><sentence id="5808">At first I looked around in Barbourville. </sentence><sentence id="5809">We had a little tough time getting off the ground, because the, we had some disagreements about how to do this the best way. </sentence><sentence id="5810">Some people, some of the mountain people's rights members thought that it was more important to organize, to organize work with low- income groups like the Welfare Rights Group, rather than doing lawyering work. </sentence><sentence id="5811">So it wasn't quite as smooth sailing getting started as I had hoped. </sentence><sentence id="5812">But after a little while we got on our way and Joe Begley's son, J. T. Begley, who had just gotten out of the Marines and gone back to law school, turned out to be the first lawyer that I hired. </sentence><sentence id="5813">And I hired a fellow named Mort Stamm, who is now in Australia, teaching. </sentence><sentence id="5814">And we started off with, then a fellow named Paul Fauri, who is the Domestic Relations Commissioner in Franklin County, and we started in that little house I pointed out to you on the way up here. </sentence><sentence id="5815">So, that's how it began. </sentence><sentence id="5816">And I was telling you, it wasn't an easy beginning. </sentence><sentence id="5817">I think the Bar Associations were very suspicious and I think they were threatened and thought really we were going to compete with lawyers for clients that would be able to pay. </sentence><sentence id="5818">And then some, many lawyers, who were employed or retained by coal companies were not particularly sympathetic to the notion that lawyers might start to challenge some of these practices and give people representation in the courts. </sentence><sentence id="5819">So we were not the most popular people in town when we started. </sentence><sentence id="5820">I had difficulty renting an office. </sentence><sentence id="5821">Finally found an office in the place where Jean and I ended up living for a long time on the other side of town, within a week of each other. </sentence><sentence id="5822">And we got started. </sentence><sentence id="5823">It was also a difficult time because at the national level, President Nixon had an Office of Economic Opportunity Director, who was opposed to legal services, bringing any of these sort of controversial cases against public officials, and challenging welfare rights practices and that sort of thing. </sentence><sentence id="5824">And he, he decided to, he wanted to de-fund those programs. </sentence><sentence id="5825">So I had only been here about a year when all of that began in 1973 and it looked like we might lose our money. </sentence><sentence id="5826">We had half of the lawyers were on half salaries and the secretary, we had to hire, we got a lawyer in Washington, Steve Pollak, I mentioned to you, I used to work with, to represent us to threaten to sue OEO to get our funding. </sentence><sentence id="5827">Some other programs similarly went through a period of that sort. </sentence><sentence id="5828">Governor Reagan at that time, who would become President, had sort of declared war on legal services in California, who had represented migrant farm workers and had also won some fairly major welfare decisions with regard to hearing rights. </sentence><sentence id="5829">And had showed that the California welfare system was violating the rights of welfare recipients and applicants. </sentence><sentence id="5830">And he was angry and tried to start, established an inquiry, tribunal out in California, that sort of thing. </sentence><sentence id="5831">Actually the tribunal came out with a report, this included some judges, that was very favorable to CRLA. </sentence><sentence id="5832">Then when Reagan became President, he decided to do it all over again. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="6098">A: I was just saying that the constitutional amendment was passed in 1988, so it was introduced in nineteen, I guess in the 1988 legislative session. </sentence><sentence id="6099">And it was passed by ninety-two percent of the voters. </sentence><sentence id="6100">It was a great publicity campaign by KFTC, a lot of letters to the editor, it sort of put them on the map. </sentence><sentence id="6101">We had started KFTC with a small group in Hazard, Kentucky. </sentence><sentence id="6102">A group of citizens came together to talk about fair taxation of minerals, initially. </sentence><sentence id="6103">Because the coal under the ground, not only did the land owner not have the opportunity to object to whether they could be surface mining or not, but they were paying virtually all the taxes on the property. </sentence><sentence id="6104">They were not... and the Kentucky constitution said that all properties, cash... is taxed in fair cash value. </sentence><sentence id="6105">But the minerals weren't being taxed. </sentence><sentence id="6106">So the group looked at that and decided that they would try to start an organization called the Kentucky Fair Tax Coalition. </sentence><sentence id="6107">I've even been credited with giving, we were sitting around the room trying to decide what should this thing be called?People were throwing up names. ( </sentence><sentence id="6108">Laughing.) </sentence><sentence id="6109">Somebody said, I think it was, whatever the various combinations people had been throwing out, was that I suggested it be called Kentuckians Fair Tax Coalition. </sentence><sentence id="6110">But the other issue it took on was the Broad Form Deed. </sentence><sentence id="6111">And the group started very small, it was just kind of a get together really. </sentence><sentence id="6112">One of the members who, one of the folks who was there was a young man named Joe Zakos, who had come from Pennsylvania and was interested in working with local citizens groups. </sentence><sentence id="6113">And he had come, was living in David, I think and had gotten involved in some issues over in Martin County. </sentence><sentence id="6114">It didn't have anything to do with the Broad Form Deed. </sentence><sentence id="6115">It was really a proposal to move a low-income community out of a flood-prone area. </sentence><sentence id="6116">And they were going to fill it in and put in new housing or industrial... the only thing was they forgot to discuss it with the people who were living there. </sentence><sentence id="6117">And he organized an effort there to... which ultimately stopped that. </sentence><sentence id="6118">They backed off on that project. </sentence><sentence id="6119">But in the process began a group called the Martin County Concerned Citizens, who then were involved with a number of environmental and socially active, social... got involved in issues of social concern. </sentence><sentence id="6120">We represented them one year in a case challenging the application of... Kentucky Power wanted to build another power generating plant. </sentence><sentence id="6121">And the reason they wanted to build it was to sell more power to other companies, but it would have raised the rates of everyone, including the Martin County citizens, people who lived in that area. </sentence><sentence id="6122">And we had a lawyer in legal services in Lexington, Tony Martin, who focused on energy work, and basically demonstrated that there was no need for the power plant, that all it was going to do was increase everybody's power bill. </sentence><sentence id="6123">They had plenty of generating power, they were just trying to expand themselves. </sentence><sentence id="6124">And the stockholders might benefit, but the Martin County citizen group was the named party. </sentence><sentence id="6125">And so that was just to say that, even though a group that was called Kentucky Fair Tax Coalition and decided later to rename itself Kentuckians for the Commonwealth, because local chapters were working on different issues of local concern. </sentence><sentence id="6126">Didn't necessarily involve minerals and that sort of thing. </sentence><sentence id="6127">But they really put themselves on the map with the campaign to get the constitutional amendment passed. </sentence><sentence id="6128">So that amendment was on the ballot in 1988, along with the lottery. </sentence><sentence id="6129">And the lottery barely passed. </sentence><sentence id="6130">It passed by, I think, fifty-one or - two percent of the vote. </sentence><sentence id="6131">Ninety-two percent of the vote, people voted for the Broad Form Deed amendment, which showed people knew what they were doing. </sentence><sentence id="6132">In fact, I remember when, early when we had been here not too many years, the Courier-Journal | think did an informal poll. </sentence><sentence id="6133">And something like ninety-three percent of the people thought they shouldn't allow anybody to 81   USHMM Archives RG-50.549.05*0007 82 strip mine your land without your consent. </sentence><sentence id="6134">But I was then, one of my, the coal industry decided they wanted to challenge the constitutionality of that constitutional amendment as violating the federal constitution. </sentence><sentence id="6135">Because they claimed that mineral ownership rights had been established by these series of Kentucky cases in the Supreme Court over the years and that people when they bought mineral rights expected to be able to legally surface mine. </sentence><sentence id="6136">And we argued... and I was representing an older couple in Johnson County, Garnet and Eugene Ward, who lived on a small farm... they really weren't farming. </sentence><sentence id="6137">It was in a holler that had not been mined. </sentence><sentence id="6138">And there was a mining application by a company. </sentence><sentence id="6139">And at the trial court, one of the attorneys who was here then was handling, handled that case, and it was on appeal and it came to me and I took the case over. </sentence><sentence id="6140">And we ended up arguing the constitutionality of the amendment in the Supreme Court. </sentence><sentence id="6141">And the Attorney General argued in our support and the court then agreed with our theory that they never had the right in the first place to grant the right to strip mine. </sentence><sentence id="6142">So it took a lot of years, but finally the right was... you cannot today surface mine anybody's land without their consent. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="6190">Q: When did that final decision come down? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="6192">A: I think it was 1990. </sentence><sentence id="6193">The Supreme Court decision was stated in 1990. </sentence><sentence id="6194">Ward versus, Ward versus... I forgot the last name for the moment. </sentence><sentence id="6195">I can talk about that case a long time, but that's sort of the summary. </sentence><sentence id="6196">Garnet, now both of the Wards... Eugene died while we were in the Supreme Court. </sentence><sentence id="6197">And then Garnet died a couple of years back. </sentence><sentence id="6198">She was a very feisty woman. </sentence><sentence id="6199">She claimed... they never, no one else had ever paid any taxes on this property. </sentence><sentence id="6200">And they didn't know that anybody else had any claim to the minerals. </sentence><sentence id="6201">She thought they owned the claim. </sentence><sentence id="6202">When we were in circuit court we asserted that, and there was some basis for her claim, because when the minerals were sold, about 1910, really interesting, by... the local owner, the owner was in Johnson County and he sold the mineral rights to a company in New York, that wanted to develop these minerals. </sentence><sentence id="6203">And he sold... and they promised to pay him with... they gave him shares of stock and said they would buy those shares back once their company was in operation. </sentence><sentence id="6204">And a year went by and nothing happened, so he sued them to get his money. </sentence><sentence id="6205">And actually in that suit someone, a deposition of him was taken. </sentence><sentence id="6206">And when he sold that property he said, "I will give you the minerals and you may mine that property, but I want you to leave all the walnut, chestnut, and hemlock trees over ten inches," which made it impossible to strip mine. </sentence><sentence id="6207">And so we actually argued initially it was not a Broad Form Deed, that this deed specifically was limited to deep mining because it was impossible to strip mine, because he had said that. </sentence><sentence id="6208">And on deposition, which was... the deposition from his testimony was still in the courthouse. </sentence><sentence id="6209">And in the deposition he reasserted that, that he wanted those trees left alone. </sentence><sentence id="6210">And that you could use the smaller timbers as people did in deep mines. </sentence><sentence id="6211">Timbers under ten inches were used for shorings in the deep mine workings. </sentence><sentence id="6212">So that made good sense. </sentence><sentence id="6213">He was saying, "You can have the saplings, but I want those good trees left." </sentence><sentence id="6214">So our local judge agreed with that and said, "You can't mine." </sentence><sentence id="6215">So they appealed to the Court of Appeals and they won. </sentence><sentence id="6216">The Court of Appeals, the intermediate appellate court said, "Well that's just what these deed provisions say, but the mineral owner still has the paramount right to mine under our decisions." </sentence><sentence id="6217">So then we took that case to the Supreme Court on discretionary review. </sentence><sentence id="6218">We asked them to review that. </sentence><sentence id="6219">They took the case and so the amendment was argued, we argued the amendment on that. </sentence><sentence id="6220">So Garnet, they never, they did not... anyway, when these minerals were sold, he did some, there was very careful, plats were laid out and surveyed. </sentence><sentence id="6221">And it was not, and when they filed this mining permit and claimed they owned the minerals where Garnet and Eugene lived, they didn't 82   USHMM Archives RG-50.549.05*0007 83 do that very well. </sentence><sentence id="6222">Where they claimed their boundaries looked like went... she could make, we could make a colorable assertion that that didn't coincide with those original plats. </sentence><sentence id="6223">Because they didn't prove that, clearly she should have had the right to those minerals, but we lost on that claim. </sentence><sentence id="6224">It's just an aside, but I think she probably didn't own the minerals. </sentence><sentence id="6225">It couldn't clearly be shown that she owned the minerals. </sentence><sentence id="6226">But we won the case, so that's the law. </sentence><sentence id="6227">It was a big, nice effort to have been involved in and I think one of the important achievements that we made along with many other cases | think the program's been able to bring. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="6293">Q: Do you want to talk about David and your involvement there? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="6295">A: David is about nine miles from Prestonsburg and in the 1930s, especially, it was a booming coal town. </sentence><sentence id="6296">It was what they called a model community, sort of like Wheelwright, or many of these coal, you know most... Floyd county and this area had a number of coal camps. </sentence><sentence id="6297">They were basically company towns, because a company owned the homes where the people lived and the company paid them with scrip. </sentence><sentence id="6298">And they owed their soul to the company store, as it were. </sentence><sentence id="6299">But some of the homes were quite nice. </sentence><sentence id="6300">I mean, I think they were very nice communities and very close communities. </sentence><sentence id="6301">There were some employers that were better than others. </sentence><sentence id="6302">And there were the mine wars in Harlan County, all of the difficult history involving unionization. </sentence><sentence id="6303">Where it was successful, and where it wasn't. </sentence><sentence id="6304">But David, the mine there was the Princess Coal Company. </sentence><sentence id="6305">And David was mentioned, was named for a fellow named David Francis, who when I came here, lived in Huntington. </sentence><sentence id="6306">He still, that family owned the minerals. </sentence><sentence id="6307">The only swimming pool in this area, in this end of town was at David and people used to go out there to go swimming on the train. </sentence><sentence id="6308">They had a little airport. </sentence><sentence id="6309">They had a school. </sentence><sentence id="6310">It was a very vibrant mining community and when the mine closed in the "40s, it kind of went downhill. </sentence><sentence id="6311">And it was purchased by... the buildings, not the minerals, but the town of David, the ridge around it and the homes that were there were, was purchased by a small group of businessmen here in Prestonsburg. </sentence><sentence id="6312">And people paid rent to them. </sentence><sentence id="6313">And a group of Catholic priests from St. Vincent's Mission came to David in 83   USHMM Archives RG-50.549.05*0007 84 the late "60s and "70s and started teaching bible school and some literacy training. </sentence><sentence id="6314">And apparently they were approached by the businessmen to see if the mission was interested in buying the town. </sentence><sentence id="6315">I think they viewed themselves as absentee landlords and all they did was collect the rent. </sentence><sentence id="6316">They saw the water system going downhill. </sentence><sentence id="6317">They didn't really, weren't interested in developing the community. </sentence><sentence id="6318">The homes were in pretty bad shape. </sentence><sentence id="6319">They weren't really slum lords, they just weren't doing anything to keep it up. </sentence><sentence id="6320">It was a private water system. </sentence><sentence id="6321">So the Father, Matthew at the time, one day came to see me, and told us about the offer to buy the town. </sentence><sentence id="6322">They weren't interested in doing it, but they wondered whether we could, whether the community might be able to buy it in some way, if they, we could figure out how to, help them figure out how to do that. </sentence><sentence id="6323">So, I asked a law student to do some research and we got a little help from the National Economic Development Law Center". </sentence><sentence id="6324">And we decided, we put together an economic development, a corporation, a Kentucky corporation. </sentence><sentence id="6325">And we started having some community meetings in David. </sentence><sentence id="6326">And there was a company... the town wasn't working, but Island Creek Coal Company still had a store that they owned. </sentence><sentence id="6327">The old company store. </sentence><sentence id="6328">There was a fellow named Tiller(r)", who ran the store and who also, he read the Wall Street Journal. </sentence><sentence id="6329">And he was a very smart guy. </sentence><sentence id="6330">He was an interesting man. </sentence><sentence id="6331">So, they elected him as Chair of this group. </sentence><sentence id="6332">And he became the first Chair of our little community development corporation. </sentence><sentence id="6333">We didn't own anything yet, but they started planning. </sentence><sentence id="6334">We started looking into the possibility of financing the purchasing of the town and how it might work. </sentence><sentence id="6335">The problem was there was no water, the water system was unreliable. </sentence><sentence id="6336">They had a pump that was literally held together by chicken wire. </sentence><sentence id="6337">They were afraid to take the gamble unless they had water. </sentence><sentence id="6338">So we were sort of diverted for a couple of years until we were able to figure out with our local area development district how to, ultimately we were able to get a grant, which helped one of the existing water districts bring water to a number of their new customers in the rural part. </sentence><sentence id="6339">The Beaver-Elkhorn water district supplied water to a lot of the homes on Right and Left Beaver Creek. </sentence><sentence id="6340">By getting them additional, those lines, they agreed they would run a line over to David, an extension. </sentence><sentence id="6341">And we established a David Water District and went to the Public Service Commission to get approval to bring water to David through the water district, which would buy its water from this Beaver-Elkhorn Water District that agreed to extend its lines. </sentence><sentence id="6342">And when we got that done, by that time Mr. Tiller had been transferred to somewhere, Western Kentucky. </sentence><sentence id="6343">People were afraid the corporation was going to go in, go down, because he was really sort of a driving force. </sentence><sentence id="6344">But there was an old coal miner, retired, who had black lung, named Ashland Howard, whose nickname was "Hawk". </sentence><sentence id="6345">And he had the energy and the spirit and the--even though he may not have had the formal education--to push this group along. </sentence><sentence id="6346">And he took over, became the Chair of that group. </sentence><sentence id="6347">And we then, once we got the water district in, we put together a financing package, where we had a first mortgage from the local bank here in Prestonsburg and a second mortgage from a group in Washington, called the Housing Assistance Council. </sentence><sentence id="6348">And the idea was that if the corporation could buy the property, all of David, then the renters could buy their homes in turn and the local bank would make those mortgages. </sentence><sentence id="6349">So the bank would turn its money over quickly and get its mortgage paid back as people bought their houses. </sentence><sentence id="6350">And the Housing Assistance Council in Washington helped, encourages developments of this sort. </sentence><sentence id="6351">They were, I think we paid them back twice as fast. </sentence><sentence id="6352">So, we were able to purchase the town. </sentence><sentence id="6353">We had another lawyer, by that time I had another lawyer named Kay Adrion, who works over in Virginia now as a private practitioner. </sentence><sentence id="6354">And she helped sort of put the deal together. </sentence><sentence id="6355">And then after the town... we did all, this was a *deg National Economic Development and Law Center (NEDLC), Oakland, California. </sentence><sentence id="6356">Claude Tiller 84   USHMM Archives RG-50.549.05*0007 85 large amount of legal work. </sentence><sentence id="6357">Public Service Commission, all this deed work. </sentence><sentence id="6358">And we were also able to get the corporation to realize they needed to get some staff people. </sentence><sentence id="6359">So we helped them to write a Vista grant to get a Vista out there. </sentence><sentence id="6360">At the same time a young man named Danny Greene had come to David and started a, at home, he had taken in some foster care kids. </sentence><sentence id="6361">He came down as a volunteer with the Mission. </sentence><sentence id="6362">And he started this David school, which over the years has obtained some national recognition for helping high school dropouts. </sentence><sentence id="6363">He realized there was no real alternative school here. </sentence><sentence id="6364">Kids would drop out, that was the end of it. </sentence><sentence id="6365">The schools really just wiped their hands of them. </sentence><sentence id="6366">He bought the old store building. </sentence><sentence id="6367">We bought most of the town, ridge to ridge. </sentence><sentence id="6368">And he bought several others and was able to get some financing for the old store, which became the school. </sentence><sentence id="6369">There's now a brand new building, which is very beautiful, that has been built in the meantime, and the story of the school, I've been on their Board and we've done a lot of things together. </sentence><sentence id="6370">But afterwards the corporation built and developed about twenty-five new homes, Farmer's Home owned... put up new houses where the old ones were, had deteriorated in one of the hollers. </sentence><sentence id="6371">It's a very nice, attractive town now. </sentence><sentence id="6372">It was sort of the Appalachian, we had this big battle over a strip mining permit at one point. </sentence><sentence id="6373">There was a large block of coal left

there was also a large amount of coal that had not been mined because they hit water in the mine. </sentence><sentence id="6377">There was an attempt to re-open that, to start, to get a permit to mine that block of coal. </sentence><sentence id="6378">And Danny and the community got very upset about that. </sentence><sentence id="6379">And so we opposed that permit and there was a lot of community pressure, a lot of help. </sentence><sentence id="6380">And thankfully that was, we were able to fend that off. </sentence><sentence id="6381">But we've been very much, you've had deep mining and strip mining and coal truck traffic, all the problems that you see all over, in one little spot here in David. </sentence><sentence id="6382">You have the craft co-operative as a little, as a new, which has become fairly successful. </sentence><sentence id="6383">It's anice community. </sentence><sentence id="6384">There were actually, we had plans to develop other parts of David, to expand it, but basically the community sort of decided it didn't want to get any bigger. </sentence><sentence id="6385">It's a very interesting place. </sentence><sentence id="6386">And we learned a great deal

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="6494">A: Well, I think what I'm doing now has been in many ways has been most fulfilling over the last thirty years. </sentence><sentence id="6495">Working with the Civil Rights Division was a great opportunity to learn to practice law and to do something very worthwhile. </sentence><sentence id="6496">The big difference is that in the Civil Rights Division, we didn't live in those communities and that we came and went. </sentence><sentence id="6497">Whereas, and I have great admiration for the people who stayed there and their courage and how difficult their lives were. </sentence><sentence id="6498">The lives, the life we've had for the last thirty years in Prestonsburg has been here. </sentence><sentence id="6499">And I wouldn't at all compare myself to the African-Americans who lived in those communities and the life they had and how difficult that was, because we are white. </sentence><sentence id="6500">And we live in an area where 85   USHMM Archives RG-50.549.05*0007 86 there are very few African-Americans. </sentence><sentence id="6501">And I think their life has been difficult at times although it's gotten much better. </sentence><sentence id="6502">I mean there is also a fair amount of blatant racism in this particular area, and some of it is direct racism. </sentence><sentence id="6503">But over the years I've been able to recruit, at least the only practicing attorney in Eastern Kentucky right now, is the woman who has my office in Jackson(r)!.She's been there a number of years. </sentence><sentence id="6504">And we've tried unsuccessfully to recruit some others, because they don't... </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="6518">Q: You're talking about African-Americans? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="6520">A: Yeah, African-American lawyers, and paralegals. </sentence><sentence id="6521">You have to have a support system as a minority person to live, I think, wherever you are. </sentence><sentence id="6522">It's difficult to be alone. </sentence><sentence id="6523">And in Hazard we have a church to which Cynthia from Jackson belongs. </sentence><sentence id="6524">And there are some black communities that are concentrated in our areas. </sentence><sentence id="6525">So the few people who have looked, that have really taken a little look at it, I think were, very cautious about, or were not convinced they could feel comfortable living here. </sentence><sentence id="6526">We do have a black secretary in Barbourville and one in Harlan and we have a paralegal in Richmond, Richmond having a fairly much larger African-American community. </sentence><sentence id="6527">But the population is about ninety-eight percent white in our thirty-seven counties. </sentence><sentence id="6528">But I think the point I wanted to make was that we do, legal services offices are in the communities where our clients are and so you are much more associated and you are a part of that community. </sentence><sentence id="6529">I think we're a lot closer to our clients and you get to know your clients. </sentence><sentence id="6530">And you get to see the problems and live with the problems from day to day. </sentence><sentence id="6531">Not to say that all of us are poor, but I think after your kids, especially when your children get into the schools, you begin to feel that you have much more of a stake in trying to develop, do something about that community. </sentence><sentence id="6532">You find other parents who really want the best thing for their children, even though it may be what we're doing in court is not always popular. </sentence><sentence id="6533">Maybe our value systems are not on the same track as the other lawyers who for a large part are driven by the money they are going to make in private practice. </sentence><sentence id="6534">They do some good things in private practice along the way, but generally in the social structure people are driven by money. </sentence><sentence id="6535">So, I feel that the work we do, we represent about 7,000 clients a year and much of the work we do, whether for each of those clients, the case we help them on is the most important thing in the world, whether you've got to talk about an abused spouse or someone who's about to be evicted from an apartment or someone who we're helping with social security benefits or something small, or whether we're involved in some major issue involving the Broad Form Deed or safety discrimination, the cases that tend to get the headlines. </sentence><sentence id="6536">Or working on black lung, working on trying to help make black lung regulations more responsive, little more liberal, where more than five percent of the claims are approved. </sentence><sentence id="6537">Or something like David. </sentence><sentence id="6538">Each of those are a real, I think, positive contribution to helping people lead better lives and making the society a more just one. </sentence><sentence id="6539">So, I think it's, you asked me a while ago did I think we were going to be here thirty years when I came and I said I thought we'd be here maybe two or three years. </sentence><sentence id="6540">But I think the work has been so challenging and the opportunity to do this work has been a real privilege, that I always say we're fortunate at least to be paid for doing something we want to do. </sentence><sentence id="6541">And the government, state and federal governments are willing to provide funds to do it. </sentence><sentence id="6542">I think the newer, our younger lawyers give up a great deal to work for us, because they are working at very low salaries and many of them have large loan re-payments. </sentence><sentence id="6543">They start at 25,000 dollars a year and some of them have really huge debts of 80-90,000 dollars to their law schools. </sentence><sentence id="6544">We have a small loan re-payment program 6!

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="6604">A: I remember the teacher virtually threatened him because he couldn't keep the crayons within the lines, which is still a problem for some children. </sentence><sentence id="6605">I mean she was more concerned about his drawing, keeping the crayons in the lines. </sentence><sentence id="6606">And what, how that would, then realizing how, what a negative reaction this could have on a child, who was basically an academically-gifted young boy. </sentence><sentence id="6607">But you know, those were... the teacher eventually left, and we, I think we were fortunate that we had some teachers who saw how bright he was and that he began, that he was able to get the best for himself, was able to do quite well. </sentence><sentence id="6608">And we had a principal who wanted, who was very interested in the best, in providing good education for mountain kids, and who encouraged Jean to help start a Gifted and Talented program in the school. </sentence><sentence id="6609">And he never, there wasn't a single swing on the yard when we first came there. </sentence><sentence id="6610">And so we put together a little committee and gradually got a coal company to do some grading and developed a wonderful playground with the PTA, on the school grounds. </sentence><sentence id="6611">And that he just, his name was John Pitts. </sentence><sentence id="6612">He couldn't figure out where he wanted to put the swings, so he hadn't put them anywhere. </sentence><sentence id="6613">But he just needed some help. </sentence><sentence id="6614">And you know, and I think as people realize that what you want is the same thing they want. </sentence><sentence id="6615">That what you're trying to do is really not a turnover, turn everything upside down, that we're filing law suits every time... but what we're trying to do is help the community and be good citizens. </sentence><sentence id="6616">Then you begin to feel that people are on your side, even if the few lawyers aren't, and that we have a lot of support in this community. </sentence><sentence id="6617">And I remember in our PTA when the movement first started to put the Ten Commandments up on the walls of the classrooms, which is something that's come back today again. </sentence><sentence id="6618">I don't know if you've seen the paper, the Harlan County Board of Education voted to put the Ten Commandments on the walls, even though it's against the law and the Supreme Court has said you cannot do that. </sentence><sentence id="6619">We had a discussion in our PTA, a very thoughtful discussion. </sentence><sentence id="6620">And we had, there was, we had at least one family of Indians, not Native Americans, but from India. </sentence><sentence id="6621">A surgeon, whose daughter was in Michael's class. </sentence><sentence id="6622">And, you know, there were people, initially the reaction is what's wrong with the Ten Commandments? </sentence><sentence id="6623">They're perfectly good commandments. </sentence><sentence id="6624">And you know, I could say, "Well, they're the foundation of our faith as Jews, but they may not be the foundation of our Indian friends, and religions differ. </sentence><sentence id="6625">And I would be the last person to say there's anything wrong with the Ten Commandments, but they don't belong on the wall of the school right now." </sentence><sentence id="6626">And the attorney... at the time, they were waiting for the Attorney General to come out for an opinion. </sentence><sentence id="6627">So, the resolution at that meeting was to wait until the Attorney General came out with an opinion. </sentence><sentence id="6628">And people were quite comfortable with that. </sentence><sentence id="6629">I'm sure that if we hadn't been there, and I mean the point was... that was let's see, twenty years ago, that people accepted what we had to say, and were respectful of what we had to say, and were willing to wait. </sentence><sentence id="6630">And that wouldn't be always the case, I think, where you had folks who are very strong in their... and I'm sure some of those people are, were members of fairly doctrinaire, Baptist and... churches, but they were willing to say, "We'll wait." </sentence><sentence id="6631">And I think those things always give you some hope, I mean give you cause for feeling good about, being proud of the people you are with. </sentence><sentence id="6632">I mean I'm not always proud of everything everybody does, and you always wonder, but... So I think as we, both Jean and I, got involved in a lot of educational advocacy work, that we sort of knew we were here. </sentence><sentence id="6633">Then when our daughter, Annie, did not do well academically as she got into high school and had a lot more... she is a very social person and was friends with people who were 88   USHMM Archives RG-50.549.05*0007 89 very, very poor and friends with people who were quite rich. </sentence><sentence id="6634">And she had a lot of kids who were friends who were on the fringy group. </sentence><sentence id="6635">And she was in high school and was not doing well. </sentence><sentence id="6636">So anyway, she went to the David School, which didn't have many girls at the time and they were able to take her. </sentence><sentence id="6637">She hadn't dropped out. </sentence><sentence id="6638">She did really well there and thought the David School was a wonderful place because of the one on one. </sentence><sentence id="6639">And she had a very good math teacher who helped her with her math. </sentence><sentence id="6640">We got her back on the right track, academically. </sentence><sentence id="6641">But it was very hard for me to take her... I mean I felt, I really wanted to stick with the public school, public education. </sentence><sentence id="6642">But they were losing her, and she was a good example of a student who should have stayed, who had, at least then, average academic skills, but was just an example of someone that fell between the cracks because the teachers were not paying attention. </sentence><sentence id="6643">Which is something, I think, we've changed. </sentence><sentence id="6644">And I think that we've always continued to be involved in these kind of efforts to try to help out our schools and make this region a better place. </sentence><sentence id="6645">And I think that education has a lot to do with that. </sentence><sentence id="6646">And I think we see in my work here in the office, we do a lot of work, we represent parents of kids who have special needs and the schools tend to, they don't want to bother with them so often, unless you have a very committed teacher, who's going to work with students like that. </sentence><sentence id="6647">It's much easier to move them out of the way. </sentence><sentence id="6648">So when we, I think a lot of the cases we've done, the consumer cases, all the cases I've made reference to, the black lung work, where it's hard for, the organization wouldn't have anyone to assist them in these very technical fields without spending a great deal of money. </sentence><sentence id="6649">Helping them to write regulations that will benefit them. </sentence><sentence id="6650">All these things have been really a great place for me to work and for the lawyers who worked in this program. </sentence><sentence id="6651">I mean I think people who work in legal services across the country who devote their lives or their careers to serving the poor, are a wonderful group, I have a lot of admiration for them. </sentence><sentence id="6652">So it's always nice for me to come to work every day, because it's such a good place to be. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="6703">Q: I wondered, you mentioned that there is some racism in the area and you also talked a little earlier about how you had a difficult time when you first arrived, because people were thinking of you all as Communists or something like that. </sentence><sentence id="6704">And you had trouble renting an office and so forth. </sentence><sentence id="6705">Did you experience any anti-Semitism? </sentence><sentence id="6706">Did people know that you were Jewish? </sentence><sentence id="6707">Has that been a problem at all? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="6713">A: I don't think so, many people in this area don't know, really have had no experience with Jews at all, or Quakers for that matter, I think. </sentence><sentence id="6714">And so in the more recent years, I don't spend a lot of time at it, but I've been to church groups and talked about Judaism. </sentence><sentence id="6715">Maybe the Klan, the few members of the Klan, when they get together, their constitution talks about the white, Aryan race, and Jews, money-making Jews, and that kind of thing. </sentence><sentence id="6716">I've never been conscious, really of anti-Semitism here in any major way. </sentence><sentence id="6717">I know that those, I know that people who are strong Christians do feel that if you're not saved, you're going to Hell. </sentence><sentence id="6718">And so they have a real concern about us, whom they may like and they don't want us to go to hell. </sentence><sentence id="6719">And they would like us, I'm sure, to be saved. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="6729">A: No, I think... Annie probably went to more church, was, went to church more, because she spent more weekends with friends who went to church, some of whom are more evangelical than others. </sentence><sentence id="6730">We have been invited to many churches. </sentence><sentence id="6731">And we have gone to, more to the Presbyterian 89   USHMM Archives RG-50.549.05*0007 90 church than others because, probably the Catholics and the Presbyterians have run more programs for poor people. </sentence><sentence id="6732">And in this area over time, St. Vincent's Mission came in here. </sentence><sentence id="6733">Or maybe not the Catholic church as such, but the ministry. </sentence><sentence id="6734">They brought more, while they are also attempting to increase the number of Catholics in their ranks, I think their message of being socially concerned has been stronger than that of the other faiths, even though they are a minority. </sentence><sentence id="6735">The Presbyterian church was always very active with its Christian Service ministry. </sentence><sentence id="6736">And it's not as fundamental as the Baptist church and some of their beliefs with respect to Jesus. </sentence><sentence id="6737">So when Jean, as I said from the beginning was working with the Meals on Wheels program and a number of their related programs in this Christian Service ministry, we've gone there many times. </sentence><sentence id="6738">But there's never been any real, I mean we've known all of their ministers. </sentence><sentence id="6739">In recent years there's been a much more sharing between rabbis and ministers. </sentence><sentence id="6740">Now here, the Ministerial Association, they had a Catholic priest that was here when we first came, named Father... oh gosh, what's his name? </sentence><sentence id="6741">Getting a little tired. </sentence><sentence id="6742">Young Catholic priest was here. </sentence><sentence id="6743">It will come to me ina moment. </sentence><sentence id="6744">And they wouldn't let him in, wouldn't let him in the Ministerial Association. </sentence><sentence id="6745">He'd tend to wear moccasins around and wear blue jeans and was always a little bit out front on some of the social issues, working with welfare folks, and asking people about this being the way Jesus would have it. </sentence><sentence id="6746">He finally, I think, five or six years later, put a Christmas card in the paper, wishing all of his ministers well at Christmas, hoping they would have a nice Christmas. </sentence><sentence id="6747">He guilt-tripped them into it. </sentence><sentence id="6748">They finally let him in. </sentence><sentence id="6749">But there was that kind of thing, but there's never really been, I don't know, people have always been very nice to us maybe because, more about who we are than what the religion is. </sentence><sentence id="6750">I'm sure they would welcome our, many of the churches would have welcomed the conversions. </sentence><sentence id="6751">Or the fundamental religion, especially. </sentence><sentence id="6752">We've been to many funerals, I mean, when you get to these, especially when you go to a funeral where they preach over, about salvation and that you simply, you know, you're doomed if you're not saved. </sentence><sentence id="6753">And they're looking at you. ( </sentence><sentence id="6754">Laughing.) </sentence><sentence id="6755">But they mean well. </sentence><sentence id="6756">I mean that's what it is, they feel like we're going to be lost if this doesn't happen. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="6994">Q: Yeah. </sentence><sentence id="6995">So, going back, we were just talking a little bit off tape about some of your, about some of your speaking experiences and things that you've brought up or drawn upon when you've gone to commencement addresses and so forth. </sentence><sentence id="6996">And one of the things that you mentioned was the last case that you had before you left the Justice Department which had to do with the Kent State University violence. </sentence><sentence id="6997">Can you talk about your role in that and your point of view about what happened? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="7002">A: Well, I mean my role was, at the time was as Chief of the Criminal Section of the Civil Rights Division. </sentence><sentence id="7003">Because this involved the National Guard and potentially other police officials, state officials, the Justice Department is called in to investigate. </sentence><sentence id="7004">Potentially there is a federal crime when police officials act illegally or summarily and what we call summary punishment by not arresting, for example, students who do something wrong, but rather they overreact and shoot or punish or beat whoever the victim might be. </sentence><sentence id="7005">So, when this happened, this incident happened and was called to our attention, my job was to write a request to the Federal Bureau of Investigation to investigate, to see whether a violation of federal law had occurred. </sentence><sentence id="7006">And so, that being May of--how many years ago?--1970, thirty years ago, I drafted that request, which then was sent out under the name of the Assistant Attorney General of the Civil Rights Division, who I believe at the time was Jerry Leonard. </sentence><sentence id="7007">And I'm sure I'd have to go dig it out or I don't even know if I have a copy of it, you know, it would be fairly thorough about where they would be interviewing any witnesses who were there and whether they, the police officials in fact were threatened or there was any reason that would justify their having used force in shooting those students who were killed. </sentence><sentence id="7008">There was a long grand jury convened after I left. </sentence><sentence id="7009">As I recall it was actually inconclusive. </sentence><sentence id="7010">I think there was no federal trial. </sentence><sentence id="7011">I think there were civil trials later which I'm not sure, it seemed to me they may have recovered some damages for the families of the children, of the students who had been killed. </sentence><sentence id="7012">It was just a very tragic event. </sentence><sentence id="7013">There were others at the time. </sentence><sentence id="7014">I recall, I think when we were speaking, I had seen an article recently before I gave the commencement address here at Prestonsburg Community College, which happened to have been written by the President of Kent State University. </sentence><sentence id="7015">It was sort of a memorial column or just recalling those tragic events and the fact that they were in the memory of the President and people who were at Kent State now. </sentence><sentence id="7016">And that the school itself had made great progress in the intervening years and that this awful event was a milestone, obviously, in the history of the school, which sort of marred its reputation, along with... or which they felt marred its reputation. </sentence><sentence id="7017">It was not forgotten, but that since then the school had progressed and had moved into the age of technology and that she was very proud of their progress. </sentence><sentence id="7018">And I happened to be particularly moved by the way that she ended the column, which was that in this age of technology, it was important not to lose our humanity. </sentence><sentence id="7019">And so I was, used her, some of her quotations in concluding this address that I gave to the local students. </sentence><sentence id="7020">And it reminded me that it was also sort of one of the last things we did, that I did at the Justice Department, before we left on our vacation, but really left. </sentence><sentence id="7021">And then were headed for Appalachia. </sentence><sentence id="7022">93    USHMM Archives RG-50.549.05*0007 94 </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="7046">A: Well, I didn't, no. </sentence><sentence id="7047">My job basically, if... had I stayed, the office, the lawyers who worked with me and for me as Chief of the Criminal Section... after, the way those things would work is that when the FBI goes through its investigation and prepares a report, those are usually turned over to the United States Attorney for prosecution or for determination of whether a crime has been committed. </sentence><sentence id="7048">And generally then if there is some conflict, in other words when the officers say, "I thought that it looked like the student had a gun and that we had to shoot the student or we would have been killed," those factual disputes, someone has to resolve them by generally going to a grand jury, which is what happened. </sentence><sentence id="7049">And then either the U.S. Attorney co-operatively with lawyers from the Civil Rights Division, or... would make that presentation, but we left. </sentence><sentence id="7050">That was at the point after I had authored and drafted this report, this request, was when we left. </sentence><sentence id="7051">And so the investigation really went on and I believe one of my colleagues, Jim Turner, who was sort of one notch up in the hierarchy as a Deputy Attorney General(r), was sent out there and that he spent several months, along with reviewing the reports and working with the grand jury and then determining whether someone should be indicted or not. </sentence><sentence id="7052">I want to think that there was never, that there were no federal indictments, but I may be wrong. </sentence><sentence id="7053">It seems to me that was one of the sad things, that this was one of those, one of those sort of inconclusive... there were, on the face of it you would think that there was no reason to shoot students, because they were certainly not armed. </sentence><sentence id="7054">And that they got caught in the, were victims of what happened. </sentence><sentence id="7055">But I'm not sure that anyone was actually ever accused of having, of criminally having done this. </sentence><sentence id="7056">That there was some evidence in the heat of the moment that these folks felt threatened, their lives were threatened. </sentence><sentence id="7057">And that they, while they may have been negligent or they may have, whatever they did, that there was enough justification to make them question, that they made a bad decision, but it wasn't, certainly wasn't intentional on their part. </sentence><sentence id="7058">And that it may have been enough to warrant civil proceedings. </sentence><sentence id="7059">But that's the way those things always, you know, went. </sentence><sentence id="7060">And so in other circumstances, like when I was in the Houston case, we also asked the FBI to investigate and to assist us in determining, looking at records and other areas. </sentence><sentence id="7061">And then the lawyer who is responsible for the case, as I was in the Houston case with other lawyers working with me and were working under my direction, then I would present the case to the judge. </sentence><sentence id="7062">That's how those things work. </sentence><sentence id="7063">We're done. </sentence><sentence id="7064">I didn't do any more in Kent State. </sentence><sentence id="7065">I mean that was, most of that then happened after I left. </sentence><sentence id="7066">So it was a memory and this article that I happened to see in the newspaper sort of jogged my mind back. </sentence><sentence id="7067">It's sort of the punctuation mark. </sentence><sentence id="7068">It's the point at which we left. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="7092">Q: I wonder also if you had, at the time if you felt, you had mentioned in the earlier sessions of this interview how much you idealized this country and its constitution and the principles on which it was founded, and that you really held, had high expectations of it. </sentence><sentence id="7093">During the Vietnam War did you feel disillusioned with this country and its government? </sentence><sentence id="7094">Or did that change your perspective at all? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="7098">A: Well, I mean, I think there are lots of times when you wish political decisions were made, were different. </sentence><sentence id="7099">I mean I think that everyone is, that a lot of people are sad about our involvement in the Vietnam War. </sentence><sentence id="7100">I was in the war, served during the time of Korea. </sentence><sentence id="7101">It was obviously... and as I probably said before, there were lots of reasons I enjoyed the time I spent in the Service. </sentence><sentence id="7102">We (r) Actually was Deputy Assistant Attorney General. </sentence><sentence id="7103">94    USHMM Archives RG-50.549.05*0007 95 made a lot of very close friends, who I continue to see and hear from, and get together with periodically. </sentence><sentence id="7104">And I think you feel that you are doing something worthwhile when you're in the Service. </sentence><sentence id="7105">And helping this country in a small way. </sentence><sentence id="7106">But that I also noted that when, during the Suez Canal Crisis, when we were on alert for a week and no one was quite certain which side we were on, and that because the United States hadn't made up its mind which side we were on, and Israel was one of the partners, was one of the main parties involved in that dispute, the thought that we would be in a conflict with Israel was not very appealing to me, but that it just let me know how much of a, that this was not what I wanted to do (laughing), to be regimented in that way. </sentence><sentence id="7107">So that staying in the Service was not anything that I wanted to do. </sentence><sentence id="7108">On the other hand, I always, I think that it's a very dangerous occupation. </sentence><sentence id="7109">And I feel those people who are in the Military for a career, who really believe that this is an important thing to do, often that we owe a lot to people who have been, who have served in our Military, and who have either given their lives or come back wounded or who are veterans. </sentence><sentence id="7110">And I'm sure now we much, recognize much more the people in Vietnam, who may not have won a war, were nevertheless there because they were doing what they were told to do. </sentence><sentence id="7111">And of course a lot of people were willing, were Conscientious Objectors and didn't go. </sentence><sentence id="7112">My personal feeling is if someone's a Conscientious Objector they ought not to go. </sentence><sentence id="7113">And we ought to let them not go. </sentence><sentence id="7114">There are plenty of people who want to go or who were willing to go or there were and there were things that could be done. </sentence><sentence id="7115">So, I don't know that I, I'm not disillusioned. </sentence><sentence id="7116">I'm still very much a, feel very strongly that, I guess maybe it's a little rhetoric, but I feel that this is still the best country in many, many ways in the world. </sentence><sentence id="7117">There are a lot of imperfections with it, that we... and some of the issues that we have to resolve are very difficult issues. </sentence><sentence id="7118">When we see in this area the economy being as poor as it is. </sentence><sentence id="7119">We've lost a lot of jobs here. </sentence><sentence id="7120">Trying to catch up. </sentence><sentence id="7121">What I spoke about at PCC, of course, that, that the Kent State thing related to, I asked, I emphasized to the students how much they should be grateful for being in this free country. </sentence><sentence id="7122">It was also the, the week of the graduation was also the week of Law Day, in which we celebrate our freedom and the Constitution under which we live. </sentence><sentence id="7123">And it was also the anniversary of Holocaust Remembrance Day. </sentence><sentence id="7124">And it was the anniversary, the thirty year anniversary of Kent State. </sentence><sentence id="7125">And I think all of those are messages that we need to remember and reflect upon. </sentence><sentence id="7126">I think we do have a legal system that really is the basis for the freedom that we have. </sentence><sentence id="7127">And a lot of those freedoms are at times tenuous. </sentence><sentence id="7128">You worry when the Klan, you wish we did not have the Klan around, but the fact that we allow them to exist under, in a restricted way still is part of the freedom that we can enjoy. </sentence><sentence id="7129">And I think all of those kinds of issues sort of tumble around together. </sentence><sentence id="7130">And yet we, we have to be, we're always balancing those things. </sentence><sentence id="7131">And I think the political system that we're under, where we flip back and forth between a Democratic party in control and the Republican party in control at the state and national government, kind of keeps everybody off balance, at the state level and the federal level. </sentence><sentence id="7132">But it seems to make us sort of come out in the middle and even though lots of things go on that we don't like. </sentence><sentence id="7133">I mean I wish we had greater funding for legal services at the state and federal level. </sentence><sentence id="7134">And sometimes Congress, the legislation we have on, that affects welfare moms seems very punitive, at times. </sentence><sentence id="7135">And I know we could do better with that. </sentence><sentence id="7136">We clearly need a better health care system, there are lots of places where we can improve, where we ought to improve, being as rich as this country is. </sentence><sentence id="7137">We seem not to regard people, the problems poor people have as seriously as we ought to. </sentence><sentence id="7138">Well, that's a rambling answer. </sentence><sentence id="7139">I can't even remember, it seemed to me that we started with Kent State and we kind of got into what I was talking about, but it all kind of goes together.95   USHMM Archives RG-50.549.05*0007 96 </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="7185">Q: Yeah. </sentence><sentence id="7186">Kind of related to what you were saying, can you talk more, you had mentioned that sometimes, you mentioned off tape and I'd like to get this on tape, that you mentioned when you go to speak at various places within the community, people are interested in, partially interested in hearing you speak because of your Holocaust-related experiences. </sentence><sentence id="7187">And maybe you can talk about your, your invitation to speak at the hundred-year anniversary of one of the black churches here and also talk about why you think it is that people want to hear about that particular aspect. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="7191">A: Well, I think that the black church, the name right now escapes me, probably shouldn't. </sentence><sentence id="7192">The hundredth anniversary was an event they'd worked on, was quite a significant event for the church. </sentence><sentence id="7193">There are two churches in Wheelwright, Kentucky and this is one of them. </sentence><sentence id="7194">And they had been planning this anniversary for some time and have had a series of ministers over the years and it's a very cohesive community. </sentence><sentence id="7195">And I think, probably, one of the reasons they asked me to speak was because they related, they knew that I was Jewish and that I had been involved as a legal services lawyer and perhaps as a Justice Department lawyer in some civil rights issues over time. </sentence><sentence id="7196">But also that I was a, that my family had escaped from the Holocaust and they knew some of that history. </sentence><sentence id="7197">And I think they analogized it in their own way to the discrimination that they had felt and that they wanted me maybe to reflect upon the f act that there were people who were white and who were discriminated against because they were Jewish or for reasons other than race. </sentence><sentence id="7198">But that someone, a family lived in this community that had shared some of that history that their own families and ancestors had experienced over their lifetime. </sentence><sentence id="7199">I know that, I think in the schools, I think that the schools now have made the Holocaust a very much a part of their curriculum. </sentence><sentence id="7200">When I go, I've spoken to middle school students and elementary school and high school students. </sentence><sentence id="7201">And when I ask how many of them know who Ann Frank was or whether they have done a unit on Ann Frank, almost every hand goes up in the room. </sentence><sentence id="7202">I think that unit is probably done in the fifth and sixth grade and in the seventh grade. </sentence><sentence id="7203">And that, but the fact, I think teachers tell me, the fact that they see someone who is alive and who can come into their class and say this is what happened to my family. </sentence><sentence id="7204">I was eight years old when they arrested my father and took him to the concentration camp. </sentence><sentence id="7205">Or I was standing in the courtyard when they were dynamiting the synagogue. </sentence><sentence id="7206">That is always more, it makes a stronger point than having heard it from a third person. </sentence><sentence id="7207">And if it's someone in their own community that I suppose has been identified as having some credibility, that doesn't just make these stories up. </sentence><sentence id="7208">I think when you, you always tend to put some faith and trust in people that have lived with you a long time, who are part of the community. </sentence><sentence id="7209">It's kind of like any other, listening to older, someone described the history of the May house or the May family or their own family history. </sentence><sentence id="7210">When they've grown up here it means more. </sentence><sentence id="7211">At least I think that's, whenever you find someone, whether it's the war, my neighbor used to, my neighbor must have been on every beach. </sentence><sentence id="7212">He died a few years ago, but he was one of those Appalachian soldiers who was drafted and lived through every beach assault in the Pacific. </sentence><sentence id="7213">And even if he tells it in a low key sort of conversational way, it's very powerful to talk to someone who lived it. </sentence></p></dialogue>

I mean some of the church groups, when we first came Jean was... we were involved with the Presbyterian church a good bit because they did a lot of social, were more involved in local social projects. </sentence><sentence id="7251">They started Meals on Wheels and Christian Service Ministry that she was involved with. </sentence><sentence id="7252">And so the ministers who knew that we were involved, had Passovers and that I was Jewish and some of that developed into, people, by word of mouth realized that I wasn't born in this country and that I did have this experience. </sentence><sentence id="7253">But it wasn't, I guess in more recent years, I've had more, probably as people learned and as I spoke more about the Holocaust and about being Jewish, that there have been more, there's been a bit more of an awareness about the Holocaust. </sentence><sentence id="7254">I think partly because of the Holocaust Memorial and there's been more publicity generally about the importance of this whole era and trying to make people remember it and not let it be forgotten. </sentence><sentence id="7255">That all probably is part of the reason why this has come up. </sentence><sentence id="7256">And I think that tying it into Law Day is something that has gotten around among the teachers, that that's something I'm willing to speak about or can speak about on Law Day, that may be more meaningful to students than just talking about the Constitution or how the legal system works, which is the other thing that we generally do when we go to the schools. </sentence><sentence id="7257">Well, I don't have any doubt that the history, that our fleeing from Germany and coming to this country and being grateful for the opportunity to be free here, has sort of moved me into public service work. </sentence><sentence id="7258">I think that's pretty clear. </sentence><sentence id="7259">When I was in the military, I think it probably in a way helped move me to go to the Service as well. </sentence><sentence id="7260">I don't know that I went into the ROTC, which helped partly also with tuition. </sentence><sentence id="7261">Back then it was one of the ways of making Duke affordable, which was an expensive school. </sentence><sentence id="7262">But I mean, whether it's just the rationalization or the reason, | think I certainly felt that being in the Service was one way of trying to help fulfill my, help me give something back. </sentence><sentence id="7263">You can stay out of the Service. </sentence><sentence id="7264">I'm sure I didn't have to do that. </sentence><sentence id="7265">But that was during a time that people also were being drafted. </sentence><sentence id="7266">And that if you didn't want to be an enlisted man and wanted to do more with your career in the Service... I guess my bigger decision was that I was, I did have the option after coming out of Duke as a chemistry major, of going to work in the Military as being in something that was more science-related back then, working, using my chemistry degree. </sentence><sentence id="7267">And I decided really not to do...

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="7333">Q: All right, this is tape eight, side B. And uh, related to your work or to your experiences with speaking to groups, you had mentioned a little bit earlier that you have on Law Day talked about the Holocaust. </sentence><sentence id="7334">And what do you talk about when you talk about the Holocaust on Law Day? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="7337">A: Well, I talk about the contrast between a society that we have in this country, where we have a government and a nation, which is governed by the rule of law and what happened in Fascist Germany where the legal system was basically put aside for a dictatorship. </sentence><sentence id="7338">And that the kinds of things that were able to happen in the Holocaust, which was a result of Hitler's fanaticism. </sentence><sentence id="7339">And what did happen in that dictatorship, and how, again, grateful we need to be and how they, students, can reflect on or ought to reflect, and their teachers and all of this ought to reflect on the system we have in this country, which would not, hopefully, permit anything like that to happen. </sentence><sentence id="7340">That the checks and balances in the legislative, executive and judicial systems would keep that from happening. </sentence><sentence id="7341">And that we have, that free speech is important and that all of the guarantees that we have under the Constitution and under the Bill of Rights are very meaningful and that it's important to talk about them. </sentence><sentence id="7342">So I use, I guess the family's personal experiences, and I talk a little bit about the history of how all this came about in the 1930s from Hitler's rise to power. </sentence><sentence id="7343">How during the war, I mean even afterwards, how people would like to pretend in Germany that no one knew about it and this all sort of just happened and people are looking the other way. </sentence><sentence id="7344">At least were looking the other way and most, I suspect, did know about what was going on in the Death camps. </sentence><sentence id="7345">That's what I try to focus on and I think the teachers seem to appreciate that and seem to feel that it's a good way to have their students appreciate Law Day. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="7355">Q: Why don't you just talk about... you had mentioned in the first sessions that we did, something about the relationship between Judaism and justice, and it was something that you said that you had thought about. </sentence><sentence id="7356">Would you elaborate on that some? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="7359">A: Well, I don't remember what I said at the time, but the important tenet, I guess, of Judaism is the emphasis on justice, study and justice. </sentence><sentence id="7360">That the Ten Commandments and having a society where being just to each other and where you have a governing, legal codes that govern Judaism, which are principles of living really. </sentence><sentence id="7361">The major ones. </sentence><sentence id="7362">I might have said that those principles probably helped to influence me and the work that Ido. </sentence><sentence id="7363">I remember when we were just talking about Law Day, usually when I begin a talk, I talk a little bit about the fact that we've been, who we are and who I am, that I'm here in Prestonsburg. </sentence><sentence id="7364">We've lived in Floyd County all these years. </sentence><sentence id="7365">And talk a little about our legal services agency and try to describe that we do have a system in this country that provides lawyers for people who can't afford lawyers, on the criminal and on the civil side. </sentence><sentence id="7366">And that what this program, what Appalred and other civil legal services programs do and how difficult it is. </sentence><sentence id="7367">Many times it is basically impossible to navigate through the legal system without having a lawyer to help you, so that poor people are often on the short end of business transactions and many other people lose rights. </sentence><sentence id="7368">They lose benefits to which they are entitled. </sentence><sentence id="7369">And the kind of work that defenses in eviction cases, consumer cases, all the work that we have done. </sentence><sentence id="7370">The Broad Form, environmental work. </sentence><sentence id="7371">So I try to also mention that. </sentence><sentence id="7372">So, going back to what you were asking me, I don't know that it's any easier... I mean I think all religions, whether it's Christianity with Jesus" sort of different, somewhat little different spin on the loving aspect of God, that it's not as much of the retribution and thunder that you read about in the Old 99 USHMM Archives RG-50.549.05*0007 100 Testament. </sentence><sentence id="7373">But that any, I know there are a lot of people in legal services and folks have written about, who, even who have had backgrounds in Divinity School, or who feel that by helping, by using their legal talents to help people who are oppressed or who are poor or have been discriminated in one way or another, that that is a good way for them to live out their life and their principles and their values. </sentence><sentence id="7374">And providing legal services for low income people, I don't think that that's... there's anything particularly unique about being Jewish in that way. </sentence><sentence id="7375">I just, probably anyone who feels that their, that religion and a belief in God is part of their personality or their person, would feel the same way about that, I think. </sentence><sentence id="7376">I mean, we have people in legal services who are very religious. </sentence><sentence id="7377">They're Catholic, Protestant, Jewish. </sentence><sentence id="7378">And we have many people who are not religious, just as, I'm sure, other professions do. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="7400">Q: The question that had come to my mind before, that had slipped out, was kind of related to something that, when I've interviewed other Holocaust survivors, that gets brought up a lot. </sentence><sentence id="7401">And I don't know whether you" ll have anything to say to it or not. </sentence><sentence id="7402">But often I hear people say that they feel, hear people state an opinion about whether a Holocaust could happen again. </sentence><sentence id="7403">And many people say, "I think this is going to happen again." </sentence><sentence id="7404">That there is going to be some kind of mass persecution of the Jewish people. </sentence><sentence id="7405">And some people feel like that's not going to happen, but a lot of... it just comes up, and I'm wondering whether you feel like... you were talking a little bit earlier about the legal system in this country. </sentence><sentence id="7406">Do you feel like that system is really stable enough so that there is not potential for that kind of disruption or do you feel like it is possible for something like that to happen in this country? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="7414">A: In this country? </sentence><sentence id="7415">I would like to think that it could not happen in this country in our lifetime or in anybody else's lifetime. </sentence><sentence id="7416">I think that when you read about any sort of fanatical behavior, when you read about... it's only been a hundred years or a little more, well a hundred fifty years since lynchings were pretty commonplace in the South. </sentence><sentence id="7417">And we had a, quote, "legal system", that was not as... we didn't have transportation systems, and we lacked a lot of the modern conveniences, so that I think our life was a lot more rural. </sentence><sentence id="7418">But it seems to me that communities were pretty heartless about... I mean that there was, in the South more so than any where else, but on a large scale, African-Americans were property. </sentence><sentence id="7419">I mean they were property. </sentence><sentence id="7420">And anyone, and people seemed to accept that in a fairly major way. </sentence><sentence id="7421">I don't know that it would happen just to Jews. </sentence><sentence id="7422">And obviously the Klan had put Jews and Catholics into a group, blacks. </sentence><sentence id="7423">But you know, we see things, we see the American Indian in this country for years having, in not the very distant past, being treated as a second-class citizen. </sentence><sentence id="7424">You see... but in the next fifty years probably the white population as it is, or, quote, "Caucasian" population, will probably be a minority in this country. </sentence><sentence id="7425">So I don't know. </sentence><sentence id="7426">I do think that people can be fairly heartless. </sentence><sentence id="7427">I mean we've had this, even with the go around with theTen Commandments we've had in this state recently, that we have educators and superintendents who don't seem to get it, and don't understand or can't understand why anyone would object to putting those Ten Commandments on the walls of the school or a public building. </sentence><sentence id="7428">I mean that's always pretty scary to me, and they wield a lot of influence. </sentence><sentence id="7429">And they could be leading, they could decide that they're going to march on any one of us. </sentence><sentence id="7430">Any lawyer who lived in a local community that promoted, who was representing the other side. </sentence><sentence id="7431">I don't know that you would see anything like what happened in Germany, on that massive a scale, where you're filling boxcars with thousands of people on a schedule that end up being cremated and killed and gassed. </sentence><sentence id="7432">But I think people can, there are leaders that appeal to emotions and that in, just the same as the abortion clinics, you have folks who would like to defend the 100 USHMM Archives RG-50.549.05*0007 101 fact that they can kill somebody because their view is different than their own. </sentence><sentence id="7433">So I think it's possible and I think it is probable they"! </sentence><sentence id="7434">continue to happen as long as you have open gun, as long as gun laws are the way they are. </sentence><sentence id="7435">And as long as you have people who believe in these fairly, I don't know, fundamentalist religions. </sentence><sentence id="7436">Wars are fought. </sentence><sentence id="7437">All the things that we've seen in the last few years, and maybe this country is a little different because of its tendency to become more homogeneous, both culturally and racially. </sentence><sentence id="7438">But you think of all the Tutsis and the Hindus and you think Kosovo and you see all of these people and you see massive... as far as they're concerned it is a Holocaust. </sentence><sentence id="7439">Right? </sentence><sentence id="7440">I mean they are being killed in massive numbers. </sentence><sentence id="7441">We just aren't there. </sentence><sentence id="7442">I don't know and you feel pretty helpless over here trying to do anything about it. </sentence><sentence id="7443">So I don't know, we can always rationalize it by saying those aren't very civilized countries. </sentence><sentence id="7444">But all of these things seem to be done... I mean look at Israel and the Arab countries. </sentence><sentence id="7445">Both sides, certainly the Arabs, think that all of this is for Allah, and most of these massive killings are religious wars. </sentence><sentence id="7446">And they are done in the name of God for one side or the other. </sentence><sentence id="7447">Or the ethnic issues up there in Russia. </sentence><sentence id="7448">I mean tanks... so, who's to say that can't happen here? </sentence><sentence id="7449">I would like to think it wouldn't happen here because of all the different pressures that keep the country going. </sentence><sentence id="7450">For one thing, we're so materialistic, people want to keep making money and they want to keep a society and keep the economy going. </sentence><sentence id="7451">And wars and internal fighting and disputes on a large scale, they ruin countries. </sentence><sentence id="7452">| think if it's nothing more than that sort of selfish self-interest and political interest, that people know they're not going to allow anything of that scale to happen without calling out the National Guard or something. </sentence><sentence id="7453">At the same time you see on the television, you see all those things that you think somebody was just writing a fiction plot a few years ago, they can happen. </sentence><sentence id="7454">Whether it's biological warfare or some goofy, this computer virus stuff. </sentence><sentence id="7455">We see that everything is possible with technology. </sentence><sentence id="7456">But I don't know that anyone, these days, in this country, I'm not sure that we would have to fear a Holocaust. </sentence><sentence id="7457">I do think that minorities who live in fairly isolated situations, I think are always somewhat vulnerable. </sentence><sentence id="7458">Here in Floyd County now, it's a nice thing to say, we now have a mosque here in Eastern Kentucky, which is, I think, a real milestone. </sentence><sentence id="7459">And we do have more and more African-Americans and people of other cultures, who have, are finding a home and generally acceptance, at least in some economic, to some economic extent. </sentence><sentence id="7460">But I don't know that they are not always somewhat vulnerable. </sentence><sentence id="7461">To some extent there are people who are here because the area has needed more physicians and for economic reasons and they are excellent citizens. </sentence><sentence id="7462">Whether over time, like the osteopathy school or if the economy gets worse, people, they will have become enough of this community where they would stay and would speak their mind. </sentence><sentence id="7463">I thought they were, they were totally silent during the Ten Commandment debate. </sentence><sentence id="7464">I had encouraged some of them to speak out, because they were the most affected. </sentence><sentence id="7465">So, you, you know, it's the same way with the Jewish communities during, the Jewish families that moved South in the earlier days. </sentence><sentence id="7466">They stood by, they were in their communities, they were merchants in these towns and they could not join country clubs and they were being discriminated against. </sentence><sentence id="7467">They had African-American maids at home. </sentence><sentence id="7468">And they were certainly willing to live in a segregated society, because it was economically favorable to them. </sentence><sentence id="7469">I think I may have said that earlier. </sentence><sentence id="7470">I think those things are, those are difficult ethical, philosophical issues. </sentence><sentence id="7471">But it has to create a certain level of discomfiture for people who are doing that. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="7575">A: We were, we were still on our honeymoon. </sentence><sentence id="7576">We got married in February, 1967 and this was February, 1967. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="7579">Q: Okay. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="7581">A: We flew back, back. </sentence><sentence id="7582">We were out of the country probably ten days and we were going to spend another five, four or five days in New York seeing some plays or something. </sentence><sentence id="7583">But when you were were back in this country and this case was ready to go or we were ready to get in and get ready for trial. </sentence><sentence id="7584">So I kissed her good-bye and I went to Mississippi. </sentence><sentence id="7585">And I spent, specifically actually, I primarily did two things. </sentence><sentence id="7586">I spent almost a month interviewing people who were prospective jurors in the case. </sentence><sentence id="7587">Because nowadays they have psychologist, psychological, they have these jury experts that are sitting, that sit with the lawyers and who've done big sophisticated background checks and they" ve even sometimes tried cases to juries to try them out. </sentence><sentence id="7588">They" ll have a mock trial and have a mock verdict. </sentence><sentence id="7589">But by learning through the black community, who the members of the white community were that might be trustworthy and who were supportive and who thought this was a dreadful thing, this killing of the three workers and who were upstanding citizens and who would know people, basically, I created a notebook of information about the jurors. </sentence><sentence id="7590">I mean we didn't know who the twelve would be. </sentence><sentence id="7591">You get a list of about forty or fifty. </sentence><sentence id="7592">And so I collected information on these people by word of mouth primarily. </sentence><sentence id="7593">And met a lot of people, and then put this notebook together for John Doar, who was my boss and for the U.S. attorney for trial, which they used in selecting the jury. </sentence><sentence id="7594">102    USHMM Archives RG-50.549.05*0007 103 </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="7609">Q: How were the forty people selected in the first place? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="7611">A: They're chosen out of the jury wheel, at that time in most states, they were chosen off the voter list, the voting lists. </sentence><sentence id="7612">You put all the voters... it's a federal court, so the district is much larger than just a county. </sentence><sentence id="7613">So you're more apt to get people that cover a much larger area. </sentence><sentence id="7614">And I think the trial was in Biloxi, in the Southern district of Mississippi with Judge Cox. </sentence><sentence id="7615">And so these jurors were somewhat spread out. </sentence><sentence id="7616">I mean it wasn't all the way across the state, but it was in Southern Mississippi in several counties. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="7623">Q: And was there some kind of quota with the jurors, where there were supposed to be a certain amount white and a certain amount black? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="7625">A: No, but there were blacks on the jury, but the blacks were, they were struck. </sentence><sentence id="7626">Now I was in some earlier trials in the early, when I first came, we had a trial in Georgia involving SNCC workers, who were some voter registration workers, including several of whom were black. </sentence><sentence id="7627">And then later with the trial of Fannie Lou Hamer and they were all white jurors. </sentence><sentence id="7628">It was really at a time before, again it was something at the time that was not challenged as being unlawful, the system for selecting jurors and that resulted in no blacks being on the jury. </sentence><sentence id="7629">Now this particular jury, now in the Southern District, you would think, probably, that half the people on the jury would have to be or close to half would have to be black, because the voting requirements have been so slackened. </sentence><sentence id="7630">Because that was another part of this whole civil rights struggle, was they were using literacy tests at the time. </sentence><sentence id="7631">I'm pretty sure... and that would make sense, because the number of black voters back then was still very, very small, and so you had very few blacks. </sentence><sentence id="7632">And they were not, probably every qualified, voting black was probably in the jury pool. </sentence><sentence id="7633">So, I don't know if they were out of the, let's say the twelve, that were called initially or fifteen, as they were being struck, there may have been several who were black, but they were struck, so that the jury was an all white jury. </sentence><sentence id="7634">But I was, of course, felt pretty good, because we got a conviction. </sentence><sentence id="7635">So I felt like that work was at last helpful. </sentence><sentence id="7636">The other thing that I was, we had always, the way we did our trials in the Civil Rights Division... I may have talked about this before. </sentence><sentence id="7637">We'd have two people inside the courtroom putting on the case and then the fellows outside the courtroom who were responsible for preparing witnesses and making sure, and having things go right. </sentence><sentence id="7638">In the Neshoba County case, my other responsibility, well there were several others, but my one major responsibility was to firm up the identification of the workers. </sentence><sentence id="7639">And that was... of these three civil rights workers who were killed. </sentence><sentence id="7640">And that was done through their dental records. </sentence><sentence id="7641">We went back and found who their dentists were and the dentists" charts and compared them, in the event that that was in dispute. </sentence><sentence id="7642">I don't think we put the dentists on, and it may be that it was admitted, but we did that. </sentence><sentence id="7643">And then there was clothing that had been retrieved from the workers, and the whole issue of proving that they were who we claimed they were, that they had been the murdered workers. </sentence><sentence id="7644">And then I did a lot of other, I did some... there were other parts of the case, where you're trying to make sure that everything is together. </sentence><sentence id="7645">And some of the witnesses were not heard. </sentence><sentence id="7646">There were people who, a deputy sheriff at one point picked up a young woman who was an Indian--there was a Choctaw reservation in that area--who was an Indian, and she overheard a conversation. </sentence><sentence id="7647">But she didn't speak English. </sentence><sentence id="7648">So when we wanted to go talk with her, we had to find an interpreter to try to tell us what she was saying. </sentence><sentence id="7649">I think actually she did testify, 103   USHMM Archives RG-50.549.05*0007 104 because she overheard them saying something that indicated they knew what was about to happen or that they were going to stop the workers when they let them out of jail that night. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="7678">A: Right, she just spoke a very broken English and she remembered some phrases that they had said when she was picked up. </sentence><sentence id="7679">They gave her a ride. </sentence><sentence id="7680">I don't remember how we tracked her down, but it was something that was helpful like that. </sentence><sentence id="7681">The grand jury, I worked on the grand jury a while, one of my roles was nothing more than a logistician. </sentence><sentence id="7682">I was in Biloxi, getting people driving from Neshoba County, but the grand jury was sitting in Oxford. </sentence><sentence id="7683">And we were moving, I was doing a little more than that, besides interviewing. </sentence><sentence id="7684">I kept taking people to the airport and sending them from Biloxi to Oxford. </sentence><sentence id="7685">Keeping the witnesses going. </sentence><sentence id="7686">That took, we had a lot of logistical issues in getting, finding these people way out in the country and brining them down--especially African-Americans--who had been mistreated, and getting them to the airport and getting them up there and back. </sentence><sentence id="7687">But then the fact that there was a conviction in this case, John did a, really quite a remarkable, did a very, very good job in presenting the case. </sentence><sentence id="7688">It was a big effort. </sentence><sentence id="7689">It was a very sad thing to kind of work on that. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="7726">A: Well, I was just saying in that particular situation I always can picture, we had the clothing put away in boxes behind the door. </sentence><sentence id="7727">But it was really... the stench of those clothing was so strong, that it was always there. </sentence><sentence id="7728">And for some reason that always stuck with me more than the dental records. </sentence><sentence id="7729">Well, you do, you feel very badly for the families, you feel kind of not very forgiving, I think, for the people who did this. </sentence><sentence id="7730">And of course, there were some church burnings before that. </sentence><sentence id="7731">The atmosphere around, in Mississippi and Neshoba County among the, in the

</sentence><sentence id="7734">They were violent, and just bad people in that sense. </sentence><sentence id="7735">So I think you have a, if anything you're probably driven. </sentence><sentence id="7736">I don't know that I ever felt depressed, I think most of us, and at the time this was a pretty highly motivated group of lawyers, who worked in the Civil Rights Division. </sentence><sentence id="7737">It was a very relatively small group of lawyers in the early "60s. </sentence><sentence id="7738">It was sort of a sidelight, but I mean Congress's commitment to civil rights was not great either. </sentence><sentence id="7739">The Division had very few lawyers working on civil rights cases when I started in 1962. </sentence><sentence id="7740">And they had to beg for any money, and so there were very few of us and we worked on these voting rights cases, it took an enormous amount of time and it was hard to do more than two or three of them. </sentence><sentence id="7741">We'd spend months looking at records and microfilm. </sentence><sentence id="7742">And we worked extraordinary long hours. </sentence><sentence id="7743">He couldn't understand why people who were family men with children would want to go home at the end of the day and not come back and work at night or work on Saturdays or work on Sundays. </sentence><sentence id="7744">Of course, there were some folks who got divorces over that hard work, just as they do in the Service, I think. </sentence><sentence id="7745">So I don't know, I think that lawyers get depressed when they lose cases. </sentence><sentence id="7746">And we lost, we lost many cases in the early stages in the lower courts, voting rights cases and others, because the judges themselves were segregationists and were appointed and came out of that society. </sentence><sentence id="7747">So we had to appeal their decisions before and they were reversed and all of that took time. </sentence><sentence id="7748">So, when you work hard, it doesn't matter what, if you work hard... then when we knew we were going to lose, it's... and then you did lose, you're sort of prepared for it. </sentence><sentence id="7749">And you really are trying to put the case together in the first level, so that it's a compelling case to the next level. </sentence><sentence id="7750">And that's what happened, we overprepared and we generally won, eventually we would win. </sentence><sentence id="7751">And then gradually the law started to change. </sentence><sentence id="7752">It took a very long time, and so I've said many times it was fortunate or maybe because of that slow pace and the limited role of the federal government, that somebody like Martin Luther King had to come along. </sentence><sentence id="7753">Or that blacks had to organize themselves and realize, as so often happens, that people have to organize and that movements get started and that direct action has a place. </sentence><sentence id="7754">And it all sort of came together in this instance around the Voting Rights Act of 1965. </sentence><sentence id="7755">That's when Jean and I met.

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="7804">A: I don't, not really, I think. </sentence><sentence id="7805">There was a very good, made for T.V. movie about that case. </sentence><sentence id="7806">I'm often asked about "Mississippi Burning," which is a popular movie that came out, which was not really accurate in many ways. </sentence><sentence id="7807">But I thought it depicted the hatred of the atmosphere at the time fairly well, and some parts of it were there. </sentence><sentence id="7808">Jean and I have a, at our house, the painting of the sailboat in our living room is from the restaurant called, it was from Meridian, called Wideman's Restaurant, which was where we worked out of the Meridian office, which is close to Neshoba County. </sentence><sentence id="7809">But I don't think so. </sentence><sentence id="7810">I mean, one of the other last things beside the Kent State thing that I did at the Civil Rights Division was to, you know after these folks were convicted, then they appealed their conviction and it went on. </sentence><sentence id="7811">That took a few years. </sentence><sentence id="7812">And I think one of the other last things that I did was to file a brief opposing their last motion not to be sent off to prison. </sentence><sentence id="7813">I wrote the response to that and then they were picked up. </sentence><sentence id="7814">Then they finally went to jail. </sentence><sentence id="7815">So that was about 1970. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="7830">A: Not, it only comes, it comes up, well, my friend Ned Pillersdorf, who is a practicing lawyer here, teaches a class on the court system, on I think, civil liberties and the law. </sentence><sentence id="7831">And he generally has speakers come in, other judges and I usually come in for a night with him. </sentence><sentence id="7832">And I've spoken a few other times, but really not very much. </sentence><sentence id="7833">And I'm not sure that that many people are aware of what I did. </sentence><sentence id="7834">I mean I don't particularly publicize it. </sentence><sentence id="7835">If I'm giving a speech and somebody's writing some background about my legal history, they'll generally mention that. </sentence><sentence id="7836">But I don't really do much speaking about it. </sentence><sentence id="7837">Usually the schools have a unit on it. </sentence><sentence id="7838">There's a lot of, certainly a lot of written materials and most of those... Taylor Branch's books quote my boss, there's a lot in Taylor's books about John Doar(tm). </sentence><sentence id="7839">And usually when books are written like that, that's who they are going to write about. </sentence><sentence id="7840">I don't know that I'm anybody necessarily. </sentence><sentence id="7841">But locally if people ask, I will talk about the cases. </sentence><sentence id="7842">I mean I've spoken a few times, not recently about the legal developments of these, of how we put these cases together and the Voting Rights Act and the impact of the Voting Rights Act. </sentence><sentence id="7843">But then I left in 1970 and I've been doing this legal services work for thirty years. </sentence><sentence id="7844">And unless those things come together somewhere, it's become part of my, sort of distant past, except for reunions of Civil Rights Division lawyers and some of the ongoing contacts I've had with people. </sentence><sentence id="7845">So not really very much. </sentence></p></dialogue>

</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="7874">A: Well, I think probably what I had reference to was after Richard Nixon was elected and William Mitchell became Attorney General(r), they did not want to continue to seek bussing of students as a remedy to undo segregation. </sentence><sentence id="7875">And bussing, Charlotte had accepted a bussing remedy and several other states, too. </sentence><sentence id="7876">The problem is when you have a segregated community, so that white students, black students are, if you don't use something like bussing, you can't achieve very much integration, unless you pair up schools where the two housing districts happen to be close. </sentence><sentence id="7877">Where they call that pairing of schools. </sentence><sentence id="7878">You could pair schools that are in nearby neighborhoods. </sentence><sentence id="7879">But the Nixon administration, so the Nixon administration really backed, not only on bussing, but they generally felt, I think, that the position of the Department in the past had been too strong towards moving towards integrating classrooms. </sentence><sentence id="7880">And they were more inclined towards free choice, which would essentially leave student... the schools white and black, with some very few exceptions. </sentence><sentence id="7881">And the Houston case was filed right after the Nixons came in and we did ask for bussing as a remedy. </sentence><sentence id="7882">And it was the last case that they allowed that to go through. </sentence><sentence id="7883">In fact, the Assistant Attorney General, who was probably called on the carpet about it a little bit, because it had gone to him and he had approved it. </sentence><sentence id="7884">And I don't know that he was brand new, whether he really focused on it as much as he might have. </sentence><sentence id="7885">But the Attorney General had to, I think had to sign it as well. </sentence><sentence id="7886">We went forward in that case. </sentence><sentence id="7887">It was a very large case. </sentence><sentence id="7888">Houston was the third-largest school district in the country. </sentence><sentence id="7889">I can't remember, a couple of hundred schools. </sentence><sentence id="7890">They had, what they had done is spent millions and millions of dollars building new suburban schools outside, on the outer fringes of Houston. </sentence><sentence id="7891">At the same time they let the inner-city schools decay, so it was really doubly bad. </sentence><sentence id="7892">It wasn't just, in some school districts they tried to upgrade black schools to prevent desegregation. </sentence><sentence id="7893">In Houston they didn't care. </sentence><sentence id="7894">They spent all their money on white schools and let the black schools get worse. </sentence><sentence id="7895">So, but then at the same time they bussed white kids past black schools and blacks past white schools. </sentence><sentence id="7896">So we asked for, I had an expert from Miami, Florida, who was an expert in school desegregation matters. </sentence><sentence id="7897">What a minute, maybe he was from Austin, Texas. </sentence><sentence id="7898">Mike Stolee. </sentence><sentence id="7899">I guess he was from Austin. </sentence><sentence id="7900">Well, one or the other. </sentence><sentence id="7901">And he testified as to the need to bus and that using bussing as a remedy would produce a, basically an integrated school system, with all the advantages that might come, or that could come with that. </sentence><sentence id="7902">There was much more to it in the case than that, but basically that was it. </sentence><sentence id="7903">The other phenomenon at the time was that the Chicano community was just developing, so that it was like we had three donuts. </sentence><sentence id="7904">You had a core of inner-city black schools, then you had a small, growing donut around it of Chicano communities and then you had all the whites on the outside. </sentence><sentence id="7905">But racially, Chicanos were treated as whites at that time, and probably still are. </sentence><sentence id="7906">There's a designation for themselves, but we were trying to desegregate a school district that had traditionally been black and white. </sentence><sentence id="7907">And so one of the things that the judge in the case did, was pair up some white schools with Chicano schools, which I wasn't particularly happy about. </sentence><sentence id="7908">I mean I don't know that we had achieved very much, as we had hoped to do. </sentence><sentence id="7909">There were some other things. </sentence><sentence id="7910">We didn't get a lot of bussing, but we got, the Board was required to spend massive amounts of money to get, to upgrade schools. </sentence><sentence id="7911">And the other, probably the best thing that happened was they threw out the School Board. </sentence><sentence id="7912">They voted in a new School Board that was much more moderate. </sentence><sentence id="7913">And they got rid of the lawyer who had gotten rich representing the Board and keeping the system segregated. </sentence><sentence id="7914">This case that I was working on had been filed many years before that and the NAACP had sort of reactivated it and urged the government to enter the case, which we did. </sentence><sentence id="7915">And so when we moved down there with four or five lawyers, and Jean came 6 This is a misstatement--John Newton Mitchell (1913-1988) was Attorney General under Richard Nixon, 1969- 1972. </sentence><sentence id="7916">William Dewitt Mitchell was Attorney General from 1929-1933 under Herbert Hoover.107 USHMM Archives RG-50.549.05*0007 108 with me, we had not been married too long and we rented an apartment, we lived there four or five months getting ready for this trial. </sentence><sentence id="7917">And when it was over, we took a big trip and nine months later our son Michael was born. </sentence><sentence id="7918">Actually we went to Canada, up to Calgary and... you ever been up there? </sentence><sentence id="7919">Lake Louise, Banff. </sentence><sentence id="7920">Wonderful country. </sentence><sentence id="7921">Houston, I still sort of scratch my head a little bit. </sentence><sentence id="7922">I haven't kept up with what... there was an appeal of that order. </sentence><sentence id="7923">And I wrote part of the brief on appeal. </sentence><sentence id="7924">Still have it with me. </sentence><sentence id="7925">But I always felt a little badly about the limited result of the pairing of the schools, but I think it helped a great deal in the long run in different ways, to move that system from what it had been, where they had just let the black schools deteriorate into such terrible condition. </sentence><sentence id="7926">Then let's see, Michael was born in 1970, I still had a hearing, a pre-trial, I think, not a pre-trial, but a conference right after he was born. </sentence><sentence id="7927">We delayed it because I expected him to be born in April. </sentence><sentence id="7928">So, that was April 1970. </sentence><sentence id="7929">I think that's about it. </sentence><sentence id="7930">I don't know if you're thinking about something else in the case. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="8012">A: I don't, I don't, no, I don't think I had thought about being out of here. </sentence><sentence id="8013">There were a couple of things probably, one was one of the earliest cases that we were involved with, involved the local health care establishment, for example. </sentence><sentence id="8014">There was a federal program in here, that wanted to set up what is now a federally funded health care clinic, that Eulah Hall was associated with. </sentence><sentence id="8015">But the governing agency was a Community Action agency, which had some public officials and local doctors, who were either on the Board or very close to the governing Board and they basically didn't want this thing to do anything. </sentence><sentence id="8016">They were going to use it primarily as a taxi service to... they had a trailer, which was fully equipped sitting out, for example, at Mud Creek, but all they used it for was people would go to the trailer and then they'd drive them into Prestonsburg to get their medical services from Prestonsburg physicians, that would get money. </sentence><sentence id="8017">So, they were reimbursing them for services, but they wouldn't allow anybody to be treated out there. </sentence><sentence id="8018">Not even a nurse to give them shots. </sentence><sentence id="8019">And then they employed a doctor. </sentence><sentence id="8020">The local medical establishment threw a lot of roadblocks into his getting a license. </sentence><sentence id="8021">And it was just a lot of trouble getting it. </sentence><sentence id="8022">So the welfare rights groups came to me and we filed some administrative complaints and basically threatened to close the thing down. </sentence><sentence id="8023">I mean their decision was if it wasn't going to work and be responsive, let's just not have it. </sentence><sentence id="8024">Let's not waste the money. </sentence><sentence id="8025">Well, two things happened, one was, of course, that Jean wasn't sure who her doctor would be, since 108   USHMM Archives RG-50.549.05*0007 109 they were all mad at us. </sentence><sentence id="8026">And so she wondered if she could get any child care, any medical care for her son, who was less than a year old, or just about a year old. </sentence><sentence id="8027">And then the establishment, the doctors or the agency complained to Congressman Perkins(r) about it and he asked for an audit by the General Accounting Office of what we were doing, not just in this case. </sentence><sentence id="8028">There was at the same time a lot of hostility by local lawyers to having our get started. </sentence><sentence id="8029">They thought basically we were going to take money out of their pockets. </sentence><sentence id="8030">So the GAO sent an inspector here, which wasn't too... but he was in our office for about a month. </sentence><sentence id="8031">He looked at all, every piece of paper and then he issued... they ended up issuing a report which was really very favorable and complimentary. </sentence><sentence id="8032">And when I called Congressman Perkins to ask him about this thing, about his request, he said not to worry about it. </sentence><sentence id="8033">He was doing it to placate the local officials. </sentence><sentence id="8034">He was sure it was going to work out okay. </sentence><sentence id="8035">So there were things like that. </sentence><sentence id="8036">And I had the local Bar was quite hostile. </sentence><sentence id="8037">I went to them on one occasion and asked them, told them I wanted to set up a system to refer clients to lawyers who, if the clients weren't eligible for our services, if they made too much money, that we wanted a fair system. </sentence><sentence id="8038">So, would they want to give me a list of the lawyers in some order, the ones that would take certain cases and not take...

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="8213">A: It seems that companies just won't regulate themselves. </sentence><sentence id="8214">They will not. </sentence><sentence id="8215">We've seen that over and over again, whether it's the chemical industry or the mining industry. </sentence><sentence id="8216">Because where people are looking for profit, primarily, they don't want to shut something, a mine down, long enough to fix what's broken or to take real measures to keep dust levels down until somebody has made them do it. </sentence><sentence id="8217">Because every time you do that, you have to slow production down a little bit and you won't produce as much. </sentence><sentence id="8218">So, as a result you have a high incidence of black lung disease and you have an unfriendly worker environment. </sentence><sentence id="8219">Finally things have started changing in the last few years. </sentence><sentence id="8220">So now I think it's much more accepted, if that's the right word, I think people even can understand or they see it happening and they see that that's probably one of the roles that we play. </sentence><sentence id="8221">And that we have done over the years, but I think at the same time they can see that what we do is responsible. </sentence><sentence id="8222">That we have good lawyers. </sentence><sentence id="8223">That we don't make up law suits and that generally there's a good reason for what we do. </sentence><sentence id="8224">When we can do something in the community, like the housing project, where we're working with public officials, who are now, who want to do something for people who let's say live in substandard housing, out of their own sense of duty or their own feeling that everybody's entitled to have a decent place to live in. </sentence><sentence id="8225">If you've got that sort of in county government, then those are people we can work with and not have to sue. </sentence><sentence id="8226">I mean, I'd like nothing better than to have us, to be able to put ourselves out of business.(Laughing.) </sentence><sentence id="8227">But, I don't know, I think that's a long way off. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="8246">(Laughing.) </sentence><sentence id="8247">Do you, okay, so last time you talked about the Broad Form Deed and how that case was dealt with and the victory that resulted from that. </sentence><sentence id="8248">And you talked about the development of the community in David and I'm wondering... and you also talked about the establishment of the Kentuckians for the Commonwealth, which was called Fair Tax Coalition first, and the work that that organization started on doing. </sentence><sentence id="8249">So I think those were the main things that you talked about during this era that you have been in Prestonsburg. </sentence><sentence id="8250">I'm wondering if you want to highlight anything else from those years? </sentence><sentence id="8251">Go into detail about anything else? </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="8252">A: Well, I think we've... there are some other sort of unique things that we've done. </sentence><sentence id="8253">I think I'm very proud of the work that we've done on behalf of coal miners, who have refused to work in unsafe conditions. </sentence><sentence id="8254">We established a mine safety project, where we represent those miners in seeking a reinstatement and damages for having been fired unjustly--excuse me--or discriminated against unjustly. </sentence><sentence id="8255">I think that's been real successful. </sentence><sentence id="8256">And the lawyer who did that for a number of years, Tony Oppegard, who is now the Assistant to the Director of the Mine Health and Safety Administration, who was an Appalred lawyer in West Virginia years ago. </sentence><sentence id="8257">I think that's been very significant. </sentence><sentence id="8258">We've represented a lot of disabled coal miners in applications for black lung benefits, this federal program, where so many people, right now, ninety-five percent of the people are denied, because the governmental regulations are so severe and it's so difficult to obtain the claims. </sentence><sentence id="8259">But we still manage... and the private bar hardly does those cases at all. </sentence><sentence id="8260">So we've worked with the Black Lung Association, Bill Worthington, for example, officers of the Black Lung Association, in trying to get Congress to be, relax those requirements and to have better regulations that are fairer, that we see a more reasonable number 112   USHMM Archives RG-50.549.05*0007 113 of people be approved for black lung benefits. </sentence><sentence id="8261">We have won many of those claims, the ones that we've screened and where private attorneys finally gave up. </sentence><sentence id="8262">Because it takes so long for private attorneys to get their fees and because they're so complex and take so long, we're going to get another lawyer to come in pretty soon, nearer in the next few months to do that. </sentence><sentence id="8263">And the mine safety and black lung work sort of go hand in hand. </sentence><sentence id="8264">The same thing is true of coal miner, of pension benefits. </sentence><sentence id="8265">We had a case we went to the United States Supreme Court on involving pension benefits where we lost. </sentence><sentence id="8266">But it really helped them, I think, in some ways to re-write their requirements. </sentence><sentence id="8267">But Gracie, it's the Gracie Robinson case, a woman up here, a widow up in Auxier, whose husband had worked over thirty years in the coal mines, but had not stopped working and applied. </sentence><sentence id="8268">And he died in the coal mines in an accident. </sentence><sentence id="8269">And the requirements for obtaining a widow's pension was that the miner should have applied for a pension and stopped working. </sentence><sentence id="8270">And since he was killed in a mine accident they said he hadn't applied for his pension, they wouldn't give her her pension. </sentence><sentence id="8271">We said that was arbitrary. </sentence><sentence id="8272">If he's worked thirty years and you only have to have twenty-five to get a pension. </sentence><sentence id="8273">And he wanted to keep working, that it was like punishment at that point. </sentence><sentence id="8274">We won and then we lost in the District court and then we won in the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia and then we lost in the United States Supreme Court. </sentence><sentence id="8275">But they did actually re-write that provision in the bargaining contract. </sentence><sentence id="8276">But I think the work we do for low, for disabled miners has been really important. </sentence><sentence id="8277">I think the... in the last few years we've started a migrant farm worker program up in Richmond, where we got some money from the legal services Corporation to help migrant workers throughout the state. </sentence><sentence id="8278">We have a very small grant. </sentence><sentence id="8279">It's only about 35,000 dollars, so we've done that co-operatively with a program in Texas that represents these folks full time. </sentence><sentence id="8280">And we've managed to file some of the first cases with respect to working conditions. </sentence><sentence id="8281">I mean there are cases where the workers come up here and the grower breaches the contract or at least our workers claim the growers have breached their contract by not providing the working time that they claimed they would or the working conditions under which they would work. </sentence><sentence id="8282">And the program, the Western Kentucky program had the grant a few of years ago and they just could not really find the workers and we were, by getting together with the people in Texas, the paralegal from Texas came up and who helped... who helped to do this project, did the outreach work. </sentence><sentence id="8283">And oh [YAWNS] and for example he would meet the bus, the Greyhound bus coming in at one o'clock in the morning at the station and give out his card to the workers and then they would know how to contact him. </sentence><sentence id="8284">That kind of thing. </sentence><sentence id="8285">And you have to be bilingual, obviously, but I think that's been a very, even though we have very few migrant workers out here in Eastern Kentucky, there are a number of other areas in the state, especially where they have large tobacco farms in Western Kentucky, that's where we've had so many of our cases. </sentence><sentence id="8286">I think most recently the development of our housing coalition here, called LINKS(r)", where we're doing this huge home repair project. </sentence><sentence id="8287">With all the groups that are coming in from out of state. </sentence><sentence id="8288">And just bringing all these agencies together under one roof, so they can collaborate and work together, I think has been a real positive development. </sentence><sentence id="8289">Showing people how they can, I mean we've pulled together a lot of different agencies and non-profits, who are all addressing housing issues, into one collaborative. </sentence><sentence id="8290">And I think everybody's been real pleased with that. </sentence><sentence id="8291">I think we've been able to do that because we don't have any axes to grind or turf. </sentence><sentence id="8292">We just said, ""We want to do this and we're willing to do it if you all will cooperate and we can seek funding together, and do some cooperative work." </sentence><sentence id="8293">And so now I actually am sharing a grant with the fiscal court, which would have, and for a worker here, who is a young woman who came from Jean's program. </sentence><sentence id="8294">A participant, who is very, very deg7 Low Income Housing Coalition of Eastern Kentucky.113   USHMM Archives RG-50.549.05*0007 114 bright and who has moved up very fast. </sentence><sentence id="8295">Who is a single parent. </sentence><sentence id="8296">Could go to law school if she were willing. </sentence><sentence id="8297">And that makes me feel good. </sentence><sentence id="8298">And we've had a number of people like that, who are single parents, who have been on welfare, who have worked with us in a training situation over a few months" time and have really, really sort of progressed so quickly and come out of their shell and have moved on to good jobs. </sentence><sentence id="8299">I think we have a pretty extraordinary group in most of the offices. </sentence><sentence id="8300">It's a good program to me, I mean if I go through the senior staff in this organization, I'm just really proud of who they are and what they do. </sentence><sentence id="8301">Many of them have been with me a long time and each of them has different skills, but they're all committed to what we, this representation of low-income persons, who otherwise wouldn't be able to have lawyers. </sentence><sentence id="8302">Whether it's for a mundane situation or something that is pretty exciting, that will really effect a lot of other people in the future. </sentence><sentence id="8303">I think we've, I think we do very, very good legal work and I think we have real committed people who are doing it.

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="8564">Q: Okay, tape number ten, side A, an interview with John Rosenberg. </sentence><sentence id="8565">I guess now would be a good time for you to say something about your work with establishing the Science Center. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="8568">A: Okay. </sentence><sentence id="8569">Well, I was a chemistry major as I think you know, and I think that we've always known that the scores of our students here in science and math were very low and that science, math and technology was not valued very highly. </sentence><sentence id="8570">So a number of years ago, maybe nineteen, somewhere between 1990 and "92, I asked teachers, some teachers to come together and some other folks in the community to see whether we might not start a, developing some ideas for improving math and science, and what they thought. </sentence><sentence id="8571">And what we learned was that teachers were very uneasy about teaching math and science. </sentence><sentence id="8572">Many of them had very poor backgrounds during their teacher training and they were ill-equipped, especially at the elementary level, to try to present scientific concepts. </sentence><sentence id="8573">And they really wanted more hands-on activities to support them. </sentence><sentence id="8574">So we, we sort of met periodically and then over the next couple of years. </sentence><sentence id="8575">And then I saw a small video segment, or heard about it, about a college up in Pennsylvania, Western Pennsylvania, Juniata College", which had obtained funding for a science van, where a chemistry teacher was driving a van around and dropping experiments off at high schools, dropping off equipment that the schools couldn't afford to buy. </sentence><sentence id="8576">And was like a sort of Johnny or Jeanie Appleseed, would tell school A about what school B had done with these things. </sentence><sentence id="8577">Over the course of several years the number of incoming students at Juniata College who were, who majored in or who showed an interest in science, studying science-related courses, like tripled. </sentence><sentence id="8578">So, I thought it would be, then got to thinking that we would like to, wouldn't it be nice if we did something like that. </sentence><sentence id="8579">I had not, I don't think had really thought about the planetarium theater kind of thing yet. </sentence><sentence id="8580">But we were meeting and we got a small grant back about 1990, maybe "94 as a result of this work and this group that kept meeting. </sentence><sentence id="8581">We realized that we could maybe establish a center like that if we could get some funding. </sentence><sentence id="8582">So, we got a little money out of the legislature, I think 75,000 dollars to hire a consultant. </sentence><sentence id="8583">One of the legislators here in this area, Greg Stumbo", was interested in technology and with KERA" having come in I think there was a strong, an atmosphere that was conducive to getting some funding. </sentence><sentence id="8584">And I thought we should start off in a small way, so we hired a consultant from West Virginia, Mike Howard, who had worked in the Kentucky educational system, to do some community meetings and help us look at more specifically where we fit and what kind of activities would be helpful. </sentence><sentence id="8585">And it sort of reinforced what we had already known in some ways, that teachers wanted hands-on Mr. Wizard kinds of things. </sentence><sentence id="8586">And that if we could bring presentations to them and do something like the science van and educational programs, that that would be helpful. </sentence><sentence id="8587">And I don't know where I first came up with the idea of trying to do a planetarium or a science museum or really, I thought it might be nice if we could even replicate a coal mine. </sentence><sentence id="8588">But I started, we started talking that up and realized that if we had a modern facility it would be really meaningful. </sentence><sentence id="8589">And I also learned that you could, they had these portable planetariums that you could take around to schools, which are little... they call them planetarium in a foot locker, where you blow up, it's like a vinyl thing and you blow it 68 Juniata College, Huntingdon, Pennsylvania.

operating grant and on a fairly short notice we got a local architect to put together just a schematic of what a theater and planetarium might look like and what it could do, and that we would, and

<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="8989">Maybe it's not a question, maybe it's just an observation, but you've, in your work have kind of devoted yourself to people who, really you naturally don't share a whole lot in common with, I mean as far as your own background and your own tradition. </sentence><sentence id="8990">And in some ways that's why... </sentence></p><p><sentence id="8991">because those people were separated from mainstream culture and because they were disadvantaged in various ways, that's why you felt the need to work with them. </sentence><sentence id="8992">But yet it seems that your own tradition as a Jew and as a refugee from Nazi Germany has been an important part of your identity. </sentence><sentence id="8993">I kind of wonder how you've kept that connection with your roots and with that tradition alive and whether that's been a difficult balance for you in a context that's so separate from it. </sentence><sentence id="8994">I think so many Jews and in particular so many refugees, so many survivors have felt the need to be among people who really understand what they've been through and who had experienced something similar to what they'd experienced. </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="8995">A: Well, I don't know. </sentence><sentence id="8996">I think some people just feel the need to continue to...

You know, there are great differences among Jews, as you were saying at lunch, in the way, in the philosophy of the Holocaust Museum and how it should be run. </sentence><sentence id="9018">I have, my mother's sister, at least one if not both of them, but one of them for certain, would say she would never step foot into Germany again. </sentence><sentence id="9019">I mean there are many Jews who came from there, who think it's heretical to go back to Germany and would never forgive anybody and would draw the line in the sand. </sentence><sentence id="9020">Whereas Mom went back and would go and continue to have some correspondence with people. </sentence><sentence id="9021">And they were very touched to see her and she was touched to see people she went to school with. </sentence><sentence id="9022">My ties, and you know I still have very good friends who I went to school with in North Carolina and Gastonia and that sort of thing and in the Service. </sentence><sentence id="9023">I think it's all, I guess it's one humanity. </sentence><sentence id="9024">I mean I think you just, you kind of try to get the most out of what you can, wherever you happen to be. </sentence><sentence id="9025">And that has been pretty, I think that in terms of relationships here hasn't been that hard. </sentence><sentence id="9026">I think the most difficult, the big difficulty is that, one difficulty is that most of us who are professionals in legal services or in others, who are in a helping profession or if that's the way we choose to live our lives, in a sense we live a pretty, we live, really, a middle-class life with our own surroundings. </sentence><sentence id="9027">And we have most of what we need. </sentence><sentence id="9028">We are not disadvantaged the way our clients are disadvantaged. </sentence><sentence id="9029">On the other hand, our value systems are totally different from our counterparts in private practice or in the business community. </sentence><sentence id="9030">So we don't share a lot of their values. </sentence><sentence id="9031">And so you have to kind of make your own life and if you need a lot of friends in the community that may be difficult. </sentence><sentence id="9032">And I think to some extent that's why you have turnover in communities. </sentence><sentence id="9033">Or because you become absorbed in your own world and you do stay so busy and you do enjoy the work that you do, that that takes up a lot of your time. </sentence><sentence id="9034">Which is some of, I think, the kinds of stuff that Jean and I keep going, that keeps us going. </sentence><sentence id="9035">Whereas in a place like Washington, even if you're working all the time, you're... and legal services is probably that way, you're socializing and working with the same group of people, because you're always 124    USHMM Archives RG-50.549.05*0007 125 together. </sentence><sentence id="9036">And so you don't really need a lot of outside help. </sentence><sentence id="9037">I think that's... and that's why I said earlier, the school, I think when your kids start to school, you start to develop much more of a base in the community and you meet parents. </sentence><sentence id="9038">Maybe even socially your friends become, at least for a few years, the parents who have kids in schools like you do. </sentence><sentence id="9039">And that social engagement helps to, I think, draw you into the community and start thinking about things like a Science Center. </sentence><sentence id="9040">I mean the first ten or fifteen years I was here, the idea of, you're just going uphill all the time. </sentence><sentence id="9041">And even the idea that, that you might be working together with the business community. </sentence><sentence id="9042">I mean when I was filing these coal cases, the very notion of trying to seek funding, from say the coal council that's given the Science Center some money to design coal exhibits. </sentence><sentence id="9043">I would have said, "We can't do that." </sentence><sentence id="9044">We had a big debate, I was on a Bar committee that was doing a booklet for the elderly, health care for the elderly and rights of the elderly. </sentence><sentence id="9045">And whether we should get money, accept money from Humana, because we were suing Humana. </sentence><sentence id="9046">I said, "I don't want any of Humana's money." </sentence><sentence id="9047">Well, we eventually took Humana's money and gave them a, I can't remember. </sentence><sentence id="9048">The other committee members said, "Let's get the money, don't worry about it and give them a little acknowledgement. </sentence><sentence id="9049">You can sue them. </sentence><sentence id="9050">Let's get their money." </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="9101">A: Right, get their money twice. </sentence><sentence id="9102">Those are philosophical issues that are hard to grapple with. </sentence><sentence id="9103">That's why I say, now that I'm sharing a grant with a judge. </sentence><sentence id="9104">I sued that judge, ten years ago ina strip mining case, he was in the Service. </sentence><sentence id="9105">And we've had a couple of knock-downs, but he wants, he's very... I think he, you know, he's like a lot of other political figures, but he came up the hard way and he wants to see this be a better place to live. </sentence><sentence id="9106">And he's willing to invest his time to try to improve housing and clean up garbage and do things that bring in industry. </sentence><sentence id="9107">And as long as we don't bump into each other over other things, I think that's a good thing to do. </sentence><sentence id="9108">And so those are the kind of things that help make being in the community more, when you start thinking well maybe we can do things with others and make this a better place for everybody, even if we have to step on some toes. </sentence><sentence id="9109">The problem in agencies like these is the temptation with many agencies, of course, especially state, to jump over, it's too easy to get co-opted. </sentence><sentence id="9110">And so you, as you were talking about, the problem in the museum or any institution, if you start becoming cautious because you're afraid somebody's going to cut your money off, or you're going to lose your job or something is going to happen, then you lose the effectiveness. </sentence><sentence id="9111">And I think we've been able to avoid that, I think, pretty well. </sentence><sentence id="9112">I think people know, have known me, that I don't want to get into that position. </sentence><sentence id="9113">And the people on both sides of the fence, that I'm not going to do that. </sentence><sentence id="9114">IfI did that, I'd stop one or the other. </sentence><sentence id="9115">That I think that... it doesn't mean that you can't compromise. </sentence><sentence id="9116">But it is, you get put into those positions and that's hard, especially when you have funding sources that are problematical. </sentence><sentence id="9117">I mean, that's hard. </sentence><sentence id="9118">Like the migrant cases, when we had some publicity in one of the migrant cases that we filed and people went screaming to Congress. </sentence><sentence id="9119">My counterparts are worried we're going to lose the money in the State Legislature if they find out legal services is involved in this case. </sentence><sentence id="9120">That kind of stuff can be really hard, and you just try your best to get through it. </sentence><sentence id="9121">But I'm pretty pleased with where we've come. </sentence><sentence id="9122">I hope whoever takes over will keep it going that way. </sentence><sentence id="9123">Most of the people who run my offices, I think, have that philosophy. </sentence><sentence id="9124">I can't remember what you asked. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="9278">Q: Why don't you repeat that you are going to talk about a couple of cases, because I didn't get that part either. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="9280">A: Yeah, I was just going to tell you about a couple of... when you said is there anything else and then we started talking about stories. </sentence><sentence id="9281">And I said I didn't really do very well with stories, which I don't. "" </sentence><sentence id="9282">m nota storyteller. </sentence><sentence id="9283">But I thought I might mention a couple of experiences, just about legal cases that I was involved with that I don't know that I've mentioned. </sentence><sentence id="9284">The first one is one in the early "70s or in the early "70s that involved the Paintsville Housing Authority. </sentence><sentence id="9285">A family, part Indian, named Elsie, the father was named Elsie Dale. </sentence><sentence id="9286">They lived in a shack, in an old house and their house burned down. </sentence><sentence id="9287">And so he applied to get into public housing and they wouldn't let him in. </sentence><sentence id="9288">So, I went over there and when I got there Elsie had taken some of the charred timbers that were left and put them up against an old automobile, his car. </sentence><sentence id="9289">And the family was living there. </sentence><sentence id="9290">And they applied for public housing and they wouldn't let them in. </sentence><sentence id="9291">They wouldn't let them in because the community treated them as black, not as... I mean Indian. </sentence><sentence id="9292">They were dark-skinned. </sentence><sentence id="9293">But they were very poor. </sentence><sentence id="9294">And so we went to the Housing Authority. </sentence><sentence id="9295">We started investigating. </sentence><sentence id="9296">And it turned out that the Housing Authority had also threatened to kick out some unwed mothers. </sentence><sentence id="9297">And then there was a guy named, what was this fellow's name? </sentence><sentence id="9298">He was a veteran. </sentence><sentence id="9299">A single father. </sentence><sentence id="9300">They didn't want him to... he wanted to get in with his child. </sentence><sentence id="9301">They didn't want 127   USHMM Archives RG-50.549.05*0007 128 him in. </sentence><sentence id="9302">The woman who was running the place, Maxine somebody, was very... she let you in if she knew you. </sentence><sentence id="9303">It was who you knew. </sentence><sentence id="9304">There was nothing fair about the system and she just didn't want them in the project. </sentence><sentence id="9305">So, we filed a lawsuit. </sentence><sentence id="9306">It was one of the first large cases that we had filed. </sentence><sentence id="9307">And on the way up there, I had to get, we had a hearing, we were to have a hearing in Lexington for preliminary injunction. </sentence><sentence id="9308">And we were trying to get the witnesses together. </sentence><sentence id="9309">And that night I was going to pick up the fellow who was the veteran. </sentence><sentence id="9310">And I couldn't. </sentence><sentence id="9311">He wasn't at home. </sentence><sentence id="9312">And I finally found him and he was drunk. </sentence><sentence id="9313">And I had to get him up there. </sentence><sentence id="9314">And so I finally got him in my car, and we got as far as Salyersville and I filled up the gas tank. </sentence><sentence id="9315">And he was riding with me. </sentence><sentence id="9316">And he wanted, as we were leaving the gas station, he wanted to get out. </sentence><sentence id="9317">And he was... what did he want to do? </sentence><sentence id="9318">He started to hit me. </sentence><sentence id="9319">I threw hot water in his face. </sentence><sentence id="9320">Oh, I threw my coffee at him. </sentence><sentence id="9321">And I remember the coffee spot stayed on the side of the car. </sentence><sentence id="9322">So, we then drove, we started driving, I had this old Peugeot in 1970, because Jean and I had bought it to take a camping trip. </sentence><sentence id="9323">We brought it to drive down here. </sentence><sentence id="9324">We had a "59 Volvo and we had this old Peugeot. </sentence><sentence id="9325">And we had like a "62 or "66 Peugeot, which we had taken on our camping trip. </sentence><sentence id="9326">So, we got halfway to Lexington and I started having car trouble. </sentence><sentence id="9327">I got out of the car to look under the hood. </sentence><sentence id="9328">And my witness, who was still partially drunk, then locked me out of the car. </sentence><sentence id="9329">And the stars were out. </sentence><sentence id="9330">I remember, it was a beautiful night. </sentence><sentence id="9331">He wouldn't let me back in. </sentence><sentence id="9332">What was his name? </sentence><sentence id="9333">Elvin... Anyway, I bet I was out of the car for about half an hour. </sentence><sentence id="9334">He finally let me in. </sentence><sentence id="9335">We got into Lexington about 1:30 in the morning. </sentence><sentence id="9336">Next morning he was sober, and he got on the stand and he was a very, very good witness. </sentence><sentence id="9337">And I had a blow-up of this big automobile with the timbers and Elsie Dale got on and testified. </sentence><sentence id="9338">He had four kids. </sentence><sentence id="9339">He needed a four-bedroom unit. </sentence><sentence id="9340">And the clerk of the court started crying. </sentence><sentence id="9341">I mean it was so sad, they wouldn't let him in. </sentence><sentence id="9342">But the judge would not order the Housing Authority to let them in. </sentence><sentence id="9343">He said I could try to prove that there was further discrimination and as it turned out that day... And the unwed mothers, Effie Pickelsheimer was her name. </sentence><sentence id="9344">She testified. </sentence><sentence id="9345">We put on a strong case, but the judge was not going to do anything that day. </sentence><sentence id="9346">So anyway we came back. </sentence><sentence id="9347">But I always remember throwing this coffee. </sentence><sentence id="9348">Thirty years later. </sentence><sentence id="9349">What was his name? </sentence><sentence id="9350">He had a short, fat... he eventually, the same person was indicted because he shot a guy in the back, who had started a fight with him. </sentence><sentence id="9351">And I went to visit him in the jail about twenty years later after that particular... Crum was his second name. </sentence><sentence id="9352">It wasn't Elvin Crum, what was his first name? </sentence><sentence id="9353">Well, we ended up having a number of grievance hearings. </sentence><sentence id="9354">I got the know all the tenants in that project. </sentence><sentence id="9355">This case went on for about two years. </sentence><sentence id="9356">In the meantime they were tearing down a new section, an old section of Paintsville. </sentence><sentence id="9357">So we were able for Elsie, he really wanted a house of his own. </sentence><sentence id="9358">And as part of the settlement of this case we were able to get him a Farmer's Home House built by the Community Action Agency. </sentence><sentence id="9359">He never got in the housing project. </sentence><sentence id="9360">But they were such a nice family and you knew the only reason they didn't live in the project was because they were not white. </sentence><sentence id="9361">We did finally get a very good, agreed court order that required them to set up a very fair system. </sentence><sentence id="9362">And for years after that they wouldn't... anytime there was a question about whether somebody should get in or not, they would call me, because they didn't want to go back to court. </sentence><sentence id="9363">But it was a case that went on forever. </sentence><sentence id="9364">And finally really was resolved in a very favorable way for the clients in that housing project. </sentence><sentence id="9365">I was thinking, another, when we talk about the effect cases have, I represented a group over from Pike County, who, they were supposed to strip mine above their, they were going to strip mine this holler above their homes in Poor Bottom off Maribone Creek over in Pike County. </sentence><sentence id="9366">And the families were worried that the strip mine was right over their houses and that the rocks and boulders were... So when we looked into it, we learned that there were deep mine workings that had been worked out inside the mountain and that if they strip mined around 128   USHMM Archives RG-50.549.05*0007 129 the front side, they were in danger of hitting those old deep mine workings which were filled with water. </sentence><sentence id="9367">And the water would then potentially be a real problem to the people down below. </sentence><sentence id="9368">It just could come out in gallons and wash away houses. </sentence><sentence id="9369">So we had a couple of hearings in Frankfort and one of the lead plaintiffs was named Edith Easterling, who was very much involved in the case against the McShurleys, which is when the Appalachian Volunteers were here, I don't know if you now about that? </sentence><sentence id="9370">There was this series in The New Yorker about this couple that was arrested by the local prosecutor. </sentence><sentence id="9371">The case went to the House Un-American Activities Committee. </sentence><sentence id="9372">Anyway, Edith's daughter was name Sue Kobak, she'd married a young man in Washington. </sentence><sentence id="9373">And she was home and she went to the hearings with us. </sentence><sentence id="9374">And they couldn't find, we were the only folks that could represent anybody because it would cost a fortune. </sentence><sentence id="9375">There were no lawyers around who would represent this community to try to stop the strip mining. </sentence><sentence id="9376">It had actually already started. </sentence><sentence id="9377">I had a wonderful expert, a guy who had been an inspector. </sentence><sentence id="9378">And she went to the hearings with us. </sentence><sentence id="9379">And I didn't know this until later, after she got home, she applied to go to law school and went to law school as a result of seeing this experience. </sentence><sentence id="9380">And actually an experience that had a favorable outcome. </sentence><sentence id="9381">The administrative judge said that we were right in that they had left, this information about the water in the old workings was not on the permit application. </sentence><sentence id="9382">And that he considered it to be a danger to the family and they stopped the strip mining operation totally. </sentence><sentence id="9383">Edith Easterling a wonderful person, a remarkable woman. </sentence><sentence id="9384">And I didn't know until after was in... and Sue went to law school and had a difficult time as an Appalachian student for a couple of years. </sentence><sentence id="9385">She later married a doctor in Clintwood and she's a city attorney in Clintwood, Virginia. </sentence><sentence id="9386">I was just thinking back about those sorts of human, and you become... you were asking me earlier, you become very close to your clients. </sentence><sentence id="9387">She had organized that little holler. </sentence><sentence id="9388">And it potentially was a really serious problem. </sentence><sentence id="9389">We did a lot more strip mining work than we have in recent years because some of the lawyers who worked for us are now doing that in private practice. </sentence><sentence id="9390">I just recently represented somebody in Letcher County, whose name had been left off, their property had been left off a mining map. </sentence><sentence id="9391">They just left them off because they didn't... and they knew, they knew that she owned the property that they wanted to mine and that she wasn't going to let them mine. </sentence><sentence id="9392">And so they left, they thought, I think, they could get away with it by just leaving their name off the map, which they are required to put on to show the property that they intend to mine, figuring they might just pay her damages when it was over. </sentence><sentence id="9393">And she was outside, this is an older widow, looking up there and saw the trees getting cut, coming over the hill. </sentence><sentence id="9394">It was one of the cases that I did. </sentence><sentence id="9395">And then we stopped them from going any further and the state agreed that they should not do that. </sentence><sentence id="9396">So I don't know, I was just thinking back on Elsie Dale and the people you get to meet in these cases, who have to be pretty gutsy to stand up against pretty moneyed interests, who pay big bucks for lawyers and who hire people in the community, who hire their... I think one of these folks had a son who was a truck driver for the same company that had mined, that was mining that strip mine. </sentence><sentence id="9397">You're always running into that, that sort of situation. </sentence><sentence id="9398">But in every one of these cases, you know, whether it's in legal services or it's the discrimination cases like Fannie Lou Hamer, and the people who... Eulah Hall always reminds me of, you mentioned Eulah Hall. </sentence><sentence id="9399">You know Eulah and I went to Washington together because in this health care case. </sentence><sentence id="9400">I don't know if I mentioned that the first time, when Eulah started this clinic and I was telling you this morning earlier about the medical clinic when they wouldn't let these folks do this medical thing. </sentence><sentence id="9401">What happened then, we asked for a hearing and she was my witness and I took her to, we went to Washington and we had an administrative hearing. </sentence><sentence id="9402">And they came back down here and did a big (tm) Vista workers arrested under Kentucky Sedition Statute 129   USHMM Archives RG-50.549.05*0007 130 investigation and they threatened to close it. </sentence><sentence id="9403">They ended up reorganizing it with a new board of directors, and... </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="9535">A: Clinic, yeah. </sentence><sentence id="9536">The clinic, the program that was in being, because it wasn't doing what it was supposed to do. </sentence><sentence id="9537">And then so they ended up reorganizing that clinic with a new board. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="9543">A: Well that's what turned into the Mud Creek Clinic, which is now a nationally-known clinic. </sentence><sentence id="9544">Back then it was called, yeah, I guess back then it was just the Mud Creek Clinic. </sentence><sentence id="9545">There was a period of time, it went through several phases, where it was called Big Sandy Health Care, whatever... back then it was really under the Community Action Agency. </sentence><sentence id="9546">But eventually it became the Mud Creek Clinic. </sentence><sentence id="9547">Then that clinic burned down. </sentence><sentence id="9548">Jean, she got her nursing degree, did her internship out there after it had been burned down. </sentence><sentence id="9549">They put a phone on the telephone pole. </sentence><sentence id="9550">And Eulah kept the place going in her house. </sentence><sentence id="9551">No one believed she could do it. </sentence><sentence id="9552">In three weeks she raised like 200,000 dollars over the telephone. </sentence><sentence id="9553">And this was a social worker with a fifth-grade education. </sentence><sentence id="9554">And she raised enough money, maybe it wasn't two hundred, to build a new clinic. </sentence><sentence id="9555">And it's been expanded several times since then. </sentence><sentence id="9556">Now they have a dental clinic and a daycare center and it's a real wonderful institution. </sentence><sentence id="9557">That was a place, the only place... and a good friend of ours became a doctor there. </sentence><sentence id="9558">That's the place where we took our kids. </sentence><sentence id="9559">Now it's run by a federally-funded group called Big Sandy Health Care up here. </sentence><sentence id="9560">They also run a clinic in Magoffin County and one in Pike County. </sentence><sentence id="9561">And Eulah has stayed right with it. </sentence><sentence id="9562">I mean she's won these wonder woman awards. </sentence><sentence id="9563">She's on lots of boards and lots of committees. </sentence><sentence id="9564">And has just kept on, but day to day she's still the social worker out there. </sentence><sentence id="9565">And she's represented people in social security and black lung cases, and has really learned it. </sentence><sentence id="9566">Recently had her picture hung in the Capitol in that Women's Galleria, you know, one of those, the Kentucky Commission on Women, Women of the Year things, or whatever they call them. </sentence><sentence id="9567">I'm real proud of her. </sentence><sentence id="9568">I think she's quite a testimonial to what people can do when they want to do it. </sentence><sentence id="9569">And she worked with us for a few years as an outreach worker with Appalred. </sentence><sentence id="9570">So those are the people you come across, you know. </sentence><sentence id="9571">Hard to beat, right? </sentence><sentence id="9572">Well, I guess we can call it a day. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="9633">Q: This is tape number eleven, side A. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="9635">A: Well, we're talking about and I was thinking about how you maintain your Judaism as it were. </sentence><sentence id="9636">A few years ago we learned that there was still a congregation in Williamson, West Virginia, which is about thirty-five miles from here, much closer than Lexington and we went over there one Friday night. </sentence><sentence id="9637">And found a very friendly group of people, who were meeting sort of monthly and being served by the rabbi from Huntington, West Virginia, who comes down on a Sunday night to do a Friday night service. </sentence><sentence id="9638">And the synagogue is an old, old synagogue. </sentence><sentence id="9639">I don't know, probably a hundred years old at least. </sentence><sentence id="9640">It sits up on top of a hill in the black section of Williamson. </sentence><sentence id="9641">And there's no elevator and you've got to walk up a huge bunch of steps, well, probably twenty-five. </sentence><sentence id="9642">And the average age of the people other than us is about seventy. </sentence><sentence id="9643">But they've kept on going and they consist of folks from Welch and Grundy and nearby people who are in a probably twenty, thirty mile area from around Williamson. </sentence><sentence id="9644">I think twenty years ago during the height of the coal mining in this area and maybe through the seventies and eighties I think they had fifty families. </sentence><sentence id="9645">Over the years the kids have moved away and so the older members of the Williamson Jewish community are still there. </sentence><sentence id="9646">And the President is a fellow named Bill Rosen, whose son is now a circuit judge in Ashland. </sentence><sentence id="9647">But it's been a nice group of people, and the rabbi, who is from Huntington, is an interesting personality. </sentence><sentence id="9648">His wife teaches a, not Headstart, but Upward Bound program. </sentence><sentence id="9649">And I've actually been... the rabbi teaches a class at Marshall University on Jewish studies. </sentence><sentence id="9650">And so I've visited his class and spoke about the Holocaust as sort of a living survivor. </sentence><sentence id="9651">But it is interesting, and then it's much nicer to go to a congregation of that sort, where every person that comes is one more person that makes a difference, rather than going to Lexington, where you've got a large congregation at Adath Israel and there's also the Conservative, the Orthodox congregation there. </sentence><sentence id="9652">So, that's been very nice. </sentence><sentence id="9653">We actually have, there are other, three other Jewish mixed couples here. </sentence><sentence id="9654">Miriam Silman, whose father, by the way, had the contract to, was an engineer, who re-did, who did the plans to re-do Mount Vernon. </sentence><sentence id="9655">And then Pam Weiner, whose husband is from here, from Pike County, and is a Buddhist. </sentence><sentence id="9656">They just had a baby. </sentence><sentence id="9657">And then Deborah Golden, who is a lawyer with my Pikeville office. </sentence><sentence id="9658">And then there is another couple in Pikeville, Terry Mulliken, who's a lawyer. </sentence><sentence id="9659">His wife, Cynthia, has been on my Board. </sentence><sentence id="9660">It used to be there's a large family in Pikeville that used to go to Williamson, their name Yaruses. </sentence><sentence id="9661">They're friends of ours. </sentence><sentence id="9662">But they, and they go, now they're older and they go once ina while. </sentence><sentence id="9663">But the Williamson community was sort of the hub of the Jewish residents of this area for many years. </sentence><sentence id="9664">Now there are probably twenty families that are left. </sentence><sentence id="9665">One of the younger set married, a young woman married an Israeli when she was in Israel and they have a little boy. </sentence><sentence id="9666">They've recently been divorced. </sentence><sentence id="9667">Very few young members. </sentence><sentence id="9668">But it is there and we have, we joined that congregation, so that we once again do have a, sort of a formal tie to a Jewish community that's here, for whatever it's worth. </sentence><sentence id="9669">I guess it's worth putting that down. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="9705">Q: Is it a Conservative? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="9707">A: It's Reform. </sentence><sentence id="9708">Now the congregation the rabbi is from in Huntington, you had a Reform and an Orthodox congregation merge. </sentence><sentence id="9709">Really unusual. </sentence><sentence id="9710">And so it's sort of conservative. </sentence><sentence id="9711">And I think he actually has, for the benefit of the Orthodox members, he has services on Saturday morning as 132 USHMM Archives RG-50.549.05*0007 133 well. </sentence><sentence id="9712">He's a very funny fellow, almost like a stand-up comic when he does sermons. </sentence><sentence id="9713">Because he" ll say something very serious and then it will jog his mind to kind of say something funny, reminds him of something funny. </sentence><sentence id="9714">But he's a very bright fellow. </sentence><sentence id="9715">It's a nice group. </sentence><sentence id="9716">I mean, it's obviously an older group and they depend on one or two people like the Rosens and one or two other families to sort of keep it going. </sentence><sentence id="9717">You know, once they got the air conditioning... I don't know how many more years they can do that. </sentence><sentence id="9718">There's not a very strong base down below. </sentence><sentence id="9719">Someone did a series in West Virginia, I think it may have even been in The New York Times, an article on old congregations. </sentence><sentence id="9720">And someone did a project in Kentucky, didn't they? </sentence><sentence id="9721">On Jewish synagogues in Kentucky, a few years ago? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="9738">Q: Yeah. </sentence><sentence id="9739">Lee Shai Weissbach did a book on synagogues of Kentucky. </sentence><sentence id="9740">He's at the University of Louisville. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="9744">A: Well, the one in Ashland is, I don't know what they turned it into, a day care center. </sentence><sentence id="9745">We used to go there for the first few years we were here. </sentence><sentence id="9746">In fact I had a fraternity brother at Duke, whose father, who was Jewish, whose father was the mayor of Ashland back in the "50s, and he's now down in Florida. </sentence><sentence id="9747">And then they gave that up. </sentence><sentence id="9748">And I think people either went to Portsmouth, about thirty or forty miles north, or to Huntington. </sentence><sentence id="9749">That congregation folded. </sentence><sentence id="9750">And then we went to Lexington for high Holy days. </sentence><sentence id="9751">We never really, I was never, didn't know many people and we were up there for Seder a couple of nights, but you never felt much a part of it. </sentence><sentence id="9752">You know what I mean? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="9762">Q: Yeah. </sentence><sentence id="9763">So, Jean's taken, has Jean taken a strong interest in Judaism? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="9766">A: Oh yeah, I mean, I think, we often go Friday nights. </sentence><sentence id="9767">She goes with me. </sentence><sentence id="9768">She's always supported that. </sentence><sentence id="9769">Doesn't know any more, doesn't know a lot of Hebrew. </sentence><sentence id="9770">But we also now have Quakers, we have a Quaker group in Eastern Kentucky, which is a very small Quaker group, she may have mentioned to you. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="9776">Q: Yeah, and I think you actually talked about the Quaker group a little bit in the last... </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="9778">A: We go there on weekends. </sentence><sentence id="9779">I don't think tomorrow, I don't think it's this weekend. </sentence><sentence id="9780">I think it's next weekend, but three or four couples. </sentence><sentence id="9781">They're awfully nice. </sentence><sentence id="9782">But she, someone was saying the other day... If you ask Michael, I guess maybe both kids sort of consider themselves Jewish. </sentence><sentence id="9783">Not that they observe or are really close to the synagogues. </sentence><sentence id="9784">When Jean told me that about Ann Louise, I was a little surprised, but I think that's what she says. </sentence><sentence id="9785">Whether that will always be that way, I think they do associate more with us, rather than the Jewish community at large. </sentence><sentence id="9786">All right. </sentence></p></dialogue>
