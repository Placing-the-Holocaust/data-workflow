to Russia and Russia didn't play much. </sentence><sentence id="1364">They trained them and they they...Russian always was like England, fighting to the last Eng...to the last Indian soldier. </sentence><sentence id="1365">The Russians did the same thing. </sentence><sentence id="1366">They sent them out because it was a very dangerous mission, to send out the Spanish Communists. </sentence><sentence id="1367">Again, they didn't want them in Russia because they had enough Communists there. </sentence><sentence id="1368">OK. </sentence><sentence id="1369">As you can see, I'm not such a great lover although they saved my life, you know, but that's the truth. </sentence><sentence id="1370">That was Spanish...very fine, very fine people, very...very...they were not the average Russian partisan, the average soldier. </sentence><sentence id="1371">Each one was with a personality. </sentence><sentence id="1372">We met some Ukrainian...some partisans and they told us sorry, we don't take. </sentence><sentence id="1373">What did you do? </sentence><sentence id="1374">See, without without ammunition. </sentence><sentence id="1375">We said how we get ammunition. </sentence><sentence id="1376">Go take a stick and kill a German, take his gun or his rifle and come to us. </sentence><sentence id="1377">Then you'll fight. </sentence><sentence id="1378">It's easier said than to do because the Germans were twelve feet tall in our eyes. </sentence><sentence id="1379">We were young and anyway the Germans were the the the rulers there. </sentence><sentence id="1380">How can you go and kill? </sentence><sentence id="1381">II stayed away as far as I can from a German and they told us to take a stick and killa German. </sentence><sentence id="1382">Again, the same story. </sentence><sentence id="1383">Everybody was . </sentence><sentence id="1384">So we decided, four of us, four or five young boys...there's only way    how to get to the partisans, cause we knew we can't survive. </sentence><sentence id="1385">We didn't know when it's going to end and the woods was cold. </sentence><sentence id="1386">It was forty below zero with no clothing, no food, no nothing. </sentence><sentence id="1387">The older people stayed there. </sentence><sentence id="1388">We're going to see how the the horses with the with the sleds, and we're going to follow and it happened that we saw a partisan with a sled and he happened to be Jewish. </sentence><sentence id="1389">We went over to him. </sentence><sentence id="1390">We told him who we are. </sentence><sentence id="1391">He said I can't take you, but follow...don't say a word but follow my road and you'll get there. </sentence><sentence id="1392">That's all he said. </sentence><sentence id="1393">He went away. </sentence><sentence id="1394">We waited for an hour. </sentence><sentence id="1395">It wasn't snowing, and we followed. </sentence><sentence id="1396">We followed maybe five, six miles, and once we we were going, they came out and said hand, you know, raise your hands. </sentence><sentence id="1397">And they took all five five of us separate places. </sentence><sentence id="1398">How did you get here?So I said we saw...we were looking for the partisans. </sentence><sentence id="1399">We want to fight. </sentence><sentence id="1400">We are against the Germans and we saw a road. </sentence><sentence id="1401">We want to fight. </sentence><sentence id="1402">Where are your guns? </sentence><sentence id="1403">We don't have any guns. </sentence><sentence id="1404">We're going to send you back and we made up, if they told us they send back, what we have to say. </sentence><sentence id="1405">We have to say two things we agreed. </sentence><sentence id="1406">We want to be killed by a Russian bullet, not by German. </sentence><sentence id="1407">That was appeal (ph) to the Russians, and if they...if we'll see they don't want to take us, they should be aware that if the Germans catch us, we don't...we're not responsible what we're going to say. </sentence><sentence id="1408">We had to use threat. </sentence><sentence id="1409">To use
