Mrs. Schiff, would you please tell me your name at birth, and when and where you were born? </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="7">A: My name is Gabriele D.

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="11">Q: Could you tell me briefly about your family, and about your home life in Hamburg? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="13">A: I was born to a physician and his wife. </sentence><sentence id="14">We had a very assimilated home life. </sentence><sentence id="15">I was the youngest of four children. </sentence><sentence id="16">I went to high school, as far as I could get in Germany. </sentence><sentence id="17">It was all under the Whymar Republic, which of course, 1933, was taken over by Hitler, and my schooling, at least my formal schooling, came to an end. </sentence><sentence id="18">And at that time, one had to think slowly, about preparation for leaving Germany. </sentence><sentence id="19">I was about 16 at the time, and it was a very difficult Germany, and the most uneasy time for Jews, but an e -- uneasy time for Germany, all around. </sentence><sentence id="20">Vesters, strikes, and on the whole, you are looking how to create a future. </sentence><sentence id="21">My first job, as I always wanted to be a social worker, from my seventh year on, I became a secretary in a Jewish girl's orphanage. </sentence><sentence id="22">And at that time, it became clear that the girls who had no German passports, mostly of them Polish orphans, would be sent back to Poland. </sentence><sentence id="23">It was partly my job to help prepare the children for a life that we really couldn't foresee, but it certainly meant separation, separation from the place they knew, as well as if they had relatives, separation from relatives, into the unknown. </sentence><sentence id="24">I have done that about a year, and then decided to better learn England, prepare -- English -- to prepare for eventual immigration. </sentence><sentence id="25">I went to England, and tried to learn shorthand and typing. </sentence><sentence id="26">I never did very well. </sentence><sentence id="27">I worked in household, but then a letter came from a colleague in Hamburg, telling me that there were still so many children that could possibly go out -- correction, not so many, but some. </sentence><sentence id="28">And I decided, against anybody's advice, to go back to Germany. </sentence><sentence id="29">And I stayed in Germany for about a year, and again, helped children, also worked for the German Jewish community. </sentence><sentence id="30">It's interesting that even though we had very assimilated, from the very beginning, my 50 year career in social work, was almost all in Jewish social work. </sentence><sentence id="31">I prepared for my immigration, which was very difficult for many reasons, which perhaps we don't have to go into. </sentence><sentence id="32">The secret police at one time got hold of me, which was not a pleasant experience. </sentence><sentence id="33">They took my passport away, and eventually I got out of Germany, because one of my English friends, a former boyfriend, wrote me a fake letter that he was going to marry me, and I would become an English citizen, and set a date for our marriage. </sentence><sentence id="34">And at that point, I got my passport back, and left in a hurry. </sentence><sentence id="35">Again, I stayed in England for a very short time. </sentence><sentence id="36">I didn't work. </sentence><sentence id="37">By that time my mother and my oldest brother had immigrated to England, and so it was a bit of a family reunion. </sentence><sentence id="38">It's all not [indecipherable] clear in my memory, but somewhat like it. </sentence><sentence id="39">And my brother from America, where I als -- also had a brother, came. </sentence><sentence id="40">He was a lawyer here, working for the office of Price Administration, he must have been the levelator. </sentence><sentence id="41">Anyhow, he picked me up, and we came together to America. </sentence><sentence id="42">And it was a little funny story when I arrived here. </sentence><sentence id="43">People who thought I'd gone into the wilderness in America, my aunts, etcetera, had given me, of all things, tea kettles. </sentence><sentence id="44">So when I arrived here, and the customs opened my stuff, I was surrounded by the tea kettles, and the customs official looked at me and said, "Golly, what do you want to do? </sentence><sentence id="45">Trade with the Indians?" </sentence><sentence id="46">That's the beginning of America. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="82">Q: When did you arrive to the U.S.? </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="86">Q: So, just briefly maybe, we" ll turn back to your years in Hamburg, and could you tell me a little bit more? </sentence><sentence id="87">Was your family observant of religious holidays? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="90">A: No, we were very assimilated. </sentence><sentence id="91">Yes, proforma -- it's a harsh word, but we did observe Rosh Hashanah and Yom Kippur. </sentence><sentence id="92">Actually, I still do it, even though my life had gone up and down in between. </sentence><sentence id="93">And we were an upper class, very well known family. </sentence><sentence id="94">And what you did was always being looked at by others. </sentence><sentence id="95">But, I should mention my mother -- and I've inherited that from her, liked to help people, and she always volunteered. </sentence><sentence id="96">And she had what she called office hours in our house, and she would counsel people. </sentence><sentence id="97">And as a child of seven, I was sitting under the table, listening to these stories, and that's why I decided I wanted to help. </sentence><sentence id="98">And another -- and that's the last story of my past, we had a big house, and I had a governess, as ever -- anybody had to, had a little money in Germany. </sentence><sentence id="99">And I was always afraid when the governess had the day out, and I was alone in the big house. </sentence><sentence id="100">So my father, to comfort me one day, bought me a big, chocolate teddy bear, and said that, "He'll keep you company." </sentence><sentence id="101">I didn't want chocolate bear, I wanted somebody to talk to. </sentence><sentence id="102">So I cried. </sentence><sentence id="103">So my father, who was a little impatient, said, "Well, you are but spoiled. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="104">There are many poor children who have no teddy bears." </sentence><sentence id="105">I said nothing, and I thought. </sentence><sentence id="106">Day before, we had taken a walk, and my governess had said, "Let's walk slowly here," no, correction again, "let's walk fast, because this is where the poor children live." </sentence><sentence id="107">So, I thought, teddy bear, poor children. </sentence><sentence id="108">So during afternoon, I ran around, back to that neighborhood with my chocolate bear, and when I saw a little girl that looked poor to me, pressed the chocolate teddy bear into her arms. </sentence><sentence id="109">Once later, my mother was playing bridge, and one of her partners said, "Our neighborhood is changing, because an absolutely strange girl walked up to my little daughter, </sentence></p><p><sentence id="110"> and gave her a teddy bear." </sentence><sentence id="111">And I always say, "I have spent my life giving teddy bears to the wrong people." </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="112">Q: You said that your family was a total of seven children? </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="113">A: Four. </sentence><sentence id="114">Four children. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="127">Q: And briefly, would you tell me what happened to your family members, your immediate family members through the war years? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="129">A: Yeah, we were very lucky, we all got out of Germany, but not together. </sentence><sentence id="130">We have never been together again as a family. </sentence><sentence id="131">My mother left a little later than I did, to England, which she lived -- let's see, she left after Crystal night, and only got out because my Dutch brother-in-law came from Paris to take her out with the help of the Dutch consulate. </sentence><sentence id="132">He came, and he was politically quite on the left, and had brought quite a few fake Dutch passports, and got out two or three well known writers, who were in concentration camp. </sentence><sentence id="133">One of them, Eric Musam, some people may be interested him, he was later killed, but he got him out. </sentence><sentence id="134">So [indecipherable]. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="141">Q: And did you have any encounters with anti-Semitism when you were growing up in Germany? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="143">A: Who hasn't? </sentence><sentence id="144">Yes, and I only gi -- I had all -- I -- I had, as everybody else did, I remember well my first encounter, when I was, well, maybe 12. </sentence><sentence id="145">I had a girlfriend, very blonde, and very Aryan, and her father was an architect, and we were quote, best friends, end quote. </sentence><sentence id="146">And from one day to another, she said, with tears in her eyes, "My father forbade me to play with you any    </sentence></p><p><sentence id="147"> longer, because you are Jewish, and he belongs to a certain German organization, and would be a danger for him if his daughter is running around with a Jewish girl." </sentence><sentence id="148">That was my very first -- and, I had to give you all these things you get from everybody, because of course, you met it everywhere, from your greengrocer -- and you met the other, too, people who stood up for you, and perhaps a most outstanding one was we had a super in our house, and he denounced my mother to the Secret Police, and denounced me, too, because I had a non-Jewish boyfriend, which was against the Nuremberg laws. </sentence><sentence id="149">So, I mean, we had our share of this, but compared what later on happened in eastern Europe, it's all chicken feed. </sentence><sentence id="150">No [indecipherable] </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="151">Q: Okay. </sentence><sentence id="152">I think we can perhaps move on then, to your early years in America, and what you did when you first arrived. </sentence><sentence id="153">Any striking first impressions that you had, and that you'd like to recount? </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="154">A: Cause New York is overwhelming if you come from Germany, and my family -- I had an aunt here, who was very well-to-do, and was very nice to me, but I didn't fit into that type of society at all. </sentence><sentence id="155">I looked European, English was bad, politically I was too much interested in Social Democrats. </sentence><sentence id="156">They were very nice to me, but I didn't want to play the role of a poor relative, that's just not in me. </sentence><sentence id="157">And I had a Quaker friend in Philadelphia, who was a teacher of music. </sentence><sentence id="158">And we had been through a lot in Hamburg together, we had gone to school together. </sentence><sentence id="159">So I phoned her, and said, "Etta, please get me a job, any job." </sentence><sentence id="160">And she came through. </sentence><sentence id="161">And I lived in the house of a lovely Quaker family, where my friend Etta also had a room. </sentence><sentence id="162">And I did a little a-around the house. </sentence><sentence id="163">I'm really not very well trained in that respect, but they were very good pe -- were actually lovely people. </sentence><sentence id="164">I took a little bit care of children. </sentence><sentence id="165">And money I didn't have. </sentence><sentence id="166">Furs I had, but no money. </sentence><sentence id="167">And the man of the house, who was a lawyer, professor of law, discovered that I have a usable brain. </sentence><sentence id="168">And he thought to get anywhere in this country, I would have to study, and get at least a Bachelor. </sentence><sentence id="169">And he gave me a chance just try for a scholarship in a very good American college in Swarthmore, which has helped me for the rest of my life. </sentence><sentence id="170">And they again were very nice, because they believed me. </sentence><sentence id="171">I had my examination for the university in Germany, which I didn't have, but I said I had lost it. </sentence><sentence id="172">And I could make up for it in an examination, I passed with very good grades, and so I got through Swarthmore in two years. </sentence><sentence id="173">That, of course, was a big help, because then, during those two years, I used my furniture, rented an apartment with borrowed money, and sublet rooms to other students. </sentence><sentence id="174">And that way, I got through college. </sentence><sentence id="175">I just missed feeb -- Phi Beta Kappa, which I'm really angry about, because I had the cooking to do for -- and I had it easy because I majored in English, which was not in English literature, but I minored in German, so it meant I could concentrate on my major. </sentence><sentence id="176">And later on, I took psychology. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="201">Q: So when you were in school, you were also focused to some extent on social work again? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="203">A: Never left my mind. </sentence><sentence id="204">I did not tell you that before I even mentioned Swarthmore, I had gone to the Pennsylvania School of Social Work, who had told me I could not study social work if I wouldn't have an America Bachelor. </sentence><sentence id="205">It was very different times, and that was one reason why I was so glad to go to Swarthmore. </sentence><sentence id="206">And the day I had my Bachelor, I went back to the University of Pennsylvania, I say, "Here I am, please let me in." </sentence><sentence id="207">They were very psychologically oriented at that time, and they seriously said to me, "Well, you know, you will have to work with people who know pain, and suffering. </sentence><sentence id="208">And to know that, you have to know it yourself. </sentence><sentence id="209">Did you ever have any suffering and pain?" </sentence><sentence id="210">And I said, "Yeah, I just left my family in Europe, I make a very precarious living here. </sentence><sentence id="211">I've met many good things, but I've also met [indecipherable] </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="212">Q: Did you have much fear in you when you arrived in the United States? </sentence><sentence id="213">Do you recall having that kind of emotion? </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="214">A: I recall having a lot of anxiety. </sentence><sentence id="215">Not so much fear, which is very much related. </sentence><sentence id="216">I didn't think I would not get through, that never occurred to me. </sentence><sentence id="217">But I didn't know how. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="222">Q: And what did you continue to hear about developments in Germany and Europe during this part of your schooling, and your early years in the U.S.? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="224">A: To be honest, I was so concentrating on daily life, that it was not very real to me. </sentence><sentence id="225">I knew what was going on in Germany. </sentence><sentence id="226">I was dead sure, if I'd ever become a citizen, I would go and try to help rebuild. </sentence><sentence id="227">I felt guilty. </sentence><sentence id="228">I was safe, and my friends were not. </sentence><sentence id="229">I was in close contact with the Quakers, who were the only organization, I believe, who could, at that time, get into Germany, even could -- and get into the camps. </sentence><sentence id="230">And they, at that time, were starting their so-called refugee section, and they ask me to work in it, and to set it up. </sentence><sentence id="231">And so I knew particularly about Germany, that people had lost their jobs, difficulties in getting out, were taken to camps, but if I'm very honest, for instance, Crystal night is not in my memory as the overwhelming experience it was, becu -- I think like, human beings, and young ones, you think about studying, about your boyfriends, about whatever the day brings. </sentence><sentence id="232">Yes, it's all going on in Germany, and you also -- at least I was, a little bit cruel, and you thought, "Why didn't these people get out?" </sentence><sentence id="233">Later on, I [indecipherable] they couldn't, but I was somewhat mixed up in my thinking. </sentence><sentence id="234">It came back more and more when I -- at the refugee section, as my daily bread, and had to write and answer letters from Germany, people pleading for so-called affidavits. </sentence><sentence id="235">And while I was working with Quakers, I was sent to get affidavits, and I was, of all things, going to lowa. </sentence><sentence id="236">Now, imagine this German Jewish girl, with fairly good English, but still not -- still the the English English. </sentence><sentence id="237">I was sent to farmers, who in their turn had rarely heard of Jews. </sentence><sentence id="238">So we had a great time not -- of learning each other. </sentence><sentence id="239">They showed me their farm, and they showed me everything they a -- and they talk with thee and thou, as the Quakers does. </sentence><sentence id="240">And whatever they showed me, I'd never seen before. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="241"> And the very nice old farmer got a little impatient, and showed me a cow, and said, "Did thee ever see a cow?" </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="242">Q: So when were you in Iowa, and what exactly were you trying to accomplish while you were there? </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="243">A: The latter I can answer first one. </sentence><sentence id="244">Probably in deg38 - "39. </sentence><sentence id="245">It's vague, but I think so, because deg39, I went to college, so it must have been before 39. </sentence><sentence id="246">What was your question? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="251">Q: And what were you trying to accomplish while you were there? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="253">A: I was charged to get affidavits of support for refugees who were still in Europe, and wanted to come to this country. </sentence><sentence id="254">And somebody had to guarantee that they would not become a charge of welfare. </sentence><sentence id="255">And I got quite a few affidavits, because I could plead my cause. </sentence><sentence id="256">I had seen it. </sentence><sentence id="257">And I did that, really until I went to college, working for the Quakers, being a counselor in a refugee camp. </sentence><sentence id="258">Now, this was a Quaker camp for refugees who had already arrived in this country. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="265">Q: And where was this refugee camp? </sentence></p></dialogue>

</sentence><sentence id="311">No, doesn't happen in college, comes a little later. </sentence><sentence id="312">So I graduated, made many friends. </sentence><sentence id="313">Was interesting to me, that there, we really didn't know who was Jewish, and who was not. </sentence><sentence id="314">You know, that was such a difference. </sentence><sentence id="315">I was a rarity at that time, because refugees weren't so many at that time. </sentence><sentence id="316">And I know, I get along with people, and I had a great time, and eventually I graduated, in deg41. </sentence><sentence id="317">And there was no question I'd go to school of social work, I got another scholarship, which meant another job on the side, but these things are typical for an immigre. </sentence><sentence id="318">And I kept my apartment with my furniture, I rented a room -- separate rooms. </sentence><sentence id="319">And began to be more involved with refugee questions. </sentence><sentence id="320">I had a room mate who was very much on the left political, and didn't let me forget that it was Fascists who did all this. </sentence><sentence id="321">And we were very young. </sentence><sentence id="322">And I always get involved in strange things, so I was -- well -- political involvements, so stay out of it. </sentence><sentence id="323">And I found life very interesting, got much more Americanized. </sentence><sentence id="324">Had a very easy time in school of social work. </sentence><sentence id="325">My placement was with the children's agency, and it all seemed to me very easy. </sentence><sentence id="326">I don't know why they made so much fuss about it. </sentence><sentence id="327">The only bad thing was, I had in the morning, and in the evening, to travel for over an hour, through all of Philadelphia. </sentence><sentence id="328">So much for that. </sentence><sentence id="329">I still was in touch with the Quakers, I still have them out with the refugee faction. </sentence><sentence id="330">And I always have had a great respect and love for the Quakers, but never wanted to convert, because I always thought, you don't run away from something that's difficult into something that's easier. </sentence><sentence id="331">So the Quakers were asked by the War Education Authority -- this is now "41. </sentence><sentence id="332">Don't hold me to the dates. </sentence><sentence id="333">Not deg41, [had a -- nonsense. </sentence><sentence id="334">43, I graduated from school of social work. </sentence><sentence id="335">There is something I don't remember, and that's what -- I think right after school, I went to Maryland, to the state hospital, because I was more and more interested in psychiatric social work. </sentence><sentence id="336">And I spent one difficult year in a state hospital near Sikesville, Maryland. </sentence><sentence id="337">And that was a -- hospital of about 3,000 patients, and five physicians. </sentence><sentence id="338">And there I became very much aware of Europe and it's difficulties, because the majority of our five physicians had come from Europe, and had escaped Hitler. </sentence><sentence id="339">And there were also one Jewish physician who was American. </sentence><sentence id="340">And I told you, I get involved, sometimes I also in the wrong place. </sentence><sentence id="341">I became, in my free time, the director of the recreation for our camp of -- of conscientious objectors. </sentence><sentence id="342">I could wro -- write a book about it if | want. </sentence><sentence id="343">And that was not liked by the American attendants, because they had their husbands in the war, here was this one Jewish female, and she was playing around with the people who were trying to escape war duty, and messed up situation, I was in between vics. </sentence><sentence id="344">And the Jewish doctor, saw me going with my CO friends, a whole unit of them, singing Christmas carols. </sentence><sentence id="345">He called me to his office, and sa -- and said, "If I wouldn't be punished, I would spank you. </sentence><sentence id="346">You are no [indecipherable]. </sentence><sentence id="347">You tried to be a Christian," -- which I never tried, I just like to go around with some [indecipherable].And he gave me hell. </sentence><sentence id="348">So I got it from Jewish side. </sentence><sentence id="349">End of Tape One, Side A Beginning Tape One, Side B </sentence></p></dialogue>

id="410">I didn't go too often, but he came to me. </sentence><sentence id="411">I -- these are individual things. </sentence><sentence id="412">My outstanding best friends at that time, were the director of the labor relations board in Philadelphia, and his wife. </sentence><sentence id="413">And they were ardent pacifists. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="414">And on the day the we -- war broke out, they asked me, "How do you feel about it?" </sentence><sentence id="415">And impulsively, I said, "I'm glad that," -- now this is when America got into the war, -- "that America is getting into the war, because that will give the allies more power." </sentence><sentence id="416">And they looked </sentence></p><p><sentence id="417"> at me in disgust, and said, "How can you be glad about any war?" </sentence><sentence id="418">And I said, "Is it better when people are slaughtered in camps? </sentence><sentence id="419">Do you want that to go on for eternity?" </sentence><sentence id="420">So we had a very long discussion. </sentence><sentence id="421">We stayed friends afterwards, and we both kept our opinions. </sentence><sentence id="422">They were pacifists. </sentence><sentence id="423">I had been a pacifist for a good time of my life. </sentence><sentence id="424">As a matter of fact, when in Germany, I was the youngest member of the [indecipherable] for Human Rights. </sentence><sentence id="425">So, that will always be my interest. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="426">But, I changed when Hitler came, and I gave up the pacifist, I just couldn't. </sentence><sentence id="427">But that's my outstanding memory. </sentence><sentence id="428">And then, of course, it was the anxiety, I couldn't get letters from Europe. </sentence><sentence id="429">I had heard so much about the first World War, because I was born in the beginning. </sentence><sentence id="430">But when I was five and six, the memory was still very strong, my parents, and [indecipherable]. </sentence><sentence id="431">So, I knew what was going to happen, and I also had a ration book during the war, but I suppose everybody had it. </sentence><sentence id="432">I don't know, I was in an institution, in that camp -- no, in the state hospital, and we got very little to eat, but I realized it was still much more than they had in Europe. </sentence><sentence id="433">And then, of course, I had very strong sympathies for the allies, and once in awhile, I got letters smuggled from England, or from my sister in France. </sentence><sentence id="434">I suffer always for some contact, somebody asked me this question. </sentence><sentence id="435">I don't remember if the letters were censored or not. </sentence><sentence id="436">I don't think I ever was out of contact with my mother. </sentence><sentence id="437">I looked -- I kept my mother's address, but not the war time, one, so I -- I really don't know. </sentence><sentence id="438">I remember how I threw my camera into a river, because I wasn't permitted to have it. </sentence><sentence id="439">Why I didn't give it to an American colleague, I don't know. </sentence><sentence id="440">And I -- I did not have too many Jewish friends while I was in Philadelphia. </sentence><sentence id="441">I had roo -- Jewish room mates, but one was American, and as I implied, very much on the left. </sentence><sentence id="442">The other was also from Germany, and very assimilated. </sentence><sentence id="443">And so certainly we were interested, we read the papers, and we hoped that war would be over. </sentence><sentence id="444">But we also tried very hard to live from day to day. </sentence><sentence id="445">Now, this changed for me in 1943 or four. </sentence><sentence id="446">I'm really not good with figures. </sentence><sentence id="447">When the War Education asked me -- War </sentence></p><p><sentence id="448"> Education Authority, to go to Oswego, New York. </sentence><sentence id="449">And Oswego was a camp, it was a former army camp that had barracks, and awful ones. </sentence><sentence id="450">And there's barbed wire around. </sentence><sentence id="451">It always amazes me, the only time I personally have been in the camp, with barbed wire, and real barracks, was in America. </sentence><sentence id="452">Because I was always insisted on living right in the camps, because you can't be of help if you are billeted in a hotel outside. </sentence><sentence id="453">And these were a thousand refugees, who had been in - - yeah, it was called concentration camps, but were not extermination camps, in Italy. </sentence><sentence id="454">One was called Perramonte, just for your information. </sentence><sentence id="455">And the refugees, the majority, by far, were Jewish. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="456">I think we had about five non-Jewish people, but we had some. </sentence><sentence id="457">We had some Ukrainians. </sentence><sentence id="458">And Dr. Ruth Gruber, who was the assistant to all [indecipherable] acres, who was an -- high in the government, had been sent to Europe to select from different camps, a thousand refugees. </sentence><sentence id="459">These had been invited by President Roosevelt, with the idea that Italy was starving, and he would at -- at least take a thousand mouths out. </sentence><sentence id="460">Well, it's really not a very bright idea, but it helped a thousand people. </sentence><sentence id="461">And they were invited to -- the whole time, they didn't know if they could stay in this country. </sentence><sentence id="462">And what that means psychologically, you can't do it -- can't imagine. </sentence><sentence id="463">Actually, one was sent back because he was insane. </sentence><sentence id="464">The others eventually stayed here, in "45. </sentence><sentence id="465">And I've met them over the -- my career in social work, all over the place. </sentence><sentence id="466">And that was my first camp ex -- no -- well, the other was a vacation camp, this was a camp with all the difficulties of a camp. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="467">People not having any privacy. </sentence><sentence id="468">Some people died. </sentence><sentence id="469">One person died shoveling snow. </sentence><sentence id="470">The administration was blamed for that. </sentence><sentence id="471">I got an [indecipherable] to later camp life. </sentence><sentence id="472">The food was always [indecipherable], it's always in camps. </sentence><sentence id="473">People have to have an outlet for all their feelings, so they fight for food. </sentence><sentence id="474">We had a few birth. </sentence><sentence id="475">We had a hospital run by a Jewish laf -- doctor, who was supervised by Dr. Ruth, who had already an MD in America. </sentence><sentence id="476">In the hospital, I had an operation, and I remember my refugee doctor very well. </sentence><sentence id="477">However, it went all right. </sentence><sentence id="478">It was an ope </sentence></p><p><sentence id="479"> -- operation, an appendix, and they found an ovary was -- they took out an ovary that shouldn't have taken out [indecipherable] forget. </sentence><sentence id="480">And I stayed in that camp, almost through the end. </sentence><sentence id="481">I think I left a month before. </sentence><sentence id="482">People eventually got the permission to stay. </sentence><sentence id="483">Most of them came to New York. </sentence><sentence id="484">Ruth Gruber co-wrote a book about Oswego, "Safe Haven." </sentence><sentence id="485">I disagree with the book, but anyhow -- </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="486">Q: Can you explain why? </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="487">A: I -- Because she saw a side from the point of view of a rather optimistic American. </sentence><sentence id="488">She worked very hard, I mean, she really -- she helped. </sentence><sentence id="489">These people wouldn't have been here without her, but how she described the camp, I don't quite agree with. </sentence><sentence id="490">I saw more conflict than she did. </sentence><sentence id="491">But ac -- but we are still good friends, I still see her, and Oswego people have also [indecipherable] word? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="497">Q: Community? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="499">A: Community. </sentence><sentence id="500">They meet once in awhile, cause we all are old people now. </sentence><sentence id="501">And some of them died, some of them have grandchildren. </sentence><sentence id="502">The grandchildren I met in my last job, and some of them, because in that job, among other things, I ran a scholarship committee for refugee, and second and third generation. </sentence><sentence id="503">And suddenly, some of my Oswego grandchildren turned up.[indecipherable], they are very bright, and good students. </sentence><sentence id="504">Europeans know how to study. </sentence><sentence id="505">So, you see, that's why I say my life is so interwoven, one with each other, Quakers from all occasional [indecipherable] etcetera. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="514">Q: Can we go back momentarily to your very first experiences, helping refugees, and that's when you were working with the Quakers. </sentence><sentence id="515">And could you give a little more detail as to how you started to get involved in that kind of work? </sentence><sentence id="516">Was it through the friend in Philadelphia, or someone else? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="520">A: I tell you, my girlfriend, whom I knew from school, was a Quaker, and was a daughter of the deeding Quaker in Germany. </sentence><sentence id="521">Somebody writes a book about it, and interviewed me. </sentence><sentence id="522">So, through her, it was natural that I met other Quakers. </sentence><sentence id="523">And I met a professor of social work, Hetta Calls, from Czechoslovakia. </sentence><sentence id="524">She was a professor of social work in Bryn Mawr, and for quite some time I stayed in her house, and she was a president at that time, or the founder of this refugee section, and she knew that I knew typing, a little shorthand. </sentence><sentence id="525">And she introduced me as her secretary to the American Friend Service Committee in Philadelphia. </sentence><sentence id="526">And I was very lucky, I got to know Rufus Jones, and Kelly, and learned to loved, and admired a lot. </sentence><sentence id="527">And met my first -- I was a refugee of -- myself at that time, really in the camp. </sentence><sentence id="528">What I had to do as a secretary was really mostly writing letters, trying to search for people, trying to get affidavits, trying to talk to lawyers. </sentence><sentence id="529">A little bit helping people to adjust. </sentence><sentence id="530">Helping them to get lessons for car driving. </sentence><sentence id="531">Women didn't really know how to drive. </sentence><sentence id="532">I don't know how to -- not today. </sentence><sentence id="533">And it was not that common in Germany, or Austria. </sentence><sentence id="534">The refugees at that time are mostly from Germany -- not in the camp Oswego, but what I imagine Philadelphia was pretty much German Jewish [indecipherable]. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="550">Q: Where was the camp that was run by the Quakers, the two summers? </sentence><sentence id="551">Where exactly was that located? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="554">A: In Nyak, N-y-a-k, New York. </sentence><sentence id="555">It's how -- it's about an hour from here, upstate, in Westchester. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="558">Q: Okay. </sentence><sentence id="559">So, after that experience, the experience with the camps, the two summers in a row, then eventually, you were able to work in Oswego with refugees, and that work there, what was your daily responsibilities? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="562">A: Taking histories, in case people could stay in this country. </sentence><sentence id="563">Taking histories for the sponsoring agency. </sentence><sentence id="564">Helping people to adjust to camp life. </sentence><sentence id="565">No European knows camp. </sentence><sentence id="566">And that men should do the cooking, don't tell me. </sentence><sentence id="567">And to see that the hospital functioned. </sentence><sentence id="568">We were just -- every religion had a -- a -- [indecipherable] what's the word? </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="721">A: I did not know that there were camps in Italy. </sentence><sentence id="722">I did not know the war conditions. </sentence><sentence id="723">Yugoslavia had an awful secret pol -- police, Usetasha. </sentence><sentence id="724">I had not known of that existence, and the madness, and the badness of the war was really beginning to come home to me, when I heard these people who had escaped by night over the mountains. </sentence><sentence id="725">Who had sent children to other countries. </sentence><sentence id="726">The living with danger, the constant being afraid some knock at the door will be the secret police, and you'll be taken away. </sentence><sentence id="727">It became all a reality. </sentence><sentence id="728">And, of course, I was there when Roosevelt died, and that had a terrific effect on the camp population. </sentence><sentence id="729">They were really depressed. </sentence><sentence id="730">It's something that is now a -- people don't want to acknowledge, American Jewish people, that Roosevelt made many mistakes. </sentence><sentence id="731">But he also was a big hope for people. </sentence><sentence id="732">And, of course the ones who came to America loved him for that in -- invitation, and they were devastated when he died. </sentence><sentence id="733">They couldn't know that Truman did much more perhaps, in the end, but it was really a -- a major depression. </sentence><sentence id="734">I always felt that all the deaths they had seen in Europe were suddenly coming to life again by the death of Roosevelt, who had sort of been a power figure to them. </sentence><sentence id="735">So all that made the whole time much more real to me. </sentence><sentence id="736">I -- also, I didn't have as much of a private life. </sentence><sentence id="737">In Philadelphia things were going on, but here you read the papers much more, and people had a country, but they had lost their parents. </sentence><sentence id="738">You saw, actually the people.

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="855">A: You know, it's all 60 years ago. </sentence><sentence id="856">I had to bring a witness. </sentence><sentence id="857">I was the only one to be naturalized, and funny enough, in the small town of Westminster, Maryland, they hadn't naturalized anybody, as far as I know. </sentence><sentence id="858">Anyhow, I hold number one certificate. </sentence><sentence id="859">And of course, I was afraid, I should know some American history, and I know I got questions, what makes a suggestion a bill, when it had to become a bill, and so on. </sentence><sentence id="860">End of Tape One, Side B    Beginning Tape Two, Side A </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="869">Q: This is a United States Holocaust Memorial Museum interview with Gabriele D. Schiff, conducted by Amy Rubin, on July 27, 2000, in Forest Hills, New York. </sentence><sentence id="870">This is tape number two, side A. On the last tape, we were speaking about your time in Oswego, and -- where you were working with refugees, and now perhaps you can tell me what you did after you finished your time in Oswego. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="873">A: When I came back from Oswego, I had moved from Philadelphia to New York, and I was waiting for papers to clear, to go eventually to Europe. </sentence><sentence id="874">I went back to a job I had had before, and that's the juvenile court. </sentence><sentence id="875">I was always interested in working with delinquent youngsters -- so- called delinquent. </sentence><sentence id="876">And I worked for what's called Youth House for boys, and later for Youth House for girls. </sentence><sentence id="877">Again, as a psychiatric social worker, taking histories this time for the judge to have -- make decisions what to do with a youngster, send him home, go to placement, or whatever was indicated. </sentence><sentence id="878">I had done that early in the game, I forgot which year. </sentence><sentence id="879">I did it again when I came back from Oswego, and that was by the middle of "45. </sentence><sentence id="880">And I did it until the end of 46, when I went, with the Joint Distribution Committee, to Europe. </sentence><sentence id="881">I had been in touch with the Joint a long time before. </sentence><sentence id="882">Actually, I'd known about it all my life, cause my family was very instrumental in it's creation. </sentence><sentence id="883">And the Joint was one of the agencies working in Europe after the war. </sentence><sentence id="884">The other was UNRRA. </sentence><sentence id="885">Those were the two main agencies. </sentence><sentence id="886">Of course, every religion had it's representation. </sentence><sentence id="887">The Joint, and the U.S. Army, and the UNRRA was p-part of it, were really the most constructive factors in rebuilding. </sentence><sentence id="888">I am very aware that they are under a lot of criticism, but having been on the spot, I can say that they performed a miracle. </sentence><sentence id="889">Europe at that time was chaos, people not knowing where they came from, not knowing where they were going, practically not knowing who they are. </sentence><sentence id="890">The Joint and UNRRA [indecipherable] really established camps, with the help of the army, for various groups, eventually for all people. </sentence><sentence id="891">There have been so many camps, and they were different in the different zones. </sentence><sentence id="892">You had the British zone, and you had the American zone. </sentence><sentence id="893">I can't remember if they had a Russian zone, but they had three zones. </sentence><sentence id="894">And em -- each zone had it's country director, and then there was a director for all the work, in Paris. </sentence><sentence id="895">He was in charge of it all. </sentence><sentence id="896">I know that when I came over, I was first going to Paris, to be oriented toward what was expected to me -- of me, and to be assigned to a country. </sentence><sentence id="897">I did not know when I left here where I would go. </sentence><sentence id="898">I assumed it would be Germany or Austria because of the language. </sentence><sentence id="899">To my great surprise it was Italy. </sentence><sentence id="900">And my much bigger surprise came, I went to Rome, because the capital always was the center where the Joint worked out of, and I spent a few weeks in a sort of reception camp called Genechita, City of the Movies. </sentence><sentence id="901">It was the Hollywood of Italy. </sentence><sentence id="902">And that was a camp for every refugees that had been picked up. </sentence><sentence id="903">Every nation, and wi -- religion. </sentence><sentence id="904">Men, women, children. </sentence><sentence id="905">I don't know how many. </sentence><sentence id="906">To me it seemed thousands, it may not have been. </sentence><sentence id="907">And that camp, I remember as a nightmare. </sentence><sentence id="908">If you ask me who administered it, I do not know any more. </sentence><sentence id="909">I know it had no individual rooms. </sentence><sentence id="910">There were partitions between the families, sort of made of sheets -- bedsheets, where you could hear every noise from the neighboring bed, which means your private life was open to the children, open to each other. </sentence><sentence id="911">It may be part because it was my first real camp, but I was absolutely overwhelmed. </sentence><sentence id="912">The second day I was there, there was a rumor that a Chinese had killed his wife. </sentence><sentence id="913">If that was so or not, I have no idea, but everybody talked about it. </sentence><sentence id="914">That was, in my memory, the most primitive camp, but as I say, I had just arrived, I had no basis of comparison. </sentence><sentence id="915">In a way it was good, because every other camp seemed like -- not paradise, but at least not like hell. </sentence><sentence id="916">And I must say, I don't remember anything of the beauty of Rome, which I had not seen before. </sentence><sentence id="917">I only remember this miles of humanity, badly dressed, hungry, cold -- it was winter, I came so -- in February, I think. </sentence><sentence id="918">And -- and then I was told I was to go to Milano, because I had experience with hospital work, and [indecipherable] work. </sentence><sentence id="919">And I got on long train ride. </sentence><sentence id="920">It still was right after the war, and people always forget, your trains weren't running. </sentence><sentence id="921">Italy itself had no food. </sentence><sentence id="922">The people were under the impression still of the war. </sentence><sentence id="923">Yes, they had won the war, oh, Italy didn't here -- take it back, I'm not sure Italy won. </sentence><sentence id="924">But they were -- everything was gray and gray. </sentence><sentence id="925">And it took us very, very long to get from Rome to Milano, which usually takes a night. </sentence><sentence id="926">Sleeping [indecipherable] didn't work, it was -- Italy was just a country in which a war had raged. </sentence><sentence id="927">And one shouldn't forget, it wasn't only all Displaced Persons, it was all the Italians themselves. </sentence><sentence id="928">You were hungry, and tired, and had no work. </sentence><sentence id="929">When I arrived in Milano, this rehabilitation center, being a former hotel, looked like absolute luxury. </sentence><sentence id="930">I did not stay in the place. </sentence><sentence id="931">I think that had had reasons, because it was tuberculosis all over the place. </sentence><sentence id="932">We had, as far as I remember, no children. </sentence><sentence id="933">Some younger people. </sentence><sentence id="934">I remember a young woman, perhaps in her early 20's, from Yugoslavia, who had survived with her parents, and they had gone through hell, and she had ch -- tuberculosis, and died, very much at the beginning of -- and I never forget it, I can still paint her face. </sentence><sentence id="935">And that -- it's really difficult to talk about, because it's a double experience. </sentence><sentence id="936">Here you had survivors faced with death again. </sentence><sentence id="937">Now, what that meant to them, I can't imagine, I can only feel a little bit in my fingertips. </sentence><sentence id="938">And still you had the same political groups fighting each other, that was the Hungarians and the Poles. </sentence><sentence id="939">All Jewish people, but different ideas, different religious traditions. </sentence><sentence id="940">Being angry at the world. </sentence><sentence id="941">This is [indecipherable] people. </sentence><sentence id="942">I remember three of young men who were not even 20 -- I mention that because you, at that age, could survive, and then in the 30's and 40's. </sentence><sentence id="943">You hadn't many old people survive, and you hadn't many children survive. </sentence><sentence id="944">Not in these camps. </sentence><sentence id="945">We had a doctor from South Africa, who was the M.D. director of the camp, and we had Displaced Persons physicians. </sentence><sentence id="946">We had about three physicians. </sentence><sentence id="947">Now, either ask me how many patients, I really don't know, about a hundred, could be mistaken. </sentence><sentence id="948">Too long ago to ve -- to remember figures. </sentence><sentence id="949">And, what perhaps has to be mentioned is that was the time where streptomycin was a rarity. </sentence><sentence id="950">The doctors practically only had lermotorax to work with, which was a much more complicated procedure, nobody [indecipherable] it could be dangerous. </sentence><sentence id="951">Also, for the TB doctors, they had to stand very long. </sentence><sentence id="952">This is procedure, and I know once or twice somebody fainted. </sentence><sentence id="953">And streptomycin, we always had to get on the Black Market. </sentence><sentence id="954">Now, this was the center of the Black Market. </sentence><sentence id="955">You exchanged streptomycin for either coffee or cigarettes. </sentence><sentence id="956">And the accepted -- accepted currency were cigarettes. </sentence><sentence id="957">And -- and the other thing was, there was something -- the army run co -- called the PX, which was like a shopping center, with a very low prices. </sentence><sentence id="958">And we had, as American, or an English workers, we could buy there, and we could exchange. </sentence><sentence id="959">There are also two currencies. </sentence><sentence id="960">There was green dollar, and oh, what was the other called? </sentence><sentence id="961">A script. </sentence><sentence id="962">A script, as far as I remember, you couldn't take out of the country, I don't remember it. </sentence><sentence id="963">The green dollar was much better, and you could get anything for a green dollar, from two dollars to [indecipherable] dollars, there was no rule or regulation. </sentence><sentence id="964">And there was a fight to get food, because the Germans had no food themselves. </sentence><sentence id="965">And all these things are of course, forgotten. </sentence><sentence id="966">Now, one of these stories -- oh, I don't know how many, have been in articles I have written over the years. </sentence><sentence id="967">They are not very new. </sentence><sentence id="968">I've told them before. </sentence><sentence id="969">But one can't duplicate them, I can't invent new ones. </sentence><sentence id="970">And one which shows you the difficulty with food. </sentence><sentence id="971">Jewish holidays, of course, played a very, very big role. </sentence><sentence id="972">And these were the first holidays in freedom. </sentence><sentence id="973">So, my people in the -- I call it camp, it's really abcenter, wanted to be like home, and have geese and chickens for Rosh Hashanah. </sentence><sentence id="974">Now how to put loose geese and chickens, when all I had was the canned goods the Joint hand me? </sentence><sentence id="975">Now, many, many of my people weren't even used to that. </sentence><sentence id="976">So, the only thing to do was to ask if any of the DP's would be able to look after    live chicken and geese, and there was somebody. </sentence><sentence id="977">So then I went to the mayor of this little village, and asked if I could have some, I would bargain against canned peas, and stuff like that. </sentence><sentence id="978">Well, they let me have some. </sentence><sentence id="979">So, in our DP Center, we had guk, guk, guk, guk. </sentence><sentence id="980">And they were a big excitement, we had them for a few months. </sentence><sentence id="981">We had to feed them, they were like everybody else, starving. </sentence><sentence id="982">And the whole group, of course, was very much interested. </sentence><sentence id="983">And Rosh Hashanah came. </sentence><sentence id="984">We had a cook who was German and not Jewish, so he cooked the beasts, and when he was cooking them, to get the feathers out, he used boiling water, and when he did that -- you know what a mushkia is? </sentence><sentence id="985">The Jewish [indecipherable] overseers, which we would have foster, came in, and he looked at it and said, "Trayfa, no good, no good. </sentence><sentence id="986">You can't eat them. </sentence><sentence id="987">Now tell your community what happened." </sentence><sentence id="988">I said, "We m -- have to find a way out. </sentence><sentence id="989">This means life to them." </sentence><sentence id="990">Well, I had an Orthodox part, a community, they all wanted to go right to America, and the un-Orthodox want to go what was then Palestine. </sentence><sentence id="991">Now, the un-Orthodox said, "We can eat -- eat it." </sentence><sentence id="992">The Orthodox says, "Trayfa, trayfa, it can't be done." </sentence><sentence id="993">Then the Orthodox committee came to me and said, "You know, you have to ask a miracle rabbi." </sentence><sentence id="994">A-Again this gentleman assimilated [indecipherable]. </sentence><sentence id="995">Well, eventually, I found a miracle rabbi in a camp in Austria. </sentence><sentence id="996">Now, try to phone, in occupied Germany after the war from one country to another. </sentence><sentence id="997">I had to call General Clay's office, who was the commander of all of the German zones, and I got some soldier who thought I was utterly nuts. " </sentence><sentence id="998">What do you want, chicken? </sentence><sentence id="999">Buy some chicken." " </sentence><sentence id="1000">Excuse me, I have to," -- "All right, you get clearance." </sentence><sentence id="1001">I get clearance, I call for the wonder rabbi, and I get him. </sentence><sentence id="1002">And he says, "First of all, are you a Jewish daughter? </sentence><sentence id="1003">Well, this is a very difficult question, I have to think about it. </sentence><sentence id="1004">Would you call back in two hour?" </sentence><sentence id="1005">I said, "But the things have to be cooked. </sentence><sentence id="1006">I have no time to waste, I have excited people." </sentence><sentence id="1007">Call back. </sentence><sentence id="1008">So I go through the whole thing again, get the same soldier to Clay's office, who just -- who just shakes his head, I am sure, but gives me clearance. </sentence><sentence id="1009">And then I get the answer, it's a little difficult to translate from the German Jewish. " </sentence><sentence id="1010">If the geese and the chickens were boiled in water that was higher than the boiling mark, then they are trayfa, but if that was lower, if was water right out of the faucet, then they can be eaten." </sentence><sentence id="1011">So I was on very good terms with a young DP camp director, who had had a baby. </sentence><sentence id="1012">I said to him, "Please, you bathed your baby this morning in hot water from the faucet?" </sentence><sentence id="1013">He knew exactly what I was doing, said, "Yes, Miss Tarenberg, I did." </sentence><sentence id="1014">I went back, called my two committees together, and said, "That's the answer from the [indecipherable] rabbi, we can't go any higher, and we are going to eat the animals." </sentence><sentence id="1015">And we did. </sentence><sentence id="1016">But these stories, once in a lifetime. </sentence><sentence id="1017">Bad food is in all institutions, one of the main cause for trouble, because people don't have so many things to fight about, and they let out all their hostility, their fear, their anxiety, on food. </sentence><sentence id="1018">And I have had so many debates about food, you can't imagine. </sentence><sentence id="1019">In the three centers I worked in. </sentence><sentence id="1020">So that was part of it, but the emotional atmosphere on these holidays, with the families, some were all over the place, if they were alive, was really unforgettable. </sentence><sentence id="1021">On a more cheerful note, we had our first wedding in camp. </sentence><sentence id="1022">And that again is a story, how overly sensitive people are under those conditions. </sentence><sentence id="1023">This young couple wanted to go Aliyah beth -- you know what it is? </sentence><sentence id="1024">To Palestine. </sentence><sentence id="1025">And when they married -- at that time, of course, we had to create a wedding dress. </sentence><sentence id="1026">Well, the Joint had sent us lots and lots of material for cottons, and out of the cotton material, we made dr-dresses for the whole group. </sentence><sentence id="1027">And in a actual over-identification, I made myself a dress, too. </sentence><sentence id="1028">We must have looked like a flower garden. </sentence><sentence id="1029">Anyhow, when they married, I wanted to give them a wedding present. </sentence><sentence id="1030">You don't have very much to give, and anyhow, money seemed to be the most important. </sentence><sentence id="1031">Well, I took some lira and put them in an envelope, which was from my office, it was a little torn, and the young lady first said -- didn't say anything. </sentence><sentence id="1032">And much later came to me and said, "I didn't thank you, because I was annoyed, because you didn't take care enough to put that money in a nice envelope, and write something nice on it. </sentence><sentence id="1033">We are taking that money, not for our personal gratification, but we'll give it to Aliyah beth." </sentence><sentence id="1034">I said, "You're welcome, if that gives you satisfaction. </sentence><sentence id="1035">I'm sorry. </sentence><sentence id="1036">I surely didn't want to hurt you." </sentence><sentence id="1037">But that's typical for the over-sensitivity. </sentence><sentence id="1038">That was a Greek girl from Saronica. </sentence><sentence id="1039">And I found them a particularly sensitive group. </sentence><sentence id="1040">I don't know as much as [indecipherable] that I know about the other European countries. </sentence><sentence id="1041">But they are a very sensitive group to work with. </sentence><sentence id="1042">We had quite a few. </sentence><sentence id="1043">We also had a supposedly Sephardic Jews -- Jew, from Greece somewhere, who turned out not to be Jewish at all. </sentence><sentence id="1044">He was a Turk, and when a -- when he got angry, took a saber out -- I was talking -- and run around with a saber, but he ran away, end of story. </sentence><sentence id="1045">As I say, the interesting thing is that all that I remember so well, probably because I felt guilty that I couldn't do more to help them, that they all have forgotten the bad part, and of course, compared to the concentration camp, this at least meant some security, but that they didn't know to which country they would go. </sentence><sentence id="1046">I remember one woman who had a utterby breakdown, with good reason. </sentence><sentence id="1047">She had waited and waited for her husband, eventually located him in Poland, but he was married to another woman, he had thought she was dead. </sentence><sentence id="1048">And -- help. </sentence><sentence id="1049">And then, a young lady who really -- later in this country, when I met her, by chance in the street, became a friend of mine, had marched all the way from Romania, that was days and nights. </sentence><sentence id="1050">And she was young, she was almost a year -- a year -- was about 17 or 18, and almost all her family had been killed, but one brother who had gone to Palestine. </sentence><sentence id="1051">And she tried violently to make an adjustment once she" ll come to America. </sentence><sentence id="1052">Had bad case of TB. </sentence><sentence id="1053">They all had TB, but this was one of the worst. </sentence><sentence id="1054">And I looked after her, I s -- sat up at night with her, etcetera, etcetera. </sentence><sentence id="1055">You do what you think has to be done. </sentence><sentence id="1056">It's not always social work, what's [indecipherable] happen. </sentence><sentence id="1057">And one day we got a cable from Palestine that her brother had died in the war against England. </sentence><sentence id="1058">Now I had the nice job to tell. </sentence><sentence id="1059">And of course, she practically lost her mind, and so for quite a few nights I stayed with her in her room, and played, as well as I could, mother figure, but -- and she never got over, not even today, is happily married, but she had to tell all her past. </sentence><sentence id="1060">Many didn't talk about their past, but she felt she want to describe the halls, and there were many children. </sentence><sentence id="1061">It was a very religious home. </sentence><sentence id="1062">And so every day, we set aside a certain hour for telling. </sentence><sentence id="1063">And then I left, and I didn't hear about her. </sentence><sentence id="1064">I thought of her sometimes. </sentence><sentence id="1065">I had a picture, with a very nice dedication. </sentence><sentence id="1066">And really, 40 years went by, and I -- I'm here in Forest Hills in a street, in front of a store, looking at some hats. </sentence><sentence id="1067">And a very tiny voice behind me said, "Aren't you Miss Tarenberg?" </sentence><sentence id="1068">That was Celie, that's her name, Celia. </sentence><sentence id="1069">And she had come to this country, had gotten TB again, was in a TB sanitarium. </sentence><sentence id="1070">Had married, happily. </sentence><sentence id="1071">Her husband died. </sentence><sentence id="1072">Had married again, living quite near here. </sentence><sentence id="1073">Has two wonderful children, and is a very good business woman, which I'd never thought. </sentence><sentence id="1074">Had [indecipherable] in business. </sentence><sentence id="1075">We see each other once in awhile. </sentence><sentence id="1076">It's gone -- I never [indecipherable] something, I cannot identify this [indecipherable]. </sentence><sentence id="1077">You find that in DP camps, people became either very, almost fanatically religious, or said a God who lets concentration camps happen. </sentence><sentence id="1078">It's very difficult to say something to either. </sentence><sentence id="1079">But I found that over and over again. </sentence><sentence id="1080">And it's interesting that the stories I got at that time, went riva -- really well, just about liberated from camps, were quite different than what you get today. </sentence><sentence id="1081">I remember, I think out of my personal sy-system, I remember so well a young man who was very close to his father, they were very religious, and he had seen his father jump into the fire with a Torah in his arm. </sentence><sentence id="1082">You don't hear that any more. </sentence><sentence id="1083">But I must say, I almost cracked up on that one.

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1375">A: That is difficult to say, because is a highly individual -- some people had a great need to talk about their homes, and to show that they had little a farm, or a good business, or -- and I think people react in accordance with their personality. </sentence><sentence id="1376">You can't really make generalizations. </sentence><sentence id="1377">Some people had a great need to show how clever they had been in surviving, while today we recognize that survivor, was luck. </sentence><sentence id="1378">There are some things that have been shown, which made survivor, for instance, in a camp, somewhat more likely, if you had a close relative somewhere who needed you. </sentence><sentence id="1379">If you had a reason to survive. </sentence><sentence id="1380">There are such things that one can perhaps a little, generalize. </sentence><sentence id="1381">Some people who had a somewhat guilty conscience, had to justify the way. </sentence><sentence id="1382">There was much more things that had to be hidden at that time. </sentence><sentence id="1383">I remember one man was so upset because he had stolen potatoes. </sentence><sentence id="1384">And well, there were much more serious crimes that had been done. </sentence><sentence id="1385">And yes, after the people trusted you, you would have the conflict that you could have saved somebody, but you ran, or whatever it was. </sentence><sentence id="1386">I always have difficulty with some of the things, because you cannot document them, you have to trust my memory, and some of these stories, I don't even mention, because I have no way of showing they really happened. </sentence><sentence id="1387">I know it, but that's my quarrel I have very often, with people I discuss this whole -- memories are memories, but they are not documentation. </sentence><sentence id="1388">They change. </sentence><sentence id="1389">Human mind is stra -- is really doing strange things. </sentence><sentence id="1390">And people who've changed their story don't even know that they have changed it. </sentence><sentence id="1391">I've had people tell me another person's story, and thought it was theirs. </sentence><sentence id="1392">So, what I always say, but that's now a personal opinion. </sentence><sentence id="1393">Your facts are the skele -- skeleton, and the stories [indecipherable] are really the flesh you put on the skeleton. </sentence><sentence id="1394">Cause it's amazing what happens. </sentence><sentence id="1395">And then there are, of course, people who do it with a purpose. </sentence><sentence id="1396">One experience is that when we were very eager to get people to America, and they were -- the doctors felt they were really ready to go, but their x-rays didn't show it, we thought of [indecipherable] that the right x-rays were taken. </sentence><sentence id="1397">And the same people, when it came to restitution in this country, wanted me to testify that they had tuberculosis. </sentence><sentence id="1398">That's very difficult to decide what to do. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2338">A: Yes, they were very similar. </sentence><sentence id="2339">I think Merrano, because it was beautifully located, and had more appealing rooms, was I think, the more cheerful setting, if a TB sanitorium can be cheerful. </sentence><sentence id="2340">End of Tape Three, Side A Beginning Tape Three, Side B </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="2348"> continue to tell me about differences, and similarities between the different centers. </sentence><sentence id="2349">The two in </sentence></p><p><sentence id="2350"> Germany you got to know, and if you'd like to compare with the one in Italy. </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2351">A: Comparisons are always difficult, no matter what you compare. </sentence><sentence id="2352">The thing that stands out in my mind is that the people in Italy were closer to their real survivor experiences, and were more revolutionary, and also had more of a feeling of quote, that's coming to me. </sentence><sentence id="2353">And they really felt    that the world owed them a living. </sentence><sentence id="2354">Certainly America, because it was so rich, and Germany because it had handled them so badly. </sentence><sentence id="2355">As far as the camps, they were both located in pleasant surroundings. </sentence><sentence id="2356">I think the kooven ital -- Italy had more contact with the population of Merrano, than the group in Passau had with the inhabitants of Passau. </sentence><sentence id="2357">The problems were pretty much the same, health, where to go to, how to handle one's past, and what the future will bring. </sentence><sentence id="2358">This is an oversimplification, but by now, some of the details have slipped my mind. </sentence><sentence id="2359">What is very much on my mind is the fact that many of the people who are still alive, of my rehab center population, are in their late 50's, I think up the end of 60, and I wonder how they will handle the process of aging, which is something that affects all people, but I have a suspicion that it affects them differently. </sentence><sentence id="2360">From my work with survivors in this country, I have seen that they pretty much go to a second -- through a second immigration when they get older. </sentence><sentence id="2361">Certainly the language that they have handled rather well, through ha -- the middle years, gets to be slightly problematic again. </sentence><sentence id="2362">I find that older people, including me, are apt to count money in their mother tongue, which they haven't done for years. </sentence><sentence id="2363">Also, of course, living in a city, a big city like New York, where you haven't gone to school, or know anybody from the olden days, makes you doubly lonely. </sentence><sentence id="2364">Loneliness, of course, comes with aging, but as a survivor, you sometimes ask yourself, what do you survive for? </sentence><sentence id="2365">I have often heard complaints by survivors that there is nobody they went to school with, no neighbors that know the streets they have walked in. </sentence><sentence id="2366">And if it comes to memories, most older people can escape into pleasant memories, and do, but what can the survivor escape to? </sentence><sentence id="2367">Slaughter, and burning, and anxiety, and death. </sentence><sentence id="2368">So, I think -- and I know that at the moment, studies being made about it, that there is actually a difference. </sentence><sentence id="2369">Yes, the experience of aging, we all have, but in a way, the survivor has it more so. </sentence><sentence id="2370">Everything gets overly intensified. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2394">Q: Have you focused on these issues of aging among the survivor population in your work, after returning from Europe, in New York? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2396">A: Thave. </sentence><sentence id="2397">And I have had an -- when I still had cases -- later 1 became an administrator, I have had cases of people who were older, and my agency had a coffee house once a week, for older survivors, and that always gave me a chance to talk to different people, and as I'm, in a way, one of them, they share it with me quite frankly, their pleasures, and their worries. </sentence><sentence id="2398">And, of course, sickness is another one, where people born and raised in this country, may have a relative come in, or a long time friend when they need help. </sentence><sentence id="2399">It's always very different -- difficult for the survivor who lives alone, to find a person who helps take care of their bookkeeping, whom they can have on their living will, and all these documents that run all our lives, become problems, and make it suddenly clear again, yes you thought you were an American, you thought you were at home here, and suddenly you feel like a foreigner. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2404">Q: I'd like to return to your time in Germany, and to your own living conditions. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2406">A: Okay, which -- </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2407">Q: So when you were in either Birishgamine, or Passau, what were the living conditions that you had on a weekly basis, a daily basis, how can you give some picture of what your own conditions were like? </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2408">A: We were so much daily living that they almost are not conditions. </sentence><sentence id="2409">I had a room. </sentence><sentence id="2410">I had office hours from about 10 to about four. </sentence><sentence id="2411">People came to me when they had question about their pocket money, when their laundry wasn't intact, or the cook was angry, somebody had sent the food back. </sentence><sentence id="2412">So I think part of the time, I was made of all purposes, and then people had sometimes gotten letters from consulates in a different language, which I tried to translate. </sentence><sentence id="2413">They had to make official phone calls, which I made for them. </sentence><sentence id="2414">And almost always, they took this opportunity to talk about what just worried them that particular day. </sentence><sentence id="2415">They hadn't heard from an uncle in America who was supposed to give an affidavit. </sentence><sentence id="2416">The consulate hasn't let them know somebody had treated them badly. </sentence><sentence id="2417">There was a rumor that Australia had -- took only people in agriculture. </sentence><sentence id="2418">Whatever came up during the day, and then in the evening sometimes, we really talked about olden times, how it was at home, how they had sat around the open fire, how the grandfather had lived with them, how different it all was when the Russians came, who came riding into the kitchen, and had very different ideas of civilization. </sentence><sentence id="2419">Also, on the other hand, had been very helpful. </sentence><sentence id="2420">Many had been liberated by the Russians, who had liberated Auschwitz, and had really only good things to say. </sentence><sentence id="2421">Other had stories that they simply had to tell, because they've had such an injustice had to be done to him. </sentence><sentence id="2422">I remember a little story which is indicative. </sentence><sentence id="2423">In a camp, there were a husband and wife, and as most camps, as -- especially concentration camps, there was absolutely nothing to eat. </sentence><sentence id="2424">And one day, the husband had managed to gather two potatoes to bring to his wife, who was in the barrack. </sentence><sentence id="2425">And it was a very wet, damp day. </sentence><sentence id="2426">He tried to balance his way on bar -- bare feet through the ward with his two potatoes, and he was very close to home when an SS man came and just threw the potatoes out of his hand, down to the floor, into the mud, so that they couldn't be eaten any more. </sentence><sentence id="2427">And he said, "That was one time where I cried." </sentence><sentence id="2428">And I must confess, I cried when I heard the story. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2451">Q: How do you look back on the emotional reaction in you, during your time working with refugees, and how -- you say you cried from this story. </sentence><sentence id="2452">What other incidents really got to your center, and bothered you, disturbed you? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2455">A: The interesting thing is, the big stories don't upset you as much as the small ones, and the reason is, I cannot identify with thousand people being killed, but I can identify with a husband being proud to relieve the starving of his wife, and have it spoiled. </sentence><sentence id="2456">And I've always felt, when I'm honest, it is these small things, the things that could have happened to me, in my experience, because the other things I haven't experienced. </sentence><sentence id="2457">I have not lost somebody in a fire. </sentence><sentence id="2458">I haven't lost anybody through Hitler, really, but I've lost a much -- many other things, and I know the loss were innocent. </sentence><sentence id="2459">Things I have experienced are easier to ad -- identify with. </sentence><sentence id="2460">There are some stories of escapes through snow nights. </sentence><sentence id="2461">Now, I have some there from my husband, but as you will read them, why should I tell them? </sentence><sentence id="2462">That -- his life was full of these small stories that get you. </sentence><sentence id="2463">And not only me, but everybody we knew. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2474">Q: Did you feel that there was an emotional toll, or price that you had to pay to do this kind of work with refugees? </sentence><sentence id="2475">At the end of a day, did you reflect to yourself, and try to -- try to come up with ways to look at each day with perspective? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2478">A: Yes, I try to review each day, and to see if there's something I could have done better. </sentence><sentence id="2479">And when I found something, I welcome it. </sentence><sentence id="2480">An emotional toll, perhaps it didn't take, because I felt guilty to begin with. </sentence><sentence id="2481">And everything that I could do, would relieve my personal feeling of guilt. </sentence><sentence id="2482">I came out of it, I think a better social worker, or to b -- say it better, a better listener, because so much of the help one could give, was simply by listening with a sensitive ear. </sentence><sentence id="2483">You may say a trained ear, because people were so unhappy when they came to this country, that nobody wanted to listen to them. </sentence><sentence id="2484">And they were bitter about it. </sentence><sentence id="2485">And even today, the first thing one's being told, oh well, when we came to America, nobody wanted to hear us. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2494">Q: Did you keep a journal, or in any other way record your reflections? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2496">A: I didn't keep a journal, but when something really moved me, I made either a story out of it, because I liked to write, or put it down verbatim. </sentence><sentence id="2497">I kept those notes for a long time, but I don't have them any more. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2500">Q: Again, with respect to the centers, or the DP camps where you were working in Germany, were there similar types of religious activities and observances, as what you saw in Merrano, and also, what could you say about any of the cultural activities taking place in the camps, or centers in Germany? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2502">A: I don't remember. </sentence><sentence id="2503">I don't remember that we celebrated a Jewish holiday. </sentence><sentence id="2504">I may not have been there during holidays. </sentence><sentence id="2505">I don't remember the split between Orthodox, and the assimilated that we definitely had in Merrano. </sentence><sentence id="2506">You may have had several [indecipherable] in Barishkamine, not in Passau. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2512">Q: Do you have more distinct memories of Merrano, in comparison to the two in -- places in Germany? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2514">A: Yes. </sentence><sentence id="2515">I think because it was the first, and I came back from my own recuperation, and I stayed in touch with some instructors who went later to Israel. </sentence><sentence id="2516">And the young girl I mentioned to you as the youngest, was later adopted by one of the doctors, and they went to Israel together, and then married a doctor, and came here, and stayed with me for some time, and I helped her find a job here. </sentence><sentence id="2517">Yes, Merrano has many more memories. </sentence><sentence id="2518">The others, I never feeled at home, and it was somehow -- it was more of a job. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2524">Q: And what time period were you, more or less, in Germany working with refugees? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2526">A: From "49, I think part of "48, the end of "48. </sentence><sentence id="2527">In "50, I came back to the States. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2530">Q: In any of these situations, whether in Italy, or in Germany, did you encounter any families that were intact, any family members that had already found each other again, or was it all single individuals, even if there were marriages within the camps, or the centers? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2532">A: I think there were families in [indecipherable] in the first camp, where I was a few days. </sentence><sentence id="2533">I cannot remember -- I think husband and wife, I may have met one or two couples. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2536">Q: And in Germany, were there marriages in those camps, or centers, just as there were in Italy? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2538">A: Made a mistake, in Italy there weren't, in Germany there were. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2540">Q: Maybe I made the mistake, but . . </sentence><sentence id="2541">.| may have also gotten the wrong impression about something else. </sentence><sentence id="2542">I think I was told that in one of the places you were in Germany, you were the only relief worker living in the camp itself, is that true? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2546">A: These were rehab centers, and they were -- they were listed as DP camps, so I use it sometimes. </sentence><sentence id="2547">I think everywhere I was -- no, not in Italy, but in Passau, and Barishkamine, I think I was the only one living there. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2550">Q: And was that a choice on your part, something that you asked for? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2552">A: I think I was the only worker, and it was [indecipherable] it was the thing to do. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2554">Q: So, in other words, when you were working with refugees, you were living amongst them, or </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2555">A: Yes. </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2556">Q: And then you would go on the weekends, or at some other point to Munich, is that how your routine went? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2558">A: There was never a set routine, but very often I would do that, yes. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2560">Q: And again, just like I was asking with respect to the refugees in Italy you worked with, in Germany, did many of them wind up leaving the centers while you were there, and how did the conditions change from the point when you started, to the point when you left? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2562">A: Basically they didn't change. </sentence><sentence id="2563">Some people left, their visa came through, sometimes they found a relative unexpectedly, in Argentine or somewhere. </sentence><sentence id="2564">The big change was, there was a Palestine one could go to, by -- or rather Israel one could go to. </sentence><sentence id="2565">Palestine you needed the English    permit, and didn't get it. </sentence><sentence id="2566">So that opened up new hope, and the spirit was a little more hopeful toward the end of my work, than in the beginning. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2573">Q: When you would take down the histories of refugees experiences, on a daily basis, were you surprised and shocked from -- with what you heard, or did you go through a sort of transformation during your time with this work, and -- </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2574">A: No. </sentence><sentence id="2575">Even today, and I have taken hundreds here too, I think every history is different, and it will get me, I sometimes get mad at the client in my mind, and sometimes I admire them, but I've never gotten to the point where they don't touch me. </sentence><sentence id="2576">They may not -- I'm sure they don't touch me as much as they did in the beginning. </sentence><sentence id="2577">But I was very prepared for my husband's stories. </sentence><sentence id="2578">But that came out a little later. </sentence><sentence id="2579">No, I -- I never really got tired or blase about it. </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2580">Q: And yet, weren't you often surprised? </sentence><sentence id="2581">Was every day bringing something new to your awareness that you had not heard before? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2584">A: Not every day, but once in awhile, I did hear about a criminal act I'd never heard of before, or some event I had never heard of. </sentence><sentence id="2585">And that overwhelmed me. </sentence><sentence id="2586">There was one mention, at one point, which I can't document, of somebody who claimed to have eaten human flesh. </sentence><sentence id="2587">That was something I could neither understand, nor digest. </sentence><sentence id="2588">I've never heard it again, other people said it was never [indecipherable]. </sentence><sentence id="2589">I don't know. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2596">Q: Did refugees talk much about war crimes trials taking place? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2598">A: Not at all. </sentence><sentence id="2599">I don't know which ca -- which year the war crimes took place. </sentence><sentence id="2600">Not at all. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2604">Q: In Germany, did the refugees often talk about specific perpetrators, and -- </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2605">A: Yes. </sentence><sentence id="2606">They talked a great deal about the kapos, the people who were the supervisors in the concentration camps. </sentence><sentence id="2607">And they had grim stories to tell, and they would repeat the stories over and over again. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2611">Q: But you also heard about people who had done good things, and they remembered that too. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="2613">Polish peasants who had survi -- had helped survive a couple. </sentence><sentence id="2614">Some had survived, a couple -- had saved a couple's child, and some person said, "None of us would have survived, if it wouldn't have been for people who were helpful." </sentence><sentence id="2615">I heard that from both Italian -- more Italians than Poles. </sentence><sentence id="2616">But also Germany, but less so. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2621">Q: Did you meet individuals from your own hometown of Hamburg? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2623">A: Once or twice, yes. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2625">Q: People you had known? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2627">A: No. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2629">Q: So will you tell me now how it came to pass that you left Germany, and eventually returned to New York? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2631">A: Well, I guess my contract was up, and three years was long enough, and I had met my future husband at that time. </sentence><sentence id="2632">And the eventually hope was to go to America. </sentence><sentence id="2633">And I -- I just had had -- I -- I felt it was time to go home. </sentence><sentence id="2634">I had an apartment I wasn't -- didn't know what was going on there. </sentence><sentence id="2635">So I came home. </sentence><sentence id="2636">And [indecipherable] immigration agencies, for HIAS -- for New York Association for New Americans. </sentence><sentence id="2637">Then, for a short time, I went back to the juvenile court. </sentence><sentence id="2638">And then I heard that my latest agency, 1959 -- in the meantime I got married -- Self Help, was looking for somebody to take over for vacation. </sentence><sentence id="2639">And I said I'Il do it. </sentence><sentence id="2640">I came for three months, and stayed 40 years. </sentence><sentence id="2641">And I worked as a caseworker first, psychiatric social worker, and eventually ended up as deputy director. </sentence><sentence id="2642">That was an agency that worked exclusively for survivors. </sentence><sentence id="2643">It started with survivors from Germany, but soon became survivors from central Europe. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2657">Q: So you want to continue telling me about this organization you worked for, Self Help? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2659">A: Right. </sentence><sentence id="2660">It was founded in 1935 by German refugees. </sentence><sentence id="2661">And they founded it, and worked together with the Quakers. </sentence><sentence id="2662">So, in name, it is always a non-sectarian agency, but today it works only for Jewish survivors -- that is not true, either. </sentence><sentence id="2663">Anyh -- it works. </sentence><sentence id="2664">It still has a section only for survivors. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2671">Q: Did you get involved with restitution issues? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2673">A: As an agency, yes. </sentence><sentence id="2674">We worked closely with claims conference, and the president of the claims conference was a board member of our agency, w-we worked very closely with all agencies, as another German Jewish agency, the blue card -- </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2675">Q: You've made references to the fact that you later met many of the survivors and refugees you had helped. </sentence><sentence id="2676">And how did those meetings usually come about? </sentence><sentence id="2677">Did you take initiative to try to contact them -- </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2678">A: No. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2680">Q: -- or did they come to you? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2682">A: No, neither nor. </sentence><sentence id="2683">Just by chance. </sentence><sentence id="2684">Self Help has a great home health aide service, and people ask for our home health aides, and they were often survivors. </sentence><sentence id="2685">And Self Help, together with other agencies, runs quite a few apartment houses, which were originally for survivors, so I met survivors there. </sentence><sentence id="2686">Then United Helpers, this the agency has a scholarship program. </sentence><sentence id="2687">I met them for that. </sentence><sentence id="2688">And yet, there's also a German Jewish based nursing home. </sentence><sentence id="2689">By now I meet quite a few there. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2698">Q: What can you say about the similarities, and differences between the different organizations you've worked for through the years, that have helped refugees? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2700">A: HIAS is an immigration agency founded by Jewish people from eastern Europe, and has many of it's connections in eastern Europe, and Poland, and Hungary, and so on. </sentence><sentence id="2701">The American Joint was founded by German Jews, and it's connections are more in western Europe. </sentence><sentence id="2702">Both agencies are immigration agencies, both work in many countries in Europe, have many similarities. </sentence><sentence id="2703">There's room for both of them. </sentence><sentence id="2704">Basically, they have the same goal, I think -- it's hard to say. </sentence><sentence id="2705">I really w-would have to read the formulation of their missions to be able -- I know what the working differences is, but what's in their mission, I couldn't say. </sentence><sentence id="2706">And then we have the Jewish Federation, which funnels all these agencies. </sentence><sentence id="2707">You have a small, but very effective German Jewish agency called the Blue card, which is a relief giving agency. </sentence><sentence id="2708">The other agencies, basically, are not giving relief. </sentence><sentence id="2709">They help with everything else. </sentence><sentence id="2710">And the Council of Jewish Women, I think doesn't do anything, they used to help with immigration. </sentence><sentence id="2711">And Self Help has become rowt -- right now, an all around agency, that has a -- a very large homemaker service, with almost 3,000 homemaker. </sentence><sentence id="2712">No, not 3,000, over a thousand homemakers, and it has five apartment houses that it runs. </sentence><sentence id="2713">It does five senior citizen centers, for the city. </sentence><sentence id="2714">And in our housing, too, there weren't enough immigrants any more, so it's open now to Chinese, and everywhere, who is living in that particular community. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2731">Q: I know that you mentioned this briefly earlier, but I was wondering if you could elaborate on something you mentioned in the way of survivors who you met first in DP situations in Europe -- </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2732">A: Mm-hm. </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2733">Q: -- showing a certain perspective about their experiences, and that over the years, in meeting them again, were meeting other refugees again, or for the first time even, that you've seen a different kind of perspective shared. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2735">A: That applies mostly to the way things are remembered. </sentence><sentence id="2736">End of Tape Three, Side B    Beginning Tape Four, Side A </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2740">Q: This is a United States Holocaust Memorial Museum interview with Gabriele D. Schiff, conducted by Amy Rubin, on July 27", 2000, in Forest Hills, New York. </sentence><sentence id="2741">This is tape number four, side A. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2744">A: In comparison, the more sheltered time in the DP camps is, in their memories, more positive than it was when they lived there. </sentence><sentence id="2745">There, the old insecurity and fear was overwhelming. </sentence><sentence id="2746">Now that the struggle in the outside world has been not easy, to say the least, the time in the DP camp is seen in rosier and rosier light. </sentence><sentence id="2747">I have a friend who is writing a book, who I sometimes talk to, and he asked me to give him some names of people who would give him their -- their history. </sentence><sentence id="2748">And I suggested them. </sentence><sentence id="2749">And he said it was very difficult to get anything negative for them, they were only ready to paint it in the most positive pictures. </sentence><sentence id="2750">That, of course, is rather interesting, and my only explanation is that life on the outside was strenuous, and makes the camp experience, sheltered life, not to worry about job, not to raise children, in rosier light than it really was. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2760">A: I think for me it was a natural thing to do. </sentence><sentence id="2761">I have never had any doubt about going into it, and I must say, coming out of it, I find in a way this history is a logical ending to about 40 years of service, which I have given with pleasure, also with heartache, but that's part of life. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2768">A: Yeah, the one, and I think the most interesting one was a passport issued by Raoul Wallenberg, in Hungary, to Jews. </sentence><sentence id="2769">It was given to my husband, and I happen to have the original, and I sent it to the museum. </sentence><sentence id="2770">I also sent them a picture of the sanitorium in Merrano, and one has the director on it, the other our first group of graduating nurse's aides. </sentence><sentence id="2771">I also sent them most recently, a large snapshot of Goering, which was taken by my brother, who was asked to interrogate Goering in Nuremberg. </sentence><sentence id="2772">That picture came into my hand, and I thought it has a better place with the museum. </sentence></p></dialogue>
