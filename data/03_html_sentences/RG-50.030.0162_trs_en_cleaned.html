<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="61">Q: And then? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="63">A: Oh, then uh December Sth, we entered Germany. </sentence><sentence id="64">And again we followed uh an armored unit through; and the incidents that uh I uh am really here to tell about uh occurred in April. </sentence><sentence id="65">And uh it was near the town of Waldenburg in East Germany. </sentence><sentence id="66">We were stationed in a little town called Remse: R-E-M-S-E. We had just arrived there that day when uh another GI came over and told me there were three Jews across the street. </sentence><sentence id="67">They were dressed in the striped concentration camp uniform. </sentence><sentence id="68">I went over to them, and I started to speak Yiddish to them. </sentence><sentence id="69">And, oh, were they happy to be able to talk to someone who spoke Yiddish! </sentence><sentence id="70">And they told us some of their stories--uh the same ones that I will tell you about later--and uh we gave them food. </sentence><sentence id="71">We gave them some chocolate and other goodies; uh and they told us where they were from, that just down the road at the next town of Waldenburg there were a group of twenty- two hundred freed concentration victims. </sentence><sentence id="72">Uh there were two thousand women-- mostly from Hungary--approximately, and about two hundred men--mostly from Poland, some Germans. </sentence><sentence id="73">They uh were freed just that morning. </sentence><sentence id="74">They were being driven by a group of SS officers to be used as slave labor uh whenever the Germans were able to make a stand. </sentence><sentence id="75">They slept in the woods at night. </sentence><sentence id="76">When they got up in the morning, the SS officer led the transport to the left. </sentence><sentence id="77">If he had led them to the right, nothing would have happened. </sentence><sentence id="78">He would have been able to keep chasing them. </sentence><sentence id="79">Where we were, we were following the 4th Armored Division, and uh we were actually a spear-head. </sentence><sentence id="80">We were heading towards Chemnitz [NB: Karl-Marx-Stadt], in order to capture it. </sentence><sentence id="81">And we were sticking out of the main lines; uh but uh after the uh incidents that I'm going to relay, we received orders to retreat. </sentence><sentence id="82">And we went back a hundred and sixty miles uh west and south, out of the area. </sentence><sentence id="83">Because that was the area that the Potsdam Agreement had allotted to the Russians, and the Russians were on the other side of Chemnitz. </sentence><sentence id="84">We uh waited "til after supper. </sentence><sentence id="85">I asked an officer to borrow a truck. </sentence><sentence id="86">I told the other soldiers in the outfit where I was going with the truck; and we got food from the kitchens. </sentence><sentence id="87">We got food from packages that the soldiers had received overseas. </sentence><sentence id="88">And we took the truck to the little town of Waldenburg, uh where these uh freed people were. </sentence><sentence id="89">Uh I spoke to them in Yiddish. </sentence><sentence id="90">At first, they were skeptical; but then they uh accepted it. </sentence><sentence id="91">And I started...we started, rather, to give out the things we had brought. </sentence><sentence id="92">And there was such bedlam. </sentence><sentence id="93">There was such fighting. </sentence><sentence id="94">It became uncontrollable. </sentence><sentence id="95">We could uh...they were hungry and they wanted these things that they hadn't seen for many many years. </sentence><sentence id="96">Oh, finally I, we stopped giving it out and uh it was given to the leader of the group who actually did distribute it later. </sentence><sentence id="97">But then I started to talk to the, to refugees who were there, and it it's hard to describe the mixture of happiness and sorrow that they had. </sentence><sentence id="98">Uh they called us belachim (ph)--angels. </sentence><sentence id="99">Uh they said the (ph)...the Messiah is here. </sentence><sentence id="100">And one man even said, "We're going to have a new  http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection have given me." </sentence><sentence id="101">I have no one." </sentence><sentence id="102">Besides this mixture of elation and sorrow, I heard the stories that I really already knew about how the Germans had mistreated the uh the Jews that were under their control. </sentence><sentence id="103">They told me, for example, how babies" heads were smashed against walls, the wanton killings that occurred for absolutely no reason at all, just for the sake of killing or for the slightest trivial thing that was done wrong. </sentence><sentence id="104">Uh they spoke about working twelve hours at night, after being up all day; and uh stories of that kind. </sentence><sentence id="105">Uh, I asked people to sign a list of names with relatives they might have had in America, England or Palestine; and I told them that I would send the list overseas. </sentence><sentence id="106">Which I did, eventually. </sentence><sentence id="107">They were reluctant to do it. </sentence><sentence id="108">They weren't sure that this was an honest list. </sentence><sentence id="109">They were afraid--some of them, at least--that some kind of deportation list was being made up. </sentence><sentence id="110">They hadn't overcome the fear that they uh felt. </sentence><sentence id="111">And uh I left. </sentence><sentence id="112">The next night, I came back again; but the atmosphere was entirely different. </sentence><sentence id="113">Instead of about fifteen Gls being there, there were several hundred. </sentence><sentence id="114">And they all brought things for the uh women and men that were there. </sentence><sentence id="115">They were quite safe. </sentence><sentence id="116">Uh the day before, there was a lieutenant for the American government--uh the AMG, the American Military Government there. </sentence><sentence id="117">And I went over, and I spoke to him. </sentence><sentence id="118">I said, "Well, what can you do for these people?" </sentence><sentence id="119">He said, "Well, I'll try and get uh the chairman mayor--the Burgermeister--to give them some food, etc." </sentence><sentence id="120">And uh he said, "It won't do any good. </sentence><sentence id="121">We can't force them, and I'm too busy to really supervise them." </sentence><sentence id="122">But when we came the next day, we discovered they had received a hundred pounds of butter--which I figured out to be a tenth of a pound per person approximately. </sentence><sentence id="123">And uh in addition, the uh rest of the goodies that the uh other Gls had brought. </sentence><sentence id="124">They were quite uh satisfied. </sentence><sentence id="125">They weren't hungry anymore. </sentence><sentence id="126">Uh, so that that solved that problem. </sentence><sentence id="127">I didn't get too many more names, but I did learn a new word the second night. </sentence><sentence id="128">The word miissulman. </sentence><sentence id="129">The man who told me the story told me that a miissulman was someone who was so emaciated, so starved, so shrunken, so skinny that their features became very, very sharp--to the extent that they looked like a mouse. </sentence><sentence id="130">And these were the people that were screened out by the Germans for immediate death, because either they couldn't anymore or soon would not be able to do any labor. </sentence><sentence id="131">It was this man's job to carry the mtissulmen who couldn't walk to the crematorium. </sentence><sentence id="132">And he did that; until he finally too became a miissulman. </sentence><sentence id="133">But he was lucky. </sentence><sentence id="134">The doctor there uh was a friend of his, and he helped him. </sentence><sentence id="135">And now the man was pretty husky and pretty strong. </sentence><sentence id="136">He was not a weakling anymore. </sentence><sentence id="137">As a matter of fact, uh most of the people uh in Waldenburg were pretty physically fit; because they had been chosen to be the future laborers wherever the Germans would take them. </sentence><sentence id="138">So in this case, instead of picking the weaklings, the strong ones were picked so that they could be transported and done some work. </sentence><sentence id="139">The list of names that was sent home were sent to my wife, uh who worked for the Yiddish scientific institute--YIVO. </sentence><sentence id="140">The letter arrived on a weekend. </sentence><sentence id="141">She called up the officials of the YIVO; and they immediately went to the office, read my letter, read the list of names, and they issued a press release which was published in the Times and the Jewish Daily Forward and the Aufbau. </sentence><sentence id="142">The Aufbau listed all the names. </sentence><sentence id="143">The other two didn't. </sentence><sentence id="144">And uh the next day, they sat my wife down in the office; and there were many many phone calls from people who were looking. </sentence><sentence id="145">We know that she did contact... She looked in the New York phone books and found one or two people who were listed there; and she called them up and she told them that their relatives were still alive. </sentence><sentence id="146">However, unfortunately, right after that--the next day--uh we were pulled out of Remse. </sentence><sentence id="147">And as I mentioned before, we went back and This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="148">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="149"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection down a hundred and sixty miles. </sentence><sentence id="150">And I assume 4th Armored was pulled back, too; and the Russians came in and took over the area and Waldenburg and these refugees. </sentence><sentence id="151">So I had...I had no future information on them. </sentence><sentence id="152">The reason we went south was that we were heading towards the so-called Austrian redoubt. </sentence><sentence id="153">The story was that the Germans were going to make a last stand in the Austrian mountains; and American armies were sent there to be sure that nothing even like that happened. </sentence><sentence id="154">And we went and we moved just as quickly as we had always moved, ending up in a town called Vocklabruck: V-O-C-K-L-A-B-R-U-C-K. [hope I got it right. </sentence><sentence id="155">And uh we were there...we got there on May 5th. </sentence><sentence id="156">Uh V-E day was May 8th[, 1945].Meanwhile, stories started to sift through about a concentration camp in the area that uh had recently been liberated. </sentence><sentence id="157">The name of the concentration camp was uh Ebensee. </sentence><sentence id="158">Uh, again I borrowed a truck. </sentence><sentence id="159">Didn't take food this time, because our Army was there. </sentence><sentence id="160">But I took along twenty-three soldiers who wanted to go with me. </sentence><sentence id="161">The distance was, I...I recall correctly, about uh twenty miles from where we were. </sentence><sentence id="162">We got to the camp. </sentence><sentence id="163">Uh I got permission, a pass, to visit the crematorium and into the camp. </sentence><sentence id="164">I was amazed. </sentence><sentence id="165">In contrast to the Waldenburg group, all I saw were living skeletons--gaunt people, many of them completely naked. </sentence><sentence id="166">Uh many of them, you couldn't tell whether they were walking dead or walking alive. </sentence><sentence id="167">Their faces were expressionless. </sentence><sentence id="168">Uh, I...I really don't know how to describe it accurately. </sentence><sentence id="169">It...it...it was so different than anything I've every seen. </sentence><sentence id="170">Uh these...well, "walking skeletons" again, walking around. </sentence><sentence id="171">Uh people were lying on the ground--not too many--that seemed to be dead. </sentence><sentence id="172">Uh, I wouldn't know. </sentence><sentence id="173">And uh here, too, I started to speak to the uh people who were in the camp. </sentence><sentence id="174">Uh one told me a story of how uh they performed experiments on women, of the kind that uh we perform on dogs and guineas [pigs]. </sentence><sentence id="175">For example, the sterilization of women. </sentence><sentence id="176">Ina different vein, a...one man asked me, "Are the Jews going to Israel?" </sentence><sentence id="177">And I explained the difficulties that the uh people were having getting into Israel. </sentence><sentence id="178">And he says, "Oh, the Germans are such liars! </sentence><sentence id="179">We were told that hoards of Jews were arriving safely in Israel, and I had looked forward to uh getting there." </sentence><sentence id="180">There's also a story that was told of the Germans taking uh Jewish boys and girls, forcing them to get undressed, and forcing them to have sex with each other while they were watching. </sentence><sentence id="181">The girls, I was told, were screaming, "Kill me! </sentence><sentence id="182">Don't do this to me!" </sentence><sentence id="183">But that wouldn't have helped. </sentence><sentence id="184">So uh it just went on, the way I was told. </sentence><sentence id="185">Uh, there were many sick and dying at Ebensee. </sentence><sentence id="186">The American medics were taking care of them. </sentence><sentence id="187">Uh, while I was there, two busloads uh of sick people were transported out of uh Ebensee. </sentence><sentence id="188">But there were any number of others who wanted to be in the bus. </sentence><sentence id="189">It was pitiful to see the bag of bones climbing up the side of the bus. </sentence><sentence id="190">It was a slippery bus; they couldn't stay there. </sentence><sentence id="191">Or climbing on to the top of the bus, in order to be there when the bus went out. </sentence><sentence id="192">They did not get out, because they were taken off the bus--hopefully, to go on another load. </sentence><sentence id="193">We went to the crematorium. </sentence><sentence id="194">The crematorium...and there was no gas chamber. </sentence><sentence id="195">This wasn't a big enough camp. </sentence><sentence id="196">The building had two rooms. </sentence><sentence id="197">One room where the bodies were kept before they were burned. </sentence><sentence id="198">The other room where there was an oven--one oven--that could burn eight people every two hours. </sentence><sentence id="199">This, I was told, was absolutely not enough; and that thousands of dead Jews and other nationalities were buried in the hillside of Ebensee. </sentence><sentence id="200">The...what I'm touching things, the irony was the sign the Germans had put up on the wall. </sentence><sentence id="201">It was a verse, went something like this: "Don't let the worms get my body; better that the fire engulf me, so instead of burying me, burn me. </sentence><sentence id="202">I'm trying to think if there's anything else. </sentence><sentence id="203">Oh, yes. </sentence><sentence id="204">Uh, before the outfit (TECHNICAL CONVERSATION) went overseas, uh every uh outfit had This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="205">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="206"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection to have an orientation officer to give an explanation as to why we were fighting the war. </sentence><sentence id="207">Having been a history teacher before the war started, I was selected to do that. </sentence><sentence id="208">And among the reasons I gave for our being in...in the war was the inhumanity of the Germans. </sentence><sentence id="209">On the way back from Ebensee--and this could be almost two years later--uh I didn't stop to figure it out. </sentence><sentence id="210">One of the men said, "You know, and when I heard you, I thought it was all propaganda." </sentence><sentence id="211">I had heard the stories already, because I was interested; and I repeated them to the men. </sentence><sentence id="212">And he said, "I thought this was all propaganda." </sentence><sentence id="213">And he says, "Now, I know better." </sentence><sentence id="214">Went back to uh Vocklabruk; and from there, we were wondering whether we would be sent directly to Japan, or go for a leave in the States and then go fight in Japan. </sentence><sentence id="215">But, fortunately, the war ended. </sentence><sentence id="216">And after spending a lot of time in uh...in France in staging camps, uh I was sent back overseas. </sentence><sentence id="217">But meanwhile, the rule in the Army was that if you had a place to sleep, you could get a pass. </sentence><sentence id="218">Because the big problem was lodging. </sentence><sentence id="219">And I happen to have had relatives in Paris and in Belgium. </sentence><sentence id="220">As a matter of fact, uh I bugged the officer so much about going to Paris or Belgium that even at the height of the Battle of the Bulge, when the fighting was going on, they went to get their liquor rations. ( </sentence><sentence id="221">TECHNICAL CONVERSATION) And they came in at seven o'clock in the morning, and said, "Milbauer, you want to go to Brussels?" </sentence><sentence id="222">I said, "Yes!" " </sentence><sentence id="223">Be ready in fifteen minutes." </sentence><sentence id="224">And we went to Brussels during the Battle of the Bulge. ( </sentence><sentence id="225">TECHNICAL CONVERSATION) And uh from my uh camps in France I went to Paris several times. </sentence><sentence id="226">I went to Belgium again, because that was the...I had the lodging with my family. </sentence><sentence id="227">Uh, I used to bring food to my family in Paris. </sentence><sentence id="228">Uh I couldn't to Brussels, because we were all in one little jeep. </sentence><sentence id="229">But again, I was able to borrow a truck and bring food to the Paris family. ( </sentence><sentence id="230">TECHNICAL CONVERSATION) Interestingly enough, uh my family story has a happier ending than some of the previous stories that I told you. </sentence><sentence id="231">Uh, it was not a small family; but everyone survived, uh most with an interesting story to tell. </sentence><sentence id="232">In Paris, uh my uncle by marriage, [Franz Van Manhut (ph)] was a painter, professional painter. </sentence><sentence id="233">He had at least one picture that the Louvre bought. </sentence><sentence id="234">He kept his wife in the basement for the whole war. </sentence><sentence id="235">She never went out, so she was not bothered. </sentence><sentence id="236">As a matter of fact, in my house I still have a mint yellow (ph) that was never sewn on  http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection white marriage. </sentence><sentence id="237">And because she was married to a gentile, in Belgium she wasn't called anymore. </sentence><sentence id="238">Uh I have a cousin, Henri, in Belgium, who is a native born Belgian. </sentence><sentence id="239">He was in the Belgian Army. </sentence><sentence id="240">He was captured after only sixteen days of fighting; and he ended up in Hamburg after being in seven different prison camps. </sentence><sentence id="241">He survived the bombing of Hamburg, which was pretty severe and did hit some of the camps. </sentence><sentence id="242">Uh he later went to work for the Belgian government. </sentence><sentence id="243">Uh there's uh another uncle--uh, Uncle Joseph-- who joined the French Army as a uh volunteer. </sentence><sentence id="244">He too was captured, and he ended up with Stalag 17. </sentence><sentence id="245">Uh he's written a number of French books. </sentence><sentence id="246">He's a published poet; and there are some poems about Stalag 17 in his uh books. </sentence><sentence id="247">He got sick in the prison camp, was repat...repatriated back to France, immediately joined the resistance. </sentence><sentence id="248">And after a while, he was denounced. </sentence><sentence id="249">And in the nick of time he managed to escape across the Pyrenees and finally ended up in Palestine. </sentence><sentence id="250">Another uncle by marriage, David Lara, worked for one of the newspapers in Belgium. </sentence><sentence id="251">And he was very strongly anti-Nazi before the Nazis came. </sentence><sentence id="252">And as soon as they were close or after...just after they came - I don't know which - he too escaped across the Pyrenees, to uh America; and his wife followed him uh not too long thereafter. </sentence><sentence id="253">Uh there's one more relative that I seem to have forgotten. </sentence><sentence id="254">Oh, yes--a cousin by marriage who was a captain in the Maquis in the Vichy area. </sentence><sentence id="255">After the war--I don't know exactly how this happened--he and some of his followers surrounded one of the grand houses in Paris. </sentence><sentence id="256">It's a big house, I was there. </sentence><sentence id="257">Uh, and uh they just took it over. </sentence><sentence id="258">And he lived there for a number of years, until his business went bad and he had to give it up. </sentence><sentence id="259">Uh I think that's the story. </sentence><sentence id="260">I mean, I...to the best of my ability. </sentence><sentence id="261">TECHNICAL CONVERSATION </sentence></p></dialogue>
