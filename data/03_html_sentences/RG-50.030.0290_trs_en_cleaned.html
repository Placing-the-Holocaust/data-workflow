<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="99">Q: Were you religious? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="101">A: No. </sentence><sentence id="102">Well of course we were kosher in the house. </sentence><sentence id="103">I wouldn't say we were ultra religious, but we were kosher at home, and we celebrated the high holidays and Hanukkah and Passover and traditional, I would call it. </sentence><sentence id="104">Then, of course, when the Russians came into Lithuania, we were kind of on pins and needles, because my father was a businessman. </sentence><sentence id="105">He was afraid they were going to send us to Siberia. </sentence><sentence id="106">So, he started planning on how we should get out of Lithuania. </sentence><sentence id="107">It wasn't easy, actually, for people who are more or less established to just throw away everything and pick up the family and leave. </sentence><sentence id="108">That was in 1939, and at that time, we had relatives in Germany, and one time they sent us a letter asking us to help them, because they had this store. </sentence><sentence id="109">They were store keepers and one day the Germans came in -- that was written in the letter -- the Germans came in, took away the head of the family from the store and told the wife, he's going to be back in a few days. </sentence><sentence id="110">We just want to interrogate him. </sentence><sentence id="111">The next day, two days later, they came back with a little box, which in Lithuania peppercorns came in little boxes, and they came back and handed her the box, put it on the counter and said, "this is your husband." </sentence><sentence id="112">So, this was the letter we received in "39. </sentence><sentence id="113">And of course, my parents tried to help them to leave, and they did arrive in Kovno, but is didn't sound real. </sentence><sentence id="114">It just didn't sound that people could do that to other people. </sentence><sentence id="115">So, my mother definitely felt that something was wrong with her, but my father kind of believed it because there were quite a number of Polish Jews who kept on running away at that time from Poland. </sentence><sentence id="116">So, he started somehow plotting things out how to get out. </sentence><sentence id="117">So, the first thing he did, which he wasn't silly, but he went to to  see his family because he came from Vilna. </sentence><sentence id="118">I'm just digressing because I just wanted to show you what a great man he was in a way. </sentence><sentence id="119">He wasn't actually, he wasn't demonstrative, but he was exceptionally supportive of me. </sentence><sentence id="120">I don't know, but he really was. </sentence><sentence id="121">Before the Russians came in, I had a beautiful coat made for me. </sentence><sentence id="122">It was grey wool, fur collar, a trench coat with a belt, very sharp. </sentence><sentence id="123">So, my father took the coat and said he was going to see his family in Vilna, and he came back and the lining of the coat was removed and behind the lining was all mink -- filled in with mink. </sentence><sentence id="124">He felt that in case something is going to happen to him, I should have something to fall back on, to sell the coat or sell the mink for my mother and my brother and myself. </sentence><sentence id="125">That is the kind of family I grew up. </sentence><sentence id="126">I really and truly feel personally that I cannot, how should I say it, I could not let this four years, or actually three years, actually horrible three years, ruin my life, ruin me for the rest of my life. </sentence><sentence id="127">It was a period where actually the world went mad, and I happened to be caught in between. </sentence><sentence id="128">It could have happened to anybody who was there. </sentence><sentence id="129">That to destroy the rest of my life and to feed my children with experiences of madmen after the war and live in the past, I couldn't do that, because my upbringing was great. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="159">Q: Let me ask you a little bit more about Kovno before the war. </sentence><sentence id="160">Was it a great place to grow up? </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="187">Q: So you didn't have any difficulties? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="189">A: I really didn't, but it turned out worse with the Germans, eventually. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="191">Q: You had a nice life. </sentence><sentence id="192">Did it ever occur to you that that would be taken away? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="195">A: No, no. </sentence><sentence id="196">Not only did it never occur me, but even when I was in concentration camp, I always expected to survive. </sentence><sentence id="197">And I really attributed it to my father. </sentence><sentence id="198">I'm serious, because in retrospect, I mean I thought about it before you came. </sentence><sentence id="199">He really instilled in me a tremendous amount of self assurance and confidence, and if you just do your thing, you'll make it if you want it badly enough. </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="200">Q: Now, you were mentioning that you were starting to get concerned after the Russians came in. </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="201">A: That's right. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="203">Q: What sorts of opportunities were taken away from you at that time? </sentence><sentence id="204">How did your life change? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="207">A: You mean to leave Lithuania? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="209">Q: No, just in Kovno when the Russians were there, were certain things prohibited to you? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="211">Could you continue to practice your religion. </sentence><sentence id="212">Did you still go to school? </sentence><sentence id="213">Was everything basically the same, or did it change? </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="214">A: Well, the first thing that changed was the Russians had a theory that they had to relocate the people. </sentence><sentence id="215">Never to leave the same people in the same area. </sentence><sentence id="216">So, what they did, the first thing they did was to move me from my school to another school where I didn't know anybody. </sentence><sentence id="217">I did know some, but -- and the people from the other school were moved to my school. </sentence><sentence id="218">So, they kind of mixed the whole thing up. </sentence><sentence id="219">And, they also, of course introduced all Russian history and Russian, and we were fed with all the Russian propaganda. </sentence><sentence id="220">I wouldn't say -- the only problem as far as I recall is that we were fearful that any day they'll come and just take us to Siberia because everybody around us, whoever was in business, that's where they wound up. </sentence><sentence id="221">The truck used to come, just like the Germans actually. </sentence><sentence id="222">They had the same system. </sentence><sentence id="223">Without warning, they used to knock at your door and say, "Come, take whatever you can just take with you." </sentence><sentence id="224">Put you on a truck, put you on a train, and send you to Siberia. </sentence><sentence id="225">So, that was our only fear at that time. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="238">Q: Did you know people that were going to Siberia, did you know where they were going? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="240">A: Well, they knew, they knew that's what the Russians are doing. </sentence><sentence id="241">They did have some inclination of what they were doing. </sentence><sentence id="242">The people, especially who are in business, who are employing people. </sentence><sentence id="243">So, that was the only fear which I recall my father had. </sentence><sentence id="244">But, otherwise, and as I said, I got used to being in the new school, and I kept on doing my own thing. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="250">Q: Did you continue to practice Jewish holidays and all? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="252">A: I don't really recall, because we were not that religious that it affected us. </sentence><sentence id="253">Probably the people who were religious it affected them. </sentence><sentence id="254">But I don't recall going to Temple that year for all the high holidays. </sentence><sentence id="255">That's something that is kind of murky in my mind. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="260">Q: Do you remember the first day of the war in Kovno? </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="261">A: Yes, I do, very much so. </sentence><sentence id="262">It was 1941, June 21, 1941. </sentence><sentence id="263">That was a day that I was supposed to go to my school, my original school to pick up my diploma because I had graduated from high school. </sentence><sentence id="264">I had a pair of silk stockings, which I kept for that special occasion, to put on a pair of silk stockings. </sentence><sentence id="265">I walked to school, which was quite a distance, and I picked up my diploma. </sentence><sentence id="266">It was all rolled up with a ribbon, and I walked home, and as I passed where the President of Lithuania lived, suddenly something fell out from an airplane, because they bombed the President's quarters. </sentence><sentence id="267">I fell on the sidewalk. </sentence><sentence id="268">I got up. </sentence><sentence id="269">I wasn't really concerned about the bomb more than that I tore my stockings. </sentence><sentence id="270">I came home, and we knew something was going to happen because we really -- in spite of the fact that we did not want to believe that the Germans are going to come into Lithuania, and we hoped that it would just pass us by, we knew that they are there and we had no choice at that time. </sentence><sentence id="271">We were already caught between the devil and the , </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="272">Q: Can you describe the atmosphere in the street at that point? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="274">A: It was chaotic. </sentence><sentence id="275">It was very, very chaotic. </sentence><sentence id="276">It's very difficult to describe the chaos. </sentence><sentence id="277">People really didn't know what to do, because they were trapped. </sentence><sentence id="278">We were really just trapped. </sentence><sentence id="279">We couldn't do anything. </sentence><sentence id="280">We didn't have weapons. </sentence><sentence id="281">We didn't have anything. </sentence><sentence id="282">We didn't have anybody on our side. </sentence><sentence id="283">It wasn't only the Germans that were against us, it was actually the Lithuanians started before the Germans started. </sentence><sentence id="284">So, they started looting and screaming and yelling and beating us up. </sentence><sentence id="285">So, we didn't know which way to turn. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="298">Q: You saw this and this was just all around? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="300">A: Oh, all around us, all around us, yes. </sentence><sentence id="301">We kept our door locked, and we were lucky that they must have got enough from the people around so they didn't manage to break down our door. </sentence><sentence id="302">They were terrible, unbelievable. </sentence><sentence id="303">It was such like, like I said, I never had any contact with them before, but they turned like animals. </sentence><sentence id="304">It was just neighbors, people who you dealt with. </sentence><sentence id="305">They suddenly -- it was almost like they waited for it, like hungry dogs and so it was rough. </sentence><sentence id="306">It was really rough. </sentence><sentence id="307">You know, I read a book by an author by the name of Bothenheimer (ph). </sentence><sentence id="308">He's a Jew. </sentence><sentence id="309">I'm just telling you a little story about it. </sentence><sentence id="310">I belong to a study group, and in the book it described about a bunch of Jews who believed they were being taken by the Germans to a hotel and that eventually they would be staying there until after the war. </sentence><sentence id="311">I was the only survivor. </sentence><sentence id="312">The rest of the people in the group were Americans. </sentence><sentence id="313">And after reading the book the discussion was going on, how stupid could you be. </sentence><sentence id="314">Couldn't you just stand up against the Germans? </sentence><sentence id="315">Couldn't you just stand up against the Lithuanians? </sentence><sentence id="316">There were so many and there were only three or four soldiers around you. </sentence><sentence id="317">And I was absolutely furious, because it wasn't a matter that we were weak, or that we were like sheep. </sentence><sentence id="318">We had no choice. </sentence><sentence id="319">How can you just protect yourself against a bunch of mad dogs. </sentence><sentence id="320">You just can't do that. </sentence><sentence id="321">I mean people did it, and they were immediately killed in front of you. </sentence><sentence id="322">So you just hoped against hopes that you will make it without making any waves. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="346">Q: Now, in the first few days after the bombs were dropped and the Lithuanians were  running around beating people, can you describe what else was happening? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="348">A: Not really, not really. </sentence><sentence id="349">Just trying to figure out what's going to be next, and we were at home most of the time. </sentence><sentence id="350">We wouldn't dare walk out of the house until they came around with those loud speakers directing us what to do. </sentence><sentence id="351">But we packed. </sentence><sentence id="352">We packed mostly silver and mostly valuable things because, you know, in spite of the fact that we hadn't experienced things like that since almost 1924, for I'd say almost 20 years or so, or less than that, we lived a relative normal life. </sentence><sentence id="353">Really, a normal life, but when something happens to you you kind of know it's the survival of the fittest. </sentence><sentence id="354">You kind of know what to do. </sentence><sentence id="355">And you start thinking, you don't need a pillow, you don't need extra clothes, you need something that you can trade eventually. </sentence><sentence id="356">So, we took the silver and some of the jewelry, which my mother had and every upper middle class family had something, because there was no stainless steel and there was no other kind of this stuff which is sold here now, so whatever you had was kind of silver or gold. </sentence><sentence id="357">It was not synthetic. </sentence><sentence id="358">And we knew that the farmers outside in the country will be glad to acquire it, to exchange. </sentence><sentence id="359">Not that we ever experienced it before, but like I said, it's something that you just know. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="372">Q: Now, I know a lot of people were herded up, right away taken outside of the city and killed. </sentence><sentence id="373">Was this something that you were aware of at the time? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="376">A: No, no I found out later on. </sentence><sentence id="377">Like I said, we were just lucky. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="380">Q: Did you have any contact with the Jewish part of the city, Slobotka (ph), at this point, or were you separated? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="382">A: No, no. </sentence><sentence id="383">We did not live -- we lived in Kovno. </sentence><sentence id="384">Actually we lived behind the Post Office. </sentence><sentence id="385">There was the front of the Post Office and behind was the interior where they had buildings. </sentence><sentence id="386">We lived in one of the apartment buildings behind the Post Office. </sentence><sentence id="387">So, maybe that's why, now that I'm thinking about it, maybe they just didn't want to destroy the Post Office. </sentence><sentence id="388">They thought maybe the Post Office not too many Jews live. </sentence><sentence id="389">I don't know, but we were not bothered. </sentence><sentence id="390">We just waited to hear what the next step would be. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="400">Q: It was several weeks, and then did you have to move from where you were living? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="402">A: Yes. </sentence><sentence id="403">Then we were told that we had to go to the Ghetto because they were going to have a separate place, a Ghetto, for the Jews. </sentence><sentence id="404">All they kept on yelling was and we took whatever we could. </sentence><sentence id="405">Now, I don't remember how we got there. </sentence><sentence id="406">I totally forget. </sentence><sentence id="407">I mean I remember so many details, but this is one thing that I just do not remember how we got there. </sentence><sentence id="408">I know we didn't walk. </sentence><sentence id="409">It was quite a distance, and I know that we had quite a lot of stuff by the time we came to the Ghetto, so maybe Father arranged -- I can't really -- it's blank. </sentence><sentence id="410">All I know is that we wound up in a small apartment, which was called at that time the Small Ghetto and which was actually this is where most of the Jews were brought in that particular part of the town. </sentence><sentence id="411">And then after a short period of time, they started coming in and asking for silver and whatever you have, all your valuables, the  ones who brought there, and I remember my parents handing over a box of something with stuff. </sentence><sentence id="412">They saved some of the other ones and then after that there was the big which was called, they decided to shrink, that was their method to shrink up the area, and we were told to come out on the field, four in a row. </sentence><sentence id="413">Actually eight in a row. </sentence><sentence id="414">We started out, and my best friend and her brother and her father and mother were in the same row with the four of us, and they were the other four. </sentence><sentence id="415">And they said, everybody eight in a row and just walk. </sentence><sentence id="416">And the Germans, young, absolutely young faces, must be 18 or 19, inconceivable how you can motivate young people to be so cruel. </sentence><sentence id="417">They just walked and they separated in half, four and four, and they send my friend and her family on one side and my father and mother and brother on the other side. </sentence><sentence id="418">We didn't know what happened. </sentence><sentence id="419">It turned out that her side was the bad side, and these people from that particular side never came back. </sentence><sentence id="420">They were taken and they were killed. </sentence><sentence id="421">Now, all I can contribute it to is luck. </sentence><sentence id="422">She certainly -- I wasn't certainly better than she was and her family. </sentence><sentence id="423">We were both the same people and so, I'm here probably because I was just lucky. </sentence><sentence id="424">So, when they shrunk it, when they eliminated almost half of the population, we had to move to another area in the Ghetto. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="449">Q: This was when, do you remember? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="451">A: This was only 1941. </sentence><sentence id="452">It was quite early. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="455">Q: Soon after the Ghetto was formed? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="457">A: Yes, yes, because at the same time they also called out, they asked for 500 people who are, I mean, personalties, who speak German, who are educated, who are so on and so forth. </sentence><sentence id="458">They had names and these people who were actually dealing with Germany for years, my father almost went because he represented a Germany company too in 1932, and who were professional people. </sentence><sentence id="459">They all went, hoping that they would be able to do something to negotiate with the Germans or influence them. </sentence><sentence id="460">They were called out, and they were killed. </sentence><sentence id="461">This was known as the 500, the top, the cream really of the Jewish population. </sentence><sentence id="462">So, that was all in the same period of time, and they were trying somehow, in retrospect that's the only way I can understand, to kind of shrink the population. </sentence><sentence id="463">End of Tape #1  Tape #2 </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="471">Q: Now this action that you were talking about where 500 people were taken away, this was in the beginning days of the Ghetto? </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="541">A: That's the only one. </sentence><sentence id="542">I was waiting most of the time, and then, of course, I was taken to the farm, a farm. </sentence><sentence id="543">The Germans needed, for what reason I don't know, a group of young women to take on a farm to apparently pick vegetables or plant vegetables on the farm. </sentence><sentence id="544">They dragged me out of this group, and we found ourselves on this farm. </sentence><sentence id="545">I got up in the morning and walked out on the farm and a German came galloping on a horse, a nice big horse with a saddle, and he looked at all of us. </sentence><sentence id="546">We were about 18, 20 women approximately and he picked me and he said to me "Have you ever ridden a horse?" </sentence><sentence id="547">I said no. </sentence><sentence id="548">He said, "Good, it's time to learn." </sentence><sentence id="549">So he got off the horse, and he removed the saddle, and he made me get up on the horse, and he must have talked to the horse or did something to him because the horse started running like a madman, and I thought to myself, you're not going to lose me off that horse, and I made it. </sentence><sentence id="550">Then I finally came down, he said, "Now you learn, now you can pick vegetables." </sentence><sentence id="551">So, I was there for a couple of days, and then I was lucky enough, because I don't think they came back. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="563">Q: Why did he ask you to do that? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="565">A: It was fun for them. </sentence><sentence id="566">I mean, can you imagine a young woman going on a bare back horse who has never ridden a horse, and a wild one. </sentence><sentence id="567">You know what it means to holding onto the horse, not to fall off and break your neck, because that was what he was probably hoping. </sentence><sentence id="568">Who knows, they were mad. </sentence><sentence id="569">They were creatures from hell. </sentence><sentence id="570">They were absolutely mad. </sentence><sentence id="571">I don't think they looked at us as humans and that was exactly what I decided at one time. </sentence><sentence id="572">They didn't look at us as humans. </sentence><sentence id="573">I never looked at them as humans, and I'll just try plain and simple to survive because you couldn't look them in the eye. </sentence><sentence id="574">I know a young woman looked them in the eye. </sentence><sentence id="575">They slapped her to death. </sentence><sentence id="576">They couldn't touch us, thank goodness, because they were told they would be poisoned. </sentence><sentence id="577">Otherwise they would have raped every single one of us. </sentence><sentence id="578">We were 18 year old kids. </sentence><sentence id="579">That's what they did. </sentence><sentence id="580">They did all kind of things for recreation. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="597">Q: Tell me a little bit more of what life was like in the Ghetto itself? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="599">A: Well, life went on when it was quiet, kind of normal in a way. </sentence><sentence id="600">We met, we kissed, we drank, we had fun when we had the opportunity. </sentence><sentence id="601">The young ones, we really tried to live as normal a life as you could. </sentence><sentence id="602">You're talking about people who are 18 or 19 years old. </sentence><sentence id="603">We have no responsibilities, we have no children. </sentence><sentence id="604">We have no family. </sentence><sentence id="605">Now, my mother had a stroke. </sentence><sentence id="606">I mean she just, as a matter of fact, her brother was killed, and then they had the children here, and they made my aunt take her child to be killed. </sentence><sentence id="607">She saw her child being killed, being put on a car, on a truck and I think -- I don't know, I heard gasoline. </sentence><sentence id="608">I don't know. </sentence><sentence id="609">When my aunt came back, she was mad for a short period of time, and my mother  had a stroke. </sentence><sentence id="610">But she survived, and she was pretty good and that's thanks to my brother. </sentence><sentence id="611">He really came through. </sentence><sentence id="612">He was three years younger than I was, but he was a very smart determined young boy. </sentence><sentence id="613">First of all, he was tall. </sentence><sentence id="614">He was blond and didn't look Jewish at all and that was in his favor because every time he used to go to work, he used to just leave the place and go to Lithuanians, whom he knew, and traded some silver or whatever my mother gave him. </sentence><sentence id="615">My mother used to give him a piece of silverware at a time so they would wait for the next piece. </sentence><sentence id="616">He really supported the family. </sentence><sentence id="617">When my mother had her stroke, I was married then already, so when my mother had the stroke, he was really there for her, and he brought her everything, and he brought her to the point where she could walk and talk. </sentence><sentence id="618">So, you ask me how was life, if you asked me or all my friends, it's different. </sentence><sentence id="619">Because you know youth, we'll overcome. </sentence><sentence id="620">You cannot help it, so we'll do it. </sentence><sentence id="621">It's careless, I don't think it was an adventure because it was probably miserable because this one is gone and that one is gone. </sentence><sentence id="622">The whole thing was kind of scary, and the guys also, they are afraid they were going to die tomorrow, let's have fun. </sentence><sentence id="623">For young people it was bad, but not as bad as for my parents. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="649">Q: Were there cultural activities, political activities? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="651">A: No, no. </sentence><sentence id="652">No cultural activities, no political activities, you just try to live from day to day and work, and if you have a chance to have some fun, get married because you were safer. </sentence><sentence id="653">I think we got married after that incident on the farm because I wouldn't say it was safer to be married. </sentence><sentence id="654">I mean, I liked my husband and he liked me and he asked my father for my hand and my father said by all means if anybody will take care of you, he's the one who will, and my father was absolutely right. </sentence><sentence id="655">So, we got married. </sentence><sentence id="656">Not that it mattered much eventually, because they separated us eventually. </sentence><sentence id="657">But everybody felt that if you were married you were kind of safer. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="967">A: That's right, but we didn't. </sentence><sentence id="968">We tried -- there was nothing we could do because the people outside were not willing to help. </sentence><sentence id="969">So, as I said, we were cornered. </sentence><sentence id="970">We couldn't do anything about it. </sentence><sentence id="971">The underground -- there were all kinds of rumors going around. </sentence><sentence id="972">We just hoped that the Russians were going to come back soon. </sentence><sentence id="973">I mean on the radios they kept on saying  the Germans are running for their lives, and they were already by then, so we were hoping they were just going to leave us alone while they were going to retreat. </sentence><sentence id="974">But they decided to take us with them, and that is when the two of us decided maybe we should build a bunker for the two us, because the bunkers which some of the people built, were sophisticated bunkers which were under the ground. </sentence><sentence id="975">It took them quite a while to dig. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="976">When we came to ask if they would let us in, they said it was filled up. </sentence><sentence id="977">There is no more room. </sentence><sentence id="978">So, we decided to do something on our own. </sentence><sentence id="979">So we decided to dig a hole for ourselves because they kept on saying the Russians are at our doorstep. </sentence><sentence id="980">They are going to enter Lithuania any day. </sentence><sentence id="981">So, the two of us worked through the night, and we dug a nice hole in the yard, and we put a large pitcher of water and some crackers, and we made a seat for ourselves down there, and we covered up the hole with a green pillow to make sure it kind of blends in with the landscaping. </sentence><sentence id="982">And then the next day or two days later, the Germans were rounding up the Jews to take them -- don't worry, wherever we take you is going to be better than here. </sentence><sentence id="983">So, we got into our hole, and we covered it very gingerly. </sentence><sentence id="984">We put the pillow on top of it to make sure that some of the leaves and branches could cover the pillow. </sentence><sentence id="985">We sat down, the two of us, and we figured we would last for a couple of days. </sentence><sentence id="986">There was enough air and water. </sentence><sentence id="987">The next thing we heard were people walking, making noise, Germans. </sentence><sentence id="988">They yelled, "look here, look there, there must be somebody here because there is a house and it looks like the door is open." </sentence><sentence id="989">And suddenly we had a boot coming in. </sentence><sentence id="990">One of the Germans stepped their foot on the pillow, and they started screaming, "come on out of there," and suddenly a rifle was put into the hole, and I came out absolutely muddy, dirty, and my husband came out absolutely muddy dirty, and luckily I have to say they were Austrians. </sentence><sentence id="991">Not that they are much -- not that I understand, I'm not sure, but one of them was an older man. </sentence><sentence id="992">He must have been 40, he said, "how many more are there?" </sentence><sentence id="993">I said, "just the two of us." </sentence><sentence id="994">He became hysterical, it struck him so funny. " </sentence><sentence id="995">Why should you want to stay here and be dirty and filthy. </sentence><sentence id="996">Go get washed and we'll take you to a nice place in Germany." </sentence><sentence id="997">That is how we were actually saved, because when the Germans left, they completely destroyed the Ghetto by fire and by bombing it and by all kinds of things. </sentence><sentence id="998">So, the people who were in the sophisticated bunkers, they choked to death. </sentence><sentence id="999">We definitely wouldn't have made it. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="1000"> End of Tape #2  Tape #3 </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1001">A: When you work outside of the Ghetto, you have an opportunity to bring in some more food, because the food was limited in the Ghetto. </sentence><sentence id="1002">So, therefore, one of us, when I didn't want to work , I didn't have access to anything. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1005">Q: Do you remember there being any kind of qualitative change when the Ghetto became a concentration camp? </sentence><sentence id="1006">How that came about? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1009">A: Excuse me, the Ghetto did not become a concentration camp. </sentence><sentence id="1010">The concentration camp was in Germany. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1013">Q: I thought that Kovno they enclosed, and they called it an official concentration camp a little bit later on before the liquidation. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1021">Q: I don't know, the history books, the Germans. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1023">A: It was a Ghetto. </sentence><sentence id="1024">We refer to concentration camp in Germany, but basically it was different. </sentence><sentence id="1025">Here we just lived in our homes. </sentence><sentence id="1026">We had homes in Ghetto, despite of the fact that they came around every so often to eliminate a number of population. </sentence><sentence id="1027">But in concentration camp, we were completely under their mercy. </sentence><sentence id="1028">You lived in their quarters. </sentence><sentence id="1029">You got up in the morning, and you were given a little pail with some sort of a spoon, and you got a cup of water. </sentence><sentence id="1030">So, it could be called concentration camp, I don't recall. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1039">Q: So, were there any other events that really strike you while you were still in the Ghetto? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1041">A: No, not really. </sentence><sentence id="1042">This was the worst that could happen. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1045">Q: Towards the end, when they were trying to liquidate the Ghetto, I guess, what happened to you? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="1047"> A Like I said, this is when we hid in the woods in our bunker, and they took us to where everybody was there. </sentence><sentence id="1048">That is where I met my mother, and father and brother, because they were already in that large area where they were going to take everybody to Germany or to Poland. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1051">Q: Where was this? </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1052">A: This was in Ghetto. </sentence><sentence id="1053">In Ghetto there was a large building which it, how should I call it -- they gathered everybody up there, and after they emptied out the Ghetto, they went from home to home, told everybody to go. </sentence><sentence id="1054">The streets were full of people, I mean the handful of people that were left. </sentence><sentence id="1055">I don't know numbers. </sentence><sentence id="1056">And we all went except for us, the two us. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="1062">We were the last, actually. </sentence><sentence id="1063">Most of the people were gathered up already for the last two days while we were busy trying to save ourselves. </sentence><sentence id="1064">So, there was a large building and that is where they distributed old people in separate rooms, groups of them, and then took them outside the Ghetto. </sentence><sentence id="1065">And then my husband and I, the two of us, were brought to this place. </sentence><sentence id="1066">Lucky enough, I found my mother and father, and Ralph found his brother and sister-in-law. </sentence><sentence id="1067">So, we all stuck together, and then the Germans -- it was like a parade -- they opened up the doors and said "Now walk." </sentence><sentence id="1068">And we walked out from the Ghetto to go to the trains where they took us to Germany because the Russians were chasing them. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1076">Q: Did you take anything with you? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1078">A: Yes, that is what I wanted to say. </sentence><sentence id="1079">Yes, you could take something with you, and I had my coat which my father -- I had my coat with me which my father made for me, I mean filled the lining up with mink skins. </sentence><sentence id="1080">And we walked through the street, and as my brother walked out, removed his sign, his yellow star, and walked out and disappeared. </sentence><sentence id="1081">And eventually we came to these trains, the cattle trains. </sentence><sentence id="1082">And we got on the train, all of us, the whole family, and they brought us to Stutthof. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1088">Q: Before we get to Stutthof, I want to understand a little bit what the train was like, how many people were on it what that train ride was like? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1090">A: There were many people, like sardines. </sentence><sentence id="1091">Everybody was pushed together. </sentence><sentence id="1092">One woman was mad there. </sentence><sentence id="1093">She was outrageous. </sentence><sentence id="1094">And of course, everybody eliminated there. </sentence><sentence id="1095">It was very very bad. </sentence><sentence id="1096">It was very bad. </sentence><sentence id="1097">It was terrible. </sentence><sentence id="1098">How can I describe it to you. </sentence><sentence id="1099">It was hell. </sentence><sentence id="1100">And I was wearing my warm coat, wouldn't let go of it. </sentence><sentence id="1101">And as we came to Stutthof, they told the women to get out, and they said we don't need you. </sentence><sentence id="1102">You'll meet up with your husbands and fathers later on. </sentence><sentence id="1103">So, my sister-in-law, the two of us got of the train, and I think, I'm not sure if they had transportation -- I think they had open trucks where we were piled in, and we were brought to Stutthof. </sentence><sentence id="1104">And then we were told, of course, right away my coat was taken way, and whatever else I had, which was very little, I suppose, because I didn't have a chance to take anything with me. </sentence><sentence id="1105">I held on to my mother, and then they told us to disrobe. </sentence><sentence id="1106">You know, they had all these tables and young Germans sitting behind it. </sentence><sentence id="1107">And they said to us, "Okay, go into this large area and disrobe." </sentence><sentence id="1108">I mean by disrobe take everything off. </sentence><sentence id="1109">So, here I am next to my mother, hundreds of women, and we had to be totally naked coming in in front of a desk with a bunch of young hoodlums. </sentence><sentence id="1110">So, what do you think in a case like that. </sentence><sentence id="1111">They are creatures from another planet. </sentence><sentence id="1112">There was no planet then, but creatures from hell. </sentence><sentence id="1113">Why should I bother worrying about them, whether they look at me. </sentence><sentence id="1114">How demeaning can you even feel standing with your mother and relatives and families --my sister-in-law -- and here you're standing totally naked, and they look at you. </sentence><sentence id="1115">So, I just stood there, and they just looked at us, and they told us to  go in the back to take showers, and they gave us the uniforms, the striped uniforms, and this is how our ordeal started. </sentence><sentence id="1116">This is concentration camp. </sentence><sentence id="1117">Then they put us in those bunks which you have in the museum, it's exactly how the museum has it, in those bunks, and I don't know how long I was there, but it was awful. </sentence><sentence id="1118">It was totally terrible, because mothers were taking the food of their children, not children, there were no small children. </sentence><sentence id="1119">Daughters were eating up the food. </sentence><sentence id="1120">I mean people were destroying each other. </sentence><sentence id="1121">That was actually their idea. </sentence><sentence id="1122">Whoever was weak and who could not overcome really were taking advantage of their own kind. </sentence><sentence id="1123">Anyway, I was holding on to my mother as long as I could, and then one day they told us to come out in one of those areas which is similar to fairground, except there was no fair, for them it must have been a fair, and they did the same kind of system. </sentence><sentence id="1124">We were walking, and I was holding onto my mother, and she walked pretty well, and she looked pretty good, and they took her away from me. </sentence><sentence id="1125">They pushed me on one side, and they pulled my mother on the other side. </sentence><sentence id="1126">I ran to my mother, and I was beat up pretty badly, and I was pushed away. </sentence><sentence id="1127">That's the last I saw her. </sentence><sentence id="1128">Then we were put into open cars, trucks, my sister-in-law and myself, and we were taken to some sort of a -- </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1168">Q: I need you to say that sentence again. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1170">A: We were put into open trucks, always open trucks. </sentence><sentence id="1171">This is why for the life of me I cannot understand how everybody around there didn't know what was happening. </sentence><sentence id="1172">They always saw us. </sentence><sentence id="1173">The farmers around us, the people around us, they always saw it. </sentence><sentence id="1174">And the Germans were showing off or whatever, and they were taking us to an area where they divided us into groups. </sentence><sentence id="1175">And there I was with my sister-in-law, and a very young woman about my age, walked over to me and she said, "Do you mind if I join you because everybody was taken away from me." </sentence><sentence id="1176">I said sure, why don't you join us. </sentence><sentence id="1177">And then about after a half an hour or so, because we had to wait to be distributed wherever they were going to send us, two other woman came over, both of them actually were nurses, a little bit older. </sentence><sentence id="1178">And they said,"You look like three nice woman, do you think we can join your group so we can stick together." </sentence><sentence id="1179">So, we spent the rest of our time together actually. </sentence><sentence id="1180">So, then they put us again in one of these open trucks, and took us to work in the fields, to build ditches for -- what do you call those things -- I can't think of the name at the moment, but it will come to me. </sentence><sentence id="1181">So what they did is they housed us in tents, in regular tents, as you see here. </sentence><sentence id="1182">They housed about 50 women, and in the middle of the tent was a little stove, one of those wood burning stoves, and they gave us a space on straw which this is -- so the five of us plopped down together in one corner, and we stuck together the five of us. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1196">Q: Where were they from? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1198">A: All of them from Kaunas, and we really stuck together, really stuck it out. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1200">Q: Were most of the other prisoners from Lithuania? </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1201">A: Lithuania, yes. </sentence><sentence id="1202">This was -- you see we were the last ones to be taken out of eastern Europe, so basically Stutthof was the political concentration camp. </sentence><sentence id="1203">So, probably it was just so late in the game that they didn't take us any other place. </sentence><sentence id="1204">So there were some gentiles in Stutthof. </sentence><sentence id="1205">So, we were taken there in one of the areas, which was kind of in the woods, it was mostly in the woods, where we were digging ditches -- trenches, that is what it is, trenches. </sentence><sentence id="1206">We dug very deep trenches, and that is really where the labor was hard, because they stood over you and made sure that you don't even take a breather. </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1207">Q: And if you did? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1209">A: Oh, they hit you. </sentence><sentence id="1210">They really hit you without any mercy. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1213">Q: Were you hit? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1215">A: I was never hit, because I worked. </sentence><sentence id="1216">I told you I just decided at one time, especially when I was standing there naked, that these are devils from some place, and I'm going to look at them as such. </sentence><sentence id="1217">So, this was my -- I brainwashed myself. </sentence><sentence id="1218">I figured they are not going to bring me down to their level. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1223">Q: So you didn't stay in the camp of Stutthof that long? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1225">A: Exactly. </sentence><sentence id="1226">Stutthof, I think they kept -- I was there I would say about three days, approximately. </sentence><sentence id="1227">It wasn't long, or maybe a week. </sentence><sentence id="1228">I mean time -- I cannot tell you time. </sentence><sentence id="1229">It was one thing I didn't think about. </sentence><sentence id="1230">But it wasn't long, because I didn't work there. </sentence><sentence id="1231">We didn't work there, but the rumors were that they were going to sterilize us all. </sentence><sentence id="1232">And we were lucky to get out of there. </sentence><sentence id="1233">Unfortunately, I couldn't get my mother out. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1243">Q: Were there any children there? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1245">A: No, but they wanted to sterilize us, because you know women, period. </sentence><sentence id="1246">I mean, we didn't have our period. </sentence><sentence id="1247">Thank God there was something in heaven, somebody was watching over us. </sentence><sentence id="1248">We didn't for two years, but the rumors were flying around that they were going to sterilize all the young women. </sentence><sentence id="1249">So, when we finally got into the woods, got up every morning and got our soup and went to work, and we dug those deep ditches, and then it was winter. </sentence><sentence id="1250">And it was cold, and I used to break up the ice when I went in. </sentence><sentence id="1251">There was a break once in a while, and get into the ice and wash myself because the biggest killer almost, and demoralizer, was the filth. </sentence><sentence id="1252">The filth, the stench and the lice, and the five of us decided we were going to try to eliminate it by hook or by crook, because the people around us were unbelievable. </sentence><sentence id="1253">Especially older people, also many young ones that gave up. </sentence><sentence id="1254">They just didn't care. </sentence><sentence id="1255">That was the biggest destruction, the filth, and this is what we -- two things we promised ourselves. </sentence><sentence id="1256">We were going to keep our feet covered, and winter was coming, and the snow and as soon as you got sick this was the end of you. </sentence><sentence id="1257">They did not tolerate anybody being sick. </sentence><sentence id="1258">So, they watched how to kind of decrease the population there. </sentence><sentence id="1259">So, when somebody woke up sick, if you went to the infirmary, chances are you'd  never come back, or if you were too filthy. </sentence><sentence id="1260">We decided we are going to keep clean, and we did. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1277">Q: How? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1279">A: As I said, we broke up ice, got into the water and washed ourselves, and at night we used to dry our underwear on the pipe of the woodburning little thing. </sentence><sentence id="1280">I think we were the only ones who did that. </sentence><sentence id="1281">And then, I was the brave one, I used to run out in the middle of the night, when the soldiers were kind of resting or not expecting any kind of movement. </sentence><sentence id="1282">I used to run out to -- if we were -- we were continuously being moved from one area to another because we finished one to dig those trenches in another area, then we were moved to another area. </sentence><sentence id="1283">And you could see homes not too far away from us. </sentence><sentence id="1284">I used to run out and go to the farmers. </sentence><sentence id="1285">They used to give me some bread. </sentence><sentence id="1286">At first I used to fill myself up with as much food as I possibly could, and then they used to give us loaves of bread, and I used to bring the bread to my four buddies. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1295">Q: You could just sneak out? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1297">A: You couldn't. </sentence><sentence id="1298">It was a fence, but it was a tent. </sentence><sentence id="1299">There was a large tent, a very primitive kind of a tent and around they had the very primitive kind of wires, which they were not concerned about anybody going to run away. </sentence><sentence id="1300">Where would you run, 50 women or whatever. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1305">Q: And the guards were sleeping? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1307">A: It was -- they could have shot me, I'm sure, but as I said, I was a little bit of a daredevil I suppose. </sentence><sentence id="1308">I didn't do it too often, but I tried it quite a few times. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1311">Q: And the farmers were--? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1313">A: Yes. </sentence><sentence id="1314">They give you a piece of bread and tell you get out of here. </sentence><sentence id="1315">They were terrified you shouldn't stay long, that you shouldn't be caught--they shouldn't be caught, not I shouldn't be caught. </sentence><sentence id="1316">But they knew, they knew they were willing to give you bread and feed you. </sentence><sentence id="1317">I never had any problems. </sentence><sentence id="1318">I stopped quite a number of them, maybe four. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1325">Q: They knew what was happening? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1327">A: Of course they knew what was happening. </sentence><sentence id="1328">You had to be absolutely blind or live someplace, I don't know. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1331">Q: Who were your guards? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1333">A: Pardon? </sentence></p><p><sentence id="1334"> Q; Where were your guards from, what nationality? </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1335">A: Oh my God, Germans. </sentence><sentence id="1336">You never talked to them. </sentence><sentence id="1337">You didn't even look them in the eye. </sentence><sentence id="1338">You look them in the eye you get beat up. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1343">Q: Did you have a like a block elder or somebody just in charge of your tent? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1345">A: No. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1347">Q: You didn't have that much --? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1349">A: No, no because we were mobile. </sentence><sentence id="1350">They kept on moving us. </sentence><sentence id="1351">We just kept our nose clean and worked, and that's about it. </sentence><sentence id="1352">So the only time I was beat up was when I wanted my mother back. </sentence><sentence id="1353">After that, I just figured I'm not going to mess around with them. </sentence><sentence id="1354">I'm going to try to stay alive. </sentence><sentence id="1355">And then the end came when they decided to take us on the "death march." </sentence><sentence id="1356">And they knew, rumors started flying around that the Germans are retreating. </sentence><sentence id="1357">The Russians are going to destroy them, so they decided to take us with them. </sentence><sentence id="1358">To this day, I cannot understand why. </sentence><sentence id="1359">I would really like to know what their -- they didn't have any reason for anything. </sentence><sentence id="1360">They just did what they were told. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1373">Q: Did you know that's why they were moving you? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1375">A: Of course, absolutely we knew. </sentence><sentence id="1376">And we started the "death march", it's called now. </sentence><sentence id="1377">It wasn't called then, because we didn't even think about it. </sentence><sentence id="1378">And they started taking us from village to village. </sentence><sentence id="1379">We stopped in a bar at every village, and they kept on losing people on the way, especially people who didn't have shoes. </sentence><sentence id="1380">And I happened to have a good pair of shoes. </sentence><sentence id="1381">Before, this was the most terrible experience of my life -- one of the most terrible experiences of my life. </sentence><sentence id="1382">Before we were taken on this death march, they delivered a truck with shoes. </sentence><sentence id="1383">Somehow, luckily some German threw me a pair of good shoes. </sentence><sentence id="1384">I don't know if he meant me or he meant somebody else, but I grabbed it, and I had a good pair of shoes. </sentence><sentence id="1385">And I could see people that we lose are the ones who freeze their feet. </sentence><sentence id="1386">It was cold. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="1387">It was winter. </sentence><sentence id="1388">It was in March or February, February I think, the end of February. </sentence><sentence id="1389">And we kept on losing them. </sentence><sentence id="1390">We came to a barn. </sentence><sentence id="1391">In the morning they used to wake us up, and we walked again. </sentence><sentence id="1392">They stopped in villages, the names that I happen to have, and one day one of the women who were part of my group said to me, "Why don't I try to go out and see," -- it was after the third village -- "to see if I can get some bread for us. </sentence><sentence id="1393">You always are the one who has been supplying us with some extra food. </sentence><sentence id="1394">Let me try, except my shoes are very bad. </sentence><sentence id="1395">Why don't you lend me your shoes and I'll leave you mine," which were smaller. </sentence><sentence id="1396">She had a smaller foot that I did. </sentence><sentence id="1397">She left. </sentence><sentence id="1398">She never came back. </sentence><sentence id="1399">And I got up in the morning when I had to leave, and I looked at her shoes and I said, I'm not going. </sentence><sentence id="1400">And my friends say yes you are. </sentence><sentence id="1401">And I said I'm not going to die like a dog on the street. </sentence><sentence id="1402">Let them shoot me here. </sentence><sentence id="1403">I'm just not going because I knew this was going to be the end. </sentence><sentence id="1404">You don't walk out barefoot. </sentence><sentence id="1405">Now, I just want to tell you about human nature. </sentence><sentence id="1406">In the one of the tents where we were, there was a woman who was a loud mouth and a very disliked person, but she always seemed to be able to get more than anybody else. </sentence><sentence id="1407">One of those,  you know, and everybody kind of stayed away from her because she yelled at everybody. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="1408">She was rude, she was common -- I don't even want to call her that. </sentence><sentence id="1409">She was a very disliked individual. </sentence><sentence id="1410">And I'm standing there with my three buddies, and I said to them I'm not going. </sentence><sentence id="1411">She appears from no where, and she said to me, "I have a pair of shoes for you. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="1412">I have an extra pair for myself." </sentence><sentence id="1413">She handed me a pair of shoes. </sentence><sentence id="1414">She saved my life. </sentence><sentence id="1415">I don't know what happened to her. </sentence><sentence id="1416">I've been looking for her for many years. </sentence><sentence id="1417">I never spoke to her. </sentence><sentence id="1418">I never exchanged a word with her through the months that we worked together. </sentence><sentence id="1419">But she saved my life. </sentence><sentence id="1420">I put on my shoes, and I kept on walking. </sentence><sentence id="1421">Eventually we wound up in the , which was the last village of this "death march." </sentence><sentence id="1422">By then they knew, the Germans knew that they had lost the war and that the Russians were on their tail. </sentence><sentence id="1423">They put us in a barn and that was really -- that was real hell because everybody was dying. </sentence><sentence id="1424">I wouldn't be surprised that 85 percent of the people died there because the diarrhea and the stench and the frozen bodies were unbelievable. </sentence><sentence id="1425">Every place you sat next to a corpse. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="1426">And one of my friends I went to school with, actually she was not in the same area I was, this was kind of a -- they decided to gather all the rest of the area of these people in </sentence></p><p><sentence id="1427"> . </sentence><sentence id="1428">It was like the last step, and she was in a different camp. </sentence><sentence id="1429">She came over to me and she said, "Henny you are still walking around. </sentence><sentence id="1430">Would you help me bury my mother?" </sentence><sentence id="1431">And I helped her carry out her mother, because the first thing they did was make us dig deep ditches because they knew. </sentence><sentence id="1432">And I dropped the mother on a pile of bones. </sentence><sentence id="1433">And I went back -- I went back to this barn and surrounded by death, except my two friends. </sentence><sentence id="1434">One escaped, two escaped on the way. </sentence><sentence id="1435">The one with the shoes and the other one kind of also, she escaped. </sentence><sentence id="1436">So two of them left, so the three of us, we're still holding on to each other and suddenly we hear voices. </sentence><sentence id="1437">They closed the barn doors, it was like 10:00. </sentence><sentence id="1438">I remember because we were liberated, it as an hour later. </sentence><sentence id="1439">It was 10:00. </sentence><sentence id="1440">They closed all the doors of the barn. </sentence><sentence id="1441">They poured gasoline around, all around, and they were going to burn the whole thing. </sentence><sentence id="1442">The next thing, it was a matter of I don't know -- the next thing, we hear bagging on our barn doors and Russian spoken. </sentence><sentence id="1443">And they opened up the doors, and of course, the ones who could, walked out. </sentence><sentence id="1444">I was one of them. </sentence><sentence id="1445">And my friend, my two friends, immediately ran out, and I don't know, not too many ran out because as I said, I wouldn't be surprised if 15, 20 percent of people made it, were able to walk out. </sentence><sentence id="1446">I mean maybe they carried them out. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="1447"> End of Tape #3  Tape #4 </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1448">A: I don't remember exactly but all I know is that when we were brought in there quite a number of people, but when we left, there were only a handful who could walk out. </sentence><sentence id="1449">So, I ran out. </sentence><sentence id="1450">A Russian grabbed me, and he handed me a rifle and he had our guards, these young shnooks, I think two or three of them or four of them, I think four of them, few, because some of them run away, lined up along the wall. </sentence><sentence id="1451">And he said, shoot them. </sentence><sentence id="1452">He handed me, it was clicked, the whole thing, he said go ahead. </sentence><sentence id="1453">He said do it. </sentence><sentence id="1454">I held the gun in my hand, and I thought to myself, that's ridiculous. </sentence><sentence id="1455">Should I become like them? </sentence><sentence id="1456">And I threw away the rifle, and the Russian he yelled to me in Russian , stupid. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1466">Q: Did other people shoot at the Germans? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1468">A: No, they didn't. </sentence><sentence id="1469">I'm telling you, I was the first one to run out because I walked luckily. </sentence><sentence id="1470">So then they took my two friends, I think one of them could hardly walk, so we dragged her, and they went to the village. </sentence><sentence id="1471">And the village, at that time, was deserted, because all the Germans ran away. </sentence><sentence id="1472">And you could get in any house you wanted to. </sentence><sentence id="1473">So, we found ourselves a house. </sentence><sentence id="1474">The three of us settled in this house. </sentence><sentence id="1475">And the first thing I did, I went to milk a cow. </sentence><sentence id="1476">There was a cow in the back, and the cow kicked me, lucky, and she kicked the whole milk out. </sentence><sentence id="1477">And if that wouldn't have happened, we would have died, because that was the first poison to drink milk or butter or anything of that sort. </sentence><sentence id="1478">So, we opened up the cabinets, and it was Germany there, it was under German occupation, this area. </sentence><sentence id="1479">The cabinet, there was food there called , the things you put in jars for the winter with the rubber seal, and they had all kinds of fruits, so we started with cook fruits, a little bit. </sentence><sentence id="1480">And the next thing my two friends came down with typhoid. </sentence><sentence id="1481">I didn't -- I wasn't very sick, but I was also sick, so I took care of them. </sentence><sentence id="1482">And then the Russians came. </sentence><sentence id="1483">The Russians were in the Army, and they needed women, and they were going from house to house, disregarding anything. </sentence><sentence id="1484">That time we decided we weren't going to let anybody in. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1502">Q: How did you know this was happening? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1504">A: You know, that's a very interesting question. </sentence><sentence id="1505">You know everything. </sentence><sentence id="1506">You really do. </sentence><sentence id="1507">It's an instinct. </sentence><sentence id="1508">It's an instinct you find out. </sentence><sentence id="1509">If your life depends on it or if it's something, you just find out. </sentence><sentence id="1510">Probably somebody knocked on the door and said don't let in the Russians, even if they say they are Jews and they want to help you, because they are like animals. </sentence><sentence id="1511">So, finally somebody came to the door and kept on banging and banging and started speaking Yiddish, "please let me in. </sentence><sentence id="1512">I've been on the front for so many years. </sentence><sentence id="1513">I'm a mess." </sentence><sentence id="1514">I said, "we're all sick with typhoid. </sentence><sentence id="1515">There is no place to sleep." </sentence><sentence id="1516">They did not have any place to sleep. </sentence><sentence id="1517">They didn't have any place because the houses, some of the houses, were taken up by the survivors which weren't many. </sentence><sentence id="1518">And some of them, the Germans still were there. </sentence><sentence id="1519">I don't know, but they said they were exhausted and they had to sleep. </sentence><sentence id="1520">And he kept on speaking Yiddish and I decided I'll take a chance. </sentence><sentence id="1521">So, we let him in, and he happened to be a very nice guy. </sentence><sentence id="1522">And he laid down on the floor and slept. </sentence><sentence id="1523">He was totally exhausted, and he just wanted to help us and see what he could do for us, and in the morning he left. </sentence><sentence id="1524"> And then I took sick, and then the three of us kind of made it, and we decided to keep on going. </sentence><sentence id="1525">Now, I don't know -- the Russians, that's right. </sentence><sentence id="1526">After we got well, they said they were going to take us to . </sentence><sentence id="1527">And from there they were going to send us wherever we want to go. </sentence><sentence id="1528">Since we are from Lithuania, they'll send us back to Lithuania. </sentence><sentence id="1529">And I knew that I wasn't going back to Lithuania ever. </sentence><sentence id="1530">So, we came to , and we worked there all of us. </sentence><sentence id="1531">We actually watched the Germans load ships and boats, and we were actually the drivers. </sentence><sentence id="1532">We were guards. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1562">Q: For the Russians? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1564">A: For the Russians, yes. </sentence><sentence id="1565">And then I decided, I heard rumors again, they were going to send us -- we were five women, they were going to send us back to Russia, not Lithuania. </sentence><sentence id="1566">They'll send us to Russia someplace on one of those farms, and I decided I'm not going there. </sentence><sentence id="1567">So, I took whatever I had, next to nothing, I threw it out of the window. </sentence><sentence id="1568">There was a guard watching the area where the buildings where we were actually housed, Russian stayed there and people who worked for them. </sentence><sentence id="1569">And they had a guard and a gate, and you just had to announce before you go. </sentence><sentence id="1570">There was a curfew there. </sentence><sentence id="1571">You couldn't leave just whenever you felt like it. </sentence><sentence id="1572">But my window faced the outside, so I threw whatever a small bundle out, probably some underwear and whatever, and I just went to the guard, and I told him I'm going to the movies, and he said okay, go ahead. </sentence><sentence id="1573">So, I went. </sentence><sentence id="1574">I picked up my little bundle, and I ran to the train. </sentence><sentence id="1575">And trains were going anyplace, no matter where you wanted to go. </sentence><sentence id="1576">And I really didn't know where I was going to go. </sentence><sentence id="1577">I said I wanted to go west. </sentence><sentence id="1578">And I got on the train, and there were two underground soldiers sitting, and they said they come from Lodz, and they heard that in Lodz there is an organization, an organization was established to find out who survived. </sentence><sentence id="1579">It's like what do you call those centers, where everybody sends their family -- but it's a center for all survivors so they can find people whoever tells them who they were looking for. </sentence><sentence id="1580">There was no mail. </sentence><sentence id="1581">I mean it was really only word by mouth, really. </sentence><sentence id="1582">I said okay, I'll go to Lodz. </sentence><sentence id="1583">So we arrived in Lodz at 6:00 in the morning, and they wanted to take me to a place to sleep over, and I didn't particularly care for that. </sentence><sentence id="1584">So, when I got out of the train, I decided to make it fast, and they yelled, "we fed you with chocolate." </sentence><sentence id="1585">They gave me chocolate, that's true. </sentence><sentence id="1586">And I went away, and I got on a bus at 6:00 in the morning. </sentence><sentence id="1587">My Polish was kind of rusty, so I asked the driver where is the Jewish center, and he said, "I'll take you there." </sentence><sentence id="1588">So, I arrived there, and I walked in there and that was around 7:00, 8:00, and I registered, and I told them I want to work for you and they said okay, go behind there. </sentence><sentence id="1589">So, that is where I wound up. </sentence><sentence id="1590">I was bald then because we were all shaven. </sentence><sentence id="1591">And I was wearing a turban usually. </sentence><sentence id="1592">And then one afternoon when I got through working, I went upstairs in the common area where there are a couple of dozen women are sleeping on the floor in some kind of makeshift sleeping bags, and I removed my turban. </sentence><sentence id="1593">I needed some fresh air, and I walked out in the hall to go over to a friend of mine, and there was my husband. </sentence><sentence id="1594">So, he even met me without my turban. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1626">Q: You must have been stunned. </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1627">A: Yes, that's putting it mildly because I really didn't know what happened to him, and I was going to Israel. </sentence><sentence id="1628">I figured what the heck, I speak the language. </sentence><sentence id="1629">I don't have anybody any other place in the world so I might as well go to Israel. </sentence><sentence id="1630">And they would have sent me awfully quickly because many Lithuania young people in "37 and "38, and I figured I would try a nota , but I will try it, and then I will take it from there. </sentence><sentence id="1631">And then my Prince Charming appeared, and it was fun. </sentence><sentence id="1632">And then we came to this country. </sentence><sentence id="1633">We decided we were going to start our lives all over again. </sentence><sentence id="1634">It's no use living in the past because we had nothing to do with it. </sentence><sentence id="1635">The world had gone mad so what should we do. </sentence><sentence id="1636">It could have happened to anybody. </sentence><sentence id="1637">So we're not going to let that ruin us and bring up our children with complexes. </sentence><sentence id="1638">They probably have other complexes, but certainly we didn't spoon feed them about our experiences and about the world that everybody is terrible, because there are some decent people in the world. </sentence><sentence id="1639">It was just a terrible experience. </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1640">Q: When you do think about this, because even though you want to live in the present, you have to think about this? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1642">A: Well, sure I do. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1644">Q: Are there certain memories that haunt you? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1646">A: Except that time when I knew I was going to die without my shoes. </sentence><sentence id="1647">That's my worst experience in my life -- that's not the worst, but for personal -- I have never felt as close to death as this moment, never. </sentence><sentence id="1648">Because, as I said I always think that things are going to turn out all right. </sentence><sentence id="1649">Everybody calls me Polyanna, but I just hope it eventually will turn out all right. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1654">Q: Let me ask you a strange question. </sentence><sentence id="1655">How did you feel about being Jewish throughout this? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1658">A: I never thought of it. </sentence><sentence id="1659">I never thought specifically about being Jewish, why it happened to me you mean? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1662">Q: Well, I'm wondering did you wish you weren't Jewish? </sentence><sentence id="1663">Did you feel more Jewish than ever? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1666">A: No, no I didn't feel more Jewish than ever. </sentence><sentence id="1667">I'm going to tell you something. </sentence><sentence id="1668">I don't if it has something to do with this. </sentence><sentence id="1669">We have a son, and a daughter and seven grandchildren. </sentence><sentence id="1670">And our son married a catholic young woman from France. </sentence><sentence id="1671">And my friends were telling me -- it was a long time ago 21 years ago -- friends were telling me my god it's terrible. </sentence><sentence id="1672">How can you take it? </sentence><sentence id="1673">How can you live with it? </sentence><sentence id="1674">I went to my rabbi and had a long conversation, and I said, you know intellectually I can understand it. </sentence><sentence id="1675">She's a nice woman. </sentence><sentence id="1676">That's what he wants, what the heck, who am I am? </sentence><sentence id="1677">Emotionally I don't think I can take it but I'll probably take it. </sentence><sentence id="1678">And as the years went on and people asked me I said, you know the more we have on our side, the better off we are. </sentence><sentence id="1679">So, that is my philosophy in life. </sentence><sentence id="1680">The  more people think of Jews as equal people in this world, the more chance we have of not having something like that happen again. </sentence><sentence id="1681">Because he was a madman and all his nation went mad. </sentence><sentence id="1682">I mean these people went mad and the ones -- there are a lot of nice ones there I'm sure. </sentence><sentence id="1683">I'm not going to condemn the whole German population, but the majority of them said they didn't know about it. </sentence><sentence id="1684">How could they not know about it, and how couldn't they foresee it, but I'm not a philosopher to try and figure out. </sentence><sentence id="1685">But it's terrible that people in power can motivate young people to become so unfeeling, so beastly without any remorse, and they can really turn them into terrible human beings, so it shows you. </sentence><sentence id="1686">So, I can't tell you if I felt bad being Jewish or good being Jewish. </sentence><sentence id="1687">I didn't think about it much. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1712">A: I'm glad you are here because I was going to write a book, and I know I'd never get to it. </sentence><sentence id="1713">So, I had very mixed feelings when you said you were going to come here. </sentence><sentence id="1714">I knew I'd have to go through that ordeal, but at least our family and all our grandchildren and great grandchildren and so on and so forth, if they want to know something about us -- although they all asked through the years, the little ones and the big ones, but we always answered them what they asked. </sentence><sentence id="1715">We never gave them more information. </sentence><sentence id="1716">But now at least they can go to the museum and press a button and listen to their grandparents if they want to. </sentence><sentence id="1717">If they don't want to, just let them be nice human beings. </sentence><sentence id="1718">That's all we want them to be, and I thank you for coming. </sentence><sentence id="1719">End of Tape #4 Conclusion of Interview   </sentence></p></dialogue>
