<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="30">A: No, I certainly did not. </sentence><sentence id="31">But I think that's probably true of a non-Holocaust person, too, that you don't really think what you're going to do as an adult, or even the fact that you're going to be grandparents. </sentence><sentence id="32">I mean, that's very old people, and it's very hard to think about. </sentence><sentence id="33">But I spent a lot of wonderful years, when I was in Budapest with my father, going to, not Disneyland, but to playgrounds, and theme parks, in a very small way, that - - with roller coasters, and all that kind of stuff, so I have very fond memories of that. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="38">Q: [inaudible] ... Is having a good time important to you? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="40">A: Well, i -- when you say important, yes it certainly is, I'd rather have a good time than a bad time, you know. </sentence><sentence id="41">Important, I think at this point, health, and having my family remain healthy, and around me, is more important, but yeah, having a good time certainly is important. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="51"> USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0047 4 like a Pollyanna, because everybody was telling not just horror stories, but of how terribly it affected them afterwards. </sentence><sentence id="52">Everybody blamed their misfortune, divorces, and everything else on the Holocaust, and I've -- not a matter of having gotten beyond it, but in many ways I have nice memories of certainly the -- the pre-war years, and my memories of the Holocaust, with all the horror, and being terribly afraid of many things, it was also a nurturing time. </sentence><sentence id="53">I was very conscious of -- of my parents taking care of me, and protecting me. </sentence><sentence id="54">Of providing me with food when there wasn't any to be had. </sentence><sentence id="55">I was a very finicky eater, it was a pain in the neck, you know, providing me with -- with anything I would eat. </sentence><sentence id="56">And during the time that we were hidden, I had a -- a boyfriend who was a year older than I, so we were 10 and 11, and we had a wonderful time. </sentence><sentence id="57">So, I think because my parents protected me, and made up majorly fictional, nonsensical thing in retrospect, but it helped me, I think, come out sort of a healthier person, without any of the post-war trauma that a lot of my friends, who are my contemporaries, still have. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="65">Q: You said they made up a fiction, what do you mean? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="67">A: Did you see the movie, "Life is Beautiful"? </sentence><sentence id="68">The Italian film that won all the awards?A lot of my friends thought the movie fictionalized, and trivialized the Holocaust, and I think you would have had to see the movie to know what I'm talking about, but it's -- when you see the movie, knowing it's about the Holocaust -- when I first went to the movies, for the first 20 minutes I thought I was in the wrong movie, because there was a comedy. </sentence><sentence id="69">It was silly, it was Marcelle Marceau and Chaplin all put into one, before the Holocaust theme takes place. </sentence><sentence id="70">And it was basically about a father protecting his child. </sentence><sentence id="71">I USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0047 5 didn't think it was trivialized at all. </sentence><sentence id="72">I really related to it, because the whole process, in some ways, my parents made up stories that I was able to accept. </sentence><sentence id="73">So I never had their fear, I always had their very positive attitude that my grandmother who had died in the United States, previous to the war, was a butterfly, and every time there was a butterfly flying around, it was my grandmother up there watching out for us. </sentence><sentence id="74">And to this day, you know, butterflies are kind of a meaningful thing. </sentence><sentence id="75">And there was always a positive thing, that things would be okay. </sentence><sentence id="76">So, I never had the fear that my parents had, but they wanted to be sure that I wouldn't, and I guess I didn't. </sentence><sentence id="77">I don't know if that makes any sense. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="91">Q: Sure. </sentence><sentence id="92">I -- Yo-You had said that you previously had been able -- your -- your mother had instructed you that if she said it was black, it was black, and you were not to question. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="95">A: Right. </sentence><sentence id="96">That's absolutely true. </sentence><sentence id="97">That was probably the -- the only time that she spoke to me in very strong language, because I think somebody stopped us on the street, and asked us about our religion, and my mother said we were Catholic, and I kind of pulled at her, and disagreed, and aft-after that, my mother said that at any time, that our lives depended on it, and it's very important that I not question anything she says, and if she says it's one thing, it's -- if it's -- yes, that's absolutely -- that's the truth, but -- no, no, I mean that -- that was -- and I think -- you know, I think the European children are sort of brought up that way, so it wasn't quite as difficult for me to deal with. </sentence><sentence id="98">You know, your -- you speak when you're spoken to, and you don't question a lot, and I don't think today's generation would get away with that. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="99">  USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0047 6 </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="100">Q: Were there other instances where your mother -- where you had to comply with your mother when you knew she was not telling the truth? </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="101">A: I think I -- well, the only other time, and it wasn't a ma -- even a matter of complying, but she -- she stole an egg, and I think I did tell that story in my video, and I remember that very clearly, cause everybody said where did you get the egg, and she said she ran into a farmhouse, and chicken was laying an egg, and she took the egg because she made me a cake, and it needed an egg. </sentence><sentence id="102">A little yellow cake thing, and I -- I asked her about stealing, and I think she sort of -- gee, I don't remember all that well, but I don't think it was a major discussion, but she said that when you're hungry, sometimes -- it was there, she didn't think she was taking it from anybody else, so whatever. </sentence><sentence id="103">I was 10 years old, so I didn't go into it, in major, you know, depth. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="107">Q: Was it primarily your mother then, who shaped you? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="109">A: I think so. </sentence><sentence id="110">My father and I had a wonderful relationship. </sentence><sentence id="111">He was a very quiet and very loving man, very successful in business. </sentence><sentence id="112">My father -- I think the reason for that during the war years, is that by -- my mother did not look Jewish, and I was a little girl, and I -- I don't know what -- what it looks like, but I guess I didn't look obviously Jewish, I had blue eyes, and -- my father definitely looked Jewish. </sentence><sentence id="113">He had a no -- you know, a nose that was more obviously Jewish, and not only that, but what they were doing is -- had men just drop their pants, and that was certainly easy to identify. </sentence><sentence id="114">So, I think my father, during situations where we were questioned, or had to negotiate to stay at someone's house, or were stopped on the street, my father always stayed in the background. </sentence><sentence id="115">In -- You know,   USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0047 7 during -- during the time of hiding, and also my father had a kidney stone problem, so my mother was very protective of his health. </sentence><sentence id="116">During -- Before the hiding, during the -- 01 -- the bombing, the air raids, my mother was in charge of the building, and we went down to the cellar, and all that kind of stuff, so she had more mobility, and was able to accomplish more, we stayed more in the background. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="130">Q: When you were growing up, though, before you were 10, before all of this happened, </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="132"> was he a strong presence? </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="133">A: Oh yes, definitely. </sentence><sentence id="134">Every Sunday we went to the zoo, we went to the playground, we went to the amusement park, and he would come -- I had this huge world map on the closet, or the wall of my room, and every evening after he came home from the office, we would play a game of identifying capitals. </sentence><sentence id="135">Countries all over the world, and eventually rivers, and oceans, and stuff, and it was -- it was a different kind of life than today. </sentence><sentence id="136">The fathers came home at the end of the day, mothers kind of took care of all the bathing and getting you to bed, and all that kind of stuff, but I had a very, very close relationship with my father, and a -- a very loving relationship. </sentence><sentence id="137">In some ways, I think I was probably closer to him. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="199">A: Yellow cake, chocolate cake preferably, but when desperate, Ill eat yellow cake. </sentence><sentence id="200">And I love apricot jam, that was -- that went in it, and one of the other things we used to do, USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0047 9 since food was scarce, we used to have these -- you know these kielbasa, it's like a hot dog, but it's like a salami texture, and it's very long and skinny, and I don't know how we acquired a piece, and my mother would cut one tiny, tiny little wedge, or circle, and cut it up into many, many, many pay -- many pieces, and pretend that that was a sandwich, or a piece of bread with it on. </sentence><sentence id="201">But instead of like eating the whole thing, it was rationed. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="206">Q: You still eat that? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="208">A: Yeah. </sentence><sentence id="209">The only thing that I don't eat, which really was sent to us after the war by my grandfather when they would send us care packages, is Spam. </sentence><sentence id="210">And I had -- We had no clue. </sentence><sentence id="211">They would send us Spam, and they sent nail polish, that they -- we would sell, and I don't know what other food product, but I adored ham, and the Spam had that kind of a taste. </sentence><sentence id="212">And we had, you know, never seen canned products before, so that was my very favorite, and I must tell you, when we came here, and I said Spam, everybody looked at me like thi -- and I always meant to buy Spam, and it's sort of like buying the "Enquirer," you're embarrassed to buy it, but you look at -- over somebody's shoulder at the checkout counter. </sentence><sentence id="213">But I've never bought it, and I always wondered if I bought it, what it would taste like today, but that was the only thing that I ate then, and I have not eaten since. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="231">Q: Do you think that helped you when you came to this country? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="233">A: You know, it's very hard to say. </sentence><sentence id="234">You -- You know, children fall into a lifestyle that they're in, and they don't say what would it have been like if I had been kosher, or -- or lived in -- I don't know, the lower east side, or somewhere else. </sentence><sentence id="235">I mean, the very first thing my parents did when we got here, is got tickets to Metropolitan Opera, cause that was their food. </sentence><sentence id="236">You know, we did bring some money, not a great deal, but we certainly weren't poor. </sentence><sentence id="237">But we probably spent more money on the opera than we did on food, because food we ate, but I had a very close friend, and I think I told that story, in high school, whose father was a hairdresser, and they lived in Jackson Heights, and every Sunday, they had roast beef, and this really expensive dinner. </sentence><sentence id="238">And we didn't. </sentence><sentence id="239">We had hot dogs, and beans, and I don't know, chicken or whatever, I mean, we didn't starve, but the quantity of food was not a major importance, but cultural activities were. </sentence><sentence id="240">So, you know, I don't know what it would have been like. </sentence><sentence id="241">I think I assimilated very quickly. </sentence><sentence id="242">We got here in the spring of "47, and I went to a very fancy girl's camp in Maine, that my daughter subsequently went to, that's still there, and if I had granddaughters, they'd be going there. </sentence><sentence id="243">And then I went to public schools, I went to Hunter High School, and Hunter College. </sentence><sentence id="244">And I never had any Hungarian friends, except for my parents and their friends. </sentence><sentence id="245">I spoke English, had no reason to speak anything else, and as I grew older, I started speaking English and Hungarian, kind of half and half. </sentence><sentence id="246">I started with one language and finished   USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0047 11 with the other with my parents. </sentence><sentence id="247">I mean, they spoke English with an accent, but they certainly spoke it well enough. </sentence><sentence id="248">And I married an American, and I had absolutely no reason, so I definitely assimilated, and I think maybe if I had been more religious, I would have assimilated differently, or not as easily. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="265">Q: Do you think of yourself as Jewish now? </sentence></p></dialogue>
