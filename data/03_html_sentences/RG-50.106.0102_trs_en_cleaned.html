a good prison camp, I'll send you." </sentence><sentence id="508">And he put me on that list. </sentence><sentence id="509">And I remember I came to that prison camp, came at night, all the dogs and lights, and it was quite an experience coming first prison camp. </sentence><sentence id="510">And I went next day, they put me in the pick and shovel. </sentence><sentence id="511">And  ontectnetonancedjusetneey for tarher biormatberabouttfisotecion Interview with William Luksenburg 14 I never held a pick and shovel in my hand, so at the end of the day I had blisters on my hands, and had just blisters here, I had blisters between my fingers, and I knew next day they kill me, they hit you over the head. </sentence><sentence id="512">I remember even the company I worked for was Bengera (ph). </sentence><sentence id="513">So I had a friend, she was actually a friend of my older brother, Wola zu Polska. </sentence><sentence id="514">And I walked over--she worked in the kitchen. </sentence><sentence id="515">I walked over to the window and I says, "Wola, tomorrow will be my last day because they going to kill me, I can't hold a shovel." </sentence><sentence id="516">So she knew someone that put me in the sick room. </sentence><sentence id="517">And they apparently afraid some infectious diseases so they make like a fever and they put some kind of grease on my hands. </sentence><sentence id="518">And then she said, "Can you do something else?" </sentence><sentence id="519">I said, "I will do anything." </sentence><sentence id="520">So they looked for steam roll operator. </sentence><sentence id="521">I was a kid. </sentence><sentence id="522">I have seen a steam roller operate, I never operated one. </sentence><sentence id="523">So I came over and the German came in, said, "You a steam roll operator?" </sentence><sentence id="524">I says, "Really, I don't know how to operate." </sentence><sentence id="525">He says, "You must be honest Jew

from the shovel. </sentence><sentence id="529">That's when I realized from then on I must be some kind of value because otherwise you will never go on the list. </sentence><sentence id="530">When you stay with a pick and shovel you don't have no chance to survive. </sentence><sentence id="531">At the incident with the steam roller, the steam roller had--like today hard drive brakes--had mechanical brakes. </sentence><sentence id="532">I had to push very hard to stop the steam roller and to turn, some turn it to the left and right. </sentence><sentence id="533">And the steam roller is a very

</sentence><sentence id="535">I went straight. </sentence><sentence id="536">So the German took the shovel, hit over the wheel and broke the shovel off so he had just a handle, and he kept hitting me as hard as he could  Interview with William Luksenburg 15 and all I could do is put my hands over my head, protect my head, and the guard stood there with a gun just waiting for me to make next--any move. </sentence><sentence id="537">He kept hitting until he got tired. </sentence><sentence id="538">He knocked my front teeth, he knocked my forehead, he knocked my front lip, and I thought I lost an eye. </sentence><sentence id="539">The eye was like this. </sentence><sentence id="540">And next day I came to work like nothing to it, you know, with one eye, and I worked for that company for a while and even the guy who hit me, sometimes he couldn't eat, he'd point out with his eye where he had a piece of bread or something for me to eat. </sentence><sentence id="541">So you can't figure this thing out. </sentence><sentence id="542">And then we finish the road and they build a factory. </sentence><sentence id="543">So they, they were looking for welders. </sentence><sentence id="544">So I found somebody who was older. </sentence><sentence id="545">He was a welder from home. </sentence><sentence id="546">I said, "Will you please show me." </sentence><sentence id="547">So he showed me how to do weld and I became a welder. </sentence><sentence id="548">And a good welder. </sentence><sentence id="549">When we turn on the steam I had hardly a leak. </sentence><sentence id="550">It was huge big pipes, like three feet in diameter, and you climb on ladders and you weld up, you know, like a makeshift ladders and so on. </sentence><sentence id="551">And I remember I would lay a bead. </sentence><sentence id="552">That means it looks like a machine, piece of machinery. </sentence><sentence id="553">The German always liked my work, the way I laid the bead nicely. </sentence><sentence id="554">And then they came in and turned on the steam, you know, everybody would get praises or yelled at you because you didn't a good job. </sentence><sentence id="555">I hardly had a single leak. </sentence><sentence id="556">And then this finished. </sentence></p></dialogue>
