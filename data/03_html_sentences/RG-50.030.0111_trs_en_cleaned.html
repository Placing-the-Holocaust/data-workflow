French people had a place in the...in Southern France somewhere and or grandparents and knew where to go, but people like us didn't know where to go, so we couldn't make any plans, but also we couldn't make any plans because the police did not let us travel. </sentence><sentence id="500">And...uh...we were told by our conciege that we should not even think of leaving our apartment in Paris,

fighting perhaps or in the work camp, and my brother equally and...uh...but we didn't know where they were, and we didn't know where to go and we had no means of going any place except the bicycle.

for my mother. </sentence><sentence id="513">I...My mother was too shy to do the auto stopping herself, and...uh...so I did it for her. </sentence><sentence id="514">And then I put her into the car,
