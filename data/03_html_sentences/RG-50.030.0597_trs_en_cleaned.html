<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="422">Q: Was it gradually that... </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="424">A: Yeah. </sentence><sentence id="425">Little by little it got worse and worse. </sentence><sentence id="426">But then later on the lady came up. </sentence><sentence id="427">Did I say this already? </sentence><sentence id="428">And she said, how is your wife and all this? </sentence><sentence id="429">And then she says, well, you have to excuse me, I wouldn't able to say good morning to you anymore. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="436">Q: Oh. </sentence></p></dialogue>
