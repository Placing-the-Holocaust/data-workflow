<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="129">A: Oh, it started rather early because I would say about five, started five, six, seven, eight, nine, yes because I also refused to eat for a while at home. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="131">Q: Really? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="133">A: Yes, and it was a problem, but by that time I must've been about six or seven, and I had an aunt who came from Riga, who had recently left Vienna, after Hitler. </sentence><sentence id="134">Yeah, actually, it must've been already *38 after the Anschluss in "38. </sentence><sentence id="135">I must've been about eight. </sentence><sentence id="136">She came especially from Riga after coming back from Vienna to Riga, she came especially to Libau. </sentence><sentence id="137">She said she is going to make from me Viennese sandwiches, and anything along those lines was of interest to me, and when she served me on the little piece of bread, piece of Wienerschnitzel or whatever, I said, "Well, I know what this is. </sentence><sentence id="138">It doesn't interest me." </sentence><sentence id="139">So, finally, my mother asked, "What would interest you?" </sentence><sentence id="140">And, I said, "I would love to go to Hotel Petersburg, and eat over there." </sentence><sentence id="141">That was a hotel in Libau, and had also a beautiful restaurant, also was private rooms, et cetera, and she would take me there late in the afternoon about five, five-thirty or six, and I would always have my cocoa there, hot chocolate, and little sandwiches with hard boiled egg on top of it, a small piece of tomato, and anchovies, and whatever I -- whenever I would get it I would sort of put it into the cocoa, into the hot chocolate and eat it. </sentence><sentence id="142">It was what I loved, but everything -- with anchovies with everything. </sentence><sentence id="143">Some people complained actually, and the manager of the hotel came and said to my mother, "Mrs. Dr. Schwab", that's the way we used to address people, ""There's some people who object to seeing your son put everything into the hot chocolate and eat it then." </sentence><sentence id="144">So, we were given a separate room, and for six months, I did this, and then I started eating again. </sentence><sentence id="145">I had some sort of disorder, whatever it was, I don't know, but for about six months, we went almost every single day to the Hotel Petersburg in Libau, and that's how | ate, and also I continued at home to put everything into hot chocolate. </sentence><sentence id="146">Hot chocolate, whatever I had was hot chocolate sandwiches. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="162">Q: So, do you think you needed soft food? </sentence><sentence id="163">Is that why you think you- </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="170">A: It was tasty, and whatever else I liked were desserts -- cakes, and cakes naturally are fantastic. </sentence><sentence id="171">So, I remember always also during the day, et cetera, sneaking in sometimes alone or with an aunt of mine or with my governess going to a particular cafe in Libau for just cakes. </sentence><sentence id="172">I just loved sweets. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="176">Q: It's interesting because even though your mother was very strict. </sentence><sentence id="177">She realized that she needed to ask you what you wanted. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="180">A: Yes, because it was a problem, and my father also. </sentence><sentence id="181">I don't know to what extent he knew what to do or didn't know because in those days, actually, if a father was a physician, he was not permitted to treat his son. </sentence><sentence id="182">You had to go to someone else, and the pediatrician, my pediatrician, was a man by the name of Dr. Rabinovitz, who was the father of the head of -- later on -- the head of intelligence in Israel, , and whose nephew was the Israeli Ambassador here, Rabinovitz in Washington. </sentence><sentence id="183">They all come from Libau, and the father, Dr. Rabinovitz was my pediatrician. </sentence><sentence id="184">So, I don't remember if I was taken to him for this or they just spoke over the telephone or what. </sentence><sentence id="185">This, of course, I don't know, but- </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="192">Q: But, you think it lasted for about six months? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="194">A: It lasted -- yes, that's what my mother told me after the war when we discussed it. </sentence><sentence id="195">It was, she said, many, many months probably up to about six months that we had to do this. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="198">Q: Now, do you remember when you stopped using cocoa? </sentence><sentence id="199">I don't mean to drink, but to use it with your food. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="202">A: Well, I would say by the time the war broke out, yes, when we didn't, yeah. </sentence><sentence id="203">And, actually, it was yesterday, I think, yes at the Holocaust Museum that I had some hot chocolate for the first time in years. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="216">A: Bernhard Boris Schwab, and for short we called him Bubi. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="218">Q: Bubi. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="220">A: Bubi, he was about eight, nine years older than I, and he -- he adored me. </sentence><sentence id="221">He loved me very, very much, but I was sometimes not very nice to him. </sentence><sentence id="222">I would tease him this and that, so on and so forth, and sometimes he got angry at me I remember, running after me and sort of hitting me over my rear because I really teased him a lot. </sentence><sentence id="223">I remember once on a tennis court, after I annoyed him, but he was really wonderful, and until he was taken away, I mean, he took very, very good care of me when we were just the two of us and we were alone, yes. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="228">Q: And, was he an easy going...? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="230">A: He was easy going, yes. </sentence><sentence id="231">He loved to read. </sentence><sentence id="232">He devoured reading, and it's very interesting. </sentence><sentence id="233">The last two years of the Gymnasium, he remained sitting. </sentence><sentence id="234">He failed because he was interested in his own agenda just to read. </sentence><sentence id="235">He was interested, and he just kept on reading and didn't care about school, but this happened with me too when I went to school. </sentence><sentence id="236">One day, I remember coming home and declaring, "I know everything there is to know. </sentence><sentence id="237">I know how to count to a hundred." </sentence><sentence id="238">I knew the alphabet. </sentence><sentence id="239">"And, I'm not going to school anymore or if I have to go to school, I will simply not pay attention because I love to play with my games and toys, et cetera, et cetera." </sentence><sentence id="240">And, sure enough I failed every course save English because English was something - you were a wizard if you learned English and very, very few people because my parents were brought up with French, but I was brought up with English. </sentence><sentence id="241">I had British tutors and so did my older brother. </sentence><sentence id="242">So, I passed only one subject. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="256">Q: English. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="258">A: English, and that was English. </sentence><sentence id="259">I remained sitting, and what was -- what happened was war broke out and the first thing in 1941, I thought, "My god, war broke out now. </sentence><sentence id="260">I will not have to go back to school." </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="264">Q: And, that was relieving to you? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="266">A: That was very -- that was a relief that I would not have to go back to school. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="268">Q: Were your parents upset that you were happy about this? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="270">A: No, no, actually, I've been thinking about it, and I don't remember having discussed this with my father, but they did not seem to be perturbed or anything of the sort. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="272">Q: And, no one said to you, "You don't know everything, George, if you just can count to a hundred." </sentence><sentence id="273">I mean nobody -- they just accepted what you said. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="276">A: They accepted what I said, and they let me play, and I played a lot. </sentence><sentence id="277">I was fortunate to have a lot of toys, and I just -- trains and trains, toys, all sorts of toys. </sentence><sentence id="278">I was imaging that I was a general -- that was already in 1939, 1940 -- on the Line and a cousin of mine was the general of the Siegfried, yeah, he was Siegfried Lineland, and I was . </sentence><sentence id="279">We played war, and we had tanks and we had airplanes, and we had all sorts of toys. </sentence><sentence id="280">The cousin, this cousin actually is still alive. </sentence><sentence id="281">He's older than I am. </sentence><sentence id="282">He lives in Salzburg now. </sentence><sentence id="283">So, we often, whenever we meet, we talk about our days when we used to play war. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="292">Q: Now, you were probably brought up in a fairly wealthy situation. </sentence><sentence id="293">Am I correct? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="296">A: Yes, yes, and that was also a little bit embarrassing because about -- thinking about it in anticipation of today, about fifteen years or so ago, there was a gathering of Latian Jews, and I, not thinking, I made the statement that I do not remember -- there were no, I said, "Categorically, there were no poor people in Libau who were Jews in Libau." </sentence><sentence id="297">So, they snickered at me saying, "You don't know this. </sentence><sentence id="298">You and your family probably didn't know that there were poor Jews in Libau, but there were plenty of poor Jews in Libau." </sentence><sentence id="299">This came to me as a surprise. </sentence><sentence id="300">I should" ve thought it through, obviously, but I had never met -- let's put it this way -- one who was not, well, well endowed from this perspective. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="306">Q: And, did you live in a big house? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="308">A: We had a large apartment, very large, probably -- well, not probably, it was considered the foremost apartment building in the city, yes. </sentence><sentence id="309">It had ten rooms. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="312">Q: And, was your father's office in that building? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="314">A: In the building, yeah, in the building, yeah. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="316">Q: Did that mean that he came upstairs for lunch and you would all eat lunch together? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="318">A: Well, yes he would -- what we called lunch was dinner, and in the evening was supper, and we had dinner very late about two, two-thirty because my father between ten and twelve he saw patients in the office, or was it nine-thirty. </sentence><sentence id="319">Then, he also made house calls. </sentence><sentence id="320">Then, he would come for lunch, go out again on house calls, and then he had office hours, if memory -- memory serves me right, from four to six. </sentence><sentence id="321">But, he had so many patients that he sometimes did not come and have supper before eight, eight- thirty when I did not see him because I was already in bed or whatever. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="327">Q: And, dinner when you would eat what we call lunch, but dinner in the middle of the day, were there a lot of conversation? </sentence><sentence id="328">Was this is a very perfunctory sort of eating? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="331">A: No, it was always interesting conversation, and when I was finally permitted to join them, when I was sufficiently trained, I enjoyed it very, very much. </sentence><sentence id="332">But, then, when I did sort of things that were unacceptable at the table, I was sent back. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="335">Q: And, where would be "back" to-? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="337">A: To my room. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="339">Q: Would you eat there? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="341">A: I would eat there with my governess. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="343">Q: I see. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="345">A: But, when I was permitted to sit at the table -- see, I try to make sure that I wouldn't really spoil things because I didn't want to be sent back. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="347">Q: Right. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="349">A: But, from time to time, I was sent back. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="351">Q: And, was this your mother making the decision? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="353">A: Mostly my mother, yes. </sentence><sentence id="354">My father thought everything was amusing. </sentence><sentence id="355">He did not contradict my mother, but I remember one little incident when my father came in -- which very often happened. </sentence><sentence id="356">He was not there on time at two or two-thirty when we would have the lunch. </sentence><sentence id="357">He came in late, and he just paced in the dining room, and my mother didn't talk to him and he didn't talk to my mother which was unusual, and it still sticks in my mind. </sentence><sentence id="358">It happened once. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="365">Q: And, tell me about your governesses. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="367">A: Well, I had a nanny as a -- when I was a very small child. </sentence><sentence id="368">She was Russian, Fanya, and I adored her. </sentence><sentence id="369">She was -- I just could've sold my parents. </sentence><sentence id="370">She was -- she was it so far as I am concerned, so far as I was concerned And then I was being prepared that I'm going to be a big boy, and the summer we were going to spend in Riga Beach, and when I will come back, I will have a governess and no longer my nanya, my nanny, and I didn't really understand what they were saying, and we always went summers to Riga spend time at the Riga beaches, to the resorts in Riga. </sentence><sentence id="371">And, when I came back, she wasn't there, and I just didn't understand it. </sentence><sentence id="372">And, I remember crying, but then we had engaged a German governess, Fraulein was her name. </sentence><sentence id="373">She was very strict, more in my mother's tradition than in my father's tradition which was leisurely. </sentence><sentence id="374">My mother was much more Prussian in this sense, and the governess was also in that tradition. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="384">Q: So, this was not comfortable for you. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="386">A: No, but I had no choice. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="388">Q: Yeah. </sentence><sentence id="389">Did you actually complain to your mother and say, "Why are you...?" </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="392">A: No, I don't remember complaining to her. </sentence><sentence id="393">I even think I had a crush on her. </sentence><sentence id="394">She was, as I remember, very attractive. </sentence><sentence id="395">She probably was, I don't know, I guess must have been in her late 20s or so. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="400">Q: Right. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="402">A: And, I thought she was very attractive, and I actually tried to behave. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="404">Q: Oh, really? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="406">A: I tried. </sentence><sentence id="407">Whether I did or not, that's something else, but she taught me so, proper table manners. </sentence><sentence id="408">She taught me also had to greet people. </sentence><sentence id="409">We were also taught how to walk properly. </sentence><sentence id="410">This was part of our- </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="416">Q: Now, was this the major thing the governess would do was teach you how to act? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="418">A: No, also with the homework, et cetera, and we would play games together. </sentence><sentence id="419">We would go out on walks and meet friends of mine, et cetera. </sentence><sentence id="420">We were there with the other governesses, yes. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="424">Q: So, did you really spend any more time with the governess than you did with your parents? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="426">A: Well, when I was in school, let's say I was in school -- I would come home. </sentence><sentence id="427">There was my goveress. </sentence><sentence id="428">In the morning, no she was not a live-in governess. </sentence><sentence id="429">I got- </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1300">Q: The adults? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1302">A: Yes, the adults in Riga, but my mother took me a day or two later, took me back to Libau, yes. </sentence><sentence id="1303">So, in Libau, we went to the beach as usual, to the tennis courts still in the first few weeks, et cetera. </sentence><sentence id="1304">Finally, we were permitted to talk to Russian soldiers because the Russians had established bases in Latvia already in September, October 1939 as a result of the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact, but we were not permitted to talk to Russians. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1308">Q: Really? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1310">A: Yeah, but now we were permitted to talk to Russians, and I remember on the beaches, the Russians, also Russian soldiers, Russian trucks on all the beaches, and we could get these Russian insignias what we called , et cetera. </sentence><sentence id="1311">So, we begged them, et cetera. </sentence><sentence id="1312">But, soon after the occupation, we were all notified in our building where we lived that we had to evacuate, and evacuate it rather rapidly because it became eventually the headquarters of the Communist party for the Libau and the region around Libau, but we received an extension for a couple of months. </sentence><sentence id="1313">First of all, they needed my father's expertise, and we had to find a smaller apartment which turned out in my mother's mind to be a disaster because we had to live in six rooms. </sentence><sentence id="1314">How are we going to manage six rooms? </sentence><sentence id="1315">My God... </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1322">Q: And, how many did you have before? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1324">A: About ten. </sentence><sentence id="1325">How are we going to do this? </sentence><sentence id="1326">I had to double up with my brother. </sentence><sentence id="1327">We had the same bedroom. </sentence><sentence id="1328">My father was not permitted to put up -- to have an office, but he was permitted to see private patients because, again, of his specialty. </sentence><sentence id="1329">So, he had a kind of a sitting room where his library was, but all the X-ray machinery, machinery, all this was stored in the maid's room. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1337">Q: And, could he use it? </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1341">Q: He couldn't use it? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1343">A: No, because he became head of the policlinic over there at a salary and everyone laughed at it in the family of something like 30 Rubles a month. </sentence><sentence id="1344">We were not dependent obviously on the 30 Rubles a month. </sentence><sentence id="1345">And, he started getting patients for which I don't think, I mean, he charged. </sentence><sentence id="1346">I remember the admiral of the fleet or something along those lines, came and consulted my father and he even came to our house for dinner, the admiral, and I remember this because I admired his uniforms and the illustrious medals that he wore. </sentence><sentence id="1347">That was in the new apartment that we had. </sentence><sentence id="1348">In the old apartment, we had to take in a Russian soldier. </sentence><sentence id="1349">Everyone had to take in Russian soldiers because Libau was a major base for the Russians, and Libau had three ports that never froze in the winters and that's why you had also a very big naval port in Libau where part of the Russian fleet was stationed. </sentence><sentence id="1350">So, it was very strategic significance. </sentence><sentence id="1351">Libau as a city, and that is probably why Libau was much bombarded by the Nazis in "41 when they invaded, and in "44 and "45 -- and there was a lot of fighting in and around the city, and the city was about at least 85 percent destroyed in contrast to Riga which was not a strategic site, and there was relatively little fighting, and the city, by and large was preserved, is preserved. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1375">Q: Really? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1377">A: Yeah, and I remember snickers about this. </sentence><sentence id="1378">I certainly do remember this, but then they distinguished you had still officers from the old Czarist days, and this I remember my parents saying what a difference it makes from these , [mean the ordinary, from the old days. </sentence><sentence id="1379">The aristocrats versus __. </sentence><sentence id="1380">You can see, of course, immediately the difference. </sentence><sentence id="1381">Or, if they try to be like the aristocrats, you just have to scratch a little bit and you saw where they came from. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1387">Q: Now, do you remember this soldier? </sentence><sentence id="1388">Was he -- did he have any relationship with you or not? </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1403">A: This I don't recollect. </sentence><sentence id="1404">I don't recollect him eating in the house. </sentence><sentence id="1405">Maybe in the kitchen or so. </sentence><sentence id="1406">I don't recollect this in the dining room. </sentence><sentence id="1407">I don't recollect this, but we also had to -- we could no longer have sleep-ins. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1413">Q: What does that - Do you mean with other people coming in? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1415">A: Well sleep-ins, I mean, because nobody was permitted to be a housekeeper. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1417">Q: Ah, I see what you mean, right. </sentence><sentence id="1418">So, you don't have a housekeeper. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1421">A: No more staff, no, but a woman Fenya, this woman who didn't sleep-in but always come in to work. </sentence><sentence id="1422">She kept on coming to clean up the apartment. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1429">Q: So, who started cooking, your mother? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1431">A: Good question. </sentence><sentence id="1432">I remember one incident -- no, I think it was Stepha, no, Fenya who did some of the cooking, but I remember one incident in the morning when we lived in the new apartment, and I had to go to school, my mother would prepare the breakfast for me and said, "Let's do it very, very quickly, and we'll eat in the kitchen." </sentence><sentence id="1433">And, I said to her, "I'm not a maid." </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1437">Q: Really? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1439">A: Yeah, I said to her, and I remember that very distinctly, and my mother reminded me of this after the war. </sentence><sentence id="1440">It seemed funny to eat in the kitchen, and this brings back a very funny story. </sentence><sentence id="1441">My father had a cousin in Libau, Rabinovitz, whose two sons lived here in the United States. </sentence><sentence id="1442">One son used to accompany a musician. </sentence><sentence id="1443">He had Carnegie Hall in 1925 so on and so forth until died, I think in 1929 if my memory serves me right. </sentence><sentence id="1444">And, then he became a big here in Hollywood playing behind mostly the piano. </sentence><sentence id="1445">And, in 1936 or 1937, he came to Libau and begged his mother to come and live with him in Hollywood, leave Latvia, and he said, "Mother, I'm going to build you a house with a Hollywood kitchen where you can eat in the kitchen." </sentence><sentence id="1446">She said, "Eat in the kitchen? </sentence><sentence id="1447">For this I should move to America?" </sentence><sentence id="1448">To give you just an anecdote, but the mentality. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1468">Q: Funny. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1470">A: Yeah, and that reminded me of my little incident. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1474">A: I was a kid, yeah. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1476">Q: Right. </sentence><sentence id="1477">So is there a significant change when you had to move to the smaller apartment, or do things pretty much stay okay? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1480">A: Well, it was much, much smaller the apartment. </sentence><sentence id="1481">My father was working. </sentence><sentence id="1482">He saw private patients, but could not use his X-rays or his laboratory, et cetera. </sentence><sentence id="1483">That was all gone. </sentence><sentence id="1484">Did we starve? </sentence><sentence id="1485">Food became more scarce. </sentence><sentence id="1486">Let's say a person could not buy more than, let's say a pound of sugar per month. </sentence><sentence id="1487">I'm thinking of an arbitrary- </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1496">Q: Right. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1498">A: -figure, but I do remember if we wanted to have meat, it also became scarce, and our new apartment was not far from the marketplace, and every person could buy so much and so much meat. </sentence><sentence id="1499">So, I went online to buy a pound or a kilo or half a kilo, I don't remember, and I paid. </sentence><sentence id="1500">So, we had -- and, my mother went online. </sentence><sentence id="1501">So, that between the two of us, we were able to buy enough for a sumptuous meal. </sentence><sentence id="1502">To give you just one idea. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1508">Q: So, there wasn't a restriction in terms of a family. </sentence><sentence id="1509">It was a restriction per person. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1512">A: It was. </sentence><sentence id="1513">I remember this very distinctly, yes, per person. </sentence><sentence id="1514">So, therefore, my mother went probably an hour later or so, and I went at nine. </sentence><sentence id="1515">I don't know what time it was, at ten or she went at twelve, whatever. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1520">Q: But, none of these restrictions were because you were Jewish? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1522">A: No, no. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1524">Q: This is- </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1530">A: Yes, everybody's in the same situation, yes. </sentence><sentence id="1531">Everybody was in the same situation. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1534">Q: Now, are you beginning -- forget the Jewishness part for a moment -- but, are you beginning to feel the harshness of what war means, and what occupation means, or is this you think because they're communists and so- </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1536">A: They're communists and we were vitriolicly anti-communist, and in my class, almost everyone joined the Communist Pioneers. </sentence><sentence id="1537">I did not because we belonged to the "Bourgeois Class" and we were -- the class was being lambasted all the time. </sentence><sentence id="1538">And, we were scared, but nothing seemed to happen, nothing happened until one week before the outbreak of the war. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1542">Q: In 1941? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1544">A: deg41, exactly one week before the outbreak of the war, on Sunday, suddenly Russian trucks appeared all over the city telling you you have to pack your things and leave. </sentence><sentence id="1545">We'll take you to Russia. </sentence><sentence id="1546">We didn't know whether we would be taken, too, but a lot of the well-to-do people, a lot of the Jews, also Latvians, but proportionally more Jews than Latvians, were taken and shipped off to Siberia and to that part of the world in cattle cars, and this was just one week, exactly the Sunday before the outbreak of the war between Russia and Germany. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1550">Q: Now, when you say that you were -- and I'm assuming you mean the family -- was vitriolicly anti-Communist, is that what you believed about the Communists or is that because the Communists saw you as Bourgeois and would not accept you? </sentence><sentence id="1551">Or, was it both? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1554">A: I think it was both. </sentence><sentence id="1555">I think it was both. </sentence><sentence id="1556">Again, I can't be a hundred percent certain, but I just know we were anti-Communist, and it was my decision not to join the youth movement. </sentence><sentence id="1557">Again, my parents didn't say anything that I had to or so. </sentence><sentence id="1558">My father felt probably significantly secure again because of his specialty as a gastroenterologist, not to be too worried, but still, and also the fact that he had prominent Russians now from the Russian Army and the Russian Navy as patients. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1564">Q: And, let me ask you something -- is part of the reason also that you didn't want to join not just ideological but the fact that they were also very disciplined and you were going to be indoctrinated on certain things, or you just didn't agree with them? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1566">A: I just didn't agree with them, and I didn't -- at that time, I tried to intuit myself into that situation. </sentence><sentence id="1567">At that time, I simply thought that Communism was wrong. </sentence><sentence id="1568">Why? </sentence><sentence id="1569">I don't know. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="1576"> A See? </sentence><sentence id="1577">Of course, we were chased out of our apartment, but in contrast to the other ones, we were permitted to stay there another month or two, but I do remember my mother complaining, "How are we ever going to live in a six room apartment?" </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1580">Q: Right. </sentence><sentence id="1581">That included a kitchen, right? ( </sentence><sentence id="1582">laughs) </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1661">Q: She did. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1663">A: Yes, because this aunt had survived and died in Riga about 20 years ago. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1665">Q: But, your memory of some of the details of what an apartment looks like is -- I don't know. </sentence><sentence id="1666">It doesn't seem typical to me that you as such a young child would have such very vivid memory of these rooms and the layout. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1710">A: Yeah, and war was kind of a relief for me when it broke out. </sentence><sentence id="1711">The first thing that came to my mind is, "I will no longer have to go to school." </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1804">Q: Now, during the Russian occupation, though, your father isn't earning a lot of money, really. </sentence><sentence id="1805">The money that he has possessed, that the family had, was not confiscated as far as you know. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1808">A: Well, my mother told me that we had withdrawn a large sum of money before the Russian occupation occurred from the bank, a considerable amount, but not everything should be suspicious, so only a part. </sentence><sentence id="1809">And, we were able to exchange some of it into Rubles, but there were price controls in the Russian period. </sentence><sentence id="1810">So, if you made 30 Rubles, you had to pay the rent maybe with three Rubles or four Rubles, but money was not an issue and wasn't -- and I remember the snickers about the 30 Rubles that he was making, or 35 Rubles perhaps, but it was very low. </sentence><sentence id="1811">It was in the 30s I remember, but it didn't matter to us personally. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1816">Q: Right. </sentence><sentence id="1817">So, are you -- is there any apprehension that there's going to be a war coming to Latvia, that the Germans will do something that this won't stay- </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1820">A: No, no because according to the Ribbentrop Molotov Pact, Latvia and Estonia and a good part of Lithuania fell under the Russian sphere of influence and subsequently occupation, and that Germans would not dare attack Russia. </sentence><sentence id="1821">This behemoth for as long as the war still is going on in the West. </sentence><sentence id="1822">So, there were no fears of war. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1826">Q: So, this deportation, this mass forced deportation, you think it had nothing to do with the Russians thinking there's going to be a war. </sentence><sentence id="1827">They just did it. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1830">A: That's a very good question, and that's still being speculated about. </sentence><sentence id="1831">Stalin and Molotov were convinced, and I'm not talking now as a child. </sentence><sentence id="1832">I'm talking about with my knowledge as an academic, where convinced that there would be no war with Russia -- with Germany at this time. </sentence><sentence id="1833">The lower downs believed that there will be because the Germans were sending spy planes all the time. </sentence><sentence id="1834">In fact, the week before -- two weeks before the outbreak or three weeks before the outbreak, we could see planes very, very high up. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1840">Q: And, could you see them? </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1861">Q: They still were the lesser evils even to you. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1863">A: Yes. </sentence><sentence id="1864">Well, the point is, later on in comparison to the Nazis. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1867">Q: Ah, okay. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1869">A: Yeah, but we were, the family was together. </sentence><sentence id="1870">We really did not starve. </sentence><sentence id="1871">We were not sent out. </sentence><sentence id="1872">Friends of ours were deported, yes, but my aunts and uncles in Riga were not deported. </sentence><sentence id="1873">So, by and large, by and large, we were satisfied. </sentence><sentence id="1874">Of course, the press was a controlled press. </sentence><sentence id="1875">My parents now spoke much more often in Russian in front of me for fear that I should not go to school and say something anti-Communist, and then be arrested because a child had said something. </sentence><sentence id="1876">I sensed it of course, and I resented the fact that my parents did not trust me, and that was probably one of the reasons I did not join the Russian Youth Movement, the Young Pioneers because everything was now hush-hush at home for fear that I may squeal because I was a child. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1885">Q: Right. </sentence><sentence id="1886">So, you think you didn't join partly because you felt? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1889">A: Yes, because I was vitriolicly anti-Communist like my parents, and I sensed it at home, what I overheard, what I understood from their Russian, et cetera, I kept my mouth shut, but nevertheless, they had to be cautious. </sentence><sentence id="1890">I understand. </sentence><sentence id="1891">I understand it now. </sentence><sentence id="1892">I didn't understand it at the time obviously. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1897">Q: Now, what language were you speaking in primarily now since before the Russians come you're speaking primarily German. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1899">A: I continued to speak German with my parents, yes. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1923">Q: And, this is not a harsh occupation except for the forced? </sentence><sentence id="1924">Or was it a harsh, maybe it was? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1927">A: I don't think it was a harsh occupation before the deportations. </sentence><sentence id="1928">Freedom of the press, of course, was curtailed. </sentence><sentence id="1929">Harsh from the viewpoint of physical harm, no, until the deportation, yeah. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1933">Q: Right. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1935">A: I've read that people were arrested for anti-Communist, anti-Bolshevik statements, so on and so forth. </sentence><sentence id="1936">Yes, we heard about this, but the immediate circle, our immediate circle, as I understood it at the time, was not affected. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1939">Q: Something radically different happens in 1941, however. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1941">A: Yeah. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1943">Q: Do you remember the move into Latvia by the Germans? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1945">A: Very well, I remember the outbreak of the war very well. </sentence><sentence id="1946">Actually, what happened, the war, the Germans invaded on a Sunday morning, early morning. </sentence><sentence id="1947">Saturday night, my parents went to sleep only at three or four because they played cards at our house. </sentence><sentence id="1948">There were about six or seven ladies played Gin Rummy, I mean Kunken, and suddenly early in the morning, there was lots of noise, bombs being dropped et cetera on that Sunday morning, June 22", of 41, and now we had a terrace in the rear, a balcony not a terrace, actually only a balcony. </sentence><sentence id="1949">And, we all went out to see what happened, and we saw German planes, , flying very low where we could even say hello to the pilots and they sort of winked back at us because it was very low, bombing certain parts. </sentence><sentence id="1950">We didn't know what was happening. </sentence><sentence id="1951">We turned on the radio, no news. </sentence><sentence id="1952">The news about the outbreak of the war did not come for hours because the Russians were taken by surprise. </sentence><sentence id="1953">They didn't know. </sentence><sentence id="1954">Subsequently, I read in the history books that Stalin thought that it was not Hitler behind this, the went behind Hitler's back because Stalin and Molotov were convinced that the Germans were not going to invade, and now suddenly, they did invade. </sentence><sentence id="1955">So, the bombings -- this was very exciting. </sentence><sentence id="1956">Again, our building was not hit. </sentence><sentence id="1957">It was someplace in the center of the city. </sentence><sentence id="1958">I did not immediately see any ruins, but as the Germans were moving closer, they occupied Libau one week after the outbreak of the war. </sentence><sentence id="1959">My father took us to the hospital which was a little bit outside of the city in a safer neighborhood, and we stayed there for a couple of days until the Germans came in. </sentence><sentence id="1960">But, during the bombardment, we also stayed one night in a basement in the center of the city ina kind of a policlinic, a small hospital, and there I saw a lot of the destruction already, and that became to dangerous to stay there in the center of the city because this was being bombarded by the German Navy and subsequently by the Army. </sentence><sentence id="1961">So, we moved to the larger hospital outside the city -- well, it still was in the city district, but in the residential area right near the beach, and I distinctly remember when the Germans arrived, the Latvian doctors asked my father to accompany them to "welcome the Germans" with roses, et cetera, and my father went and asked about the Jews and the Lieutenant in the car, and I remember him coming back saying the Jews have nothing to worry about. </sentence><sentence id="1962">We now have a common foe, and we must fight this common foe and the Jews are part of this war. </sentence><sentence id="1963">In the naivety, fighting if you fight together we're civilized Germans, not racists, et cetera. </sentence><sentence id="1964">Like in World War I, if you fight Communism, fine and good, and he was sort of assured, and in a certain naivety, he believed and made us rather believe that we have nothing to worry about, or maybe he just wanted to keep us calm as could be the case. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1986">Q: So, how did you feel that he asked the Germans this question? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1988">A: He came back. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1990">Q: And he told you what he asked them? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1992">A: Yeah, he told us and my brother, my mother and me et cetera, yes, and we all listened, et cetera. </sentence><sentence id="1993">There was a kind of a command car that appeared and he was part of the welcoming committee that he was asked to participate, and in this context he asked about the Jewish question, and he was assured by this officer. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1996">Q: That everything would be okay. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1998">A: That, Yeah. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2000">Q: Is this as if your father either knew nothing or paid no attention to what was happening to Jews in Germany? </sentence><sentence id="2001">Did you have any idea? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2004">A: Originally, I'm convinced. </sentence><sentence id="2005">Again, this is my interpretation that he did not genuinely believe my aunt when she said- </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2008">Q: What had happened. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2010">A: -what had happened with the Germans with the Jewish women polishing the cars with furs. </sentence><sentence id="2011">Later on, my interpretation again, is that he did not want to worry the family. </sentence><sentence id="2012">So, he always looked at the glass half full rather than half empty. </sentence><sentence id="2013">That's my interpretation. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2018">Q: Is it possible that he never asked the Germans this? </sentence><sentence id="2019">He simply told you this so you'd feel okay. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2022">A: I would -- it could very well be the case. </sentence><sentence id="2023">It could very well be the case, and then afterwards the same day, we took our baggage and we walked back to the apartment, and the house was still standing and we saw the German occupiers on the street and they left us alone. </sentence><sentence id="2024">We left them alone. </sentence><sentence id="2025">I remember staring at them, and then we went back to the apartment. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2031">Q: The same apartment, the smaller apartment? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2033">A: Yes, but in the meantime we had also heard that a number of Jews were shot by Latvians because the Latvians were also vitriolicly anti-Communist, and in some of the German propaganda that leaked through, I guess, the Germans equated Bolshevism with Judaism so on and so forth. </sentence><sentence id="2034">So, apparently, some people were shot even before, just before the German occupation took place in Libau. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2037">Q: So, how long is it when things become rougher and it's no longer the same life for you? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2039">A: Almost immediately. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2041">Q: Almost immediately? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2043">A: Almost immediately. </sentence><sentence id="2044">I remember my father having to go to a gathering place every morning to be assigned for work. </sentence><sentence id="2045">My father wore his red cross arm band. </sentence><sentence id="2046">My brother going to work. </sentence><sentence id="2047">A cousin of mine was shot dead by the Germans apparently, he had just married a Latvian girl before. </sentence><sentence id="2048">She was pregnant, but I was lead to understand that she also had a lover, and I was lead to understand that she denounced him as a Jew and he was shot and my father was called on to go to the cemetery to identify the body, and he came back to the house and I was there, pale saying, "Yes it was who was shot dead." </sentence><sentence id="2049">He identified the body, and that was about a week to ten days after the occupation, and it was not long thereafter when my father was arrested, tortured and killed, yes. </sentence><sentence id="2050">So, we immediately began to feel it, almost immediately, within days I would say, yes. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2059">Q: And, when you saw that your father coming back, it must have been very shocking to you to see him looking- </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2061">A: Yes. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2063">Q: He must have looked awful. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2065">A: Yes, yes, yes, yes. </sentence><sentence id="2066">Then, I no longer thought in terms of me and the I, et cetera. </sentence><sentence id="2067">I began thinking in terms of the larger picture that is our fate, no longer my school. </sentence><sentence id="2068">I mean, this became irrelevant. </sentence><sentence id="2069">It was not even a footnote in my life. </sentence><sentence id="2070">Now, the issue became life and death. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2077">Q: And, you're ten years old. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2079">A: Yes. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2081">Q: About ten. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2083">A: Yeah. </sentence><sentence id="2084">Nine and a half at the time now. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2087">Q: So, the quick relief of "I don't have to go to school." </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2089">A: Oh, that- </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2091">Q: Was all finished. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2093">A: That was finished. </sentence><sentence id="2094">That was finished, yes. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2097">Q: So, do you have trouble sleeping now when you're- </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2099">A: Now? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2101">Q: No, I don't mean now. </sentence><sentence id="2102">I'm sorry, now meaning at the point. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2105">A: At the point, I don't remember having trouble sleeping. </sentence><sentence id="2106">I slept. </sentence><sentence id="2107">I lead an active life in so far as I kept up with the news, the latest news, what's happening all the gossip, the dangers, by the time the evening came around, I assume I was exhausted. </sentence><sentence id="2108">I was still a kid. </sentence><sentence id="2109">So, I seemed to sleep very well. </sentence><sentence id="2110">My mother was assigned to go to work, and sometimes she was able to take me with her. </sentence><sentence id="2111">This was she was kind of a seamstress, ironing. </sentence><sentence id="2112">I remember her doing working in, I guess it must have been a laundry. </sentence><sentence id="2113">If I think of it today, for the German Air Force in Libau. </sentence><sentence id="2114">She was, and then at a certain point, she became the housekeeper, maid for the mistress, for the Latvian mistress for the head of the in Libau, and my mother knew her from before the war because they used to meet at the same hairdressers called Mary's. </sentence><sentence id="2115">I still remember. </sentence><sentence id="2116">This mistress apparently had a liking, took a liking to my mother, and sent a long to the ghetto, but this was already in the ghetto period. </sentence><sentence id="2117">But, before the ghetto period already, extra food and when she knew that things were going to happen to Jews, she would tell my mother, "You better bring George with you to the apartment." </sentence><sentence id="2118">So, I would stay for the day at the apartment safe when my mother was cleaning or whatever, yes. </sentence><sentence id="2119">But, things became in a sense chaotic, but there was within this chaos, there was still order. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2135">Q: How -- I don't know whether at the time you would know, but perhaps only afterwards when you talked with your mother, how did she take to doing this? </sentence><sentence id="2136">She was never doing this sort of work in the house. </sentence><sentence id="2137">So, all of a sudden, she's acting as someone's maid and she's ironing and she's- </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2141">A: She said to me circumstances dictate what you have to do. </sentence><sentence id="2142">She took it very stoically. </sentence><sentence id="2143">She took it very -- but, she -- ve never seen my mother in tears before. </sentence><sentence id="2144">I've never seen my mother in a state of hysteria. </sentence><sentence id="2145">When my father was arrested, she ran all over the place to her Latvian colleagues who did not raise a finger for my late father. </sentence><sentence id="2146">Some of the Latvian doctors, I guess you know jealousy, professional jealousy whatever, but nothing unusual. </sentence><sentence id="2147">They didn't raise a finger even though it was an issue of life and death. </sentence><sentence id="2148">She went to the pleading for my father. </sentence><sentence id="2149">She left no stone unturned, and at a certain point was told by the man who really killed my father that he'Il be released but a wound has to heal, that guy apparently knocked out one of his eyes, and was told that they really needed him because of his specialty, but the wound never healed. </sentence><sentence id="2150">So, they didn't want to release him in that condition. </sentence><sentence id="2151">So, they decided to shoot him instead. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2164">Q: And, that you heard later? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2166">A: That I heard later, but a patient, a Latvian patient of my father's came with the news that his eye was knocked out. </sentence><sentence id="2167">He heard it from I guess a Latvian guard in the prison or whatever, and I've also heard it from his fellow prison inmates, Jews who were later on liberated or I saw later, what happened to my father because they were eyewitnesses. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2170">Q: Do you remember the day your father was arrested or weren't you home? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2172">A: He didn't come home. </sentence><sentence id="2173">It was toward the end of July 1941, yeah. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2176">Q: So, he was working in the hospital? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2178">A: He was not working in the hospital at that time, no. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2180">Q: Or, he was doing forced labor, I guess. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="2182"> A Yes, but as a doctor, as a doctor he was doing this. </sentence><sentence id="2183">This was the end of July, and then he was shot. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2186">Q: So, how did you understand this as a young child? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2188">A: Horrified, absolutely horrified, and you didn't -- I didn't understand. </sentence><sentence id="2189">I didn't understand why we had to suffer simply because being Jewish. </sentence><sentence id="2190">I hardly knew what it meant before the war. </sentence><sentence id="2191">As I said, I knew I was a Jew. </sentence><sentence id="2192">I knew about Matza, Passover, about certain High Holidays, or when my mother and father fasted, or turning on candles commemorating the dead, et cetera, but otherwise I really did not know much about the significance. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2198">Q: So, there's no logic here for you. </sentence><sentence id="2199">I mean, nothing makes- </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2202">A: No. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2204">Q: And, even if the- </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2206">A: What the logic was I'm suffering because I'm a Jew, but I didn't understand why I had to suffer because I'm a Jew. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2208">Q: Right. </sentence><sentence id="2209">Then, how do you understand death and murder? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2212">A: I didn't analyze it. </sentence><sentence id="2213">I did not, but I remember later on thinking -- initially, I did not want to die, but later on after Stalingrad, et cetera, I did not mind. </sentence><sentence id="2214">I thought myself because I know that the Germans are going to be defeated. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2218">Q: So, you didn't mind the thought that you might die? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2220">A: Yeah, I did no longer mind it. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2222">Q: Isee. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2224">A: To see Germany destroyed, that was it. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2226">Q: Right. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2228">A: Yeah. </sentence><sentence id="2229">Because I remember in the severe winter, well -- I remember in maybe it's later it's been cut now. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2232">Q: No, you have another minute. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="2234"> A I remember it was a very severe winter, 1941-42, where I got frostbite in Libau, frostbite on my toes and my fingers, thinking perhaps if the Germans would win the war, there would no longer be a reason to punish Jews for whatever reason, and things would get better. </sentence><sentence id="2235">So, for a moment, I even thought, however perverse it may sound today, but as a child, perhaps the Germans should win and then we will be relieved of this misery, of this uncertainty. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2238">Q: So, confusion reigns in some ways. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2240">A: Confusion reigns, but death was there. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2242">Q: Yeah. </sentence><sentence id="2243">Okay, think we have to stop now. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="2246"> End of Tape 4 Tape 5 </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2249">Q: Okay, George, I understand that you know something about the circumstances under which your father was arrested at the marketplace. </sentence><sentence id="2250">Am I correct? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2253">A: Yes, he went to work to the gathering place in Libau where the Jews were gathered and then the Germans would transport them to their outfits, and he saw the trucks approaching, and he began to make signs to the people on the square, in other words, to disperse, and this was noticed by the SS people, and they beat him up terribly and threw him onto one of the trucks, and he among others were taken to the prison. </sentence><sentence id="2254">That's where he continued to be tortured. </sentence><sentence id="2255">That's where apparently his eye was knocked out, and apparently he was going around looking for his eye, et cetera, and couldn't find it, and begged -- this is from eye witnesses that we have -- begged to be shot, but they kept him alive. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2259">Q: Tell me how you remember your mother was during this period. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2261">A: She -- I've never seen her before crying or being hysterical. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2263">Q: But she was? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2265">A: She was absolutely hysterical when it happened. </sentence><sentence id="2266">She would say our our dad, our daddy, how are we going on from here? </sentence><sentence id="2267">We must do everything possible to rescue him, and she started running around and we still had some hidden diamonds and gold coins so on and so forth, and she bribed some of the Latvian colleagues especially one who used to be a neighbor of ours, Dr. , a neighbor of ours when we lived in the -- before the Russians came in, in the same. </sentence><sentence id="2268">There were two apartments to the same floor and he lived in one of them. </sentence><sentence id="2269">And, he said, "There's nothing I can do." </sentence><sentence id="2270">She went to some other Latvian colleagues. </sentence><sentence id="2271">They said, "Well, there's really nothing we can do or help or say." </sentence><sentence id="2272">She then went to the , but I don't think she did give anything to the people in terms of gold coins or diamonds, et cetera. </sentence><sentence id="2273">It would've been much too dangerous, and there was this one person who apparently knocked out my father's eye, Handtke who was tried after World War II in Hamburg where apparently I have the transcripts where this whole issue was brought up. </sentence><sentence id="2274">He defended himself. </sentence><sentence id="2275">I don't remember the details from the transcripts, and he finally said to my mother after several days, "Yes, we're going to release your husband once the wound" some sort of wound "he has will be healed, but the wound never healed so they decided to shoot him instead." </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2287">Q: And, how long did it take before she found out that he was dead? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2289">A: The first news as I remember, came from a former Latvian patient of my father's who came to visit us with the news that he had heard, and then also some of the people who were arrested together with him, some of them were released who saw it, and others were also shot relatively speaking at the same time. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2291">Q: And, did your mother then become very practical about trying to figure out how to help the three of you survive together? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2293">A: She relied heavily on my older brother who had leadership qualities which she did not really, nor of course I, as a child. </sentence><sentence id="2294">So, she relied very much on my brother, and together with whatever help I could give, we manipulated the situation to the best of our knowledge. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2297">Q: Your brother is about twenty years old in 1941. </sentence><sentence id="2298">Am I correct? </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2319">A: Yeah, and she was obviously spoiled from her old home, and my father spoiled her very much. </sentence><sentence id="2320">So, she was not very street smart or anything of the sort, but it is sometimes the circumstances that forge an individual, yes. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2323">Q: So, does she now go to work? </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2349">A: No, in the meantime, several times we had to move. </sentence><sentence id="2350">We moved in to one apartment near my school for a short time. </sentence><sentence id="2351">Let me get the sequence straight. </sentence><sentence id="2352">Oh, my -- we moved into the servant quarters of the Kessel Villa, K-e-s-s-e-1, because my brother married the daughter, but this was already a war marriage, had no legal validity to the best of my knowledge. </sentence><sentence id="2353">So, the front part was occupied, the main part of the villa was occupied by Mrs. Stein who was Latvian. </sentence><sentence id="2354">Her husband was Jewish. </sentence><sentence id="2355">So, she lived there with a daughter, and Mr. Stein, the Kessel's -- the husband was already killed, Mrs. Kessel and her two daughters, and my brother and I and my mother, we lived behind the building what used to be known as the servant's quarters. </sentence><sentence id="2356">We lived there for a while until we had to move from there and moved to another quarter which was near my school where we were in three rooms -- one, two, three. </sentence><sentence id="2357">We were one -- my brother and his newly acquired wife, myself -- we lived, slept in one room. </sentence><sentence id="2358">My mother slept in another room, another woman -- Mrs. Boop slept in a room that was in Mrs.Boop's apartment. </sentence><sentence id="2359">Yes, she was killed during the war, and two young women slept in another room. </sentence><sentence id="2360">So we were about six or seven people in this small apartment of about four or five rooms, excluding the kitchen. </sentence><sentence id="2361">And, from there, well an announcement came that we will be moved to a ghetto -- we'll have to move to a ghetto which is ina part of Libau, a section of Libau that I did not know very well, and there in the ghetto this was in the summer of "43, we were assigned to a flat in a basement that had a kind of an outhouse, the toilet was a few steps -- we had to go about five or six steps, right off the entrance, rear entrance of the building, and there including the kitchen there were one, two, three rooms. </sentence><sentence id="2362">So, two rooms and where people could sleep. </sentence><sentence id="2363">In these two rooms, my brother and his wife, and my mother and I slept, in this basement apartment, and in the other room there were about four people who slept, and we shared the same toilet. </sentence><sentence id="2364">We shared the bathroom, the bathing facilities, and we made the best of this situation. </sentence><sentence id="2365">I was working for a while in the ghetto in the garden, vegetable garden, and then I was "asked, invited" to become the commandant's runner in the Libau ghetto. </sentence><sentence id="2366">The commandant was not a bad person actually, Kerscher. </sentence><sentence id="2367">He closed his eyes to many things especially when people brought in some extra food to the ghetto. </sentence><sentence id="2368">He did not make a big deal out of it, but of course, we also managed to give him things that is not only the Schwabs but other people with means before the war who had saved a gold coin here, a diamond there, a fur coat, whatever, gave it to him, and this reminds me even before we moved into the ghetto, there were collections of gold coins. </sentence><sentence id="2369">This in order to try to release Jews from the prison to bribe the Germans, et cetera. </sentence><sentence id="2370">So, this was -- I remember people coming around for specific arrests that were made and collecting, because we were told if we gathered this and this and this and this, we would be able to get that person out of prison and so on and so forth. </sentence><sentence id="2371">But, this brings me back to before the ghetto, way before the ghetto. </sentence><sentence id="2372">Immediately after the revolution in 1917, Lenin needed hard currency, and opened up the palaces. </sentence><sentence id="2373">You could buy everything and anything for very little money. </sentence><sentence id="2374">And, we had antique -- an antique for example living room that came from one of the Czarist palaces. </sentence><sentence id="2375">We had a chandelier a cobalt with gold chandelier that came from one of the palaces that my grandparents bought and some of it gave to my father as a gift after World War I, immediately, and some that my father bought including some art works from famous Russian artists that he bought when he was serving in Russia, and right after the revolution that he bought and brought it back to Latvia. </sentence><sentence id="2376">So, in addition to the Persian carpets and the Grand piano, et cetera, this was very exclusive furniture that we had from Czarist palaces including a number of chandeliers. </sentence><sentence id="2377">I remember two in particular, and all this was taken by the Germans before we came even to the ghetto. </sentence><sentence id="2378">And, not only the German , but also the German Navy. </sentence><sentence id="2379">There was a certain Inspector Ulmann of the German Navy. </sentence><sentence id="2380">Incidentally, the old -- where we lived before World War IL, the building that became the headquarters of the Communist Party during World War II became the headquarters of the German Navy for the region, and this Inspector Ulmann came very often to our apartment, and with a crew would take a lot of the things from the apartment, and then of course, we also had people fromthe _ coming with their crews to take, and there was one guy from the by the name of Strott, S-t-r-o-t-t, who was a collector of stamps, and my late brother had a huge stamp collection and he traded stamps with all over the world. </sentence><sentence id="2381">There was actually an exhibition here in Philadelphia in memoriam for my brother, a big stamp collection, where it is all described and I have a photograph with my late mother, still. </sentence><sentence id="2382">She was already sick and we went to Philadelphia. </sentence><sentence id="2383">This must have be in 1963, when there was this big exhibition in Philadelphia. </sentence><sentence id="2384">And, he took, and I'm sure he took it for himself because he was an art collector, and then we had to two Leica cameras, one German and one Russian Leica, I remember, and we gave one of them to one of the Latvians who came to the house to look for things. </sentence><sentence id="2385">I think, and I would have to establish this, I'm not sure, but one of the Latvians was a notorious murderer by the name of Cukurs. </sentence><sentence id="2386">He had several fingers missing. </sentence><sentence id="2387">I don't know how come, but I remember fingers were missing, and for some reason I associate him with the name Cukurs who was a deputy to Arias, the famous Arias, commander of Latvians who killed Jews with a vengeance. </sentence><sentence id="2388">And, this man with the fingers came and looked for things, and I remember very distinctly my mother giving him one of the Leicas because we had two still hidden in the apartment. </sentence><sentence id="2389">This is when we were still living in the apartment to which we moved during the Russian period. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2433">Q: The smaller. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2435">A: Yes, the smaller apartment. </sentence><sentence id="2436">So, these are some of the things that suddenly come back about the furniture so on and so forth. </sentence><sentence id="2437">Now, how did we get up to this question? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2441">Q: You went back from the ghetto, but I would like to stay in this period for a moment, and ask you what was probably a peculiar question. </sentence><sentence id="2442">Was there anything like a funeral for your father? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2445">A: No. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2447">Q: Nothing? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2449">A: No, we never saw him again. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2451">Q: Because you never- </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2453">A: Nothing, never saw him, no, no. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2455">Q: So, did your mother go into mourning in some way? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2457">A: You couldn't mourn in the sense in those days you would wear black for a whole year, et cetera. </sentence><sentence id="2458">This you couldn't do. </sentence><sentence id="2459">There was no way of doing it. </sentence><sentence id="2460">You had to go in the morning to work whatever, and then they would come back and in the evening hoping to find me still there, alive, et cetera. </sentence><sentence id="2461">So- </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2467">Q: So, there's really no time for any- </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2469">A: Shiva or so on, no. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2471">Q: There's no way to do that. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2473">A: No, I don't remember -- we didn't even know exactly the date, but this was irrelevant, but I don't remember a Shiva. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2475">Q: And, do you remember yourself responding in way like your mother because you lost your father, or did you not understand what it really meant to lose your father? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2477">A: I understood. </sentence><sentence id="2478">I missed him very much, but I didn't understand what it meant that he was shot, but then I had some sort of an inkling because when he came home from the cemetery where he identified my cousin that the person was suddenly dead, and my father was arrested. </sentence><sentence id="2479">What I couldn't understand is that I'll never see him again. </sentence><sentence id="2480">This I do remember, that I may never see him again. </sentence><sentence id="2481">This I do remember very, very distinctly, yeah. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2487">Q: How did you -- was there a notice to go into the ghetto? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2489">A: Yes the bekantmachung </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2491">Q: And, what is that? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2493">A: The bekantmachung means a kind of an announcement. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2495">Q: So, it was a public announcement? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2497">A: It was a public announcement. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2499">Q: Like a poster? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2501">A: Yes, yes, by that and that date we had to move in, and then we were assigned the living quarters. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2503">Q: So, do you even as a child begin to feel that your life is getting more and more constricted, or you have no- </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2505">A: Oh, yes, not only this, but I was at a certain point coming to this, even going back before the ghetto when we had to wear the yellow star and had to deliver our radios and other things right after the occupation, and we were not permitted to go on the sidewalks as Jews. </sentence><sentence id="2506">We could only go right off the sidewalk, and I remember it was in the winter, going and a fellow student, a girl, came in my direction. </sentence><sentence id="2507">We were in the same class, and we walked and I wanted to say hello to her, and it happened to be a girl I fancied as a child. </sentence><sentence id="2508">Veltina was her name. </sentence><sentence id="2509">She sort of looked away, and I felt embarrassed that I was a Jew, that I had to wear this and I could not go on the sidewalk. </sentence><sentence id="2510">It was something strange. </sentence><sentence id="2511">Why should I feel embarrassed? </sentence><sentence id="2512">But, I remember feeling embarrassed that I am who I am. </sentence><sentence id="2513">It's a very strange sensation that I had, just as strange as the same winter when I thought maybe a German victory would be helpful to us. </sentence><sentence id="2514">Let the Germans win. </sentence><sentence id="2515">Logical, perhaps for a child, but for an adult, obviously not. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2527">Q: Did you ever say anything to your mother or your brother that you were embarrassed, felt ashamed? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2529">A: Not in this context, in a different context. </sentence><sentence id="2530">The children in the ghetto didn't like to play with me because I didn't speak Yiddish. </sentence><sentence id="2531">I spoke German, and they used to call me kind of a yeke. </sentence><sentence id="2532">I did not speak it, and I remember going to my mother crying saying, "The children don't want to play with me because I don't speak Yiddish", and I remember my mother saying to me, "George, there's really nothing I can do about it. </sentence><sentence id="2533">I don't speak Yiddish either. </sentence><sentence id="2534">We have to make the best of the situation." </sentence><sentence id="2535">And, it is in this context that I began to acquire Yiddish because this became the lingual the accepted language in camp, et cetera. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2543">Q: Isee. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2545">A: So, just like I acquired Russian, I acquired a smattering of Yiddish. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2547">Q: The Jews that you are meeting in the ghetto, were they not of your economic class because the Russians had sent out most of the Bourgeois? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2549">A: They didn't send out most of the Bourgeois. </sentence><sentence id="2550">They sent out a good number, but I assume, but in those days I didn't think in terms of classes, et cetera. </sentence><sentence id="2551">I didn't think in terms -- I didn't think in these terms, but in retrospect, I would say that they came from a milieu from which I did not come, period. </sentence><sentence id="2552">I mean, that's how I would put it now. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2557">Q: And, did that make you feel uncomfortable because they were so dissimilar in terms of background? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2559">A: No, I felt -- I felt bad that they would not accept me and at the same time, I was envious because they were stronger than I was. </sentence><sentence id="2560">They were better athletes than I was. </sentence><sentence id="2561">In many ways, they were far superior to me. </sentence><sentence id="2562">So, I was envious actually, and they spoke Yiddish which I did not. </sentence><sentence id="2563">So, I was envious too. </sentence><sentence id="2564">But, as a child, you can acquire language very easily. </sentence><sentence id="2565">So- </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2573">Q: So, how quickly did you acquire Yiddish? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2575">A: I guess I still probably have a vocabulary of about 150 or 200 words. </sentence><sentence id="2576">So, I could get by. </sentence><sentence id="2577">In other words, with my limited vocabulary, I could get by, and but also interesting because the Yiddish we speak in the Baltic countries is different from the Polish Yiddish. </sentence><sentence id="2578">For example, I'm now the Vice President of the Sholom Aleichem Foundation even though my Yiddish is almost non-existent as is Belle Kaufman's Yiddish almost non-existent, the granddaughter of Sholom Aleichem, who is still alive at 93 and is our Chairman. </sentence><sentence id="2579">When we have the annual meetings of the Sholom Aleichem meetings in New York commemorating his death because it's according to his will, when some of the Yiddish actors read his writings in the Polish Yiddish especially in the . </sentence><sentence id="2580">Yiddish, I don't understand 95 percent. </sentence><sentence id="2581">If somebody reads it with a Baltic accent, not an accent, but pronunciation, I understand fifty percent because the Yiddish is more akin to the German. </sentence><sentence id="2582">To give you just one example, when you say -- in German you say , in the Baltic Yiddish it would be __, and in the Yiddish it would be " </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2592">Q: So, it's quite different? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2594">A: Quite different. </sentence><sentence id="2595">So, I just I have difficulties with this, yeah. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2598">Q: Did you mother learn Yiddish in the ghetto also? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2600">A: I don't think so. </sentence><sentence id="2601">I don't think so. </sentence><sentence id="2602">This was not a problem for her. </sentence><sentence id="2603">It was a problem for- </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2608">Q: For you. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2610">A: For me, yes. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2612">Q: I think we need to change the tape. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="2614">End of Tape 5    Tape 6 </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2617">Q: George, let me just go way back for a second just so we get a context for your family. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="2619">I assume that your father did not become very wealthy because he was a doctor in Lativa, that there was money in the family before. </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2620">A: Yes, there was money in the family before, but he also did very well, and I remember my mother telling me that he would come home and take out from his pockets lots of money saying, "You have brought me a lot of luck, Clairehen, Claire. </sentence><sentence id="2621">Look how well I'm doing in my practice." </sentence><sentence id="2622">So, independently of his parents, but my grandfather was a big merchant in the grains -- import and export -- and, we had at least one warehouse that I was aware of with elevators in front of it, railroad tracks, right at the pier, because he exported a lot to England and elsewhere, but one of my relatives told me that we had another warehouse on the other side of the pier exactly facing it. </sentence><sentence id="2623">This I don't know. </sentence><sentence id="2624">Maybe they sold it very early on, but I only knew of the other one because it was not sold until the late "30s, the other one. </sentence><sentence id="2625">So, maybe the first one they didn't bother talking about. </sentence><sentence id="2626">But, I did not know until I heard about it over here that there was a second one. </sentence><sentence id="2627">Also, to give you a little background, what I found out over here is that when the governor of St. Petersburg came to Libau, he would always come to Libau and play bridge with my grandfather, and they were very good friends, but I would think that the big money came from my grandfather. </sentence><sentence id="2628">But, my father did very well in his practice, in his practice, yes. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2638">Q: And, was your mother's family a well-to-do family also? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2640">A: Not as well-off as my father's family, but in the six sisters, three brothers, they all went to universities, the three brothers. </sentence><sentence id="2641">The six sisters all went to gymnasium, and there you had to pay in those days and music conservatory. </sentence><sentence id="2642">My grandfather owned an upscale delicatessen store, and my mother tells me he brought home the most delicious things everyday from the delicatessen something like in Paris, and my grandmother, the big money apparently came from my grandmother who came from the Russian city of and her maiden name was . </sentence><sentence id="2643">She came from a very, very well-to-do family, and each daughter, and there was a large family, each daughter received a house or a villa as a dowry. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2648">Q: Wow. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2650">A: Yeah, so, and she had six sisters and three brothers and all were educated this and that so, you had to have some means in order to do this. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2652">Q: Right. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2654">A: And, in my father's family, the mother of my cousin over here studied at the University of Geneva in those days before World War I, and Grenoble in France. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2656">Q: Interesting. </sentence><sentence id="2657">It seemed important to get a bit of that background which we didn't get before. </sentence><sentence id="2658">Now, let's go back to this not so great situation in the ghetto. </sentence><sentence id="2659">How did you become a runner for the commandant? </sentence><sentence id="2660">Do you know? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2666">A: My German was good. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2668">Q: Clearly. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2670">A: Yes, it was my native tongue, maybe I don't know. </sentence><sentence id="2671">It's an interpretation. </sentence><sentence id="2672">Maybe this was one reason why I was "invited" to become his runner. </sentence><sentence id="2673">A second reason perhaps, it's my interpretation again is because I came from a certain background. </sentence><sentence id="2674">I don't know if this played a role, but in addition to being a runner for him - when I would have to, when I would get a pass that nothing should happen to me while I brng a watch which was repaired in the ghetto to, let's say to or to SS who was the head of the SS in Libau or to Inspector of the . </sentence><sentence id="2675">So, and I could communicate with the staff over there whatever it is in German. </sentence><sentence id="2676">Perhaps this is a reason, but again, as | said before, it's pure speculation and I do not know the facts. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2684">Q: So, the job that you had to be a runner was primarily going from inside the ghetto outside delivering. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2686">A: And, also keeping count of the inmates. </sentence><sentence id="2687">When we moved into the ghetto, we had something like 823 people survived out of community of close to 8,000. </sentence><sentence id="2688">And, when -- in the morning when they left, they were given a tag, a metal tag so I had to give them the metal tags as they went out to work in columns, and in the late afternoon, I had to collect these tags and hang them up. </sentence><sentence id="2689">So, I remember the numbers, and you could see immediately if somebody escaped or what. </sentence><sentence id="2690">The number, you associated that with a name, and that is how you kept tabs. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2696">Q: And, did you have to write down the person to whom you gave the number? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2698">A: No, everyone had his number or her number. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2700">Q: I see. </sentence><sentence id="2701">So, that was their number. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2704">A: Yes. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2706">Q: What was this like? </sentence><sentence id="2707">You were a kid doing this work for this German. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2710">A: You didn't think along those lines. </sentence><sentence id="2711">You thought about how to survive in this milieu. </sentence><sentence id="2712">At times, we had basketball games arranged. </sentence><sentence id="2713">There was a school for children which I attended on occasion. </sentence><sentence id="2714">It didn't last very long because we were not very long in the ghetto. </sentence><sentence id="2715">But, by and large, there wasn't much time for self-reflection. </sentence><sentence id="2716">At least, I do not recollect. </sentence><sentence id="2717">I do recollect being concerned on how to survive, and under the circumstances, we were still lucky because I had my mother and I had my brother. </sentence><sentence id="2718">We lost our father, but there were others who had lost more than just a brother and a father, et cetera. </sentence><sentence id="2719">So, in the circumstances, I -- I still felt "good that I had my brother and my mother". </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2731">Q: And, they, I'm assuming, were also working. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2733">A: Working, yes, my mother was working for the . </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2735">Q: Oh, that was where she was working for the ? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2737">A: Yes, and my -- well, she was already working for the way back in deg41. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2739">Q: Isee. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2741">A: But, for a short time between let's say August and September and October when she was working for the Air Force because when the big action came, she was already working and December was a very big action, she was already working for the mistress because she had the letter from the that we can not be touched. </sentence><sentence id="2742">is what we called... </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2745">Q: That December of "41. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2747">A: Yeah, "41, that was December yeah, were thousands were rounded up and killed in </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2749">Q: So, after that there was about a thousand Jews left, I think, or maybe 900 Jews. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2751">A: Well, when we moved into the ghetto in 43 there were about 820, yes. </sentence><sentence id="2752">I remember because I was in charge of the big board with the tags. </sentence><sentence id="2753">So, I knew how many Jews came into the ghetto and how many- </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2757">Q: How many? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2759">A: Yeah, and who stayed in the ghetto because those who stayed in the ghetto I did not give a tag in the morning. </sentence><sentence id="2760">So, you could see the people for illness or whatever. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2763">Q: Right. </sentence><sentence id="2764">How long are you there in the ghetto? </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3235">A: That was okay. </sentence><sentence id="3236">In the mornings, I remember I was starved all ready, but I didn't suffer all that much from hunger, but I remember I would say to my mother, "Momika, I'm so hungry." </sentence><sentence id="3237">So, she would give me her portion. </sentence><sentence id="3238">I said, "But, did you eat?" " </sentence><sentence id="3239">Yes, yes, I am full." </sentence><sentence id="3240">She would say, but she was not, but she threw me her portion because in the mornings we would receive moldy bread, some sugar, some kind of a marmalade, and this was very bad because -- this was bad because we all got diarrhea from it, and a kind of a coffee that didn't taste like coffee at least to me as a child. </sentence><sentence id="3241">It was terrible, but it wasn't enough for me. </sentence><sentence id="3242">So, I asked my mother, and she very often was able to throw me her portion, and I ate, and I remember at that time, there was a Mr. Kaufman who was a friend from before the war. </sentence><sentence id="3243">And, I went to him and I said to him in German, "Mr. Kaufman, do you happen to have a slice of bread?I'm very, very hungry." </sentence><sentence id="3244">He said to me, "George, I wish I had I could give you, but I don't." </sentence><sentence id="3245">And, I'll never forget this. </sentence><sentence id="3246">He died in New York. </sentence><sentence id="3247">He was the first chairman of the Jewish Survivors of Latvia, and he always remembered this, and I remember this particular incident as well. </sentence><sentence id="3248">But, it was done still. </sentence><sentence id="3249">It was still Herr Kaufman, Mr.Kaufman that I addressed him. </sentence><sentence id="3250">It was not Max or sort of the way we're accustomed to here. </sentence><sentence id="3251">Yes, and then, interestingly enough in this Tanklager, which was a tough place, there was a German guard by the name of Hoffmann, the beast par excellence, beat the Jews like anything. </sentence><sentence id="3252">He came I think from Romania or some place from that area, but he liked my mother, and would always address her as Frau Dr. Schwab, and when he was patrolling, he would say, "You can go into this shack" where there was a stove and what we confiscated. </sentence><sentence id="3253">We used to call it organizier, we organized something. </sentence><sentence id="3254">We stole something -- potatoes so we could slice and put it against the oven and roast potatoes. </sentence><sentence id="3255">That became a delicacy. </sentence><sentence id="3256">So, and he permitted me to go with my mother. </sentence><sentence id="3257">So, we could go in. </sentence><sentence id="3258">We could warm-up, et cetera. </sentence><sentence id="3259">We would have our potato so on and so forth. </sentence><sentence id="3260">One day, we were marching toward the Tanklager again in the winter, and my mother told me she had a terrible case of diarrhea and she doesn't know what to do.in German. </sentence><sentence id="3261">She went over to him and said, "I really have to step out." </sentence><sentence id="3262">He said, "Go ahead." </sentence><sentence id="3263">He slowed down the column, permitted my mother to attend to what she had, and then she rejoined the column. </sentence><sentence id="3264">Why did he do it? </sentence><sentence id="3265">I don't know. </sentence><sentence id="3266">My mother was gold blonde, very fair skinned, bluish-grey eyes, looked like a thousand Aryans. </sentence><sentence id="3267">Actually, she was told and that was still going back now in Libau, if she wanted to be saved to be taken to Germany, she could be saved. </sentence><sentence id="3268">She said, "I'll be delighted if I can bring my sons with me." </sentence><sentence id="3269">They said, "No, you can not." </sentence><sentence id="3270">Then, she said, "Then I stay with my sons." </sentence><sentence id="3271">And, that was still in Libau, because they distinguished sometimes the genotype from the phenotype, genetically Jewish versus the appearance, and if your appearance was "Aryan" especially Nordic, which my mother was, then you could manipulate, but she was actually asked. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3312">Q: She was asked? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3314">A: Yeah, and there are other incidents like this after the war, immediately where people in Berlin did not think that she was Jewish because the way she looked when she came to look for me, but maybe when we go into this, we can discuss it later. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3316">Q: Now, is your brother living in this outer camp? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3318">A: Yes, he was living in this outer camp, and sometimes there was communication and youcould _ had little pieces of paper or whatever, and you could communicate. </sentence><sentence id="3319">And, he communicated with my mother that it is possible to bribe the commandant Kohler of the reichsbahn where my brother was at to bring her and me to the reichsbahn, and my mother said yes she is going to send for some gold coins and fur coats. </sentence><sentence id="3320">It was something in because certain of the things we managed to give to a Latvian patient of my father's who was a head of a bank by the name of Abelit. </sentence><sentence id="3321">His name was Abelit, and he did come through, this Abelit, and sent the things to Kohler and Kohler instructed my brother to get a message to me that I should be in the camp on those three days and he will send a car for me. </sentence><sentence id="3322">And, indeed, but not for my mother, but for me. </sentence><sentence id="3323">And, my mother said, "Absolutely you go. </sentence><sentence id="3324">It's ___ and don't worry about me. </sentence><sentence id="3325">I'll be all right." </sentence><sentence id="3326">So, I went and joined my brother, but I was not the only one in the car. </sentence><sentence id="3327">There was apparently a few more who had similar deals because he could be bribed. </sentence><sentence id="3328">He was one who could be bribed. </sentence><sentence id="3329">And, then my mother, we learned later, also went to an out camp to work camp called the SS , the SS vegetable garden for the SS et cetera. </sentence><sentence id="3330">So, that's where she was, and then I saw my mother very briefly. </sentence><sentence id="3331">We had word that she would passing the reichsbahn. </sentence><sentence id="3332">I don't know how we got the word, through whom, but that at that time was a convoy that we should be at the gate or whatever, and we actually saw our mother for maybe two minutes. </sentence><sentence id="3333">We were just able to- </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3352">A: Yes. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3354">Q: She did? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3356">A: Yeah. </sentence><sentence id="3357">When I came to the reichsbahn it was in comparison to Kaiserwald, paradise. </sentence><sentence id="3358">The food was slightly better, no beatings. </sentence><sentence id="3359">I had an attack, I suffered appendicitis. </sentence><sentence id="3360">I was there in the camp hospital for a couple of days until I got better. </sentence><sentence id="3361">Incidentally, I was also in the Kaiserwald, had an attack there. </sentence><sentence id="3362">And, a colleague of my father's, Dr.Sik in Libau was the head of the hospital over there. </sentence><sentence id="3363">He said, "George, I'll take you into the hospital." </sentence><sentence id="3364">And, he kept me there. </sentence><sentence id="3365">On the third day, he said, "George, you better disappear because there's going to be inspection today and we don't know what can happen. </sentence><sentence id="3366">Do the best you can. </sentence><sentence id="3367">Nothing is going to happen to you. </sentence><sentence id="3368">Try not to work too hard or bend too hard." </sentence><sentence id="3369">And, I left, and sure enough some of the sick ones were taken away and shot. </sentence><sentence id="3370">But, the reichsbahn in comparison was not all that bad, food- wise. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3387">Q: Who ran it? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3389">A: It was run by the German reichsbahn, railroad. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3399">A: He could scream. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3401">Q: He could scream. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3403">A: He could scream, yes, but by and large, I don't remember major beatings or so, for example in the Kaiserwald, I remember having received once a smack in my face from the commandant Oberstrumbahnfuhrer Sauer. </sentence><sentence id="3404">I saw stars in front of me. </sentence><sentence id="3405">I was supposed to clear the snow from the walkway, and I perhaps didn't do it as quickly. </sentence><sentence id="3406">So, he came out and said to me, "Hey, you Jew boy, why aren't you working?" </sentence><sentence id="3407">I said, "Tm working," And, he slapped me. </sentence><sentence id="3408">I fell maybe ten feet away from the slap, and I just stars in front of my eyes. </sentence><sentence id="3409">This did not -- was not the case in the reichsbahn, and in the reichsbahn what was my task, I began to "help my brother" he was an auto electrician. </sentence><sentence id="3410">He knew about a car electrician as much as I know about the Chinese language, and I was his assistant, and what we did, what we all did for example when we had to screw in something, we would screw it in not all the way. </sentence><sentence id="3411">It was our way of, "sabotaging" the German war effort. </sentence><sentence id="3412">We would always try to do things not a hundred percent, eighty percent. </sentence><sentence id="3413">Hopefully, something will go wrong. </sentence><sentence id="3414">But, when an SS man would come, and inspect, go around the big halls and inspect somebody would scream out &gt; meant six. </sentence><sentence id="3415">For some reason, I don't know why six which meant inspector be careful. </sentence><sentence id="3416">So, we all immediately- </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3433">A: -got very seriously this and that running around, this was a code word. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3435">Q: Did anybody ever get caught for not doing things right? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3437">A: I don't remember this. </sentence><sentence id="3438">I don't remember this, and then we had a wonderful Jewish couple, German Jewish couple who were working there too, and he and his wife were the elders of this kasernierung Steinhart, Edith Steinhart. </sentence><sentence id="3439">I forget his first name. </sentence><sentence id="3440">They were lovely, lovely people, and they were so to speak belonged to the German Jewish group in the camp, but were very good towards us. </sentence><sentence id="3441">There was a couple from Vienna, lovely people, Maier was their name. </sentence><sentence id="3442">Mr. and Mrs. Maier I remember, lovely, lovely people from Vienna. </sentence><sentence id="3443">There were two German Jewish couples who were a little bit on the rough side, who became much rougher in Stolp, more to say about it. </sentence><sentence id="3444">So, one was Kentcourik from Lubek the other was Grunwald, or Greenwald also from Germany, but I don't remember from what part of Germany. </sentence><sentence id="3445">And suddenly, we knew that the Russians were advancing in the direction of Riga in the late spring of 1944. </sentence><sentence id="3446">Suddenly, we come to the camp, return from our work which was only may about 200 yards from where we were living, and that we all had to appear at an . </sentence><sentence id="3447">That was in July 1944, and there was this SS doctor from the camp, Krebsbach and his deputy, Wisner and Kohler standing and we're in this large hall and we were told to get undressed, get in line, and then there was a selection -- left, right, left, right, left, right. </sentence><sentence id="3448">My brother was sent to the left, and I was sent to the right. </sentence><sentence id="3449">But, my brother said, "Don't worry, Kohler is there. </sentence><sentence id="3450">He knows what we have done." </sentence><sentence id="3451">So on and so forth, "we can do more, don't worry." </sentence><sentence id="3452">My brother was sent to the left. </sentence><sentence id="3453">I was sent to the right, and I never saw my brother again. </sentence><sentence id="3454">My mother saw him still in Kaiserwald, and knew that he would be shot, and he said to my mother, "Don't worry mother. </sentence><sentence id="3455">We're going to take some of the Germans and Latvians, our shooters with us." </sentence><sentence id="3456">My mother felt that she could have rescued him and begged him to come to the fence, but he wouldn't come. </sentence><sentence id="3457">He didn't want to upset my mother. </sentence><sentence id="3458">So, he didn't come to the fence to see her again, and that was the last we heard of him. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3482">Q: So, he was sent back to Kaiserwald, and then they were going to shoot them? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3484">A: Yes, and then from Kaiserwald, they were taken the Rumbala forest where they were killed, yes. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3486">Q: Shot? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3488">A: Yes, but it must have been at the very end of July or the very beginning of August, 1944. </sentence><sentence id="3489">The ones who survived, I came back to the barracks, we came back to the barracks, and I kept on -- my brother was sleeping in the bunk bed next to mine. </sentence><sentence id="3490">I said, "Bubbi, Bubbi, where are you? </sentence><sentence id="3491">Bubbi, Bubbi, where are you?" </sentence><sentence id="3492">And, I had a hunch that this was it. </sentence><sentence id="3493">That I wouldn't see him again, and he was taken probably to be shot, and I was alone now. </sentence><sentence id="3494">It was at this stage that Julius Goldberg, who was in the same barrack, et cetera, he said, "George, I'll take care of you. </sentence><sentence id="3495">For as long as I will live, you will live." </sentence><sentence id="3496">And, Julius Goldberg was strong like an ox, very athletic, a yachtsman before the war, very handsome fellow, at that time probably in his late 20s I would think. </sentence><sentence id="3497">But, he slept over there, and I slept over here, and fine. </sentence><sentence id="3498">A week later, we were taken to a ship. </sentence><sentence id="3499">We were being evacuated because the Russians were coming close. </sentence><sentence id="3500">We were being evacuated, boarded the ship. </sentence><sentence id="3501">That's when we were taken to Stutthof in August 1944. </sentence><sentence id="3502">And, it was a, I guess a troop carrier, what, I don't remember what it was before the war. </sentence><sentence id="3503">Maybe it was a liner or so, but at that stage of the game there were bunks all over the place, troop carrier, I guess. </sentence><sentence id="3504">It was full of concentration camp inmates. </sentence><sentence id="3505">So, I was looking. </sentence><sentence id="3506">Maybe I would see Bubi. </sentence><sentence id="3507">Maybe I would see my mother. </sentence><sentence id="3508">And, we already had concentration camp garb by that- </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3530">Q: You mean striped uniforms. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3532">A: Striped uniforms, and I was looking up, and a woman was looking down without hair. </sentence><sentence id="3533">I didn't know who it was without hair, and suddenly I heard a familiar voice saying, "Georgenka." </sentence><sentence id="3534">My mother's voice. </sentence><sentence id="3535">She was looking down. </sentence><sentence id="3536">She was without hair. </sentence><sentence id="3537">They had taken her and shaved her hair, and there was my mother. </sentence><sentence id="3538">So, for the next three days we could see each other on the ship, and the interesting thing is that while we were going through the bay of Riga, the Russians were shooting at the ship, but missing us by a hundred or two hundred yards, and we just sailed through it, and the artillery shells would fall, go over the ship, fall on the other side maybe a couple of hundred yards from it, and we finally arrived near Danzig. </sentence><sentence id="3539">We were put on the little railroad cars. </sentence><sentence id="3540">What do they call them? </sentence><sentence id="3541">The schmalspurbahn, the German. </sentence><sentence id="3542">It's not the regular, it's- </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3554">Q: Were they half cars? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3556">A: Half cars, and not as wide. </sentence><sentence id="3557">The railroad tracks were not as wide -- lorries, kind of lorries, it's almost a sort of a choo-choo train, et cetera. </sentence><sentence id="3558">So, we were transported to Stutthof in August. </sentence><sentence id="3559">That was Kaiserwald, however bad it was, was paradise in comparison to Stutthof. </sentence><sentence id="3560">We were beaten. </sentence><sentence id="3561">We had to work also on the railroad tracks over there, not far from the gas chamber and crematorium we saw. </sentence><sentence id="3562">We already knew what it was. </sentence><sentence id="3563">The chimney burning all the time, burning the bodies. </sentence><sentence id="3564">So, we knew and the issue was how to survive there. </sentence><sentence id="3565">Food was almost non-existent. </sentence><sentence id="3566">We were all emaciated. </sentence><sentence id="3567">We were all starving, but and I no longer saw my mother. </sentence><sentence id="3568">I no longer saw my mother. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3582">Q: I'm afraid we have to stop there and change the tape. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="3584"> End of Tape 7 Tape 8 </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3587">Q: George, we ended with your saying that you no longer were able to see your mother and coming into Stutthof, the Kaiserwald was paradise in comparison with Stutthof. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="3589">So, could you explain what was going on? </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3590">A: Well, the beatings were almost non-stop now. </sentence><sentence id="3591">The food was even worse than in Kaiserwald. </sentence><sentence id="3592">When we worked on the tracks, we were beaten all the time by the Germans and by the non-Jewish couples, even though I learned what a louse means in Kaiserwald, and began the practice of delousing myself --- the hair and over here and so call in the garb that we had. </sentence><sentence id="3593">Now, we were full of lice in Stutthof. </sentence><sentence id="3594">The facilities were terrible. </sentence><sentence id="3595">Sanitary facilities in Kaiserwald were also bad. </sentence><sentence id="3596">For example, the toilet was a kind of an outhouse. </sentence><sentence id="3597">It was a square pit, and was -- on top of this what was constructed were columns. </sentence><sentence id="3598">Columns was a wooden "bench" maybe six or eight inches and you would have to lift yourself up, that I never fell into the pit was a miracle, and incidentally, there were some kapos that were so bad that they were thrown into the pit by the Jews, non-Jewish couples. </sentence><sentence id="3599">But, in Stutthof it all over shadowed Kaiserwald from every point of view, especially the beatings. </sentence><sentence id="3600">Now, the interesting part was that the reichsbahn requested that the same people be spent to Stolp. </sentence><sentence id="3601">So, I was part of it. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3614">Q: So, you got out of - </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3616">A: I got of Stutthof. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3618">Q: Let me ask you something, George, when you say -- what were they beating you with? </sentence><sentence id="3619">Do you remember? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3622">A: First of all, they would slap you, but then they also had whips -- whips. </sentence><sentence id="3623">They would beat you like you would beat a wild horse when you want them to run or something to that effect. </sentence><sentence id="3624">It didn't matter if you were young or old, et cetera, and the infirm were immediately taken after the appel to be shot, cremated. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3628">Q: And, how were you strong enough to withstand this kind of treatment? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3630">A: I always made myself older, and I always made myself taller, and this was street smartness in a sense. </sentence><sentence id="3631">Now, why was my brother taken? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3634">Q: And, not you? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3636">A: And, not me. </sentence><sentence id="3637">Again, I resorted to the same tactic, but my brother used eyeglasses, and anybody who needed eye et cetera was already concerned infirmed, which we did not know, or he would've hidden the eyeglasses. </sentence><sentence id="3638">So, he was taken. </sentence><sentence id="3639">I did not need eyeglasses. </sentence><sentence id="3640">Yes, I was emaciated, but everyone was emaciated, and however much I suffered from hunger pains, I suffered less than others because my father as a gastroenterologist, et cetera never permitted us to eat huge portions of anything, never permitted us too much, too many of the fatty things. </sentence><sentence id="3641">In between meals, we could have a fruit or something. </sentence><sentence id="3642">He was strict about that -- a fruit or so, but no as we would call it, maybe a piece of this or that, et cetera nothing. </sentence><sentence id="3643">A meal is a meal. </sentence><sentence id="3644">That's when we can eat, but everything in moderate proportion. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3655">Q: So, this was helpful to you? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3657">A: This was very helpful because I could never gorge myself with food, because many of the people and that's what I first learned -- poor people gorge themselves very often believing that they had to put on layers of fat that would protect them from the natural -- from the winters or whatever, and this I only learned subsequently. </sentence><sentence id="3658">I was not conscious of it before the war, but only after the war people talked about the food habits in the camps, and those were my habits. </sentence><sentence id="3659">However hungry I was, as I said before, I was not that hungry. </sentence><sentence id="3660">The day of liberation, as I'll tell you a little later, I mistook soap for bread and I started to eat soap, but this was already on the day of liberation which is still to come. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3665">Q: So, are you in Stutthof for like a month, two months? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3667">A: No. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3669">Q: Not even that long? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3671">A: Not even that long, probably not more than ten days or so the first time around. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3673">Q: Now, you turn 13. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3675">A: I turned- </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3679">A: Later on, I guess in 19- wait a second. </sentence><sentence id="3680">I had a birthday I remember, and this was in 1944, was I 13 in 1944? </sentence><sentence id="3681">I guess so, but this was in November, much later. </sentence><sentence id="3682">I was still now 12 in Stutthof. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3687">Q: So, when is there this sort of semi-Bar Mitzvah party? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3689">A: That was in -- that was later. </sentence><sentence id="3690">That was in November. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3693">Q: In 19- </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3697">Q: 1944. </sentence><sentence id="3698">So, we're still in 1944. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3701">A: Yes, we're still in 1944, in August, 1944. </sentence><sentence id="3702">And, suddenly we were transported from Stutthof to Stolp. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3705">Q: Right. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3707">A: In passenger cars, railroad cars. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3709">Q: Passenger cars? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3711">A: Yes, and the feeling was that the Nazis didn't want to show to their own people that you transport prisoners -- this was our interpretation -- prisoners in cattle cars. </sentence><sentence id="3712">That was our interpretation. </sentence><sentence id="3713">Whether this is true or not, I don't know. </sentence><sentence id="3714">And, that turned out to be a work camp, living right on the premises in the reichsbahn right near the railroad, the main railroad station there. </sentence><sentence id="3715">There I became a carpenter, and I know as much about carpentry as I know about Chinese hieroglyphics. </sentence><sentence id="3716">That I didn't chop off a finger or something or other is still one of those miracles because I have no sense for these things. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3725">A: Helping to repair cattle cars, transportation, et cetera. </sentence><sentence id="3726">Sometimes you needed a board, so you had to do this. </sentence><sentence id="3727">You do that. </sentence><sentence id="3728">Don't ask me what somehow or another, and managed to do what was expected. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3733">Q: You weren't building furniture. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="3735"> A No, no, no I wasn't building furniture. </sentence><sentence id="3736">I was not an artist, along those lines. </sentence><sentence id="3737">No. </sentence><sentence id="3738">I was a plain, plain worker. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3743">Q: Right. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3745">A: The food was manageable over there, and people who worked right near the tracks were able to organize sometimes potatoes, carrots, because they would fall off from the railroad tracks and smuggled into the camps and you could begin to trade a little bit here and there. </sentence><sentence id="3746">So, you could augment the poor food that we got with some of the extras, but a few months later, some people did the same thing, organize some food, and they were caught by the Germans. </sentence><sentence id="3747">And, now, the Germans wanted to teach us a lesson that theft is punishable. </sentence><sentence id="3748">And, what they did was hang the people, and we were forced to march to see the hanging, and then march around the hangers to see them. </sentence><sentence id="3749">How did I survive this one? </sentence><sentence id="3750">When it was announced hanging people, I didn't understand what it means, how a person can hang. </sentence><sentence id="3751">Again, it became interesting to me to look at the person hanging. </sentence><sentence id="3752">I didn't understand that this is involved with death. </sentence><sentence id="3753">I did not put two and two together. </sentence><sentence id="3754">How can a person hang? </sentence><sentence id="3755">And, only while hanging did I realize that the person was hanged and it meant actual death. </sentence><sentence id="3756">I did not connect this before. </sentence><sentence id="3757">So, to me again, it was a kind of a spectacle. </sentence><sentence id="3758">Theater of the Absurd, if you want to call it, or something along those lines. </sentence><sentence id="3759">Sick! </sentence><sentence id="3760">But I remember the context very well because I think about it and how could I have reacted the way I reacted? </sentence><sentence id="3761">And, my answer is, folly of youth, did not understand, and number two, and perhaps even more important than this, curiosity because everything interested me especially that what I didn't understand. </sentence><sentence id="3762">And, this happened three, four months before our liberation when the Russians were already on German soil, and also during this period in Stolp, the German Jewish couples began to behave atrociously to the Eastern European Jews. </sentence><sentence id="3763">When somebody was caught organizing something internally or so, he had to receive twenty lashes, and the German Jewish couples were only delighted to mete out the punishment. </sentence><sentence id="3764">One of them was Kentcourik who was particularly brutal. </sentence><sentence id="3765">For some reason or other, both of these couples Greenwald and Kentcourik liked me, maybe because I spoke their type of German, and left me pretty much alone this and that and were actually nice, but they were absolute -- excuse me for using the term here -- bastards. </sentence><sentence id="3766">And, I'm jumping now forward for a minute. </sentence><sentence id="3767">I was in the same hospital, after, right after the war as Kentcourik, and I came out of the hospital and was brought back by the British to the rehabilitation, to the rehabilitation barrack in the DP camp in Neustadt in Holstein with one of the British Red Cross cars, ambulance cars, and Kentcourik -- I informed the other guys who were there, fellows, many of them that I was liberated with that Kentcourik was coming out. " </sentence><sentence id="3768">Oh, Kentcourik is coming out. </sentence><sentence id="3769">We" ll beat the hell out of him," and Kentcourik came in thinking that's he's coming in as a great hero, and chairs flew into his face, this and that, so on and so forth. </sentence><sentence id="3770">He was taken back to the hospital seriously injured. </sentence><sentence id="3771">He survived this, and after the war he had two daughters, moved with his two daughters to Lubeck where he died subsequently, but I don't remember what happened to his other one, Grunwald, but that was the fate of this German Jewish couple Kentcourik. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3800">Q: George, when you're walking around, how long did they make you walk around these people who were hung? </sentence><sentence id="3801">Just once? </sentence><sentence id="3802">Twice? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3806">A: No, no, no, we were standing at attention walking, I would say about for an hour or so. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3810">A: Yeah, for us to be taught a lesson. </sentence><sentence id="3811">So, they were hanging there. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3814">Q: Do you think you also took this kind of position -- not just, that it wasn't just curiosity and interest in something new -- and ignorance because you were a kid, but also a way to protect yourself? </sentence><sentence id="3815">Or was that- </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3818">A: You can interpret it as such. </sentence><sentence id="3819">It was a protective mechanism perhaps. </sentence><sentence id="3820">You could -- I didn't think along these lines, but I can see this, yes, I can see this. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3824">Q: Was there- </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3826">A: But, not conscious. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3830">A: There was no conscious. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3832">Q: That I understand, and was there an affect after looking at this for an hour that broke this sort of curiosity? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3834">A: Well, I've been thinking about it ever since this particular episode. </sentence><sentence id="3835">Hanging, et cetera, and when I watch the History Channel, and I see some of the -- some of the things when Mussolini was hung with Clara Petacci, and how they used to hang Russian prisoners, the German and so on and so forth, this always comes back to me, this scene of how I had to watch these people being hanged. </sentence><sentence id="3836">It's something that stays with me. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3840">Q: Stays with you. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3842">A: Yes. </sentence><sentence id="3843">Well, I guess you can interpret my reactions to many of the things in psychological terms as self-protection et cetera. </sentence><sentence id="3844">The whole approach being the theater of the absurd, but looking at it with today's vocabulary and understanding et cetera, but at the time, of course, I did not- </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3848">Q: Right, you didn't have that. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3850">A: I don't have this vocabulary and know this understanding. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3852">Q: But, it must have been scary. </sentence><sentence id="3853">At some point it had to be horribly scary. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3856">A: Absolutely because I could be next. </sentence><sentence id="3857">Yes, you never knew. </sentence><sentence id="3858">Yeah, and, in Stolp I was sleeping in a bunk right next to Julius Goldberg. </sentence><sentence id="3859">Again, everything straw, this and that, lice, delousing was an every evening activity. </sentence><sentence id="3860">Bathroom facility better than Stutthof and Riga, but still -- there was water. </sentence><sentence id="3861">You could wash yourself in the barrack which was a converted -- the barrack was actually not a true barrack. </sentence><sentence id="3862">It was for a steam engine that was converted into a kind of a barrack where we could sleep, bunk beds. </sentence><sentence id="3863">And, then, the Russians were coming very close and they were going to evacuate us, but before then, about the Bar Mitzvah. </sentence><sentence id="3864">It was Eugenia Goldberg who was a nurse, and persuaded the SS woman to let her do something for me. </sentence><sentence id="3865">And, she "baked" something from potatoes which was the most delicious thing I thought I'd ever eaten because I was so starved -- a kind of a potato pie. </sentence><sentence id="3866">She explained it to Sheila Robbins, maybe she would be able to explain it to you what it was, and then the SS woman was present. </sentence><sentence id="3867">I was permitted to come in from the man's quarter including Julius Goldberg, her husband. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3880">Q: Oh, it is the husband. </sentence><sentence id="3881">They are related. </sentence><sentence id="3882">That's what I was going to ask you. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3916">Q: But it was in Stolp </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3918">A: It was in Stolp, yes. </sentence><sentence id="3919">Now, it was not long thereafter, a couple of months actually, I think it was in March, beginning of March or end of February when we were sort of dumped into cattle cars again, and we were returning to Stutthof But, because the Russians were already nearby and my mother was already liberated nearby which I didn't know. </sentence><sentence id="3920">I found this out only after I met her, we spent about a week in these cattle cars with hardly any food, no facilities to speak of, in the corners we had where the stench was absolutely incredible. </sentence><sentence id="3921">Finally, we came to Danzig and we didn't manage to get to Stutthof and we were brought to another small camp Burggraben, and we marched. </sentence><sentence id="3922">It was a long march from Danzig to Burggraben. </sentence><sentence id="3923">It was very cold, I remember. </sentence><sentence id="3924">It was about easily, easily ten, twelve miles in our circumstance to march. </sentence><sentence id="3925">We arrived in Burggrabben. </sentence><sentence id="3926">It was knee deep in mud. </sentence><sentence id="3927">There were no German guards. </sentence><sentence id="3928">It was no man's land between the Russian front and the German front. </sentence><sentence id="3929">The Russians would shoot their artillery across our heads, and the Germans would shoot their artillery across our heads. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3964">Q: Oh, you did get to Stutthof. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3966">A: Yeah, the second time. </sentence><sentence id="3967">Now, Stutthof the first time was paradise in comparison to Stutthof the second time. </sentence><sentence id="3968">Rampant typhoid, hardly any food, Russian plans attacking us, didn't know that it was probably a camp or so. </sentence><sentence id="3969">The ovens burning all the time, hardly anything to eat, people dying left and right, being shot left and right, Germans unleashing their dogs, police dogs. </sentence><sentence id="3970">And, the police dogs biting people including Julius Goldberg was bitten like mad. </sentence><sentence id="3971">His feet swelled up, and we were there for about two weeks, maybe a little longer give or take a week or so when suddenly the order came, "Evacuation." </sentence><sentence id="3972">We're going to be evacuated by boat. </sentence><sentence id="3973">And, again, we were hauled off in these mini-train, these mini-railroad tracks, not the regular ones to barges in Danzig, or near Danzig, barges. </sentence><sentence id="3974">And, then we were taken on these barges on the high seas -- the Baltic, the North Sea. </sentence><sentence id="3975">For the trip, we received a loaf of bread and some water. </sentence><sentence id="3976">That was it because we subsisted on sea water during the trip, salt water. </sentence><sentence id="3977">SS Guards were guarding us, and if you had to step out, you had to do it over the railing and into the water on these barges, and you could see the SS Guards pushing people with their shoes into the Baltic or into the North Sea. </sentence><sentence id="3978">I remember very distinctly I suddenly saw a German coming, passing me. </sentence><sentence id="3979">| thought, well, this was my end, but it passed me and didn't do anything. </sentence><sentence id="3980">And, we were down, et cetera. </sentence><sentence id="3981">To climb up we had no strength left or anything of the sort, but Julius despite his illness, I mean he was as strong as a bull. </sentence><sentence id="3982">I've never seen anything like it in my life. </sentence><sentence id="3983">And, suddenly we were told that we had arrived in Hamburg, but I don't think it was Hamburg, but this is what I remember, and that we had to get out very quickly for Hamburg because the Americans were in Hamburg. </sentence><sentence id="3984">It was actually the Brits, not the Americans, and then, we were taken back to the high seas, and at night the German guards abandoned us, and we were told that we were in minefields. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="4004">Q: On the high seas? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="4006">A: On the high seas, minefields, abandoned and we didn't know what to do. </sentence><sentence id="4007">On our barges, were Norwegian POWs, and they collected the blankets we had still from the camp, and made sails out of them. </sentence><sentence id="4008">And, came close to, very close to the shore that we later learned was Neustadt in Holstein, about 25 miles or kilometers from Lubek, and the decision was made -- this was about four o'clock in the morning, five o'clock in the morning, May the third -- that we would wade to shore and walk in the direction of Hamburg where the Americans are, and we'lI be liberated. </sentence><sentence id="4009">Julius was immediately for wading and was taking me along. </sentence><sentence id="4010">I said, "Julius please, please let me die. </sentence><sentence id="4011">I have no strength. </sentence><sentence id="4012">Please leave me alone!" </sentence><sentence id="4013">I remember Julius was stone. </sentence><sentence id="4014">He said, "Nope, you're coming with me", and took me by the collar and dragged me. </sentence><sentence id="4015">We had to go down, and actually in this very cold May in the North Sea, early morning, and I knew a little bit how to swim from the Baltic. </sentence><sentence id="4016">I grew up on the shores of the Baltic. </sentence><sentence id="4017">I knew, et cetera, but I had no difficulties wading to shore, and we all lined up and people took a long time because there were several barges of people, and there were people still there who didn't want to leave, and left very slowly, and suddenly, units of the German Navy arrive because it turned out that this was a U-boat school in Neustadt in Holstein, a huge U-boat school. </sentence><sentence id="4018">Units of the German Navy arrived. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="4033">Q: Okay, I've got to - Hold that thought because we have to change the tape. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="4038">Q: George, I want to go back to your scene with Goldberg. </sentence><sentence id="4039">This is the first time that you've said, "I want to die. </sentence><sentence id="4040">Leave me alone." </sentence><sentence id="4041">You've never indicated in any of the ways you told your story that you wanted to die. </sentence><sentence id="4042">Why now? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="4048">A: By now, I really felt totally, completely, totally exhausted -- completely and totally starved because we were subsisting on sea water. </sentence><sentence id="4049">How long can you subsist on sea water? </sentence><sentence id="4050">I just wanted to sleep because we were crowded in like herring, but he wouldn't let go of me. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="4054">Q: That's really something. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="4056">A: Yeah, and then when we finally waded there, when the German troops arrived from the _ marina, from the naval units, they started shooting at random. </sentence><sentence id="4057">People were still on the barges, wading toward the shore. </sentence><sentence id="4058">People who were sitting, who were too weak to get up were shot immediately. </sentence><sentence id="4059">It was the day of liberation, incidentally. </sentence><sentence id="4060">And, now another march. </sentence><sentence id="4061">We were going to march someplace, and I said to Julius, again, "Julius, please leave me alone! </sentence><sentence id="4062">I want to die." </sentence><sentence id="4063">And, he was all swollen from the dog where he was bitten. </sentence><sentence id="4064">He said, "No", and again he pushed me. </sentence><sentence id="4065">And, the march was not a long one, a couple of miles, and we arrived at this huge complex, a German U-boat school. </sentence><sentence id="4066">There was a huge soccer field, and there were thousands and thousands of people there from other camps. </sentence><sentence id="4067">And, we were told that there is a ship by the name of Cap Arcorna that we're going to be put on that ship, and we will sale for I don't remember where. </sentence><sentence id="4068">I was semi-delirious and I was really starved, and in the shuffle in these thousands of people, I lost Julius. </sentence><sentence id="4069">I wandered around. </sentence><sentence id="4070">British planes were overhead and shooting, and the Cap Arcona was offshore, but there was another ship, the Athens, and we were supposed to line up and get onto the Athens to be taken to the Cap Arcorna. </sentence><sentence id="4071">And, I wandered around still, and suddenly, I see a pile of things, and I was in a delirious state by then, a German guard looking at it, guns -- all sorts of things, and saw there what I would call today -- it was soap, but I mistook it for bread. </sentence><sentence id="4072">I picked it up and I started to eat it, and I couldn't. </sentence><sentence id="4073">I couldn't bite it. </sentence><sentence id="4074">I couldn't eat it. </sentence><sentence id="4075">It didn't taste like bread. </sentence><sentence id="4076">So, I threw it away, and I walked over to the guard and said to him, "May I have a slice of bread?" </sentence><sentence id="4077">He said, "Why don't you walk over to this tank? </sentence><sentence id="4078">This is a British tank. </sentence><sentence id="4079">You have been liberated, walk over and you'll get something." </sentence><sentence id="4080">So, I walked over to the tank. </sentence><sentence id="4081">The British, I decided to speak English, I said, "I'm very, very hungry. </sentence><sentence id="4082">Can I please have a slice of bread?" </sentence><sentence id="4083">So, they gave me these cookies, a number of cookies to eat because they didn't have bread, but it was some sort of cookies. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="4134">Q: Right. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="4136">A: Immediately, I was too weak to even carry that much, but Julius and I and some others went into a barrack and took over the rooms. </sentence><sentence id="4137">The bunk beds was clean, everything. </sentence><sentence id="4138">And, that's where we decided we're going to be for the night, and we were basically free, but it didn't mean anything to me being free. </sentence><sentence id="4139">I did receive some crackers, something else, et cetera. </sentence><sentence id="4140">So, my basic hunger was to an extent satiated, and then I went out myself and I organized something also one of those cans I managed to bring back. </sentence><sentence id="4141">Suddenly, there's a knock on the door and several Poles walked in, looked around, and said among themselves, and by then I knew some Polish because I lived with Poles at the camps, "This is our place and out you Jew! </sentence><sentence id="4142">Out! </sentence><sentence id="4143">You out!" </sentence><sentence id="4144">He didn't say Jews, and the Jews said, "You better get out or else." </sentence><sentence id="4145">And, Julius was in the forefront as sick as he was. </sentence><sentence id="4146">Those days are over. </sentence><sentence id="4147">They left quietly, and we stayed there. </sentence><sentence id="4148">Now, while we were still on the barges, we heard the best news of all that Hitler was killed fighting the Russians. </sentence><sentence id="4149">He was killed in Berlin. </sentence><sentence id="4150">It was very, very late April. </sentence><sentence id="4151">It must have been about the 29" or 30" of April, just a few days before we were liberated. </sentence><sentence id="4152">We were liberated on the third of May by the British. </sentence><sentence id="4153">And, the day Germany officially capitulated, I collapsed out of total weakness and I was taken to the hospital in Neustadt in Holstein. </sentence><sentence id="4154">The many, many other prisoners from Libau, from Riga, from German Jews that I met subsequently, Czech Jews, so on and so forth were all there, and I stayed for a good number of weeks. </sentence><sentence id="4155">I think four or six weeks I stayed there. </sentence></p></dialogue>
