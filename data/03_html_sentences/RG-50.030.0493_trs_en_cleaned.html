<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="936">Q: Now, are you beginning -- forget the Jewishness part for a moment -- but, are you beginning to feel the harshness of what war means, and what occupation means, or is this you think because they're communists and so- </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="938">A: They're communists and we were vitriolicly anti-communist, and in my class, almost everyone joined the Communist Pioneers. </sentence><sentence id="939">I did not because we belonged to the "Bourgeois Class" and we were -- the class was being lambasted all the time. </sentence><sentence id="940">And, we were scared, but nothing seemed to happen, nothing happened until one week before the outbreak of the war. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="952">Q: Now, when you say that you were -- and I'm assuming you mean the family -- was vitriolicly anti-Communist, is that what you believed about the Communists or is that because the Communists saw you as Bourgeois and would not accept you? </sentence><sentence id="953">Or, was it both? </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="966">Q: And, let me ask you something -- is part of the reason also that you didn't want to join not just ideological but the fact that they were also very disciplined and you were going to be indoctrinated on certain things, or you just didn't agree with them? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="968">A: I just didn't agree with them, and I didn't -- at that time, I tried to intuit myself into that situation. </sentence><sentence id="969">At that time, I simply thought that Communism was wrong. </sentence><sentence id="970">Why? </sentence><sentence id="971">I don't know. </sentence></p></dialogue>
