<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="17">A: It was Lore, and nobody can pronounce it the way my mother did, which is Loourie, you see, is the Austrian way to do it. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="19">Q: So, it was a very long O. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="21">A: In -- and in -- while I lived in England, I was Lorry, like a truck. </sentence><sentence id="22">But now people ask me how to pronounce it and I say 0-open season, any -- </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="23">Q: O -- and what was your date of birth? </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="24">A: March 8", 1928. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="26">Q: Now tell me something. </sentence><sentence id="27">This is, for me, somewhat odd way to start, but you wrote a novel about your -- about your experiences in Vienna and going to England. </sentence><sentence id="28">Why did you decide to write a novel and not a memoir? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="32">A: Because I was really less interested in the history than in being a writer. </sentence><sentence id="33">And for many years -- I -- I have written little stories before that, and I came to the point in my 20's when it seemed to me I had no subject. </sentence><sentence id="34">I hadn't been in love, I hadn't died. </sentence><sentence id="35">None of the big events had happened to me, and I wanted to be writing. </sentence><sentence id="36">And it seemed to me that these stories that I did have with -- my experiences were a dime a dozen, everybody knew about them. </sentence><sentence id="37">And then one day I -- when i-in -- in my early days in New York, I had gone to the new school and taken a course in creative writing, and we -- the people in that class had a s -- had a -- had a party. </sentence><sentence id="38">And somebody said to me, how did you come to the United States? </sentence><sentence id="39">And I began to tell my -- my Hitler stories. </sentence><sentence id="40">And there was that silence in the room that I have since had as a teacher, but hadn't experienced at that time. </sentence><sentence id="41">I thought, gee, wow, I have stories to tell and it a -- and -- and it came to me that these stories were my subject. </sentence><sentence id="42">But again, I wa -- didn't write them because I wanted to -- what I think is now known as bearing witness. </sentence><sentence id="43">I wanted to be writing. </sentence><sentence id="44">And I -- I mean another answer is that as a novelist you can in a way -- it's a cliche, it's a truism, but you can be truer that you can -- </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="45">Q: Mm-hm. </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="46">A: -- by sticking to the facts. </sentence><sentence id="47">Can I give you an example of -- </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="48">Q: Sure. </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="49">A: -- how writing as a novelist changed what might be a fact. </sentence><sentence id="50">One of the -- one of the chapters in "Other People's Houses" was about my attraction for awhile to the stories of Christianity. </sentence><sentence id="51">No-Notice that I'm -- it's the stories that attracted me. </sentence><sentence id="52">Now, in the chapter about this in "Other People's Houses", I made it may -- the narrative seems to suggest that it was the people in -- my foster parents at the -- of the time, my foster -- two -- two foster mothers tried to convert me. </sentence><sentence id="53">And when they got to -- when th -- one of them at any rate, read the story, s -- read the book, she wrote me and said, but we never tried to convert you. </sentence><sentence id="54">And I wrote back and said absolutely not, you didn't. </sentence><sentence id="55">But for an -- for a story, to be seduced by a person is more -- is a be -- it's a better story than being seduced by an idea. </sentence><sentence id="56">In fact, it's almost impossible novelisticly to write that. </sentence><sentence id="57">So novels suit me better than history, or biography, or auto-biography. </sentence><sentence id="58">It's a long answer. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="70">Q: No, it's very -- it's very interesting. </sentence><sentence id="71">So is -- is doing an interview somewhat problematic for you because you are not being a novelist now, when I ask you questions? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="74">A: Oh, no. </sentence><sentence id="75">I will try and answer you historically. </sentence><sentence id="76">But I -- as we were saying earlier, once you have actually written something, or even told it a lot, something has happened to it. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="80">Q: Yeah, yeah. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="82">A: It -- it becomes overlaid with, I guess a skin. </sentence><sentence id="83">Like an anecdote gets a kind of polish on it that is almost impossible to -- </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="84">Q: To remove that skin. </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="85">A: -- to remove that skin and get back. </sentence><sentence id="86">But it's an interesting thing to do. </sentence><sentence id="87">I think it's what one would do in -- in analysis, I think. </sentence><sentence id="88">When you've got -- you -- you go back to -- to the -- to the -- to the -- to the -- I want to say real, but you go back to the -- to the event as it happened, or try to. </sentence><sentence id="89">And that's an interesting -- so this is interesting thing to do. </sentence><sentence id="90">I don't know how -- how well I can unpack what was -- what was wrapped up. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="97">Q: Well, we-we'll divide our -- our -- your story into a few parts. </sentence><sentence id="98">So let's -- we'll go from 28 to 38 bef -- before you actually leave Vienna. </sentence><sentence id="99">So when you think about your parents as </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="103"> a kid, what is your -- what is your earliest memory of being in Vienna? </sentence><sentence id="104">How -- how far back do you go? </sentence><sentence id="105">Cause you're born in 1928. </sentence><sentence id="106">Are you five, are you four, are you six, eight? </sentence><sentence id="107">Do you have -- </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="108">A: Well, once again, as -- as with all those memories, I don't know what are the memories, and what are the stories told me. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="110">Q: Mm, mm. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="112">A: I mean, I have a lot of memories being a cute kid, very cute, and very much beloved. </sentence><sentence id="113">I was the only grandchild, the only child, the only grandchild, the only niece of two loving uncles. </sentence><sentence id="114">So I was a big deal. </sentence><sentence id="115">I will tell you the embarrassing story which explains this. </sentence><sentence id="116">My mother loved to tell the story against -- she felt it a story against herself, that she took me with her to a ladies" cafe yousa, a -- a coffee klatch. </sentence><sentence id="117">And all the ladies were talking with each other and at the end, as my little coat was being put on, I was reported to have said, here one knows nothing, here one speaks of nothing. </sentence><sentence id="118">I might have been five, or six. </sentence><sentence id="119">And my mother said, what do you mean? </sentence><sentence id="120">And I said, here they don't know that I dance on my toes. </sentence><sentence id="121">Here they don't know that I -- I can do the figure eight on the ice. </sentence><sentence id="122">No, I must have been older, seven -- six or seven [indecipherable]. </sentence><sentence id="123">And my mother was embarrassed and realized that I had been made too much of, and too much admired and too much praise. </sentence><sentence id="124">But I always thought that I'm incredibly lucky to have been brought up by two of the best people in the world that I know. </sentence><sentence id="125">My mother and my Uncle Paul, who -- who were both witty, loving, very, very, very much attached to me. </sentence><sentence id="126">Gave me a lot of space to show off. </sentence><sentence id="127">That was a world in which my poor very lar -- father, who was a six-footer, which was unusual for -- for a European Jew, I think, who was a -- who was an accountant, a chief  ontectnetonancedjuhetneey for tare biormatierabouttfisoeecion accountant in the Bank of Cooksbrock and company, was an outsider. </sentence><sentence id="128">He was odd man out. </sentence><sentence id="129">He was not able to laugh, he was not able to participate in the fun that we had before he walked in the door. </sentence><sentence id="130">He was very dear and very lacking in imagination and became, when I was five -- this certainly is a datable event, and one that I remember, became very ill. </sentence><sentence id="131">He was a bleeder. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="154">Q: Oh. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="156">A: I suppose not th-the worst degree of bleeder, otherwise he wouldn't have survived, but he's -- he was taking my mother is the story, for a bicycle ride along the [indecipherable] the -- the dia -- the Danube -- I don't know what an [indecipherable] what -- what -- what -- what broke down -- wh-what -- what is -- what is supposed to hold the water in? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="158">Q: Dike? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="160">A: Yeah. </sentence><sentence id="161">Anyhow, it was a long road, and they were -- they were riding along it and some partridges -- he saw some partridges and he took his hands off the bicycle and clapped and fell off and began to bleed. </sentence><sentence id="162">And I remember we were in my grandfather's house in the village of Fischamend, which is some half an hour by train from Vienna. </sentence><sentence id="163">Very close now, 10 minutes now from the modern V-Vienna airport, and th-that my grandfather had a house on the main square of the village, a huge house with a store, with my grandfather's straggled store at the bottom. </sentence><sentence id="164">And I remember my parents had their own room back there. </sentence><sentence id="165">My father -- remember my father flat on -- on the bed. </sentence><sentence id="166">He had -- he -- ]-[ remember particular that he was not allowed to have a -- a pillow, and oddly enough I cannot bear to lie for two seconds without a pillow under my head. </sentence><sentence id="167">But that -- he -- there was a bucket of ice water next to his bed with little balls of butter which he was supposed to eat. </sentence><sentence id="168">I don't remem -- I have no idea what kind of a theory that was, but that was -- that's certainly one of my earliest memories of going to see my father lying flat. </sentence><sentence id="169">And it was really from that moment on that he was essentially -- well, in and out of hospital is overstating it, but I -- I do remember coming home from school and my mother saying, put -- don't take off your coat, we're going to go see Daddy, who was once again in the hospital, always with his head flat on the -- on the -- on the white sheet. </sentence><sentence id="170">My mother was always cooking diet for him. </sentence><sentence id="171">I think one of the -- one of the perhaps mistakes my mother made in her very, very lovely relation with me is to use me as a friend to c -- to -- to co -- to have headaches with and to complain of my father's illness, which stood for a lot of other weakness and incapacity, I think. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="185">Q: So your -- your relationship to your father never became as close as your relationship with your mother? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="187">A: It was not -- my relationship to my father was one of regret, that I was not responding adequately to the affection he had for me. </sentence><sentence id="188">I understood that I was not responding, and I re -- I was sorry for him. </sentence><sentence id="189">So was a g -- and my -- th-the man in my life was my Uncle Paul, who was then -- </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="190">Q: Not your father. </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="191">A: -- seven years younger than my mother, who lived with us while he went to the -- to study at the -- at medic -- at the school of medicine, a -- ma -- University of lon -- of Vienna, and lived with us and read stories to me and played the guitar for me and told me about things like -- I remember that he had a professor called Professor Tort -- I mean, Professor Death, and he told me about -- I -- I can't think of the word now, hypo -- hyp -- hypnosis. </sentence><sentence id="192">I mean, here I was in my -- about seven years old, learning these fascinating things from my uncle, who would sit by my bedside and tell me -- tell me -- tell me about the world. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="196">Q: Right. </sentence><sentence id="197">Was your father jealous of Paul? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="200">A: My father wooed me. </sentence><sentence id="201">He wooed me by taking me out for ice cream, and my mother had told us not to have ice cream, it would spoil my lunch. </sentence><sentence id="202">It was always something the matter with what -- what my poor father did. </sentence><sentence id="203">I have a curious memory around the Christmastime and Vienna was full of -- of Christmas things. </sentence><sentence id="204">My father said, I'll take you across the street to look into the toy shop, because it has a Father Christmas there, a Santa Claus. </sentence><sentence id="205">And I said, I've already seen it. </sentence><sentence id="206">And I st -- to this day I regret not giving him the satisfaction of being able to -- </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="207">Q: To take you. </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="208">A: -- give me something that I might enjoy. </sentence><sentence id="209">These are -- I mean, the -- in fact, my relationship to my father seems very vivid, but it is not a -- not a -- it is always a little sad. </sentence><sentence id="210">And of course, he became very ill. </sentence><sentence id="211">As soon -- when we -- when we came to England -- one of the chapters in my book is called "The Alien", and what it's about is my father being ill in a foreign country. </sentence></p></dialogue>
