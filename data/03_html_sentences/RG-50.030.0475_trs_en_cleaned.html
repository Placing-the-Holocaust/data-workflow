<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="473">A: No. </sentence><sentence id="474">First of all, girls were not Bat Mitzvahed until much, much, much later in Greece, so this was unheard of. </sentence><sentence id="475">So there was no particular training, there was no Sunday school as we call it, or Hebrew school. </sentence><sentence id="476">The training was at home, basically. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="481">Q: And what would that training be, and who would it come from? </sentence><sentence id="482">You mentioned your -- your grandmother before, complaining of you going to Brownies on Saturday. </sentence><sentence id="483">But would she be the -- the person who would sort of teach you what you knew about the Jewish faith? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="487">A: Well, it was -- I think a combination of things with my grandmother, it was my parents. </sentence><sentence id="488">But I remember my grandmother was quite s -- had very strong opinions about things, and she would always say that you know, this is not Jewish, this is not the Jewish way. </sentence><sentence id="489">But she had no formal education either. </sentence><sentence id="490">Actually, she went up to fourth or fifth grade, and -- but she had a very strong feeling of who she was. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="495">Q: But that would be normal at the time, I suppose, even for privileged women, not to have a great deal of education, is that right? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="497">A: Yeah, that's true, but she was also a sickly child, so -- in her younger years. </sentence><sentence id="498">She -- I guess if you were sick you didn't go to school, it was as simple as that. </sentence><sentence id="499">So that was it. </sentence><sentence id="500">Her mother died when she was very young, she was like three or four, and she was raised by her brothers, and her sister, who was my other grandmother, and a bit spoiled. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="505">Q: She might have been a great reader, and have educated herself, I don't know. </sentence></p></dialogue>

We" ll continue talking about your grandmother. </sentence><sentence id="511">I assume that you had a very close and loving relationship with her. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="515">A: She used to say I was her favorite grandchild, of course she had three. </sentence><sentence id="516">But I wasn't very happy with her, because she always mingled a lot in my life. </sentence><sentence id="517">And I slept in the same room she did, we had one room, and we shared it, and of course I wanted to have all my toys out, and every night I had to put them back. </sentence><sentence id="518">And this will interfere with the story I had in my mind. </sentence><sentence id="519">I would take my dolls and everything else, and set them outside -- and there was a story [indecipherable] I had imagined. </sentence><sentence id="520">And she would make me put them back, and I didn't like that. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="528">Q: Now ya -- and your sister did not have to share a room. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="530">A: No. </sentence><sentence id="531">She had all the privileges of the firstborn. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="534">Q: I'm wondering if any -- if you have any special -- you must -- memories of these early years. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="536">You mentioned it as a very happy time, but are there particular things that evoke wonderful memories, and I'm thinking of foods, or smells, people, pieces of music. </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="537">A: Yes. </sentence><sentence id="538">Food was a very important part of our lives, and there was -- there were season things, I remember. </sentence><sentence id="539">You could not go to the grocery store and buy tomatoes in the wintertime. </sentence><sentence id="540">First of all, you -- you had to go to the grocery store, or to the produce store and buy things, so there were several stops to buy all these things. </sentence><sentence id="541">What I remember, we had women who worked in that household from the mountain of Pilion. </sentence><sentence id="542">And their parents will come to visit, and they would bring these wonderful baskets of cherries, or fresh strawberries, or figs. </sentence><sentence id="543">And they smelled so good, they were just wonderful, and I always loved it when they came to visit with their daughters, and they would bring all these fresh fruit. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="551">Q: Can you get the same quality of fruit from the same mountains today? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="553">A: Oh, I don't know. </sentence><sentence id="554">Probably yes, but I don't know, I haven't been there for a long time, so I can't -- but I also remember the -- the way they came, they came in little white baskets, or bamboo baskets. </sentence><sentence id="555">And they were covered with fig leaves, so the fruit will stay moist. </sentence><sentence id="556">And it was very, very attractive to look at this. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="561">Q: And you'd have special foods for high holidays, but I suppose there'd be other Greek holidays you'd also celebrate. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="563">A: Yeah, I think -- I don't remember particularly celebrating Christmas, but it was like a gathering, like a family gathering, all people will come, and we'll have a nice meal. </sentence><sentence id="564">I don't know whether we had turkey, I don't remember that. </sentence><sentence id="565">New Year's Eve, or New Year's Day was always special. </sentence><sentence id="566">It still is in Greece. </sentence><sentence id="567">You exchange presents on New Year's Day, so that was fun. </sentence><sentence id="568">Easter was one thing. </sentence><sentence id="569">Tha -- that was basically -- yeah, there were special foods. </sentence><sentence id="570">There was always some wonderful kind of desserts, and other things that my mother -- my mother was an excellent cook. </sentence><sentence id="571">I mean, she was terrific, and I loved everything she ate -- everything she made, I mean. </sentence><sentence id="572">What I remember also, there was a hierarchy, you know, in my house, so when we sat around the table, the food was passed by the maids, first to my grandmother, then to my mother, then to my father, then to my sister, and I was always the last one to be served. </sentence><sentence id="573">So I remember I always liked chicken livers, so -- you know, there was -- the chicken liver was gone, or -- by then. </sentence><sentence id="574">Or I wanted something -- I always wanted something that I didn't have, because I was the youngest. </sentence><sentence id="575">I ate more slowly, so sometimes, you know, the table would be cleared, and I would still be eating. </sentence><sentence id="576">Things like that. </sentence><sentence id="577">So I had a very s -- a very good sense that I was the youngest, and I had to compete with everybody. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="593">Q: Would there have been, though, responsibilities that fell on your older sister, that you were perhaps freed from? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="595">A: Well, she -- she was, I guess, older, and they were expecting more from her, you know. </sentence><sentence id="596">They didn't expect much from me, other than to be a very polite, very well-behaved child. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="599">Q: Yeah. </sentence><sentence id="600">Now, what about school? </sentence><sentence id="601">How old would be -- you be when you started attending any kind of school? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="605">A: I was six years old, and I went straight to first grade. </sentence><sentence id="606">There were no pre-schools those days. </sentence><sentence id="607">And loo -- when I went to first grade, a month later the Italian war broke out. </sentence><sentence id="608">And school was dismissed for awhile. </sentence><sentence id="609">The male teachers were all gone to war, and from then on it's a whole different story, because we had to leave Volos. </sentence><sentence id="610">Our house was taken by the navy, because it was just facing the sea, just about a block from the sea, and it was a good observation point. </sentence><sentence id="611">So we had to leave, pack our things within 24 hours, we had just finished arranging the whole -- whole household, we had just moved to this apartment. </sentence><sentence id="612">And I still remember the wax, and the clean and shiny place. </sentence><sentence id="613">And we had to leave, and put our things in storage, because the Italians were coming. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="623">Q: And how -- how old exactly were you then? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="625">A: I was six years old. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="627">Q: Do you have memories of your parents attitudes or moods at the time? </sentence><sentence id="628">Did you -- I mean, they would probably shield you from some concerns, but do you have any memories that suggest the wonderfully happy times were over? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="631">A: Yes, they did shield me, they were very protective of me. </sentence><sentence id="632">I was very anxious about this war. </sentence><sentence id="633">I remember when I went in school the day the war -- we heard the -- about the war, all the children -- the older children anyway, were telling us that people get killed in the war, that men leave their homes, and go to battle, they get injured. </sentence><sentence id="634">And I was very worried about my father. </sentence><sentence id="635">So when the principal told us that there would be no school that day, and they didn't know if there was going to be school the next day, I ran home crying, asking my mother if my father was going to be the -- in the war, if he was going to be in the army. </sentence><sentence id="636">Well, my father was 40 -- 42 I think then. </sentence><sentence id="637">So my mother calmed me down and reassures me that this wasn't going to happen, and that I    didn't have anything to worry about, we'll all be together, we'll be fine. </sentence><sentence id="638">There may be a war, but we'll be safe. </sentence><sentence id="639">And that was something that I remember very vividly. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="650">Q: And what -- what month and year was that? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="652">A: That was in October of "40, 1940. </sentence><sentence id="653">School had started September, 1940, so it was almost a month later. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="656">Q: And what happened in the next years? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="658">A: The next years -- I remember we -- we stayed -- we moved to Agria, which is a suburb, or it's one little village by the sea, not far from Volos. </sentence><sentence id="659">It's one of the first villages of the Pilion mountain, but it's down very low, by the sea. </sentence><sentence id="660">We moved there. </sentence><sentence id="661">It was also my grandmother, my aunt, who had come from Salonika with her sons, and her husband. </sentence><sentence id="662">So, it was all of us. </sentence><sentence id="663">Now that's -- </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="664">Q: Now, this would be your -- </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="665">A: My -- </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="666">Q: -- oh, the aunt? </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="667">A: My sisters -- my mother's sister. </sentence><sentence id="668">Her son Raymond was 11 months older than me, so he was a good companion, great. </sentence><sentence id="669">I made him played with dolls. </sentence><sentence id="670">He -- he was very accommodating. </sentence><sentence id="671">He was a great guy. </sentence><sentence id="672">So anyway, so we moved to Agria, we rented a place, and we stayed there for, I don't know, the whole summer. </sentence><sentence id="673">Then we returned to Volos, but shortly after, they started bombarding Volos, being a port, this was a prime target. </sentence><sentence id="674">And I remember the bombs falling, and having to run into the shelter. </sentence><sentence id="675">I was quite scared at time. </sentence><sentence id="676">Then we would come out of the shelter, and we will see all sorts of disasters. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="687">Q: Who was doing the bombing, and tell me then about the s -- the shelters. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="689">A: Okay, the -- the bombing was by the British. </sentence><sentence id="690">The shelter was at the basement of the building, and I have a feeling if the building collapsed, you know, we wouldn't be that safe there, but everybody thought they were. </sentence><sentence id="691">So everybody who lived in that apartment building would go there, and also people from the outside, if they happened to hear the siren, that people had to go hiding, and they would come, although they didn't live there. </sentence><sentence id="692">And would stay as long as -- as long as we heard the siren again, which meant that the danger is over, and out you go. </sentence><sentence id="693">Inspect the damage. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="699">Q: Yeah. </sentence><sentence id="700">So y-you would go and take food and bedding with you? </sentence><sentence id="701">What do you remember, or would you go there so fast that you would simply head there with your family as fast as you could? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="705">A: I don't remember taking nothing. </sentence><sentence id="706">Maybe a blanket, possibly. </sentence><sentence id="707">You had to run fast, there was nothing to take, because these things don't last a tremendous amount of time, as far as I remember. </sentence><sentence id="708">I think maybe an hour, maybe two. </sentence><sentence id="709">So that was it. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="715">Q: Let me go back to the -- to place what was happening in the context of the second World War. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="717">Why would the British have been bombing the port of Volos, the third largest port? </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="718">A: Well, I think it was -- it was a protection from -- from -- na -- </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="719">Q: So at this time your life was beginning to change. </sentence><sentence id="720">And then what happened? </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="721">A: Well then, it was a worry. </sentence><sentence id="722">There were curfews. </sentence><sentence id="723">There were precautions taken, you could not have lights at night. </sentence><sentence id="724">We had to put panels with black -- dark paper -- with black paper at the windows so no light would fall through. </sentence><sentence id="725">You couldn't go out past six o'clock or seven o'clock. </sentence><sentence id="726">So things started changing, people were more anxious. </sentence><sentence id="727">When the Italians came, I was fully aware that they were the enemy, and although they were not particularly terrible to Jews, they were still an occupying force, and I was very patriotic, those days. </sentence><sentence id="728">But I also remem -- remember, that was in deg41, when there was a famine, and I remember it very clear. </sentence><sentence id="729">We did not particularly suffer from lack of food, although we didn't have the kind of food we used to have before the war. </sentence><sentence id="730">But when we got food, my mother will hide it, because Italians wi -- would raid the house and look for food. </sentence><sentence id="731">And she would hide things in -- I remember in a great, big pot of gardenias. </sentence><sentence id="732">She would put potatoes, or something, I forget in a pot, or sacks of flour in a big pot, and then put soil, and gardenias on top. </sentence><sentence id="733">Or other things. </sentence><sentence id="734">But I remember they would come and lift the mattresses, and look under -- under the mattress to see if there was anything hiding in there. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="750">Q: And they'd be assuming that you were a well to do family, and might be the very place to have food. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="752">A: Yes. </sentence><sentence id="753">People were really hungry those days. </sentence><sentence id="754">I would see people fall in the streets from hunger. </sentence><sentence id="755">Children. </sentence><sentence id="756">I sti -- I still remember children looking anorectic, you know, this pale, yellow, a green color almost. </sentence><sentence id="757">And just walking and collapsing. </sentence><sentence id="758">It was terrible, absolutely terrible. </sentence><sentence id="759">As I said, I don't think we -- we were hungry, that -- as to not having food, but we certainly didn't have meat. </sentence><sentence id="760">We didn't have eggs, which was a constant supply in the household. </sentence><sentence id="761">We had a lot of beans and chick peas, vegetables, whatever vegetables we can get. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="772">Q: Would you still be sitting down rather formally, with the maid serving all of you according to your hierarchy, even with simpler foods? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="774">A: Yes, yes. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="776">Q: So the -- the staff with your family would in fact be fortunate -- perhaps more fortunate than their families in the -- in the mountains, in perhaps having more food. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="778">A: Well, I think the people in the mountain didn't suffer that much because the earth produced, and many of them had also animals they could slaughter. </sentence><sentence id="779">They had chickens, lamb, whatever. </sentence><sentence id="780">But it was the people in the city that couldn't find food. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="784">Q: And the cause of this famine in Greece, was that because ships could not get through to the port? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="786">A: I think it was mostly because the Italians were taking all the food, but I'm sure that also, you know, supplies couldn't come, yes. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="788">Q: So suffering was really quite considerable? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="790">A: It was considerable, not only in Volos, but also in Athens and other parts of Greece, yes. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="792">Q: Now are there any other things you remember during that period of Italian occupation that be -- the famine, but were the Italians taking any measures against the Jews? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="794">A: No, the Italians did not take any measures against the je -- Jews. </sentence><sentence id="795">First of all, in 1940 through deg43, it was just the Italians. </sentence><sentence id="796">It was in deg43 that Italy capitulated, and then the Germans took over. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="797">No, there was absolutely nothing. </sentence><sentence id="798">I remember there was a big, sort of a club that my father used to go there, and my mother, and occasionally sh -- I would go, which wasn't far from my house, called Exorise thekey, they had the restaurant there, there was a movie theater. </sentence><sentence id="799">And the Italians have taken this, and I guess they lived there, but there were also Italians outside guarding the place, and every time I would pass by, the Italian will say to me, bambina, bambina, and would take candy to give me. </sentence><sentence id="800">Will reach in his pocket, and show me the candy, and I would just walk past him, you know, I just didn't want to have anything to do with him. </sentence><sentence id="801">And so, you know, me -- I mean -- but I -- but I remember some things. </sentence><sentence id="802">I remember a man being beaten with a gun, with the back of the gun. </sentence><sentence id="803">I don't know what he did, but I remember that an Italian was really beating him up. </sentence><sentence id="804">This was -- </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="805">Q: And that would have -- you -- that was something you observed in the street, or -- </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="806">A: Yeah, it was in the street, yeah. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="808">Q: And I'm assuming in your attitude, you'd have taken your cue from your parents, but the -- the Italians would be hated as the occupiers? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="810">A: Yeah, of course, yes. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="812">Q: And then everything changed when the Germans occupied -- moved into Greece in 1943. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="814">A: Right. </sentence><sentence id="815">Volos was under Italian re -- you see, Greece was occu -- was divided in three parts. </sentence><sentence id="816">It was the German sector, which was mostly Salonika, and in the north Athens, Volos, were under Italian occupation, and then Macedonia, and Face were under Bulgarian occupation. </sentence><sentence id="817">The Italians were by far the mildest occu -- you know, occupying force. </sentence><sentence id="818">But I -- we left Volos in 19 -- in the spring of 1943, before the Germans arrived, and we went to Athens. </sentence><sentence id="819">So I never saw Germans in Volos. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="826">Q: And why did your family move to Athens? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="828">A: Well, I think because -- you see, in "43, nothing much was happening yet, but there were rumors about Salonika. </sentence><sentence id="829">My father was a very well informed person, and saw that probably something was going to happen. </sentence><sentence id="830">So he wanted us to be safe. </sentence><sentence id="831">We could not hide in Volos, everybody knew us. </sentence><sentence id="832">Although people were wonderful to us, and very friendly, and very willing to put us up for as long as we needed to. </sentence><sentence id="833">We still were -- everybody knew us, so there was no way of -- of hiding. </sentence><sentence id="834">Of course, there were the mountains, the mountain Pilion that a lot of Jewish people from Volos went to. </sentence><sentence id="835">But that wasn't safe either for us, because as I said, we were quite well known, so Pilion wasn't that terribly far. </sentence><sentence id="836">That's why we left and went to Athens, where we could be somewhat anonymous in there. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="846">Q: Do you remember your parents ever talking about the -- the Jews in Salonika, and I wondered what they knew, and I wondered what they shared. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="848">A: Well, they didn't share anything with me. </sentence><sentence id="849">I was quite young at the time. </sentence><sentence id="850">But I was told that we had to move almost like two or three days before to move, that we were going to Athens. </sentence><sentence id="851">And this was a place I always wanted to go. </sentence><sentence id="852">I always thought of Athens as the magnificent city. </sentence><sentence id="853">So -- but then when I realized that we were not coming back to Volos, it wasn't just a trip, I started thinking differently, and getting a little anxious. </sentence><sentence id="854">Not much was explained to me, and as a result of that, my imagination was wild. </sentence><sentence id="855">I would think all sorts of things, and of course, I couldn't discuss them, because it was like this is for the good of us, or this kind of thing. </sentence><sentence id="856">There kind of answers were -- actually didn't give me much to go with. </sentence><sentence id="857">I think -- </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="858">Q: Did that -- did that make it worse? </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="859">A: For me it did, to a certain extent, because I could never get a straight answer of what was going on, and I knew a lot was going on. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="861">Q: And were you noticing -- do you have memories of noticing a changed mood? </sentence><sentence id="862">Fear on the part of your parents? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="865">A: Yes, yes. </sentence><sentence id="866">I can see the change of mood, I can see the worry. </sentence><sentence id="867">I mean, I could sense it, but I couldn't discuss it, yes. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="871">Q: And you were -- you were 10 then? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="873">A: Right. </sentence><sentence id="874">When we left Volos on that sleek, little cargo boat, with forged papers, actually, to -- to go to Athens, I was 10. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="877">Q: False papers. </sentence><sentence id="878">Now, who would have supplied them, and would you have had Greek Orthodox names, and so on? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="881">A: That's true. </sentence><sentence id="882">We had different names, Greek Orthodox names. </sentence><sentence id="883">And my name was Paulik Sanny. </sentence><sentence id="884">And they used to call me Polly, and sometimes I would forget and somebody would call me Polly, I wouldn't respond. </sentence><sentence id="885">I guess the -- the police would issue false identity card, because    when we went -- we left Volos on this little, tiny boat full of sacks of flour and many rats, we -- the boat broke down, and we had to stop for a couple of nights in -- in the cape. </sentence><sentence id="886">There is -- you see, Volos is like a gulf. </sentence><sentence id="887">The very tip of the -- of the gulf is called Trikery, which is a lovely little place, but we had to stay there for about two or three nights until another boat will come and pick us up, and take us to Evian, and from there we went by car to Athens. </sentence><sentence id="888">So the whole trip took about 10 days, maybe a week, but I think it was more like 10 days, because boats were unreliable. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="898">Q: And which members of the family would be on this boat with you, and did any of your household staff leave with you? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="900">A: Yes, my parents, and my sister, and I. My grandmother -- maternal grandmother, my Aunt Julia, who is my mother's sister, with her husband and son, and one of our household persons was with us. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="902">Q: And who -- who was that? </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="908">A: Well, I guess she was everything. </sentence><sentence id="909">A little bit of everything, but she was very devoted to the family, and she said if the family was going to leave Volos, she was coming with us. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="912">Q: And was she Jewish? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="914">A: No, no. </sentence><sentence id="915">She was one of the girls from the mountains. </sentence><sentence id="916">She probably wanted to go to Athens. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="920">Q: And whatever discussions went on be -- prior to this plan being made, you were not -- you were protected, and you were not privy as a -- as a young child, or a 10 year old. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="922">A: No, I certainly wasn't privy, but I could see, I mean, the house is being dismantled, things are being moved to storage spaces, or some things are being shipped, and other things were given to friends or neighbors for safekeeping. </sentence><sentence id="923">We didn't recover any of that, like paintings, or carpets. </sentence><sentence id="924">So I knew that we were moving. </sentence><sentence id="925">To me it was a little bit of an adventure, to be -- being on a boat, and the boat breaking down, and all that kind of stuff. </sentence><sentence id="926">I didn't particularly like to sleep on sacks of flour, and I was afraid of the rats. </sentence><sentence id="927">There were a lot of rats there. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="935">Q: What do you remember of your -- of your sister's attitude? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="937">A: I think my sister was taking care of me. </sentence><sentence id="938">She would always make sure I was fine, and I wasn't too close to the edge of the -- of the boat, or I was -- I was -- well, she would talk to me, but -- </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="939">Q: Did she seem -- do you -- well, wonder if you even know if she was troubled. </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="940">A: I'm sure she was troubled. </sentence><sentence id="941">Now, how much troubled, I don't know. </sentence><sentence id="942">I think she was protective of my parents, so I think she tried not to show her anxiety much. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="946">Q: The -- this was -- I mean, it was a plan that obviously -- I would think obviously, talking to account that your father was full of concern about what was likely to happen. </sentence><sentence id="947">Do you -- do you remember if he ever thought of -- of leaving Europe, or -- or going somewhere much farther away, leaving Greece? </sentence><sentence id="948">He would be a man with contacts, and so on, in other European nations. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="952">A: I never discussed this with him, but I have a feeling he would never go anywhere other than Greece. </sentence><sentence id="953">| think -- End of Tape One, Side B    </sentence></p><p><sentence id="954"> Beginning Tape Two, Side A </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="955">Q: This is a continuation of a United States Holocaust Memorial Museum interview with Paulette Nehama. </sentence><sentence id="956">This is tape number two, side A.

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="965">Q: And who were they? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="967">A: There was a friend of mine who was a little younger, and her family. </sentence><sentence id="968">And they went on a small boat, and unfortunately they left them -- there were other people with them, but they were left on a -- on a rock. </sentence><sentence id="969">Supposedly the boat had trouble, and the man went up to -- went to fix the boat and never came back. </sentence><sentence id="970">And they were picked up much, much later, by another boat. </sentence><sentence id="971">But they stayed on that rock for maybe a week or so. </sentence><sentence id="972">So there were incidents like this, you would hear all over the place. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="979">Q: And did they return to Greece, or did they continue on their way? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="981">A: They returned to Greece, and they went into hiding in Greece, yes. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="983">Q: And let's go back to the move to Athens, and tell me about your life there, prior to going into hiding. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="985">A: Okay, so we moved, as I said, we came on these two different boats that took about 10 days to get to Athens, and normally the trip is like two days at the most. </sentence><sentence id="986">In Athens my uncle, who was my father's younger brother who lived there, had found a place for us. </sentence><sentence id="987">It was an apartment at -- we had one floor, my aunt and grandmother had another in the same building. </sentence><sentence id="988">And we went    there. </sentence><sentence id="989">It was spring, so I didn't go to school, because school would have been over pretty soon. </sentence><sentence id="990">And I guess we were trying to -- to get acquainted to -- to the city, and to -- to find our way around. </sentence><sentence id="991">There wasn't much we were doing as far as I was concerned. </sentence><sentence id="992">My only playmate was my cousin, who was 11 years old -- I mean, 11 months older than me, and we were constant companions. </sentence><sentence id="993">I don't remember having friends, or being encouraged to -- to make friends. </sentence><sentence id="994">Since I didn't go to school, of course I couldn't meet other children. </sentence><sentence id="995">Then, in September of 1943, we went into hiding. </sentence><sentence id="996">And the events prior to this, I remember them very clearly. </sentence><sentence id="997">I had the mumps, and I was in bed, and the dining room was adjacent to the bedroom. </sentence><sentence id="998">So my -- all my aunts, and uncles came and they were having meetings with my parents in this dining room, and I could hear them whispering. </sentence><sentence id="999">I could not make out any words, but I knew something very serious was going on. </sentence><sentence id="1000">And obviously they were planning where each one was going to go, what they were going to do, and it was like a big family meeting. </sentence><sentence id="1001">My sister was in that -- in that meeting. </sentence><sentence id="1002">Occasionally she would come out and check on me, to make sure I was all right, or put some hot pads on my cheeks, which was the normal treatment. </sentence><sentence id="1003">And then she would go back in the room. </sentence><sentence id="1004">And when I would ask what is it that -- why are you all in there, and she would say, "Well, we -- we just need to discuss some adult things. </sentence><sentence id="1005">Don't worry, everything is fine." </sentence><sentence id="1006">And but of course I worried, because I knew everything wasn't fine. </sentence><sentence id="1007">So I remember that very, very clearly. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1032">Q: What had triggered this -- what had triggered the plan, and the crisis, if you like? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1034">A: I think the fact that they were hearing more and more things about the Germans coming to Athens, and I think it was about the time that Italy capitulated, and they probably knew that if Germans come, they would probably treat the Jews the same way they treated them in Salonika. </sentence><sentence id="1035">So some advance thinking, at least to have the plan, and if you need to use it, you use it. </sentence><sentence id="1036">It was necessary to do that time. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1040">Q: Was there any leadership coming through the synagogue, or the Jewish community, do you think, to help people deal with this? </sentence><sentence id="1041">I mean, did all families begin to make plans at the same time? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1044">A: I don't know for sure, but I have a feeling they probably did. </sentence><sentence id="1045">Some decided the very last moment to go somewhere, because this is something you don't want to believe that this going to happen. </sentence><sentence id="1046">It's pretty unbelievable. </sentence><sentence id="1047">So most people denied as wildly exaggerating, or this isn't going to happen to us. </sentence><sentence id="1048">But people with advanced thinking, and people who know about the world, I guess, don't leave things to chances. </sentence><sentence id="1049">And my father was one of these people. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1056">Q: Meanwhile, you were living under false names in Athens, but would your -- would neighbors know your real identity, or would you keep very much to family, and not be mixing much with people who were not close to you? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1058">A: That is true. </sentence><sentence id="1059">I don't remember mixing much with other people. </sentence><sentence id="1060">We didn't have neighbors -- actually, there was a lady but i -- who lived in the same building, but I think she was also Jewish. </sentence><sentence id="1061">And we pretty much stayed with the family. </sentence><sentence id="1062">I don't remember venturing out much -- I mean, not -- we were free to come and go, but I would always go out with someone, I would never go out alone. </sentence><sentence id="1063">But there was no -- no particular friends that I remember at that time. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1070">Q: Now, from the time of these whispered meetings, when you had the mumps, to the time when you left the apartment and went into hiding, how much time went by? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1072">A: Probably a month. </sentence><sentence id="1073">Because we went into hiding in September of 43, and the meetings must have been like a few -- a month, or maybe two at the most, before. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1076">Q: And what preparation -- obviously the planning was going on, but as a child, do you have any memory of the activities going on in the apartment? </sentence><sentence id="1077">I mean, was there packing of valuables, or anything that you remember observing? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1080">A: I don't think we have any valuables, because I think a lot of the furniture was in there, in the apartment when we arrived. </sentence><sentence id="1081">It wa -- I don't think it was our furniture, I don't recall. </sentence><sentence id="1082">So this probably was a -- a furnished place when we arrived. </sentence><sentence id="1083">As far as clothing, I think we took whatever we needed, which wasn't much at the time. </sentence><sentence id="1084">Maybe some books. </sentence><sentence id="1085">I took my favorite doll. </sentence><sentence id="1086">I was a big doll person. </sentence><sentence id="1087">And I guess that was it, but no utensils, or anything else, because when we were into hiding, we lived with other families, not Jewish families, Greek Orthodox families, so they had their own household. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1096">Q: And when you left Volos, and came to Greece, you'd already taken a huge -- or made a huge change in your standard of living. </sentence><sentence id="1097">I assume that the apartment in Greece would be much more sparse, you'd left all your possessions and so on behind. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1100">A: Right, yeah. </sentence><sentence id="1101">They all went into storage. </sentence><sentence id="1102">As I said, some things went to friends or neighbors for safekeeping. </sentence><sentence id="1103">A lot of stuff we did not recover. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1108">Q: How -- they would simply not -- they'd have disappeared, or they wouldn't -- friends and neighbors would not honor the -- </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1109">A: Either they would move away, or some people even denied of -- I remember there was a painting that was the favorite painting of my mother's, and this woman denied that she ever had it. </sentence><sentence id="1110">And it was an outright lie. </sentence><sentence id="1111">So, things like that. </sentence><sentence id="1112">I don't remember if we sold things. </sentence><sentence id="1113">I can't recall that. </sentence><sentence id="1114">But I remember when we arrived in Athens we didn't have much. </sentence><sentence id="1115">It was a big change, definitely. </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1116">Q: Let me go back to the woman and the painting. </sentence><sentence id="1117">It's a -- m-m-maybe -- maybe it sheds light on something. </sentence><sentence id="1118">Obviously to have left a cherished possession with her, she would have been a trusted friend. </sentence><sentence id="1119">I -- | wondered was that -- her not honoring that trust later, what did that mean? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1124">A: Well, I think it was a devastating thing to find that you cannot trust people, on top of everything else that's happening. </sentence><sentence id="1125">At least there were people you could count on, and you cannot count on them. </sentence><sentence id="1126">And you really don't know to whom you can turn when things are bad. </sentence><sentence id="1127">I think that was the story in the -- the experience. </sentence><sentence id="1128">How can she be so blatant, and say, we didn't get it, they didn't give it to us. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1134">Q: And then wa -- when it comes to going into hiding, you had to know that you could trust the people that you were going to be with. </sentence><sentence id="1135">What do you know about the -- how the family split up, who you stayed with. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1138">A: Okay, first of all, my father had found this place through a friend, a very good friend of his. </sentence><sentence id="1139">He had baptized the oldest child, by the name of Many Babella, and he knew the family well. </sentence><sentence id="1140">So he had talked to them, and they had agreed to take us. </sentence><sentence id="1141">Of course, families could not -- families could not be together if there were more than two, three people, because they could be easily spotted, and they had to disperse. </sentence><sentence id="1142">My father went to some other family, and my mother and I, and sister, went to Calivare, which is a suburb of Athens, to this wonderful family of a couple, the name was Pavella. </sentence><sentence id="1143">And they had three children, a 15 year old, and one girl who was Kate, she was 10, as I was, and a younger boy about six or seven, called Dimitris. </sentence><sentence id="1144">My mother, sister, and I shared one room. </sentence><sentence id="1145">So the three of us shared one room, my father was elsewhere, and we had our meals with the family, I was playing with the children, who were about the same age as I was. </sentence><sentence id="1146">I wasn't going to school, and my excuse was that I had appendicitis. </sentence><sentence id="1147">And I wasn't supposed to go to school. </sentence><sentence id="1148">This was what I was telling the children. </sentence><sentence id="1149">Of course, they all wanted to see my incision, and there was no incision. </sentence><sentence id="1150">Basically, I liked these kids, and they were just great, they were warm, and would play all sorts of games, and we had a great connection. </sentence><sentence id="1151">My mother would communicate with my father once a week by telephone, and this was like a coded message. </sentence><sentence id="1152">When the news were bad, the message was, the patient is very sick. </sentence><sentence id="1153">When the news was better, it was that, well, the patient is doing better. </sentence><sentence id="1154">So, this was a pre-arranged kind of code for them to communicate. </sentence><sentence id="1155">My sister became good friends with the sister of the woman who hid us, the family there. </sentence><sentence id="1156">She had a bakery right across from where we were. </sentence><sentence id="1157">And my sister would go there sometimes, and also Adhero will come to -- to the house. </sentence><sentence id="1158">She was very warm, and caring, and often will bring cookies from the bakery. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1180">Q: I -- I wanted to clarify your not going to school was really because your -- you were more effectively hidden if you didn't. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1182">A: Right, yeah. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1184">Q: And then -- well, loo -- let's go ahead. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1186">A: Yeah, I couldn't go to school, because that involves being outside, and being in public. </sentence><sentence id="1187">The -- the fear was that somebody may recognize us. </sentence><sentence id="1188">Same thing for my mother and sister, we couldn't venture very far other than across the street to the bakery, because although we had left Volos, where we were very well known, and in Athens we were more -- more unknown people, it still the possibility that somebody would recognize us, and mention our names, and then everybody will be in great peril. </sentence><sentence id="1189">Of course, the family that hid us was in danger by hiding us. </sentence><sentence id="1190">These were wonderful people. </sentence><sentence id="1191">He worked for -- the man of the family worked for a Greek newspaper, so he could bring home news of what was going on. </sentence><sentence id="1192">His wife was also a very good housekeeper, caring for the children, and very nice, and my mother and Dasseia became friends. </sentence><sentence id="1193">And even after the war they would see each other. </sentence><sentence id="1194">And there was great respect for each other. </sentence><sentence id="1195">So there was -- there were good feelings there, and a good connection. </sentence><sentence id="1196">As I said, we couldn't go out, we couldn't do things that we normally used to do. </sentence><sentence id="1197">But maybe for my mother this was a big loss, but for me it was fun because there were children to play with. </sentence><sentence id="1198">At some point, I think it was probably around December, which was like three months after we went into hiding to the Pavella family, my father joined us. </sentence><sentence id="1199">I guess he had become very lonely in the family he was with in Athens, and he decided to come to be with us. </sentence><sentence id="1200">Of course, this was with the agreement of the family we lived in. </sentence><sentence id="1201">But shortly after, I remember it very clearly, one evening, Adhero, the -- the wife's sister, who had the bakery, came running to the house, and saying, "You must leave immediately. </sentence><sentence id="1202">I heard from somebody that they know you are Jewish, and you are hiding." </sentence><sentence id="1203">We used to tell, or the family used to tell that we were relatives, because sometimes we would be out in the yard, and people would ask, who are these people? </sentence><sentence id="1204">They say they were relatives. </sentence><sentence id="1205">And this man, who happened to be drunk, and he was in a tavern, in a Greek tavern, he said, "Don't get fooled, these people are not relatives of the Pavella family, they are Jews, and they are hiding." </sentence><sentence id="1206">So it was heard by everybody who was in that tavern, and Adhero happened to be there. </sentence><sentence id="1207">And she ran and told us to leave immediately. </sentence><sentence id="1208">Well, the first one who left was my father, because he was in greater danger. </sentence><sentence id="1209">And he walked from Calivare to Athens with the man of the family, Milanos Pavella. </sentence><sentence id="1210">He wouldn't let him go by himself. </sentence><sentence id="1211">He took him on foot. </sentence><sentence id="1212">And the next night, all three of us, my mother, my sister, and I, when it became dark, we also left with him. </sentence><sentence id="1213">He came back, of course, after taking my father to a friend's house in Athens. </sentence><sentence id="1214">He came back and took us to -- to Athens. </sentence><sentence id="1215">Now this is about, I don't know, probably -- I remember walking for a long, long, long time in the night. </sentence><sentence id="1216">I don't know exactly how far it is, but I'm sure it must be like six miles, 10 miles from Athens. </sentence><sentence id="1217">So it's a long walk for a 10 year old. </sentence><sentence id="1218">And we had put scarfs on our heads, and tied them so people wouldn't recognize us immediately. </sentence><sentence id="1219">So when we go to Athens, we immediately went where my father was, at the friend's house. </sentence><sentence id="1220">Now these were very good friends, who were notified, apparently, when this incident of somebody saying that we were Jews occurred. </sentence><sentence id="1221">And they were looking for a place for us to go. </sentence><sentence id="1222">But until they found a place, we couldn't stay together, because they were in danger. </sentence><sentence id="1223">So my sister went to a friend's house, one of her friends from Volos, that family lived in Athens, and they took her. </sentence><sentence id="1224">And I went -- they took me to somebody's house in Athens, and all I remember, it was like a mansion, a huge place. </sentence><sentence id="1225">And there lived a man in a wheelchair. </sentence><sentence id="1226">I think he was an old man, but here again [indecipherable] wrong, being 10 years old -- and a woman who was taking care of him. </sentence><sentence id="1227">I don't think she was a relative, I think she was a caretaker. </sentence><sentence id="1228">And I was left there for 10 days by myself, not having communication with my family, not knowing what was going on, not knowing these people. </sentence><sentence id="1229">I think this man didn't talk to me, or if he did, it must have been one or two words, or maybe he couldn't talk. </sentence><sentence id="1230">| remember the woman feeding him, spoonfeeding him, so obviously he was pretty sick. </sentence><sentence id="1231">And I was desperate. </sentence><sentence id="1232">I was totally lost. </sentence><sentence id="1233">I didn't know what happened to my parents, I didn't know if they would ever pick me up. </sentence><sentence id="1234">But the woman, the caretaker of this man was a very kind woman, so when I would cry, she would try to comfort me, or tell me stories, or all sorts of things, just to make me feel good about it. </sentence><sentence id="1235">Well, in about 10 days, my sister came, and she said, "We have a place now. </sentence><sentence id="1236">I'm ga -- I'm here to pick you up, to take you." </sentence><sentence id="1237">I don't know if she had called before or not, I don't recall. </sentence><sentence id="1238">But I took my little satchel of things, a couple of changes of clothe -- clothes, and my doll, and said good-bye and left. </sentence><sentence id="1239">And we went -- we met again at this friend's house, and we went, I think in installments again, my father went first, or we went first, to the second house, where we spent about seven months. </sentence><sentence id="1240">This was in Kipserly. </sentence><sentence id="1241">It was the family of Andonis Vayas, who was an officer in the navy. </sentence><sentence id="1242">And they had -- he and his wife had the little girl about three years old. </sentence><sentence id="1243">And I think there was a grandmother who was deaf, and also lived in the house, but we hardly saw her. </sentence><sentence id="1244">She stayed in her room for the most time. </sentence><sentence id="1245">Anyway, so it was a new adjustment. </sentence><sentence id="1246">We had a very large room for the four of us, so there was like a -- a screen put in the middle, so on one side where my parents were sleeping, and on the other side was my sister and I. We were sharing the other side of the room. </sentence><sentence id="1247">And we were closer to the street, it was on a street level, and closer to the street. </sentence><sentence id="1248">I slept on a cot. </sentence><sentence id="1249">And I remember at night I would hear the Germans patrolling, and I could hear their boots going by my window. </sentence><sentence id="1250">And I would stop breathing. </sentence><sentence id="1251">I was so petrified, because I thought they were coming for us. </sentence><sentence id="1252">And I would pull the blanket over my head, and stop breathing, I -- until I couldn't -- I couldn't do it any more, and I had to breathe. </sentence><sentence id="1253">So then slowly I will pull the blanket off my head, and I would listen very carefully, and by then the steps with the boots -- because I knew -- I knew they were boots, would disa -- have disappeared, or they would have gone away, or they were far, so I knew we were safe. </sentence><sentence id="1254">This was my biggest fear, that they would come and get us. </sentence><sentence id="1255">Here again, I didn't go to school. </sentence><sentence id="1256">My father tried to teach me some arithmetic, and I think I had two books, "Robinson Crusoe," and another one, which was a rather gloomy book called, ""The Orphans of Scotland." </sentence><sentence id="1257">And it was nothing but -- you know, five orphans, or maybe more, whose father was in prison, and how they got him out of prison in a basket, and things like that. </sentence><sentence id="1258">But it was a rather sad book, if I remember correctly. </sentence><sentence id="1259">Then I got hold of a children's magazine heyou -- I think it was a weekly magazine. </sentence><sentence id="1260">I don't know who gave it to us, or how I got hold of it, and it had wonderful stories, and this was very nice for me too, to read. </sentence><sentence id="1261">Other than that, think my imagination went wild, because I used to play in the backyard, and all I would do is pick up bamboo stick, and pretend it was a gun, and was shooting all the Germans. </sentence><sentence id="1262">And we were free, I thought, by me doing that. </sentence><sentence id="1263">Games like this. </sentence><sentence id="1264">Occasional I will play with a three year old little girl. </sentence><sentence id="1265">But that was about it. </sentence><sentence id="1266">The backyard had a fence, and the next house was also a two story house, I think, and in the balcony there was a little girl who would be out practically every day, and playing with dolls, and other toys. </sentence><sentence id="1267">And I would go next to the fence, and we started talking. </sentence><sentence id="1268">And she would always invite me to go to her house to play. </sentence><sentence id="1269">But of course, I knew I couldn't, so I would find all sorts of excuses that I couldn't go. </sentence><sentence id="1270">But one time I couldn't bear it any more, so I jumped the fence. </sentence><sentence id="1271">On our side of the yard, the fence was reasonably manageable, I could go over it. </sentence><sentence id="1272">But when I jumped, it was very high on her side. </sentence><sentence id="1273">I'm glad I didn't break a leg. </sentence><sentence id="1274">So I jumped the fence, and went to her apartment and played there for awhile. </sentence><sentence id="1275">Of course, nobody in my family knew that I left the house. </sentence><sentence id="1276">But when it was time for me to go back, I just couldn't climb the fence, it was too much. </sentence><sentence id="1277">So finally I decided I had to go around the corner, because this house was around the corner. </sentence><sentence id="1278">So I came, and rang the doorbell, and of course the woman opened the door, and she was so surprised to see me. </sentence><sentence id="1279">And my mother came, and she was absolutely pale when she saw me. </sentence><sentence id="1280">I got a good spanking for that, I remember. </sentence><sentence id="1281">I wasn't supposed to -- to leave the house, especially not telling anybody. </sentence><sentence id="1282">But it was that urge to be with other children, to be able to play, to be -- to have a normal life like any other child that made me do that. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1420">A: Well, after the second one, yeah, we went to a third one because the -- my father was taken by the Greek Nazis -- Greek SS, as they used to call them. </sentence><sentence id="1421">They were watching the house in -- the third house, and -- no, actually, the second house in Kipserly. </sentence><sentence id="1422">And one day they burst in, pretending they were people from the power company, and they wanted to read the meter, but they came in with guns, and they were asking for Moudzoukos. </sentence><sentence id="1423">And they took him, and fortunately he had money on him. </sentence><sentence id="1424">He had British pounds that were all sewn around his west -- waistband, and he paid them. </sentence><sentence id="1425">And they told him that he and his family had to leave within five hours, and they didn't guarantee his safety, or anybody else's safety. </sentence><sentence id="1426">So when they came to get my father -- panic-stricken my mother, and my sister, and me -- my sister went next door -- here again, she jumped from a terrace to the next terrace, where there were people that had help us find this house as well. </sentence><sentence id="1427">And this was in -- somebody in the -- I think in the Supreme Court, or -- he was in charge, anyway, and we knew them. </sentence><sentence id="1428">So she notify them, and they notified another friend, who immediately came -- nearby there was a market, and he was watching the house to    see the activity and what was going on. </sentence><sentence id="1429">And as soon as they brought my father back, he came in the house and took us to his house. </sentence><sentence id="1430">And from there he found another place for us. </sentence><sentence id="1431">So I think we stayed overnight, or maybe a couple of days, until a second hou -- a third house was found. </sentence><sentence id="1432">And that's when we moved again. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1447">Q: And all these families that were taking you in were Greek Orthodox families? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1449">A: Yes, they were Greek Orthodox families, they were also compensated financially. </sentence><sentence id="1450">Because there were expenses, you know. </sentence><sentence id="1451">We had to eat, and they had to eat. </sentence><sentence id="1452">And of course, there was some danger in there. </sentence><sentence id="1453">So they were being compensated. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1459">Q: I mean, were they richly rewarded, or was it -- or do you feel it was simply that you were allowed to make a contribution for real costs? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1461">A: I don't know the answer. </sentence><sentence id="1462">I have a feeling that at the time, it was just for expenses, but I know that after the war, they were very much helped by my father when things started going much better. </sentence><sentence id="1463">Because I remember this navy officer who would come often, and ask for a loan, or things like that. </sentence><sentence id="1464">And then my father would forgive the loan. </sentence><sentence id="1465">So probably it was after the war, but I -- I don't know for sure. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1471">Q: Lalso assume that they were taking very great risks. </sentence><sentence id="1472">What would -- if they had been found to have been sheltering Jews, would their lives be in danger, as we -- as well as the other side of that is that your lives were in their hands. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1475">A: Absolutely. </sentence><sentence id="1476">They were very courageous people to do that, and they were great human beings to be able to -- to help somebody else at such a risk, yes, because if anybody was found to be sheltering Jews, could be shot, he and his family. </sentence><sentence id="1477">So, it was a great danger to have Jews in the family. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1481">Q: What did they give as their reasons? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1483">A: Their reasons for what? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1485">Q: For -- for sheltering you, would they say this -- you would do it for us, or this is just common human decency? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1487">A: Yeah, I think that that was the main thing, that this was common decency. </sentence><sentence id="1488">I remember Pavellas, the first house we went, when he learned that this guy said something about us being Jewish, and hiding, and you know, he came to notify us. </sentence><sentence id="1489">She said, "You know, the -- the Nazi may come and take them." </sentence><sentence id="1490">And Milanos said, "Over my dead body." </sentence><sentence id="1491">So he had a very sense -- a very good sense of protecting us, of not letting anything happen to us. </sentence><sentence id="1492">That's why he dro -- he -- he walk with my father from Calivare to Athens, and the next day he walk back again with my sister -- my mother, and my sister, and myself. </sentence><sentence id="1493">So, I mean, he was a man who would take it very seriously that this was the lives of people that were under his care, and he wouldn't let anything happen, I mean, as far as he could control that. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1501">Q: I-It does seem very na -- I mean, he was doing the right thing, but it also seems to me admirable, because his own children were placed at risk in -- in acting morally, and so on. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1503">A: Right. </sentence><sentence id="1504">That's right, yeah, yeah. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1507">Q: Now -- </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1508">A: Also -- also, the children did not know we were Jewish. </sentence><sentence id="1509">Only the eldest daughter, Many, who was 15, knew. </sentence><sentence id="1510">She knew. </sentence><sentence id="1511">But the children also -- the family had to sacrifice, they had to give up a room. </sentence><sentence id="1512">You know, I mean this was a very small house, it wasn't a huge place, it wasn't a mansion. </sentence><sentence id="1513">So they had to give up a room for us to stay. </sentence><sentence id="1514">They had to share the bathroom, they had to -- to share the kitchen, or whatever. </sentence><sentence id="1515">So they made sacrifices as well. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1524">Q: Tell me what day to day life would be like with the Pavellas. </sentence><sentence id="1525">I mean, would you -- would you all eat meals together, and would you do chores in the house? </sentence><sentence id="1526">Like who would clean the bathroom, and what do you remember about the daily life at that time? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1530">A: For me, it was a good time, because I had company. </sentence><sentence id="1531">I mean, it was great to have the children, who were fun children to be with. </sentence><sentence id="1532">The chores were like sitting -- setting the table, or things like that. </sentence><sentence id="1533">We all had dinner together, we all ate together. </sentence><sentence id="1534">I think the cooking was done by my mother, and by Desseia. </sentence><sentence id="1535">Desseia would do the shopping, or sometimes Milanos, the father, would do the shopping. </sentence><sentence id="1536">And they would take turns cooking. </sentence><sentence id="1537">And as far as cleaning, I think we were responsible for cleaning our room, making our beds, doing the laundry, or setting it out, I don't remember, in those days you were just washing, you know, by hand. </sentence><sentence id="1538">So I think things were divided that way. </sentence><sentence id="1539">For me, I remember I would wait impatiently until the children will come home from school, because that was the fun time I could play with. </sentence><sentence id="1540">During the day my mother tried to engage me in teaching me how to embroider, or how to sew, and I had no interest whatsoever in any of these sedentary activities. </sentence><sentence id="1541">Plus my eyes were not very good, so I couldn't concentrate on a little hole there for hours. </sentence><sentence id="1542">I -- I -- I may have had one or two books, but basically I think I had a vivid imagination and I would make up stories. </sentence><sentence id="1543">And when the children will come, I will tell them stories, or they will tell me jokes, and this kind of thing. </sentence><sentence id="1544">We didn't go out, but yet had a huge yard, and that was nice, because we could play outside. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1560">Q: What about clothes? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1562">A: Oh, you had just not too many clothes. </sentence><sentence id="1563">You just wore the same things over and over. </sentence><sentence id="1564">I mean, you washed them, but I didn't wash them, my mother washed them. </sentence><sentence id="1565">But there were no new clothes, I mean, probably she would take the here -- sometimes I would get my sister's things, and she would hem them. </sentence><sentence id="1566">But there was a 10 -- 10 year difference, so you can imagine that her clothes didn't quite fit me right, even if the hem was put up. </sentence><sentence id="1567">So my biggest -- my happiest thing when she got engaged, was that I would have a new dress. </sentence><sentence id="1568">That was a big thing. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1577">Q: What do you remember of your -- of your sister and your mother's state of mind at this time? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="1579">I mean, it sounds as if for you, when you were at the Pavellas, it was not a difficult time, perhaps because you -- I mean, it was difficult in the sense that it was -- you couldn't go to school, but that -- maybe I'm wrong in saying it was not difficult, but not painfully difficult like the time when you were abandoned and alone. </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1580">A: Right. </sentence><sentence id="1581">You're right. </sentence><sentence id="1582">I'm sure it was very difficult for my mother, first of all because my father was elsewhere, and for my sister, because she was older, and she could understand the dangers, and whatever was going on. </sentence><sentence id="1583">So, since I didn't know that much about what was going on in the world, you know, I wasn't particularly worried. </sentence><sentence id="1584">I was worried about my father, and I wanted my father to be with us, and I was told he eventually will be with us, but that was about it. </sentence><sentence id="1585">I -- I didn't feel deprived, although, you know, food was not really -- it was difficult to get food. </sentence><sentence id="1586">So I remember some of the dishes, it was like cabbage with rice, and carrots. </sentence><sentence id="1587">And to this day I make it, and I think exactly of -- of that time. </sentence><sentence id="1588">I loved it, it was great dish. </sentence><sentence id="1589">You know, I mean, meat, eggs, fish probably were not available that much, and they were expensive. </sentence><sentence id="1590">So, you know, when you have a large family to feed, it's considerable. </sentence><sentence id="1591">But yes, it wasn't a painful time for me. </sentence><sentence id="1592">It was more of a -- of an interesting time, or a fun time, I would think. </sentence><sentence id="1593">But the other two places we went, it was a more painful time, because number one, I lost the children, you know, I -- I didn't have my friends any more. </sentence><sentence id="1594">So that was a big loss when we left. </sentence><sentence id="1595">And they -- I was asking Many when I saw her a couple of years ago, how was it for them when we left? </sentence><sentence id="1596">And what did their parents tell them? </sentence><sentence id="1597">And she said they missed us terribly, because we had become very connected. </sentence><sentence id="1598">The second house, the Vaia house, I was -- I was upset most of the time because -- a little bit of it was boredom, a little bit of it was inability to go out and do things. </sentence><sentence id="1599">Just -- I felt stagnated, there wasn't much to do. </sentence><sentence id="1600">But I knew that everybody else was trying very hard to -- to put a good face for the other person, so I was trying to be cheerful, so my parents won't get upset. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1623">Q: When you spoke of the code language between your parents, first of all, would there be a phone in the home at that time, or would your mother have to go somewhere to make that call? </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1788">A: He was hiding someplace in Athens, I'm not quite sure where. </sentence><sentence id="1789">But he was a Spanish citizen, so he had a sort of better treatment, as they called -- you know, the Spanish citizens were treated differently, the Jewish Spanish -- he was Sephardic -- were treated in a -- a little lenier way, let's say, were taken to Bergen-Belsen. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1793">Q: Now, that's interesting to me, so w -- you mean, the Sephardic Jews who were rounded up, generally were treated differently? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1795">A: Only the ones who were Spanish citizens. </sentence><sentence id="1796">If they were Greek citizens, no. </sentence><sentence id="1797">Because Spain was trying to negotiate with the Germans to get the citizens back, or to have a better treatment, and somehow they were able to, up to a certain extent, not really, but they were a little more lenient. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1801">Q: So he was taken to Bergen-Belsen, wa -- wa -- what -- what did you ultimate -- ultimately learn? </sentence><sentence id="1802">Ha -- was it -- it -- of his experiences? </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1828">A: Okay. </sentence><sentence id="1829">We came out of hiding, and I was kind of lost. </sentence><sentence id="1830">They tried to enroll me in public school, which was not far from where we lived, and I think it was almost -- it must have been like maybe fifth grade at the time. </sentence><sentence id="1831">I should have been in fifth grade, but I skipped so much school that I really didn't have the skills any more. </sentence><sentence id="1832">I remember the class being huge. </sentence><sentence id="1833">There must have been like 70 children in that class, and I was taught a little obs -- I had no idea what they were talking about, I didn't get any particular attention to -- to something. </sentence><sentence id="1834">So I was very unhappy, and eventually, I don't know how much later, my parents put me in a private school with a much smaller, you know, smaller classes, more attention from the teachers, and things like that. </sentence><sentence id="1835">At the time we didn't have money for private schools, and I know that my father's sister helped for me to go to private school, I know that. </sentence><sentence id="1836">So it was something very generous of her to do. </sentence><sentence id="1837">And I did like the school, it was -- the co-owners of that school were both British women, very regimented, very disciplined, but basically it was a very, very good school, and it still exists in Greece. </sentence><sentence id="1838">So once I were -- I was there then, I was able to -- to feel my way a little better. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1850">Q: Mm-hm. </sentence><sentence id="1851">What's the name of the school? </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1862">A: Oh, I'm sure about that. </sentence><sentence id="1863">I think there was a lot of anxiety I felt, because I would pick up, you know, what the adults, and the other people around me felt. </sentence><sentence id="1864">And although I didn't show it, I was always a very private person as a child, and some of it was encouraged because I wasn't supposed to be saying things to others. </sentence><sentence id="1865">I mean, to my family I was supposed to say, but -- End of Tape Two, Side B Beginning Tape Three, Side A </sentence></p></dialogue>

You were talking about the concern that you would give the game away, blurting something out as a child. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1874">A: Yes, I think that was the fear. </sentence><sentence id="1875">And I think that's why my parents weren't telling me too many things, let alone that they felt | was too young to -- to be burdened, and worry about things like that. </sentence><sentence id="1876">But I did worry. </sentence><sentence id="1877">I mean, I was a very sensitive child, so I could feel the moods of everybody. </sentence><sentence id="1878">I mean, I could see my father -- I would enter that part of the room that he -- my parents had in the second house, where it was divided by a screen, and he would smoke constantly. </sentence><sentence id="1879">I mean, the room was so cloudy, it was hard to see him, because it was one cigarette after the other. </sentence><sentence id="1880">And that worried me. </sentence><sentence id="1881">Not that I knew that cigarettes were not good for you, but his -- his mood, his pensive mood, the heaviness was there. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1890">Q: What do you think that the impact of -- of that was on you, developmental -- I -- I ask this question just because I've heard discussion of it. </sentence><sentence id="1891">Sometimes childhood is robbed. </sentence><sentence id="1892">You were forced to be adult too soon. </sentence><sentence id="1893">Or sometimes I think other survivors have said that it's -- that they've remained a child longer, and been slowed in their normal maturation, because they were bearing these burdens. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1898">A: I think that was more of the case with me. </sentence><sentence id="1899">I think even after we were liberated, we were very burdened because we had no money, we had lost the factory at the time. </sentence><sentence id="1900">We had no furniture. </sentence><sentence id="1901">So we had to start life from the beginning, to pick up the pieces. </sentence><sentence id="1902">And I think my parents were very concerned that they were -- they didn't want -- I don't know about my sister, but they didn't want me to be unhappy, and to have a bad childhood. </sentence><sentence id="1903">Here we had everything, and they had planned for everything, and here comes Hitler, and you know, he turns your life upside down. </sentence><sentence id="1904">So I think they tried to shelter me, maybe a little too much, but I think I didn't grow up as fast as I thought I would have liked to. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1912">Q: And you spoke about schooling, but as -- as you -- as your teens went on, what would be -- how did schooling progress, and other things? </sentence><sentence id="1913">Would there be -- would there be any extra curricular things, or were times too hard to have piano lessons, and art lessons and so on? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1916">A: Okay. </sentence><sentence id="1917">Schools progress normally except I had a great difficulty in school. </sentence><sentence id="1918">Part of it was I didn't have the skills to study, or I couldn't even do arithmetic. </sentence><sentence id="1919">Things that you learn in third grade, I had skipped second, third, and fourth grade, basically. </sentence><sentence id="1920">Because also, during the Italian war, school was a [indecipherable] you know, whenever. </sentence><sentence id="1921">It was -- so it was very hard for me. </sentence><sentence id="1922">I didn't know the basics, let's put it this way. </sentence><sentence id="1923">But I got up. </sentence><sentence id="1924">But I always had this feeling that I was lagging, I was behind. </sentence><sentence id="1925">And this was a very uncomfortable feeling for me. </sentence><sentence id="1926">I was ashamed of it, that I didn't know as much as the other children knew. </sentence><sentence id="1927">My greatest extra-curricular activity was joining the Girl Scouts. </sentence><sentence id="1928">You see, I always loved the Brownies when we were in Volos, as I said before, but as soon as Metaxess, who was a dictator, Fascist, decided that the Girl Scout movement, and the Boy Scout movement had to cease and all children should joined Apon, which was the youth organization. </sentence><sentence id="1929">But Jews were not included, so I could not participate. </sentence><sentence id="1930">So I always felt so hurt, because of that. </sentence><sentence id="1931">And after the -- after the liberation, and when things started falling into place slowly, my goal was to become a Girl Scout. </sentence><sentence id="1932">I was dying to. </sentence><sentence id="1933">We didn't know any troops, any Girl Scout troops, how do you go about it. </sentence><sentence id="1934">But I made sure I found out where the headquarters were, and I wrote a letter to the region officers there, a wonderful woman, by the name of Mrs. Sareefee, and I told her that I was a Brownie when I was little, and now I'm out of hiding, and I want to become a Girl Scout. </sentence><sentence id="1935">And she wrote back and -- a very warm letter that I read, and read, and knew by heart, because that was the letter I had under my pillow. </sentence><sentence id="1936">Every night I read it. </sentence><sentence id="1937">And she told me that troop number 21 is not far from where I live, and my mother could get me there, and they used to meet on Saturdays again. </sentence><sentence id="1938">And sure enough my mother took me, and she met the leaders, wonderful women. </sentence><sentence id="1939">And it was from then on I was -- my life was nothing but the Girl Scouts. </sentence><sentence id="1940">It was the most wonderful experience for me to be with this group. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1967">Q: Now why do you think that is? </sentence><sentence id="1968">I mean, did it, perhaps, address your strengths? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1971">A: Well, it addressed my strengths, it also addressed my need to -- to be included, to be with children, to be with other people, to be doing interesting things. </sentence><sentence id="1972">To be going on outings, like excursions, to do service work. </sentence><sentence id="1973">And I was very, very welcome. </sentence><sentence id="1974">To this day, I go to Greece, and I see friends that I made in my Girl Scout years. </sentence><sentence id="1975">I meet them there. </sentence><sentence id="1976">They write to me. </sentence><sentence id="1977">In fact, they send me a yearbook lately. </sentence><sentence id="1978">Every February -- 22"! </sentence><sentence id="1979">of February, it's considered the day of thinking, they call it Thinking Day. </sentence><sentence id="1980">It was the day that the re -- the Baden Powell, and his wife Olivia, when they formed Girl Scouts, they would correspond with other people, and they had set this day as the Girl Scout day, thinking of each other. </sentence><sentence id="1981">So it somehow kept it, and many of these friends gather in somebody's house, and they always send me a card, and they sign their name that they remember me. </sentence><sentence id="1982">And I think it's a wonderful feeling, to -- to know that these years were so important. </sentence><sentence id="1983">I later became a -- a Girl Scout leader. </sentence><sentence id="1984">I was pretty good at it. </sentence><sentence id="1985">I was leader taking Girl Scouts camping in service areas that we called -- Greece had earthquakes, and the senior Girl Scouts, above -- above age sic -- 17, I think, or 18, would go and help the village, and the people after the earthquakes, and I was the leader there. </sentence><sentence id="1986">So they were wonderful years. </sentence><sentence id="1987">I just love them. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2067">A: No, what I did, I finished high school, and then I went to a school of social work in -- which was part of the American college, it's called Pierce College. </sentence><sentence id="2068">And it was what they used to call apple division. </sentence><sentence id="2069">So there were three schools, school -- school of commerce, social work, and literature, so -- so I chose the school of social work. </sentence><sentence id="2070">Before that I had become a volunteer Red Cross nurse, and I used to -- I mean, I had six months training, and then I had to be at the hospital for two months every year, taking different shifts, and I enjoyed being a nurse, volunteer nurse, but it was great. </sentence><sentence id="2071">So -- I keep on jumping -- so after I became a social worker, I worked -- at the time I was doing academic work, I also had field placements in different places. </sentence><sentence id="2072">One was in a community place with refugees, the other was in a -- in an adoption center. </sentence><sentence id="2073">It was a place called Mittera, and there were primarily children from unwed mothers, and many of their children were being adopted [indecipherable] with American families, or other families. </sentence><sentence id="2074">So I was the social worker trainee. </sentence><sentence id="2075">And that -- that was a great place, I liked that place a lot. </sentence><sentence id="2076">I tried to convince my parents to adopt a baby from there, but it didn't work. </sentence><sentence id="2077">And after that, you had to pass exams again, because all social workers were employed basically by the ministry of social welfare. </sentence><sentence id="2078">So there were a lot of people who were welfare workers, and were going to villages, distributing welfare checks, and taking care of these type of things. </sentence><sentence id="2079">There were social workers who were working in a hospital, sort -- other kind of agencies, there were no private agencies that would hire social workers. </sentence><sentence id="2080">So I worked in a -- in a hospital at the beginning at the children's hospital, and later in a public hospital as a discharge social worker, discharging people, and making arrangements for them. </sentence><sentence id="2081">And then I met Isaac. </sentence><sentence id="2082">Oh, before I met Isaac I also belonged to a little Jewish club. </sentence><sentence id="2083">It was a Jewish youth club where I met Sam. </sentence><sentence id="2084">Sam is Isaac's brother. </sentence><sentence id="2085">And we became very good friends, both with Sam and his then fiancee, Evelyn. </sentence><sentence id="2086">And we were a group of about, you know, we were groups, several groups. </sentence><sentence id="2087">We used to go on excursions, or places, different -- to the movies together, but we moved in the group. </sentence><sentence id="2088">So I was dating at the time a young man, who was part of that Jewish club, and this was a nice time. </sentence><sentence id="2089">I think the adults were very pleased that we had this club, and I think partially they financed it, because they wanted all the young people to meet other Jewish people. </sentence><sentence id="2090">And in some cases it worked very well, because quite a few of these people married, you know, other women, men, that belonged to this club, and that's how they met. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2116">Q: Now, who did Sam marry? </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2120">Q: Who he met in this group? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2122">A: Yeah. </sentence><sentence id="2123">Actually, I knew Evelyn from my school. </sentence><sentence id="2124">She went to the same school I did, to American college, but she was in one or two classes younger than I was. </sentence><sentence id="2125">So I knew who she was, yeah. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2130">Q: And then when they married, that was when you met Isaac? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2132">A: Right. </sentence><sentence id="2133">Isaac -- Isaac had come to -- from the united -- he lived in the United States, and he had come to Greece for Sam's wedding. </sentence><sentence id="2134">And that's where I met him, the first time actually I lay eyes -- eyes on him, it was at the wedding, and I didn't particularly think he was attractive, or -- I didn't particularly was impressed with him, just by looking at him. </sentence><sentence id="2135">But then I think a couple of days later, my sister had some friends over, and this friend of hers said, ""We cannot come, because we have a guest, my cousin from the United States is here, so I cannot come to dinner." </sentence><sentence id="2136">And Yola said, "Bring him over," you know, "it will be fine." </sentence><sentence id="2137">So I was invited, and my parents were invited also, to Yola's, but my parents were not feeling well, so they didn't go, so I went. </sentence><sentence id="2138">And that's where I met him, and I said, "Well, he is kind of interesting guy." </sentence><sentence id="2139">You know. </sentence><sentence id="2140">And things moved very fast from there. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2150">Q: Well tell -- tell me the story, a -- a -- actually, in interviewing your husband, I -- I know it from -- </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2151">A: Ah, okay. </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2152">Q: -- one perspective in the museum tape, but -- </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2153">A: Uh-huh. </sentence><sentence id="2154">I'll be interested in hearing his version. </sentence><sentence id="2155">Well, I had broken up with my boyfriend like a week before. </sentence><sentence id="2156">And I had bought two tickets for Isaac Stern, there was a recital in Athens. </sentence><sentence id="2157">And I was still kind of lamenting the fact that I would have to either sell the ticket or go by myself. </sentence><sentence id="2158">So after I met Isaac at my sister's house, and we talked about all sorts of things, and he was telling me about his interest in music, I thought about asking him to come, but girls didn't ask boys out those days. </sentence><sentence id="2159">And I wasn't sure whether I should do it or not. </sentence><sentence id="2160">Anyway, I thought about it, I went to work in the hospital, and I thought about it, and thought about it, and I said, "Well, what difference does it make?" </sentence><sentence id="2161">I want him to come. </sentence><sentence id="2162">So I called him, and I said, "Listen, I have an </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="2173"> extra ticket for Isaac Stern, are you interested?" </sentence><sentence id="2174">And he said, "I -- am I interested. </sentence><sentence id="2175">I would love to go." </sentence><sentence id="2176">So that's how it happened, I met him, and we went to the theater, we listened to Isaac Stern. </sentence><sentence id="2177">During intermission Isaac tells me that he knows Isaac Stern from his college years, where he was directing the concerts at the University of Illinois, and he would like to go and talk to him. </sentence><sentence id="2178">So he left me there, and he went backstage. </sentence><sentence id="2179">And of course, when he came back, I asked him if he remembered him. </sentence><sentence id="2180">Yes, he remembered him, I think. </sentence><sentence id="2181">Anyway, we went out after the concert, we had coffee, we had ice cream, whatever. </sentence><sentence id="2182">And then the next day, either he called me, or I called him, and I think it was very shortly after, I think I saw him for the whole week. </sentence><sentence id="2183">He said to me, "Do you know, in English, when somebody says I want to talk to you, do you know what it means?" </sentence><sentence id="2184">And I said, "Yeah, it means that somebody wants to talk to you." </sentence><sentence id="2185">Well, he said -- so he was trying to explain to me what it meant, but all of a sudden he says, "I would like to ask you to marry me." </sentence><sentence id="2186">And I was ah, what? </sentence><sentence id="2187">You know, I just couldn't believe it. </sentence><sentence id="2188">But he -- he asked me, and I said, "Yes, yes, I will." </sentence><sentence id="2189">Right away. </sentence><sentence id="2190">I didn't even think about it. </sentence><sentence id="2191">I was very attracted to him, and I thought he was extremely bright, he was very knowledgeable. </sentence><sentence id="2192">He had a great knowledge of music, which impressed me very much. </sentence><sentence id="2193">He was very handsome, and he was an interesting guy. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2215">Q: So it was a whirlwind week. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2217">A: Yes, kind of. </sentence><sentence id="2218">And I -- I remember [indecipherable] a teacher that I met in the street, and she said, "How are you, what are you doing?" </sentence><sentence id="2219">I said, "I just got engaged." </sentence><sentence id="2220">She says, "Really? </sentence><sentence id="2221">Tell me about it. </sentence><sentence id="2222">How long did you know the man?" </sentence><sentence id="2223">I said, "A week." </sentence><sentence id="2224">And she looked at me and said, "You, Paulette, this conservative person, got engaged in a week? </sentence><sentence id="2225">That can be possible?" </sentence><sentence id="2226">It was. </sentence><sentence id="2227">But somehow I knew that this was the guy. </sentence><sentence id="2228">But I think in retrospect, you know, if any of my daughters would come and tell me they know somebody for a week, and they want to marry this    person and go to Australia, let's say, or someplace far away, I would think they would have to have their heads examined. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2242">Q: But you were right? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2244">A: I mean, it -- it didn't fit my pattern, I would always think things through. </sentence><sentence id="2245">I was -- in a sense my teacher was right, I was conservative. </sentence><sentence id="2246">I was never -- it wasn't I wasn't spontaneous, I was spontaneous, but I wasn't -- I wouldn't do things at the spur of the moment. </sentence><sentence id="2247">And this one was very incongruous with -- with my way of doing things. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2252">Q: Well, I think in affairs of the heart, perhaps one -- you know, at once. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2254">A: Yeah, I think I knew. </sentence><sentence id="2255">I think I knew. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2258">Q: And when I said you were right, I didn't mean that you were right to think your daughter's crazy, it -- it was just that time showed that your -- you were judging wisely your feelings. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2260">A: Yeah, I trust my feelings. </sentence><sentence id="2261">I think I -- I have a good sense of what I need, and what my feelings are, and I think I have intuition, in a way, or maybe a feeling of what's right for me, and what's not right for me. </sentence><sentence id="2262">Not always, but most of the times. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2266">Q: And you had -- you had a lot in common. </sentence><sentence id="2267">Looking back, do you think that was why you could make a decision so quickly? </sentence><sentence id="2268">Just that your -- you both had had -- had suffered in different ways during the war. </sentence><sentence id="2269">You had the same -- you both were Jewish. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2274">A: I don't know. </sentence><sentence id="2275">I can't answer that, because I n -- first I said yes, then I heard about all the war stories. </sentence><sentence id="2276">Although I did know some from Sam, his brother, and -- but I don't know if this was a determining factor or not at the time, because I didn't think it through. </sentence><sentence id="2277">So I can't tell. </sentence><sentence id="2278">But also the fact that he was Sam's brother kind of gave me a feeling that, well, you know, I make this decision -- this decision, but he can't be that bad, I mean, I know his brother. </sentence><sentence id="2279">And maybe my parents felt that way, too, because they knew Sam. </sentence><sentence id="2280">Sam worked with my father at the Jewish Central Committee. </sentence><sentence id="2281">And he had high respect for Sam, and Sam for my father. </sentence><sentence id="2282">So, I mean, he probably thought, who is this guy who is gonna take my daughter to America, you know, to the United States? </sentence><sentence id="2283">But I think there was some kind of a feeling that he is a solid guy, and I think that helped. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2295">Q: What was the reaction of Sam and Evelyn, and your parents? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2297">A: When we got engaged, Sam and Evelyn were on their honeymoon, so they didn't know about it until they came back. </sentence><sentence id="2298">They had just been married. </sentence><sentence id="2299">And they were thrilled. </sentence><sentence id="2300">They were very happy, very happy. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2305">Q: And you -- in a sense you've already explained that your parents knew Sam, and therefore -- </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2306">A: Yeah. </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2307">Q: -- blessed your plans. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2309">A: Oh yes. </sentence><sentence id="2310">I think they were -- they were happy. </sentence><sentence id="2311">And you know, after talking to him, my mother found him very charming. </sentence><sentence id="2312">My father found him extremely knowledgeable. </sentence><sentence id="2313">It was the time of the Sputnik, and my father was so interested about that Sputnik, but knew nothing about what was going on. </sentence><sentence id="2314">And, I mean, the fact that somebody could explain it to him in such wonderful ways, was very impressive. </sentence><sentence id="2315">So I think he was very taken with that. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2323">Q: And then, how did you make plans? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2325">A: Okay. </sentence><sentence id="2326">A-Also let me tell you that since we got engaged, I would receive huge bouquets of flower every single day, to the point that we had no place to put them, because you know -- and there was always a note from Isaac, you know, with every delivery of flowers. </sentence><sentence id="2327">And that was very nice. </sentence><sentence id="2328">So to get back to your question, when did we make plans. </sentence><sentence id="2329">I think it was understood that I would come to United States. </sentence><sentence id="2330">At that time, I was applying for a scholarship to come to the United States to study. </sentence><sentence id="2331">And I had applied to Barnard College, and I forget what else. </sentence><sentence id="2332">But I had a couple of colleges. </sentence><sentence id="2333">And Isaac told me that if I come as a student, I cannot stay in the United States. </sentence><sentence id="2334">So we went to the American consulate to get some advice, and they told us that indeed, I could not -- I could get the scholarship, but I -- even -- I couldn't get married in the United States and remain in the United States. </sentence><sentence id="2335">The Greek visa was oversubscribed. </sentence><sentence id="2336">So I think it was something like 10 years of waiting, or something like that, which didn't thrill me. </sentence><sentence id="2337">And one of the suggestions was that maybe I can go to Canada, and get married in Canada, and then for Isaac to apply for me to come from Canada to the United States as a spouse. </sentence><sentence id="2338">Because Canada had no -- no quota. </sentence><sentence id="2339">So we thought about it, and thought about it, a-and we thought it might be a good idea. </sentence><sentence id="2340">My -- there was a family that we knew who had gone to Montreal. </sentence><sentence id="2341">This was my brother-in-law's -- Yola's husband's cousin. </sentence><sentence id="2342">And they had moved from Athens to Montreal like maybe two years before that. </sentence><sentence id="2343">So Freddie, my brother-in-law, wrote to them and told them the situation, and asked them if I could stay with them while all the paperwork was being done. </sentence><sentence id="2344">And they said they would be very glad to have me there. </sentence><sentence id="2345">So that's what happened. </sentence><sentence id="2346">A friend my sister's, who was working for HIAS, the Hebrew Immigration Society, said to me, "You know we are going to speed things up for you. </sentence><sentence id="2347">Why don't you get your police report, your health records, and everything else you need, and we'll send them to the consulate in Montreal. </sentence><sentence id="2348">So after you marry, the -- all your -- all that your husband has to do,"-- [indecipherable], "all that your husband has to do is to -- to apply for you to come to United States, and this will save you a lot of paperwork over there." </sentence><sentence id="2349">I said fine. </sentence><sentence id="2350">So I did all this preliminary work, and Linda sent everything to Montreal. </sentence><sentence id="2351">So I left in April of 58 for Montreal. </sentence><sentence id="2352">It was -- didn't hit me until I was on the plane, and I said to myself, where am I going, all by myself, to somebody I don't really know. </sentence><sentence id="2353">I just wanted the plane to come back. </sentence><sentence id="2354">But the plane kept going. </sentence><sentence id="2355">And eventually I re -- I reached Montreal, my friends were there to greet me at the airport. </sentence><sentence id="2356">And this was a family that they had two children, a six year old, and a baby. </sentence><sentence id="2357">And I shared a room with the six year old, and also the mother -- his mother lived with them, in a small apartment in Montreal. </sentence><sentence id="2358">So Isaac came I think the next weekend, or two weekends later to see me. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2395">Q: How long was it since you'd seen Isaac in Athens? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2397">A: Oh, it was -- let's see, we got engaged in September "57 -- End of Tape Three, Side A Beginning Tape Three, Side B </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2399">Q: -- a continuation of a United States Holocaust Memorial Museum interview with Paulette Nehama. </sentence><sentence id="2400">This is tape number three, side B. You were telling me about being reunited with Isaac. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2403">A: Yeah, so we went to the airport to pick him up, the family and I. And I couldn't wait in the waiting room, I was so anxious to see the -- see him. </sentence><sentence id="2404">So I went outside, you know. </sentence><sentence id="2405">Apparently when the plane landed, you had to walk outside into the -- into the terminal. </sentence><sentence id="2406">So I see him coming, and I was freezing there, it was so windy, and so cold, but I was waiting there to see him. </sentence><sentence id="2407">And he was wonderful. </sentence><sentence id="2408">It was really wonderful. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2415">Q: Removed all your doubts. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2417">A: Yes, yes, it was -- it was nice. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2419">Q: And then you planned to marry in Canada, shortly after that? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2421">A: Yes. </sentence><sentence id="2422">Isaac was married before, for a short period of time. </sentence><sentence id="2423">And we had to -- to go to Toronto for him to sign some papers for the final decree, which we did. </sentence><sentence id="2424">And I think shortly after that he dis -- his divorce papers came through. </sentence><sentence id="2425">And we went again to Toronto, and we got married by a Justice of Peace. </sentence><sentence id="2426">I was all dressed up, not in a wedding gown, but in a very fancy, elegant dress that's -- my parents made me at a very great attag -- couturier, as we used to call it, in Athens. </sentence><sentence id="2427">And the question was, do I wear a hat, or do I not wear a hat. </sentence><sentence id="2428">And Isaac said, "If you wear a hat, I'm not going to marry you." </sentence><sentence id="2429">So he doesn't like hats, or he didn't like me wearing a hat. </sentence><sentence id="2430">So I thought well, okay. </sentence><sentence id="2431">So we were just the two of us, there was nobody, and you had to have witnesses for the wedding. </sentence><sentence id="2432">So we -- they told us that we can go out in the waiting room and ask two people to come inside and become our witnesses, or go to Eton, we -- which the department store across the street, and [indecipherable] everybody will come, you're two young people in love, you know, people love stories like this. </sentence><sentence id="2433">Anyway, at the waiting room there was another couple. </sentence><sentence id="2434">It was an older couple -- I mean, older, I would think probably in their 50's. </sentence><sentence id="2435">And they were going to get married also. </sentence><sentence id="2436">So we made an agreement, we would sign -- we would be witnesses at their wedding, and they would be the witnesses in our wedding. </sentence><sentence id="2437">And that's what happened. </sentence><sentence id="2438">I had to repeat in English, and my English wasn't that good at the time, you know, that's -- I do marry him, and take care of him, for better or worse. </sentence><sentence id="2439">And that was it. </sentence><sentence id="2440">At the time -- the more I think about that now, the more I think how I missed my family not being there, and not having anybody. </sentence><sentence id="2441">And many times I go to weddings, and I cry my heart out. </sentence><sentence id="2442">And I wanted my daughters to have nice weddings, with lots of people, and friends, and family. </sentence><sentence id="2443">Because I feel that I just -- was a big loss for me not to have anybody. </sentence><sentence id="2444">But on the other hand, at the time, I -- all I wanted was to get married to Isaac. </sentence><sentence id="2445">And to me, that was because there were a few obstacles, as I said, to -- to bypass the immigration laws, to -- to come -- I mean to -- for him to get the divorce papers, and all this kind of stuff. </sentence><sentence id="2446">So these were like little setbacks that kept me wondering would l ever be able to marry this man. </sentence><sentence id="2447">And that's all I wanted at the time, but there was some feeling of not having the people that mattered most in something so important in my life. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2476">Q: And the waiting in Toronto with the family would not be easy, I assume. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2478">A: Well, okay -- well, so we got married, then we went to Niagara Falls, this was our honeymoon. </sentence><sentence id="2479">And -- okay, so we went for our honeymoon to Niagara Falls, we stayed about a week, and then Isaac returned to the United States, and I returned to Montreal. </sentence><sentence id="2480">I wasn't happy at all. </sentence><sentence id="2481">The family I lived with, as I told you, had two children, so in order for me to be busy and think less of Isaac, Sonia gave me full care of the baby. </sentence><sentence id="2482">He was about six or seven months old, little Eddie. </sentence><sentence id="2483">So she would say to me, "You need to practice, you take care of him." </sentence><sentence id="2484">And I would say, "Well, I've never take care of a baby, what do I do?" </sentence><sentence id="2485">She said, "You'll find out. </sentence><sentence id="2486">Just don't let him fall." </sentence><sentence id="2487">And I was taking care of him completely. </sentence><sentence id="2488">I would take him for walks, I would take him out. </sentence><sentence id="2489">We'd play together. </sentence><sentence id="2490">It was wonderful to -- to have a little baby there. </sentence><sentence id="2491">Anyway, meantime -- it takes a long time -- Isaac applied for me to come to the United States as a spouse. </sentence><sentence id="2492">And at some point he said to me, "You know, you have to go to the consulate and tell them that - - find out why is it taking so long." </sentence><sentence id="2493">Well, it was taking longer than we thought, and eventually I went to the HIAS office, to the Hebrew Immigration Society, and saw a social worker there, who got interested in the whole thing, and she made several attempts to find out what was going on, and I think eventually what happened is Isaac had applied for me to come to the United States by the name of Nehama, as his spouse. </sentence><sentence id="2494">The papers that were sent from Greece, by HIAS were under the name Moudzoukos. </sentence><sentence id="2495">So the two things were never put together, Moudzoukos and Nehama were two different persons for them. </sentence><sentence id="2496">So they never figured it out. </sentence><sentence id="2497">It was only after desperation that Isaac went to his congressman in New Jersey where he lived, and talked to him, and the next day I get a phone call from this social worker, and she said, "Guess what? </sentence><sentence id="2498">You're going tomorrow. </sentence><sentence id="2499">We have everything ready for you, the visa is ready, come to the office." </sentence><sentence id="2500">And of course, it was wonderful, because it had become to be a big, big problem, you know, six months -- it was six months it took for me being by myself there -- I mean, it wasn't by myself, but still, I was very anxious to start my life, and for Isaac to be in the United States. </sentence><sentence id="2501">So, in November, first day it snowed in Canada when I was there, I said good-bye to my friends, and boarded a plane, and came here, in New York, and of course, Isaac was a -- waiting, and he already had rented a house in Lake Hiawatha, which at this time I couldn't even say the word Hiawatha. </sentence><sentence id="2502">And I would think, my God, if I get lost, how am I gonna say where I live? </sentence><sentence id="2503">I mean, this is not the place to take me. </sentence><sentence id="2504">You should take me someplace where I can pronounce, or I can even say it. </sentence><sentence id="2505">So it was -- the house was all taken care of. </sentence><sentence id="2506">I mean, he had arranged it, and fixed it, and he had a lot of his furniture there, but decorated very nicely, painted it, just took good care of things. </sentence><sentence id="2507">And then it was, how do I live here, and what do I do, and it was a bit hard. </sentence><sentence id="2508">It was lonely, because I didn't know anybody, although I met two good friends of his, and their wives were marvelous. </sentence><sentence id="2509">They would come and pick me up and take me to lunch, or take me places, and they tried very hard to -- to make me feel comfortable. </sentence><sentence id="2510">But a couple of months later, I -- oh no, I started going to New York, I would take the bus from New Jersey and go to New York in the day time, and started going to the museums, and just getting a feel of the city, and I loved it. </sentence><sentence id="2511">And one day, I think Isaac had gone to San Francisco on business, I was looking in the newspaper, and I saw that there was a position open for a social worker that -- to deal with adoptions. </sentence><sentence id="2512">So I called, and made an appointment, and took the bus, and went to -- and indeed, it was the International Social Service in New York, that was looking for a social worker, take care of Greek adoptions. </sentence><sentence id="2513">I knew all the social workers in the International Social Service in Greece -- I no -- in Athens. </sentence><sentence id="2514">I knew them very well. </sentence><sentence id="2515">And to me this was like a glove that fitted perfectly well. </sentence><sentence id="2516">So I told them I was interested in the job, they said they thought I would be perfect for the job, but they have to communicate with the people in Athens, and get references from there, and everything else, which they did, and then they called me, and they said, "My goodness, I mean we never heard anything as good as this. </sentence><sentence id="2517">When can you start?" </sentence><sentence id="2518">So I got the job, and I had to commute, of course, every day from New Jersey. </sentence><sentence id="2519">It would take me like an hour almost, on the bus. </sentence><sentence id="2520">And it was very    exciting, I was very excite -- I didn't know what I was doing, but it was very exciting. </sentence><sentence id="2521">And I liked the people work there, very well, very much. </sentence><sentence id="2522">Then I got pregnant with Sarah, and commuting wasn't the best thing for me. </sentence><sentence id="2523">I had the threatening miscarriage, and the doctor said to me, "Well, all I can tell you is, what you want, the baby or the wor -- the job?" </sentence><sentence id="2524">So I decided I wanted the baby, and that meant I had to stop working. </sentence><sentence id="2525">There was no other way to get to New York early in the morning, so I stopped working. </sentence><sentence id="2526">And I was sad about that, because I just felt I had reached the point where now I'm able to -- to live in the United States, to work, to become part of it. </sentence><sentence id="2527">So it was a bit sad. </sentence><sentence id="2528">But of course, having a baby was wonderful. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2671">Q: They needed -- they needed you with Sarah in your arms. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2673">A: Right. </sentence><sentence id="2674">And I think the fact that, you know, we had to leave again -- we stayed a couple of months in Athens with Sarah -- was probably harder for them, because now they had experienced their grandchild, and was taken away from them again, you know. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2677">Q: Now how did you choose Sarah's names -- is that how you pronounce it? </sentence></p></dialogue>

" </sentence><sentence id="2769">Yes, she's alive, she's breathing all right." </sentence><sentence id="2770">So I go to the hospital, the doctor meets me right there at the entrance, he takes me down [indecipherable] emergency room. </sentence><sentence id="2771">He checks me out, he says, "Mrs. Nehama, you are in perfect health. </sentence><sentence id="2772">It's Mr. Nehama who needs to be hospitalized." </sentence><sentence id="2773">Isaac was in the ambulance with Dr.Hoffman, and he was holding the baby, wrapped in a yellow sha -- the yellow towel. </sentence><sentence id="2774">We have that towel, I gave it to Nicole. </sentence><sentence id="2775">But then I couldn't see the baby, because they put her in isolation, in the intensive care, just to check her out. </sentence><sentence id="2776">And I thought she was dead. </sentence><sentence id="2777">So I keep asking, "Where is my baby, where is the baby?" </sentence><sentence id="2778">They said, "She is fine, she is fine." </sentence><sentence id="2779">I said, "I want to see the baby. </sentence><sentence id="2780">I want to get up to see the baby." </sentence><sentence id="2781">They wouldn't let me get up, although I was fine. </sentence><sentence id="2782">Well, finally in the afternoon they let me get up, and I went by the nursery and there's a woman who is sitting there -- standing there in front of the big window, and she said to me, "Did you have a baby today?" </sentence><sentence id="2783">I said, "Yes, how about you?" " </sentence><sentence id="2784">Yes," she said, "I had it at home." </sentence><sentence id="2785">I said, "I did, too. </sentence><sentence id="2786">Have you seen your baby?" " </sentence><sentence id="2787">No," she said, "but I think my baby's over there." </sentence><sentence id="2788">And then I looked, and the nurse brought Nicole, or I pointed, and she brought her, you know, from the window, and somebod -- then in the evening I had her, and she came to the room, they brought her. </sentence><sentence id="2789">But it was a little worrisome, not being able to see her. </sentence><sentence id="2790">So those days you stayed in the hospital about five days. </sentence><sentence id="2791">So everything went well, thank God she was fine. </sentence><sentence id="2792">Last day of discharge the doctor got us, all the women, all his patients were about to be discharged, and he gives them instructions what to do, and what not to do. </sentence><sentence id="2793">So he introduces every single woman around this -- around the room, and he said, "And this is Mrs. Nehama, who sneezed and had her baby on Saturday." </sentence><sentence id="2794">He used to call me the do-it-yourself girl. </sentence><sentence id="2795">He was funny. </sentence><sentence id="2796">But then I heard all sorts of stories. </sentence><sentence id="2797">I was at the grocery store one day, and I wrote a check, and the cashier said to me, "Thank you, Mrs. Nehama." </sentence><sentence id="2798">And the woman behind me, she said, "Are you Mrs. Nehama?" </sentence><sentence id="2799">I looked at her, I didn't know her. </sentence><sentence id="2800">I said yes. </sentence><sentence id="2801">She said, ""You're the woman who scared my husband to death." </sentence><sentence id="2802">I said, "I don't know your husband, who is he?" </sentence><sentence id="2803">Well, she says, "You don't know him, but you scared him to death." </sentence><sentence id="2804">I said, "What did I do?" </sentence><sentence id="2805">She said, "Di -- didn't you have your baby at home?" </sentence><sentence id="2806">I said yeah. " </sentence><sentence id="2807">Well," she said, "when you had the baby, I was seven months pregnant, and my husband wouldn't let me get out of the house for two months. </sentence><sentence id="2808">He would call me every half hour. </sentence><sentence id="2809">He was so scared I would have the baby in the house. </sentence><sentence id="2810">You changed my life." </sentence><sentence id="2811">So, there were funny things. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2953">A: Right. </sentence><sentence id="2954">There were many, many challenges. </sentence><sentence id="2955">But I wanted to have a full life, and I wanted my children to have a full life. </sentence><sentence id="2956">And I was constantly trying to fi -- find ways to -- to learn. </sentence><sentence id="2957">I'm also in a great profession, that I can go into seminars -- I'm a social worker, I have a Master's degree, and, you know, go into seminars and talking about different issues, it was great -- great for me, because I could s -- find out, and work on things that were concerning me in many ways. </sentence><sentence id="2958">So -- </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2959">Q: Now, Isaac would have been very engrossed in his work, which was fascinating work, but it would mean he'd have less time to be supportive. </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2960">A: That is true. </sentence><sentence id="2961">He also traveled a lot during the years he worked for the Apollo project. </sentence><sentence id="2962">He was traveling practically three days out of the five. </sentence><sentence id="2963">So that was fine, it was a very intense program for him, very exciting problem for him, but there wasn't -- and there wasn't that much time available for -- for doing things, although he did try to help. </sentence><sentence id="2964">Later on he would drive Nicole to piano lessons, or things like that. </sentence><sentence id="2965">But I think I was doing most of -- of the work in the house, and the responsibility with children. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2972">Q: Did you set out with clear ideas of how you wanted the children, the girls to be brought up? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2974">A: You never have a clear ideas when you are not a mother. </sentence><sentence id="2975">So you go with the flow. </sentence><sentence id="2976">I wanted my children to be whole people, not to be one sided, just geniuses, and educated, and scholars, but lacking in human -- human affairs, let's say, and compassion, and things like that. </sentence><sentence id="2977">So I wanted them to be capable, responsible for themselves, autonomous. </sentence><sentence id="2978">At the time they were supposed to be autonomous. </sentence><sentence id="2979">And to have connections, not to be alone, because I was so alone, I think. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2987">Q: What about wanting to give them some religious upbringing? </sentence><sentence id="2988">Was that important to you, going to synagogue, and teaching them about their faith? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2991">A: I was conflicted at the time. </sentence><sentence id="2992">You see, when I came out of the Holocaust, I was sort of afraid to be identified as Jewish, and to -- for people to think that I was Jewish, I wasn't sure how it would play, so out of my own anxiety, I didn't really pursue for them to go -- for us to be members of a synagogue, or to be identified with Jewish causes at the time. </sentence><sentence id="2993">Now I regret that. </sentence><sentence id="2994">I hoped -- 0-or I wished that things were different, and my attitude would have been different. </sentence><sentence id="2995">And -- but it's a little too late, I mean, for me anyway, to teach them. </sentence><sentence id="2996">But certainly they did get some religious things from -- celebrating the holidays here, the high holidays, and things like that. </sentence><sentence id="2997">On high holidays we would go to the synagogue. </sentence><sentence id="2998">But I don't think it was enough, I really don't. </sentence><sentence id="2999">But I had a real fear at the time, of being identified a Jew, although I knew it was almost like being a kryptal Jew, because I would never deny that I was Jewish, or -- or I was married to a Jew, but there was a lot of anxiety about that, until I finally realized the Nazis are gone, you know, you have nothing to be afraid of at this point. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3009">Q: Can you think of any anecdote that explains that? </sentence><sentence id="3010">Th-That illustrates your concern? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3013">A: Yeah, my daughter Maya was a swimmer, and she used to belong to the swimming team -- swim team of the Jewish social -- I'm sorry, Jewish Community Center in Rockville, in Maryland. </sentence><sentence id="3014">So she used to practice on a regular basis, and also they had races, like they had events, they would go to other Jewish centers for -- to compete. </sentence><sentence id="3015">So every time there was a race, the -- they would get a badge, and it was be sewn in the back of their jacket, or their sleeves, or t -- Maya had quite a few things on her jacket, and she was very proud of it, and I was very proud of her, because she was a good swimmer. </sentence><sentence id="3016">And I remember once, after I had sewn a badge on her -- most of these badges would say Jewish Federation, or Jewish this, or Jewish that. </sentence><sentence id="3017">They had the Star of David. </sentence><sentence id="3018">So they were definitely very Jewish badges. </sentence><sentence id="3019">She was going to go out with a friend to the mall to buy a present for another friend who had a birthday. </sentence><sentence id="3020">So the mother of the other friend was going to drive them there, and pick them up. </sentence><sentence id="3021">And it was a cool day, and Maya is ready to go, the car is waiting in my driveway, and she's wearing this jacket. </sentence><sentence id="3022">And I said to her, "Maya, you cannot wear this jacket." </sentence><sentence id="3023">It was full of badges. </sentence><sentence id="3024">And she said, "Why? </sentence><sentence id="3025">It's cold out." </sentence><sentence id="3026">I said, "No, Maya, you have to put a different jacket." </sentence><sentence id="3027">And I literally sta -- stood in front of the door, because I wanted her to go change her jacket. </sentence><sentence id="3028">My feeling was that how can she go to a public place, and be seen as being a Jew? </sentence><sentence id="3029">I had this feeling that she would be lynched, that people will say horrible things, that people will do harm to her. </sentence><sentence id="3030">And that was unbearable to me, that my child will be hurt because she was Jewish. </sentence><sentence id="3031">But basically, what that was saying is, I was Jewish, and I was hurt because of that, when I was a kid. </sentence><sentence id="3032">So that was very difficult. </sentence><sentence id="3033">Of course, once I realized what I was doing, I let her go. </sentence><sentence id="3034">But she could not understand it at the time. </sentence><sentence id="3035">I explained to her later, when she came back. </sentence><sentence id="3036">But I remember s -- having this fear. </sentence><sentence id="3037">I actually saw her being hurt. </sentence><sentence id="3038">And that was unbearable. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3066">Q: Had you experienced any anti-Semitism that led up to that? </sentence><sentence id="3067">Or -- I -- I understand that may -- essentially it was a scar from your wartime experience, but I wondered if you'd experienced any anti-Semitism in the United States? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3070">A: In the United States, no. </sentence><sentence id="3071">I have not. </sentence><sentence id="3072">In Greece, when I was in school, sometimes kids would tell me I crucified Christ, and I didn't have a recollection of doing that. </sentence><sentence id="3073">So, I -- I would tell my mother that that's what they told me, and she -- she would say, "Well, don't listen to people like that," you know, "people will say bad things about Jewish people, but it's not true." </sentence><sentence id="3074">No, basically I didn't, but it was primarily of what I've heard, what I've read, that had caused me to - - to think in those terms. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3081">Q: And when you were responsible for bringing your daughters up, did you talk a lot about your own wartime experiences, going in hiding and so on, or did you feel it was hard to discuss such things? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3083">A: I didn't talk much about it. </sentence><sentence id="3084">I -- it was hard for me. </sentence><sentence id="3085">It was much, much later that became comfortable talking about it. </sentence><sentence id="3086">It was something I -- I knew had to happen, but I had to move on. </sentence><sentence id="3087">And there were so many painful situations that I didn't think I wanted to tell my children when they were young. </sentence><sentence id="3088">Course, now they are older, so it's a different story. </sentence><sentence id="3089">But when I think about my grandchildren, I think, you know, how at the age of six or seven or eight, they can hear these stories. </sentence><sentence id="3090">Of course, you have to modify -- fy them a little bit. </sentence><sentence id="3091">I was talking with my grandson Max, who is six, and he was coming here because Isaac was being honored by the Holocaust Museum to light a candle. </sentence><sentence id="3092">One of the six candles for Day of Remembrance at the rotunda at the USS. </sentence><sentence id="3093">capital, on je -- what was it? </sentence><sentence id="3094">April 30", 2003. </sentence><sentence id="3095">So Max and his mother came. </sentence><sentence id="3096">The others were too young, the other little boys. </sentence><sentence id="3097">And Ian and Maya came. </sentence><sentence id="3098">And I was asking Max why is he here, what -- what he's going to see or hear, or why did he come. </sentence><sentence id="3099">And he said to me, "Well, because I know that Grandpa was with the partisans, and he had a gun, and he fought the Nazis, and I know that you were hiding in an attic." </sentence><sentence id="3100">Now how did he get the attic I'm not sure, but -- because I was never in an attic. </sentence><sentence id="3101">I was in small rooms, but not in an attic. " </sentence><sentence id="3102">And -- and some people really hid you, and you couldn't go out, you couldn't go to school, and that must have been real nice." </sentence><sentence id="3103">He really liked the fact I didn't go to school. </sentence><sentence id="3104">So, I mean he is six, so -- I mean, he could absorb some of it. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3127">Q: Yes. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3129">A: Yeah. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3131">Q: Now, I'm guessing that you're much more sensitive than -- than many others to any kind of prejudice or injustice. </sentence><sentence id="3132">D -- when you came, do you re -- do you have memories of thinking about the racial situation in this country? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3135">A: [indecipherable] even when I was in Greece, I would read things, and I like poems that were written by ba -- black people. </sentence><sentence id="3136">One of the poems was, but I am black, but oh my heart is white. </sentence><sentence id="3137">And a -- I was always fascinated by -- by that, how people put such values on people they don't know, or put such -- they're so prejudiced about things they don't know. </sentence><sentence id="3138">And people are people, you know. </sentence><sentence id="3139">They're just good people, and bad people, and not so good people. </sentence><sentence id="3140">But it has nothing to do with color, or religion, or the shape of your eyes, or your skin color, or your hair color, or anything else. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3176">A: [had mixed feelings, I must say, because part of the oath is that it tells you you have to abandon your country, and I still felt very Greek. </sentence><sentence id="3177">So I wasn't quite ready to abandon my country, but I did not -- I did want to become an American. </sentence><sentence id="3178">So, for awhile I struggled with that, and s -- once, Isaac -- somebody -- we were at the gathering, and somebody said to me, "Paulette, where is home?" </sentence><sentence id="3179">And I said -- without even thinking, I said Greece. </sentence><sentence id="3180">And Isaac looked at me, and he said, "I can't believe you. </sentence><sentence id="3181">Greece is home? </sentence><sentence id="3182">You live here. </sentence><sentence id="3183">You've been living here for 20 odd years." </sentence><sentence id="3184">And it was -- it was strange for me that he would get angry with me for feeling that way. </sentence><sentence id="3185">But I think it was the fact that, you know, I had lived there, I had made connections there. </sentence><sentence id="3186">I spent my childhood there. </sentence><sentence id="3187">Now that I have grandchildren however, and I have roots here, I feel differently. </sentence><sentence id="3188">I feel now I belong here. </sentence><sentence id="3189">And it's strange, but I still love Greece. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3206">A: I suppose it is, if you don't serve in the army, or something like this. </sentence><sentence id="3207">But I don't see, you know, what's the purpose. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3210">Q: Besides, my question was cause I wondered if you found it deeply moving to become an American, and in fact, tell me what that means to you now, now that you have grandsons, and roots. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3212">A: Oh, I think it's wonderful. </sentence><sentence id="3213">It's -- it's a wonderful country. </sentence><sentence id="3214">I think the freedoms you find in this country, you don't find them anywhere in the world. </sentence><sentence id="3215">The fact that the place is so diverse also is -- to me, it's very interesting, and very nice. </sentence><sentence id="3216">But it's mostly the personal freedom, of being able to say you're Jewish for instance, you know, which sometimes I couldn't say it in Greece, although there were no people to hurt me, you know, this kind of thing. </sentence><sentence id="3217">Or to do things. </sentence><sentence id="3218">Sometimes we take this freedom a little too far, I think, but there's no other country, I think, that's -- freedom is the most wonderful thing to have, and you can find it here. </sentence><sentence id="3219">Also there's another thing. </sentence><sentence id="3220">You have opportunities in this country, and if you are willing to work hard, you can do things. </sentence><sentence id="3221">Like for instance, I went to get my Master's degree when I was 49 years old. </sentence><sentence id="3222">And I remember discussing this with a friend, and I said, "Well, you know, I have grown-up children, they" ll be going to college pretty soon. </sentence><sentence id="3223">I'm 49. </sentence><sentence id="3224">I don't know if I can manage to -- to go get a Master's degree, and he said -- she said to me, "Paulette, if you want to get a Master's degree, go get a Master's degree. </sentence><sentence id="3225">You're going to be 49 whether you get it or not." </sentence><sentence id="3226">And I never forgot that. </sentence><sentence id="3227">And I thought, if I lived in Greece, and I was 49, there wouldn't have been a place for me to go and get a degree, even if I wanted to. </sentence><sentence id="3228">Even when I was talking to my friends in Greece, and I would tell them I'm going to college to get a Master's degree, they would think I was sort of well, maybe she's a little cuckoo at this late age, you know. </sentence><sentence id="3229">And to me this was wonderful. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3249">Q: Where did you go to get it? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3251">A: I went to Catholic University in Washington. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3253">Q: Now, when it was the time of your daughters to decide on careers, and pursue sort of advanced education, what do you think they gained from you? </sentence><sentence id="3254">You -- you know, even in going back to school at 49, you were something of a role model, I would think. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3257">A: Yeah, I'm sure that that was important in their lives, you know. </sentence><sentence id="3258">Actually, Maya and I graduated the same year. </sentence><sentence id="3259">It was funny to have graduations within a couple of weeks apart. </sentence><sentence id="3260">You know, I'm going to school, my mother is -- is studying for exams, I can't talk to you now. </sentence><sentence id="3261">Yeah, I think it was a role model, but I think they were -- they would have gone to school anyway, because they were motivated, all of them, and they wanted to go to college, and have a career. </sentence><sentence id="3262">So I don't think it was the only model they had. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3269">Q: Were you ever affected by the feminist movement? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3271">A: Yes. </sentence><sentence id="3272">I was affected by the feminist movement, but this is a traditional household, so a lot of the things that were going on were not totally, totally accepted. </sentence><sentence id="3273">I wanted my daughters to be women who could decide for themselves, who would have a voice, whether it was in a job, in a marriage, or in wherever. </sentence><sentence id="3274">I wanted them to be treated equally with men, not to be discriminated upon. </sentence><sentence id="3275">I wanted more for them than I wanted for me from the women's movement. </sentence><sentence id="3276">And I think they are pretty much with it. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3283">Q: Do you think they see themselves as children of survivors? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3285">A: [know Nicole thinks so, and probably the others do too. </sentence><sentence id="3286">There were times that this was difficult for them, because I remember when there were occasions that -- for instance, holidays were difficult in this family, because holidays is something that you have everybody around, and not everybody was around. </sentence><sentence id="3287">So it was always a feeling of loss, not necessarily, you know, a joyous holiday. </sentence><sentence id="3288">Things are mixed bags, often. </sentence><sentence id="3289">So I remember once, one of my daughters said, because I was trying to explain that, you know, both Isaac and I had difficult life, and she said, "Oh Mom, I'm so tired of -- of that. </sentence><sentence id="3290">Let's have the holiday and enjoy it," or whatever, you know, like okay, you had it, but why about us? </sentence><sentence id="3291">So I think she was -- I -- I forget which daughter it was, but I think, you know, to a certain degree they tolerated the difficulties, because they were part of the [indecipherable]. </sentence><sentence id="3292">I don't know that they're -- I think Nicole is more closer to that than the others. </sentence><sentence id="3293">Sarah is too. </sentence><sentence id="3294">Well yeah, I think she is. </sentence><sentence id="3295">She knows the difficulties up to a certain point, but then she chooses not to linger on those things. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3307">Q: Why do you think Nicole is more affected? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3309">A: Well, I think she stayed in this house longer, probably. </sentence><sentence id="3310">She is married to a Jewish person. </sentence><sentence id="3311">She has children, and -- boys, and she wants them to be Bar Mitzvahed, and for them to know about our lives, a lot. </sentence><sentence id="3312">And maybe the fact that she went to a Jewish camp, day camp, may have had something to do. </sentence><sentence id="3313">So, who knows? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3320">Q: When you spoke of that holidays being difficult, not everyone was here, course your family was not here because of the -- you separated fro-from -- by, you know, vast distances. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3322">A: Ocean. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3324">Q: And of course, Isaac lost his -- his mother, so their -- a grandmother had died at Auschwitz, and their uncle Nehama. </sentence><sentence id="3325">Is that what you're thinking of, the -- the actual, you know, family members lost? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3328">A: Yes. </sentence><sentence id="3329">Mostly family members. </sentence><sentence id="3330">But you see, in the past, when there was a holiday, all the family members will gather around, s-some relatives would come. </sentence><sentence id="3331">So it was a Bible kind of thing. </sentence><sentence id="3332">This time, I mean, you go through the motions sometimes, but you feel the lack of these people. </sentence><sentence id="3333">And Passover is a difficult time. </sentence><sentence id="3334">Isaac often reads the Haggadah from his father's Haggadah, which is in Ladeeno. </sentence><sentence id="3335">Has both Hebrew, Ladeeno, and Greek. </sentence><sentence id="3336">So he reads passages that he remembers his father read on Passover. </sentence><sentence id="3337">And every time he reads them, you know, I get a chill in my back. </sentence><sentence id="3338">It just -- just, you know, brings tears to my eyes. </sentence><sentence id="3339">And I remember my father reading -- not Ladeeno, but you know, presiding over the Seder, and I know the last time I saw him it was Passover, because he was sick, and I had gone to Greece, I had taken Nicole with me, who was about three. </sentence><sentence id="3340">Sh -- he had not seen her -- grandchild. </sentence><sentence id="3341">So I took her with me. </sentence><sentence id="3342">And he was quite sick, but he sat at the Seder. </sentence><sentence id="3343">And I knew it was the last time I would see him. </sentence><sentence id="3344">He died shortly after. </sentence><sentence id="3345">He died in October of 1970. </sentence><sentence id="3346">And -- but his [indecipherable] he -- he was dress up, he put his clean, nice, press shirt. </sentence><sentence id="3347">You know, he was very presentable. </sentence><sentence id="3348">And [indecipherable] and my sister was there, her husband, and Maurice, my nephew. </sentence><sentence id="3349">So you miss these people, who were much a part of your life. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3372">Q: And the essence of those holidays, I guess your daughters are right, is the -- the family gathering. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3374">A: Right, right. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3376">Q: And your -- and it's not there. </sentence><sentence id="3377">I interviewed someone called Susie Schwartz, and she spoke of the -- her wish that there'd -- were another grou -- term for survivor, just because she -- she felt that she had been in hiding in a farm building in Holland, and her problem was simply with the fact that the -- the common stereotype, or presumption is that survivors survived Auschwitz, when in fact there are many different -- </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3378">A: Yeah. </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3379">Q: -- shades and grades of suffering, and so on. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3381">A: That is true. </sentence><sentence id="3382">I mean, for a long time, I did not consider myself a survivor. </sentence><sentence id="3383">I consider myself that I lived through the war. </sentence><sentence id="3384">And the Holocaust, and the hiding was part of the war. </sentence><sentence id="3385">I remember I attended a workshop once in one of the conferences. </sentence><sentence id="3386">It was the American [indecipherable] Psychiatric Association to which I belonged. </sentence><sentence id="3387">And there was something on -- about survivors of the Holocaust, and I attended that, and the first thing I said is, can we make a distinction, who is a survivor? </sentence><sentence id="3388">Because they were talking -- I mean, it was very blurred to me, who is a survivor, and who is not? </sentence><sentence id="3389">So they said everybody who survived both the camps, and the war, and the hidden children, everybody was -- they lumped them all together. </sentence><sentence id="3390">And to that day, I never thought I was a survivor. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3401">Q: But you think differently now? </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3411">A: Well, you see, the word survivor implies to a certain degree that you were a victim. </sentence><sentence id="3412">And I don't like to feel victimized, but I was victimized, and so was my family, and Isaac's family, and a lot of other people. </sentence><sentence id="3413">So it's not an approp -- an inappropriate word to use. </sentence><sentence id="3414">But I don't like the label of being victimized, because that kind of sets you in a mold, and in a pattern, that sometimes you can't come out of it, and I don't want that to happen. </sentence><sentence id="3415">In other words, I survived, I made it, I'm healthy, both physically and mentally. </sentence><sentence id="3416">And here I am. </sentence><sentence id="3417">I'll be 70 years old in September. </sentence><sentence id="3418">It's not a small achievement, I think. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3433">A: Well, I like people to -- to know that things like that can happen if we let governments, dictators, crazy people, do all sorts of things, and we do not do something about it. </sentence><sentence id="3434">That's -- we - - the world belongs to everybody, and people are responsible for the world, and I think that we have a responsibility to -- to speak out, and not to let things happen, and to do our part. </sentence><sentence id="3435">I don't know, maybe that's a little -- but I do feel that, you know, I mean I want my friends to know that my life was different from theirs in many ways, and I think the ones who do know, respect it very much. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="3436">End of Tape Four, Side A Beginning Tape Four, Side B </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3437">Q: -- of a United States Holocaust Memorial Museum interview with Paulette Nehama. </sentence><sentence id="3438">This is tape number four, side B. I'm jumping to a new question, do you think that you were much more protective of your daughters because of your own experiences? </sentence><sentence id="3439">I mean, you mentioned that one    </sentence></p><p><sentence id="3440"> incident with -- with the jacket, but I wondered if you were more fearful in -- in other ways, and in general? </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3441">A: I probably was, and I was aware of it. </sentence><sentence id="3442">So I tried not to inflict this on my daughters, because I didn't want them to become fearful people. </sentence><sentence id="3443">And -- but I did have a lot of anxiety about it, their safety, a lot of it. </sentence><sentence id="3444">I just wanted to make sure that they were just okay. </sentence><sentence id="3445">Well, more than okay, actually. </sentence><sentence id="3446">So, I remember Maya had got a new job, a summer job in one of the ice cream stores. </sentence><sentence id="3447">I think it was called Swensen. </sentence><sentence id="3448">It was in Bethesda, an ice cream parlor, so she was a waitress there. </sentence><sentence id="3449">And she would come -- I mean, the -- the job -- the store closed at 12, they had to clean up, and I guess she would come home one or 1:30. </sentence><sentence id="3450">And I remember saying that I didn't feel this was time for a young girl, driving by herself. </sentence><sentence id="3451">And Isaac, who is very reasonable at times, tries to put reason to everything, tried to convince me that, you know, it didn't make any difference whether she came home at 12 or at 10, or at nine, because, he said, "She's going to be in the car. </sentence><sentence id="3452">What difference does it make what time she comes home?" </sentence><sentence id="3453">And I said, ""Well, what if she has a flat tire? </sentence><sentence id="3454">Where is she gonna find help at 12 o'clock at night? </sentence><sentence id="3455">You don't know what can happen." </sentence><sentence id="3456">But he said, "That can happen at nine o'clock as well." </sentence><sentence id="3457">You know, this kind of thing. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3475">Q: Now, were you -- were you mostly in agreement about disciplining the girls, and other child rearing practices, or did you have strong disagreements? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3477">A: We had some disagreements. </sentence><sentence id="3478">Isaac was very strict, | was more lenient. </sentence><sentence id="3479">And that created some difficulty there. </sentence><sentence id="3480">But it all turned out good, finally. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3485">Q: It takes awhile before you -- you can see, I'm sure. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3487">A: Right. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3489">Q: Now, one thing we didn't talk about was the family in Greece that sheltered you, provided a haven, and your maintaining ties with them, the Pavellas. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3491">A: Mm. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3493">Q: How closely have you kept in touch, and did that go on constantly, or has there been a -- a reunion and a visit in recent times? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3495">A: Well, for awhile after the war, we saw them periodically, like a couple of times a year, maybe more. </sentence><sentence id="3496">Then we saw them less often, I think, because they moved. </sentence><sentence id="3497">And then I came to the United States, so I had no idea where they were, and there was no other contact. </sentence><sentence id="3498">But I did find out through a friend with whom I was talking about the Holocaust one day when I was first in Greece, and I -- I gave her the -- I told her -- she asked me where did I hide, and with whom, so I told her the family was Pavella. </sentence><sentence id="3499">And that was about it. </sentence><sentence id="3500">Then the next day I get a call from this friend. </sentence><sentence id="3501">She said to me, "I didn't want to tell you yesterday, but you're going to receive a telephone call from Many Pavella." </sentence><sentence id="3502">I said, "What?" </sentence><sentence id="3503">She said, "I didn't want to tell you yesterday, because I wasn't sure it was her, but I know the woman. </sentence><sentence id="3504">We work together." </sentence><sentence id="3505">And she apparently called her, and ask her if they were hiding a family by the name of Moudzoukos. </sentence><sentence id="3506">And she said, ""Yes, we were hiding them." </sentence><sentence id="3507">And she said, "Do you remember Paulette?" </sentence><sentence id="3508">And she said, "Paulette, Paulette? </sentence><sentence id="3509">No, that was Paulexani." </sentence><sentence id="3510">That was my name, my false name. </sentence><sentence id="3511">And anyway, she was very excited that I was in Greece, and wanted to talk to me, and see me. </sentence><sentence id="3512">But my friend, you see, didn't want to disappoint me if this didn't pan out, if -- you know, it wasn't the same person. </sentence><sentence id="3513">And so the next day I got a call from Many, who was just ecstatic, she was very happy. </sentence><sentence id="3514">She wanted to see me, and she wants me to go to the house. </sentence><sentence id="3515">Unfortunately she was leaving for -- she was going to be out of the country, and by the time she would have returned, I was leaving for the United States. </sentence><sentence id="3516">But we kept in touch by corresponding, I sent her pictures. </sentence><sentence id="3517">And then the next year I went to Greece, my sister and I went to visit her. </sentence><sentence id="3518">We got in touch with them, and we visited them. </sentence><sentence id="3519">And then in "97, I believe, or 98, Many came to the United States. </sentence><sentence id="3520">She apparently studied in the United States, and I had no idea she was in this country, she went to Purdue University, and I had no idea where she was. </sentence><sentence id="3521">And anyway, she was being honored by Purdue, so then she decided to make a tour around the United States, and see some of her friends, and when she found out we lived in Washington, of course I insisted that she comes and stays with us. </sentence><sentence id="3522">So she came and stayed for a few days. </sentence><sentence id="3523">And it was wonderful. </sentence><sentence id="3524">We remembered all the past stories, and you know, our parents and everything else. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3556">Q: Do they -- did you learn new stories from them? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3558">A: Actually, not too many new stories. </sentence><sentence id="3559">What I wanted to know from her is what it was like for them to hide us, and what it meant to them. </sentence><sentence id="3560">And that's what I got mostly. </sentence><sentence id="3561">But she was the only one who knew we were Jewish. </sentence><sentence id="3562">The children, the other two, Booly and Dimitris did not, because of their age. </sentence><sentence id="3563">So she was worried, of course, about you know, when we left in such a hurry. </sentence><sentence id="3564">And they were told that we went with some relatives or something, not clear answers, you know. </sentence><sentence id="3565">So there were so many questions, because you wouldn't get straight answers from adults. </sentence><sentence id="3566">I think at my age anyway, and the younger a -- the younger children, Booly and -- and Dimitris's age. </sentence><sentence id="3567">Because I think people were afraid that, you know, children go to school, talk -- I mean they went to school, I didn't. </sentence><sentence id="3568">They talk to friends, if a friend repeats something like this to a parent, and the parent is suspicious, and then, you know how it goes. </sentence><sentence id="3569">I mean, you had to be careful. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3582">Q: Well, children might place the families at risk in their sort of innocence of the dangers, but you also suggest that for you as a child, not knowing may have heightened your anxiety. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3584">A: Yeah, absolutely. </sentence><sentence id="3585">Even to this day, when I don't know something I get very anxious, extremely anxious. </sentence><sentence id="3586">Knowing is power, you know. </sentence><sentence id="3587">So I remember some years ago, I had cancer, and when I heard the diagnosis, it was devastating. </sentence><sentence id="3588">And then when I pulled myself together, well the doctor explained to me I wasn't going to die from it, I got all the information I could possibly get. </sentence><sentence id="3589">And I couldn't stop reading books about cancer. </sentence><sentence id="3590">That was all I read, because the more I got, the better it was for me to ease my anxiety, although some of these books were telling you just horror stories about all what can happen, and it may have not been my situation, but you know, predicting that if this is this, that's what happens. </sentence><sentence id="3591">So Isaac said to me, "I will forbid you reading another book about cancer." </sentence><sentence id="3592">He had it. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3603">Q: But in fact it was what empowered you. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3605">A: Yeah, it did. </sentence><sentence id="3606">That's what helped. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3609">Q: You know, I'm going back to your -- your role as a grandmother now, and your feeling that you want grandchildren to know about your lives. </sentence><sentence id="3610">But a -- have you thought also of what it seems they should know about your family's history in Volos, and the -- the contribution that Jews made to the life of Greece over many centuries. </sentence><sentence id="3611">I mean, will that be part of your -- I mean there's -- would seem there's a proud heritage that was brought to a somewhat -- you know, a- abrupt and difficult stage. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3615">A: Absolutely. </sentence><sentence id="3616">Absolutely. </sentence><sentence id="3617">I think that children should know, because this is part of their heritage, as you said. </sentence><sentence id="3618">And I think when people know their roots, and they know their own life, about -- I mean, they know about their parents, their grandparents, and if they know further than that, and about their communities, they are better -- they have roots. </sentence><sentence id="3619">They have better rooting, I - - as they call it, which I think helps them as human beings, because they feel connected. </sentence><sentence id="3620">You know, they feel the connection there from way back. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3627">Q: You and Isaac had many commonalities in building a successful marriage. </sentence><sentence id="3628">Did you have any reservations when one of your daughters married somebody who was not Jewish, and m-maybe had -- you mentioned a British son-in-law. </sentence><sentence id="3629">Di-did that give you cause for concern, or really -- or not? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3633">A: A little bit. </sentence><sentence id="3634">At the beginning I was a little concerned, but I liked the man so much, and I thought he was such a good s -- man for my daughter, that this should not be an obstacle, if, you know, everybody was willing to cooperate in that factor. </sentence><sentence id="3635">And I remember -- so they had a dual ceremony. </sentence><sentence id="3636">It was at sen -- what's it called? </sentence><sentence id="3637">Saint Columbus Episcopal -- Episcopal church. </sentence><sentence id="3638">But there was a rabbi present, so the two, the rabbi, and the priest -- priest, right? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3645">Q: Yes. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3647">A: Both had a part of the ceremony, and I was reminding to my daughter that nobody trying to outdo the other. </sentence><sentence id="3648">They were very equal in their thing, and it was really a wonderful thing to have that, because it honored both families. </sentence><sentence id="3649">And obviously David's family, you know, felt that there should be an Episcopalian marriage, and we felt that it should be a Jewish wedding, but we didn't want this thing to become a -- a problem for them. </sentence><sentence id="3650">So they handled it very nicely, very nicely. </sentence><sentence id="3651">But I remember passing that church often, and saying to myself, how would I feel when my daughter gets married here? </sentence><sentence id="3652">And then I decided that I had to visit the church. </sentence><sentence id="3653">I had to go inside, and sit inside, and get the feel of it before the wedding. </sentence><sentence id="3654">Because I didn't want to be breaking down on the day of the wedding. </sentence><sentence id="3655">And I did that a couple of times. </sentence><sentence id="3656">I went and sat. </sentence><sentence id="3657">And I became very comfortable. </sentence><sentence id="3658">It was fine. </sentence><sentence id="3659">And this is a very good marriage for them. </sentence><sentence id="3660">He is a wonderful guy, great husband, wonderful father. </sentence><sentence id="3661">So I have no reservations whatsoever. </sentence><sentence id="3662">And I remember, i-it was the first year they were married, and it was Christmas, and they were coming here, and Maya said, "Can we have a turkey?" </sentence><sentence id="3663">Because Christmas was always such a big thing for David. </sentence><sentence id="3664">You know, it was the first time he was away from his family, to a new country. </sentence><sentence id="3665">I mean, things were difficult for him as well, and I imi -- immediately, you know, empathized with him, because I came from a different country, and I was in a different place, no ma -- no matter how much you love your spouse, it's still something you miss. </sentence><sentence id="3666">And of course I made the turkey, and -- and he was so happy. </sentence><sentence id="3667">He is a great guy. </sentence><sentence id="3668">And my other fellow, my Mike, Nicole's husband. </sentence><sentence id="3669">Nicole's si -- Mike is Jewish. </sentence><sentence id="3670">He is terrific. </sentence><sentence id="3671">His parents had -- live in Evanston, in Illinois. </sentence><sentence id="3672">He is from shi -- from there, too. </sentence><sentence id="3673">He grew up there, went to the same school Nicole did in Wisconsin, University of Wisconsin. </sentence><sentence id="3674">He is terrific. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3704">Q: Well, we'd be remiss now if we didn't mention Sarah's recent marriage. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3706">A: Sarah's, yeah. </sentence><sentence id="3707">Sarah's also -- she is not married to a Jewish fellow. </sentence><sentence id="3708">I'm not quite sure yet about this relationship. </sentence><sentence id="3709">It's very recent. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3714">Q: Yes. </sentence><sentence id="3715">Now, let me just finish up by asking about looking back, what do you feel are your greatest sorrows, sadness? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3718">A: Now you make me cry. </sentence><sentence id="3719">There was a time that was very hard for me here. </sentence><sentence id="3720">Raising children, Isaac was working very hard, felt kind of isolated, although I did have friends. </sentence><sentence id="3721">And I had missed Greece. </sentence><sentence id="3722">I missed the blue skies, and the blue sea. </sentence><sentence id="3723">And I missed my family. </sentence><sentence id="3724">The great sorrow was my mother's death, my father's death. </sentence><sentence id="3725">And certainly, having gone through the Holocaust is a great loss, but it's also a strength that you gain as a child, or as an adult, because you went through horrible things, and you know that you can survive things. </sentence><sentence id="3726">You can live through many difficulties. </sentence><sentence id="3727">And I'm a very patient person, and persevere. </sentence><sentence id="3728">But life is worth living. </sentence><sentence id="3729">Life is wonderful. </sentence><sentence id="3730">No matter what happens to you, there must be something in your life that is good about your life. </sentence><sentence id="3731">Life is precious. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3746">Q: And then the greatest joys? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3748">A: The greatest joys are my grandchildren. </sentence><sentence id="3749">I mean, they're -- I can't tell you how wonderful it is to have them. </sentence><sentence id="3750">And what an addition to my life and Isaac's life has been. </sentence><sentence id="3751">I have to tell you about Ian. </sentence><sentence id="3752">When Maya announced that she -- Maya and David came here, and they told us they were expecting a baby, I was sitting on this chair, and I jumped up to the ceiling from joy. </sentence><sentence id="3753">I was so happy. </sentence><sentence id="3754">The next day, I was diagnosed with cancer. </sentence><sentence id="3755">And it seemed to me like why now? </sentence><sentence id="3756">Here I am in heaven. </sentence><sentence id="3757">I'm so happy, I'm going to have a grandchild, my first one. </sentence><sentence id="3758">Why am I gonna have cancer now? </sentence><sentence id="3759">I mean, I could have had it last year, two years ago, five years ago. </sentence><sentence id="3760">Why now? </sentence><sentence id="3761">It was just terrible. </sentence><sentence id="3762">But then, after the shock, I decided that I had to lead beca -- to live because I wanted to see that -- that grandchild. </sentence><sentence id="3763">And I wanted to see Maya go through her pregnancy and be there for her. </sentence><sentence id="3764">Nobody was there for me when I was pregnant, or when I had children. </sentence><sentence id="3765">I wanted to be there for her. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3789">A: You're welcome. </sentence><sentence id="3790">I thank you, too. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3793">Q: So Ian helped you? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3795">A: So, I didn't know it was Jan. We didn't know it was going to be a boy, and it was going to be a -- but, I was thinking of this grandchild constantly, and I wanted to be well, both for my daughter, and my grandson. </sentence><sentence id="3796">And I remember Isaac said something very nice. </sentence><sentence id="3797">Shortly after the diagnosis, I said, "I don't understand, why is this happening now, that I'm going to become a grandmother? </sentence><sentence id="3798">I want to live to see my grandchild." </sentence><sentence id="3799">And he said, "You will live to see this grandchild, and many more to come." </sentence><sentence id="3800">And that was such a nice thing to say. </sentence><sentence id="3801">| remember when I was doing -- I was in radiation therapy, and it was very close to Maya's delivery, I would s -- asked the rad -- the -- the doctor there, the radiologist, "Can I take time off when my daughter has her baby?" </sentence><sentence id="3802">And for the moment she thought it was an out of town daughter, so she would say to me, "I can't let you stop radiation. </sentence><sentence id="3803">It doesn't work that way. </sentence><sentence id="3804">You have to be here every single day except the weekend. </sentence><sentence id="3805">If your daughter has the baby the weekend, you're gonna be lucky." </sentence><sentence id="3806">So finally I told her that my daughter lived here, and I had to be there. </sentence><sentence id="3807">And she said to me, "We will make every effort. </sentence><sentence id="3808">We will schedule you for six o'clock in the morning. </sentence><sentence id="3809">We will schedule you for 10 o'clock at night. </sentence><sentence id="3810">Whatever suits you, to help you out, so you can go see your grandchild." </sentence><sentence id="3811">But he was born the day after I finished radiation. </sentence><sentence id="3812">I think he timed it very well. </sentence><sentence id="3813">I was free, I was happy. </sentence><sentence id="3814">I wasn't radiating anything. </sentence><sentence id="3815">And it was just great, was the greatest day. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3838">Q: Your -- were telling me about returning to Greece. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3840">A: Yeah. </sentence><sentence id="3841">Now I return to Greece every year. </sentence><sentence id="3842">My sister lives there, and I have lots of friends, and a nephew, and now he is a father, and about to become a second time father. </sentence><sentence id="3843">So my friends date from the Girl Scout days, from high school. </sentence><sentence id="3844">And I have two wonderful teachers that are probably in their late 80's or 90's that I see. </sentence><sentence id="3845">And every time I see them, it's such a warm reception. </sentence><sentence id="3846">Last year I was in Greece, and they invited me to have coffee at a little coffee shop, two of them and a -- another good friend, who was also in the same school I was, but she was also in the Girl Scouts with me. </sentence><sentence id="3847">So actually she's the first one I call when I go to Greece. </sentence><sentence id="3848">And we were talking about all sorts of things, and then I said to them, "How do you remember me from my school days?" </sentence><sentence id="3849">You know, I was 15 - 16. </sentence><sentence id="3850">And it was such a warm feeling for them to talk about me, that they thought I was a very sensitive child. </sentence><sentence id="3851">I -- I had a lot of humanity, one of them said it. </sentence><sentence id="3852">And that this was very apparent. </sentence><sentence id="3853">They both knew I had survived the Holocaust. </sentence><sentence id="3854">Although I wasn't terribly good student, I was good student in some of the -- in their class I was a good student. </sentence><sentence id="3855">One taught -- taught history, and the other taught psychology. </sentence><sentence id="3856">So I was very good in both classes. </sentence><sentence id="3857">I wasn't good in math. </sentence><sentence id="3858">So, I mean such encouragement that I was really a worthwhile person when I was there. </sentence><sentence id="3859">And I kind of needed that, to hear it, that what was then, what is now. </sentence><sentence id="3860">Because sometimes there's such a big gap between this ocean. </sentence><sentence id="3861">And then the one who is a historian, she sent me a Christmas card, and she said how happy she was to see me in Greece, and that she always remembers me with great affection. </sentence><sentence id="3862">And that what she remembers is, here again, my humanity, and she wishes my grandchildren have some of that, and that's the best wish she can give me, which I think it's very nice. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="4636">A: I think she met him through -- through a friend. </sentence><sentence id="4637">Freddy was the cousin of the friend who took me in when I went to Montreal. </sentence><sentence id="4638">I remember when I got engaged to Isaac, I lived with a family in Montreal for six months, until my visa was ready for me to come to the United States. </sentence><sentence id="4639">Well, Joe Calderone was the name. </sentence><sentence id="4640">His mother and father were friends of my parents. </sentence><sentence id="4641">Joe was a cousin to Freddy, okay? </sentence><sentence id="4642">So Yola was very friendly with Joe and his wife, his current -- I mean his wife, and you know, they used to -- to be together in gatherings, and that's where she met Freddy. </sentence><sentence id="4643">And they made it in 46, which was still very shortly after the war, and you know, I mean, things were not that well yet, you know? </sentence><sentence id="4644">We were still -- had financial problems. </sentence><sentence id="4645">The factory wasn't -- was just beginning to -- to work. </sentence><sentence id="4646">But it wasn't producing what it did before the war, certainly not. </sentence><sentence id="4647">And -- but yeah, everybody was very happy. </sentence><sentence id="4648">When she got married she had a wedding gown, and -- and I was happy, and I told Freddy that I'm glad that he is marrying my sister, because I can have a -- a new dress for the wedding. </sentence><sentence id="4649">So he always remembered that, he thought it was really cute. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="4671">Q: That makes me think of the -- a question about how would your f -- parents dress in the time in hiding? </sentence><sentence id="4672">Would they maintain very dignified style of dress, even though clothes would get shabby and well worn? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="4675">A: Oh yeah, I mean, I remember my father always wearing a vest, a shirt and a vest, of course no tie in the house. </sentence><sentence id="4676">And my mother always wore a -- a housedress, or a skirt and blouse, some like that. </sentence><sentence id="4677">We didn't have a lot of clothes with us, so when -- since we didn't go out, you know, we didn't need to have anything. </sentence><sentence id="4678">Now that we're talking about clothes, there's something else. </sentence><sentence id="4679">After the war was over, and I think it was after the civil war in "44, there was help that had come from the United States, you know, in -- relief. </sentence><sentence id="4680">And among them, there was what we used to call UNRRA, UN -- United Nations Relief Agency. </sentence><sentence id="4681">And they were distributing clothes. </sentence><sentence id="4682">So I needed a coat, and my mother took me to get a coat. </sentence><sentence id="4683">So we looked through the different bins, or thing, and she came up with a brown coat that was down to my ankles, really long, and I didn't like it, but it was wool, and it was warm, and she wanted me to have it, because it was winter. </sentence><sentence id="4684">I cried, and cried and cried, because I just didn't like this coat. </sentence><sentence id="4685">1 wanted something else, but everything else was either too small for me, or too big for me and [indecipherable]. </sentence><sentence id="4686">So finally I ended up having that coat, but here again, she had to hem it to make it approximately my size. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="4993">A: Yes, we continued living in Athens, but we would go to Volos in the summer, because the factory was still there, and my father was, you know, working there. </sentence><sentence id="4994">And in the wintertime he would commute from Athens to Volos. </sentence><sentence id="4995">Once when we were in Volos, one summer, he -- he got a heart attack, and then he wasn't able to work for awhile. </sentence><sentence id="4996">And I remember Freddy came to -- to Volos -- my father started -- helped start a -- build a -- a small airport in Volos, because Volos had no airport. </sentence><sentence id="4997">So the first plane that landed was a tiny, little plane that had Freddy, and a cardiologist, and Yola. </sentence><sentence id="4998">They came to look after my father. </sentence><sentence id="4999">So it landed on -- the first plane that landed in that airport, isn't that interesting? </sentence><sentence id="5000">And it was tiny plane. </sentence><sentence id="5001">Then a few days later, Freddy remained in Volos to take care of the factory, and everything, and Yola and I left to go to -- to Athens, because she had a child by then, she had Maurice. </sentence><sentence id="5002">And I remember my first flight, you know, in this tiny little plane, and the pilot is totally incompetent, and I thought he was going to land in a roof in Athens, or someplace, I mean, he is going that close. </sentence><sentence id="5003">It was such a tiny little place, I mean, I was really scared. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="5026">A: It worked for a short period of time, but he -- the much more diminished -- wa -- first of all, the machinery was all destroyed, you see, and they had to replace that, or part of that. </sentence><sentence id="5027">The machinery was German machinery, and it was brought from Germany before the war, so this was very good machinery. </sentence><sentence id="5028">It just didn't have the -- the means, the financial means, you know, to buy new machinery, to get the whole thing started. </sentence><sentence id="5029">It was very hard. </sentence><sentence id="5030">But my father was a fighter, you know, he wasn't -- a very kind man, very kind man. </sentence><sentence id="5031">He couldn't stand people being hurt. </sentence><sentence id="5032">He was a very good employer, and I hear that now from people, that he was an excellent employer. </sentence><sentence id="5033">He was also involved in city affairs, 1 mean he was in the city council, he was in the Jewish community, of course, he was -- he was a pillar of the society. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="5044">A: Okay, well the world was hard for her. </sentence><sentence id="5045">Living in other people's houses was hard for her. </sentence><sentence id="5046">My father wa -- my mother was always very clean, her house was always very orderly. </sentence><sentence id="5047">She had excellent taste. </sentence><sentence id="5048">So for her to be at somebody else's house, it was very difficult. </sentence><sentence id="5049">She -- I mean, she had no other choice, you know. </sentence><sentence id="5050">And before we went into hiding, during the Italian occupation, when we had lived in the villages of the mountains of Pilion, here again we were renting a room, or two rooms from somebody else's house. </sentence><sentence id="5051">So that was hard for her, too, you know, to be in a village, here is this lady who is -- she wasn't spoiled, I want you to know, I mean, she was -- she was a woman who had a good life, but she wasn't spoiled. </sentence><sentence id="5052">So, you know, these things did take some toll, I think. </sentence><sentence id="5053">But I think the hardest thing for her was when we lost the factory, a lot of her - - of friends, who at least appeared to be friends during the good times, just disappeared. </sentence><sentence id="5054">And that she never forgot, that was a trauma for her, that the friends that she had helped, and friends that she was counting on, and has been to their house, they have been to her house, kind of discarded us because they were not -- they didn't have money any more, for awhile. </sentence><sentence id="5055">So that really traumatized her. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="5069">Q: They weren't really friends. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="5071">A: That's what I kept on telling her, because she used to say to me, "Don't count so much on your friends." </sentence><sentence id="5072">And I would say, "What? </sentence><sentence id="5073">My friends are wonderful." </sentence><sentence id="5074">You know, this kind of thing. </sentence><sentence id="5075">She'd say, "Well, they are wonderful until things change." </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="5076">Q: So that she lost some of her faith in humanity? </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="5077">A: Exactly. </sentence><sentence id="5078">I think she did. </sentence><sentence id="5079">The war did that, her friends did that. </sentence><sentence id="5080">And it was a constant struggle, yes. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="5085">Q: How important was she to your father, and to his state of mind, did he count on her utterly? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="5087">Was his mood dependent on her support? </sentence><sentence id="5088">What was their relationship like? </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="5089">A: Yeah, I think my mother catered a lot to my father, because he -- he had diabetes, so she always took good care of him. </sentence><sentence id="5090">I mean, she would -- those days they used to weigh things, because you know, you have to eat a certain amount of carbohydrates, and a certain amount of protein, I think. </sentence><sentence id="5091">But this became her responsibility of taking care of him in this way. </sentence><sentence id="5092">And she would weigh everything. </sentence><sentence id="5093">I remember he loved cherries, so the season of cherries would come, and they would count like eight cherries on the little plate, and he would say, "What is this, eight cherries? </sentence><sentence id="5094">Bring the bow] of cherries here." </sentence><sentence id="5095">And she would freak out, say, "But these are weighted." </sentence><sentence id="5096">You know, so it was like the joke, we weigh things and he -- he would sneak a few other cherries, you know, from the bowl. </sentence><sentence id="5097">So yes, but he did count on her support. </sentence><sentence id="5098">She was very supportive of him, she was always there for him. </sentence><sentence id="5099">I mean, they had a very close relationship. </sentence><sentence id="5100">But she begun to get depressed, and I think she had great difficulty overcoming this depression and slowly with every more d -- every difficulty that came along, it was harder for her to come on -- to overcome this. </sentence><sentence id="5101">So I guess she slowly started withdrawing, and withdrawing more and more. </sentence><sentence id="5102">Then she had -- her appetite was diminished. </sentence><sentence id="5103">She also had a problem with saliva, she couldn't produce enough saliva to chew her food. </sentence><sentence id="5104">And I don't know if this was the result of a dental procedure that she had, or not, I -- I -- I'm not quite clear, I don't remember, actually, at this point. </sentence><sentence id="5105">But she -- she had lost saliva, so she couldn't chew her food, and it was very painful. </sentence><sentence id="5106">And she started losing a tremendous amount of weight. </sentence><sentence id="5107">Then she was put on medication and on some vitamins, and things like that. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="5128">Q: And what ti -- at what -- what age would she be -- or what -- in what years was this taking place? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="5130">A: I think -- the depression, you know, was -- was -- it was there but not very prominent in the 50's. </sentence><sentence id="5131">I think towards the -- the end of the fift -- probab -- probably after I left, I think things got worse, because also the difficulties with the factory became much more. </sentence><sentence id="5132">There were a couple of clients who had big orders, and they cancelled them because they had financial problems and couldn't -- couldn't do it. </sentence><sentence id="5133">So that, of course, affected our financial situation. </sentence><sentence id="5134">So, I think she got tired, and she just didn't want to fight any more. </sentence><sentence id="5135">And I left in "58, so I'm sure that my leaving was something, you know, difficult for her. </sentence><sentence id="5136">She always hoped to be able to come and visit me, and see me in my new place. </sentence><sentence id="5137">She wasn't able to do that, my father's heart condition and diabetes were not doing too well, plus all the financial difficulties, you know, couldn't -- they couldn't afford the trip. </sentence><sentence id="5138">It was that simple. </sentence><sentence id="5139">So I think that certainly made her upset, and unhappy, in addition to everything else. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="5151">Q: Did she see lots of -- of your sister, Yola? </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="5274">Q: What was going on in her life when she died? </sentence><sentence id="5275">I mean, were there -- was it just a gradual sliding into greater depression, or was there something else that wer -- was happening that made her feel she didn't want to go on? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="5278">A: Yeah, I think it was a gradual depression. </sentence><sentence id="5279">I think -- I think that she saw no future to anything. </sentence><sentence id="5280">You know, I think depression -- and we are talking about clinical depression, we are not talking about just having the blues, it -- if it's not addressed, that's how it -- it ends up. </sentence><sentence id="5281">And those days, you know, people didn't understand depression, I think they don't understand depression even today in many ways. </sentence><sentence id="5282">Greece is not a -- a place where people, you know, understand these kind of things. </sentence><sentence id="5283">Certainly nobody in the family understood the enormity of it. </sentence><sentence id="5284">I think she did see a doctor, who maybe put her on antidepressants or something, but that was shortly before she died. </sentence><sentence id="5285">So, it was not a long therapy before that. </sentence><sentence id="5286">You know, she just didn't have -- she had lost the -- the zest for life. </sentence><sentence id="5287">Everything seemed to be just enormous for her, even if I would say, well, can my friends stay for dinner, and this was a friend she knew, and somebody, you know, she didn't have to particularly make something special, it seemed like it was too much for her. </sentence><sentence id="5288">Or they had to move from one apartment to the other because the lease expired and this man was raising the price. </sentence><sentence id="5289">And that was a tremendous thing for her, to -- to have to move again. </sentence><sentence id="5290">To -- to pack, to organize. </sentence><sentence id="5291">I mean, she had moved many times in her life, so things become enormous all of a sudden. </sentence><sentence id="5292">I mean, the slightest thing becomes enormous. </sentence><sentence id="5293">And I think she just couldn't deal with any of that any more. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="5310">Q: Did she talk about her -- I mean, did she leave a note, ho -- I mean -- how do you know that she committed suicide? </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="5374">Q: This is a continuation of a United States Holocaust Memorial Museum interview with Paulette Nehama. </sentence><sentence id="5375">This is tape number six, side B. You were telling me how you found out. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="5378">A: Okay. </sentence><sentence id="5379">I had an aunt who lived in New York, and I think my brother-in-law called her to call Isaac, because they didn't know our telephone number in California. </sentence><sentence id="5380">And she called Isaac at the office to tell him. </sentence><sentence id="5381">They didn't call me direct to tell me. </sentence><sentence id="5382">So Isaac came home early, and then he asked me to sit down next to him, and he said, "I have to tell you, Mother died." </sentence><sentence id="5383">And when he said Mother died, I thought he was talking about his mother. </sentence><sentence id="5384">And I'm thinking, why is he telling me his mother died, she died, you know, in the Holocaust. </sentence><sentence id="5385">Why now he tells me this? </sentence><sentence id="5386">I know, and I said, "I know." </sentence><sentence id="5387">You know, like I was trying to figure it out. </sentence><sentence id="5388">He said, "No, not my mother, your mother died." </sentence><sentence id="5389">But he -- he said nothing about suicide. </sentence><sentence id="5390">He told me that she died, and you know, it was something I just couldn't grasp, I just couldn't get in my head. </sentence><sentence id="5391">So it took me a couple of days to absorb it. </sentence><sentence id="5392">Then I got a letter -- then I called home. </sentence><sentence id="5393">And I think it was -- you know, your mind gets kind of blocked in situations like this. </sentence><sentence id="5394">Because I called, and it was after the funeral, so I spoke to my father, and my father said, "We lost Thaliki," -- Thalia was my mother's name. </sentence><sentence id="5395">Thaliki is like a diminutive. </sentence><sentence id="5396">And he said, "We lost Thaliki," and here I'm thinking, you lost her, why don't you look for her? </sentence><sentence id="5397">You know, why don't you go find her, call the police or something. </sentence><sentence id="5398">I didn't tell him that, but that was the thought that went through my mind. </sentence><sentence id="5399">So it was -- it was very differ -- difficult to be that very far away. </sentence><sentence id="5400">And then my sister sent me a letter, I asked her to -- to tell me what happened, and she sent me her -- a long, long letter, with all the details, which I brought it to therapy, and wrote it -- I mean, read it there. </sentence><sentence id="5401">And that was quite earthshaking and w -- and I was trying to avoid reading that in therapy, and -- because the letter is in Greek, so I told my therapist I cannot do it, it's in Greece, you want -- Greek, you don't understand anything. </sentence><sentence id="5402">Said, "That's all right, you will translate." </sentence><sentence id="5403">Which of course I did. </sentence><sentence id="5404">It was a very hard session, she cried, too. </sentence><sentence id="5405">Yeah. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="5435">Q: And the distance would be so -- so painful, I think. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="5437">A: Oh, it was terrible. </sentence><sentence id="5438">It was -- it was hard, because you know, I couldn't communicate other than a letter that used to take 10 days to arrive. </sentence><sentence id="5439">And phone was not so -- you know, nowadays you can call, and it doesn't cost that much. </sentence><sentence id="5440">Those days, I mean, phone calls to Greece were very expensive, and I think we talked a couple of times on the phone, I spoke with my father, with Yola. </sentence><sentence id="5441">And everybody there were thinking how am I gonna cope with being alone here, and not having a support system. </sentence><sentence id="5442">So that was -- then on top of that, two days later, Isaac came to Washington because he had an interview with Bellcom. </sentence><sentence id="5443">And this was prearranged of course, and that interview was important, so he left and he came here. </sentence><sentence id="5444">And while he was gone, I got a call from a teacher of mine who happened to be in New York. </sentence><sentence id="5445">She had no idea my mother died, but she called me just to say hello, and to say how are you doing. </sentence><sentence id="5446">And I'm saying to her -- she's calling from new -- from New York, and I'm saying, you know, my mother died, and there are tears coming down [indecipherable] poor woman, I mean, she didn't know what to do over the phone. </sentence><sentence id="5447">So -- but that's -- it was a point of connection with somebody I knew, that I could tell some. </sentence><sentence id="5448">Yeah. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="5462">Q: Which you needed so desperately, I -- I think. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="5464">A: Right, right, yeah, yeah. </sentence><sentence id="5465">Right. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="5468">Q: You must have thought about this a lot, but do you think there was any connection that we can draw between the Holocaust and your mother's sufferings, hiding, losing almost everything, and her depression and death, or do you think that perhaps -- no, you tell me. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="5470">A: Well, actually, I don't know, because there are a -- a lot of people who -- who went through the Holocaust and did not commit suicide. </sentence><sentence id="5471">So, you cannot pin it just on that. </sentence><sentence id="5472">I think there are many factors that go into something like this. </sentence><sentence id="5473">It's not only one thing. </sentence><sentence id="5474">You cannot say that it was just because of that, but certainly it has played -- I mean, the war and the Holocaust have played a major part in her lowt -- outlook to life. </sentence><sentence id="5475">So, you know, it's not one thing, but it definitely did have something to do with it, yeah. </sentence><sentence id="5476">But here again, there are lots of people who have gone through difficulties, or maybe even harder things, and still are alive. </sentence><sentence id="5477">So, part of it is her make-up, I think. </sentence><sentence id="5478">You know, there isn't a single answer. </sentence><sentence id="5479">There is no single answer, and that's the hardest thing in dealing with that, that you can't find an answer to say, well, I'll pinpoint that this was it. </sentence><sentence id="5480">There isn't. </sentence><sentence id="5481">It's a combination of things. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="5494">Q: Now you told me about therapy when -- and -- and reading the letter from your sister telling you of your mother's suicide, but what was it that helped you come to terms with it? </sentence><sentence id="5495">Was it just accepting it? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="5498">A: Yeah, sure. </sentence><sentence id="5499">That it was her decision, although this is not a decision I would choose for myself, because I don't want to leave this kind of legacy to my children. </sentence><sentence id="5500">But here again, I'm a different person, other factors go into my life, so who knows? </sentence><sentence id="5501">I think time has also something to do with it. </sentence><sentence id="5502">Education about the subject has a lot to do with it. </sentence><sentence id="5503">And I really have researched the subject in any possible way. </sentence><sentence id="5504">I once thought of running a group of people who survived the suicide of someone. </sentence><sentence id="5505">And then I decided maybe I wasn't ready to do that, because i have to be a little more detached from it, and I didn't feel I was that detached yet, when I wanted to do the group. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="5515">Q: Tell me about the areas that you have focused on in your work. </sentence><sentence id="5516">We really -- we've really, in these hours of interviewing, we talked about your early work in Athens, and we've mentioned here and there your social work, but we've not addressed it in any detail. </sentence><sentence id="5517">We talked about your interview too, when you were -- before having your first baby, when you might have returned to doing more work then, but so we -- le -- let's go back and have you pick up how you resumed your career, as the girls were growing up. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="5521">A: Okay. </sentence><sentence id="5522">Okay, well, as I said, I worked for the International Social Service in New York for a short period of time, a few months, which was a job I liked, and fitted me like a glove, it was perfect, because it was dealing with Greek adoptions, and people I knew from Greece I had to communicate with. </sentence><sentence id="5523">Anyway, well after Sarah was born, I did not work any more. </sentence><sentence id="5524">I -- and after the other children were born I stayed home. </sentence><sentence id="5525">I was involved in Brownies, and maybe school activities and things like that. </sentence><sentence id="5526">Actually I did work in the evenings, when I think Nicole was in kindergarten, for Garfinkels -- part time -- this was my part time job. </sentence><sentence id="5527">And it was primarily because I needed to do something, and I needed to do something very part time. </sentence><sentence id="5528">But I -- I could start exploring other things. </sentence><sentence id="5529">But I always wanted to go back to social work, because this was a field that always interests me. </sentence><sentence id="5530">I mean, I'm interested in people, and their lives, and what makes them tick, and what's -- how they conduct their lives, what's in their lives, what influence their lives. </sentence><sentence id="5531">So, I had a Bachelor's degree from Greece, from Pierce College, which was an American school. </sentence><sentence id="5532">And I knew I couldn't do very much, but when Nicole went to first grade, I -- I thought </sentence></p><p><sentence id="5533"> seriously of getting a job in social work. </sentence><sentence id="5534">And somebody told me about the Jewish Social Service in Rockville, that they were looking for a social worker at the department of aging, I think. </sentence><sentence id="5535">And I called, and verified that indeed they did need somebody, asked me to send my resume, which I did, and they called me back, they wanted me to go for an interview, which was terrific. </sentence><sentence id="5536">Well, I did go to the interview, but I went a day earlier than the interview was scheduled, like I was not anxious, I guess. </sentence><sentence id="5537">And then I realized when I'm there, because the receptionist looks at [indecipherable] says, "You know, I don't have you down for today. </sentence><sentence id="5538">I think your interview's tomorrow." </sentence><sentence id="5539">I'm protesting, I said, "No, no, it's today at 10 o'clock." </sentence><sentence id="5540">And then I realized I'm wrong, but then I'm thinking if I tell them I'm wrong, they'1l never hire me. </sentence><sentence id="5541">So anyway, the assistant director who was to interview me, Marty Moss was his name, he -- he said to me, "I thought this interview was tomorrow, but anyway since you're here, I have 10 minutes because I have to go into a meeting. </sentence><sentence id="5542">Let's just discuss a few minutes of what is available, and what you can do [indecipherable]. </sentence><sentence id="5543">And maybe we" ll have to have a second interview at one time." </sentence><sentence id="5544">Well, he's telling me that the opening is at the Department of Aging in the Jewish Social Service. </sentence><sentence id="5545">Now, I know nothing about aging. </sentence><sentence id="5546">I've never worked with older people, I don't know what to do with them. </sentence><sentence id="5547">I want to work with children. </sentence><sentence id="5548">Anyway, I said okay. </sentence><sentence id="5549">And then I get a call from the chairperson of the Department of Aging to go for a second interview. </sentence><sentence id="5550">And I'm thinking, do I really want to work with older people? </sentence><sentence id="5551">I'm not sure. </sentence><sentence id="5552">But anyway, it was an entrance. </sentence><sentence id="5553">So I think the question that really, she asked me, was -- I had done some volunteer work for the Jewish Community Center, we were doing some kind of a woman's day, and I had chosen the older women, and I had done, you know, some -- a presentation about it, and gathered material, and we had the show, a -- a fashion show for older women, you know, because we felt they were neglected in the fashion, things like that. </sentence><sentence id="5554">Which went very well, actually. </sentence><sentence id="5555">And I was telling her </sentence></p><p><sentence id="5556"> about that, and she said, "You'd be perfect for the department". </sentence><sentence id="5557">And I'm thinking, you don't know -- I don't either, I don't know anything. </sentence><sentence id="5558">But anyway, they hired me. </sentence><sentence id="5559">And I was excited, and I thought well, I'll learn. </sentence><sentence id="5560">If I don't like it, I can always leave. </sentence><sentence id="5561">So that was how I started, and once I started working with older people, I just loved it. </sentence><sentence id="5562">I found it so rewarding. </sentence><sentence id="5563">You know, here I was, always wanted to work with children, and now I'm finding the other end of life more interesting, actually, and very rewarding. </sentence><sentence id="5564">So it was great, it was a great team to work with. </sentence><sentence id="5565">It was a good a -- very good agency, very good camaraderie and professionalism. </sentence><sentence id="5566">And I enjoy every minute of it, and I stayed there. </sentence><sentence id="5567">I think I started in "74, and stayed until 1990. </sentence><sentence id="5568">That's a long time. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="5569">And while I was working there -- I always wanted to do therapy, and I had taken some courses, and then while I was at the Jewish Social Service, the -- my department chair said, "Paulette, you've got to get your Master's degree. </sentence><sentence id="5570">You are doing things that Master's degree social workers are doing, but we can't pay you as a Master's degree social worker." </sentence><sentence id="5571">So finally I thought about it, and thought about it, and I've never been to an American university, I was 49 years old. </sentence><sentence id="5572">So when I told a friend, I said, "I'm 49, how am I gonna go to school?" </sentence><sentence id="5573">She said, "You'll be 49 whether you go or not, just go." </sentence><sentence id="5574">So finally I talked it over with Isaac, I said I would need a lot of help. </sentence><sentence id="5575">This was a time that Maya had started driving, and she said, "I'll help, I'll help, I'll do all your [indecipherable] driving for you." </sentence><sentence id="5576">So everybody pitched in and I did go to school. </sentence><sentence id="5577">They accepted me as an advanced standing student because of my experience with social work. </sentence><sentence id="5578">They waived ce -- certain courses the first semester, and they waived field placement the first semester, because I was still working for the Jewish Social Service part time. </sentence><sentence id="5579">So my first year was much lighter than the other students here. </sentence><sentence id="5580">Second year was harder, I had to -- to quit working for the Jewish Social Service, because I couldn't handle everything, because I did have a field placement, and I had an excellent supervisor. </sentence><sentence id="5581">It was in a psychiatric clinic, a community </sentence></p><p><sentence id="5582"> psychiatric clinic in Witten. </sentence><sentence id="5583">And I got excellent experience, I had a wonderful supervisor, Meedul Shore. </sentence><sentence id="5584">And of course I had the classes, you know, I had to go to school, and plus the family. </sentence><sentence id="5585">Sarah was already in college, Maya and Nicole were home. </sentence><sentence id="5586">So it was hard writing papers, I've never written a paper in this country. </sentence><sentence id="5587">I mean, I've written papers in Greece, but they were different. </sentence><sentence id="5588">It was a little hard, because as I said, this was a new experience for me. </sentence><sentence id="5589">I didn't even know how to use the library. </sentence><sentence id="5590">I had to ask how to use the library. </sentence><sentence id="5591">It was a lot of work, an awful lot of work, but I loved every minute of it, because I felt I was doing it because I wanted to do it. </sentence><sentence id="5592">And I graduated with a Master's in 1991. </sentence><sentence id="5593">And I went back to the Jewish Social Service, and -- but at the time they had a part time job only available, and they said, "Come, it's part time, if something opens as full time, we'll get you as full time." </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="5594">Q: I was just going to ask your -- your Master's degree is in -- is it -- </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="5595">A: Social work </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="5596">Q: -- social work at Catholic University? </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="5597">A: Uh-huh, right, yeah. </sentence><sentence id="5598">1991. </sentence><sentence id="5599">And while I was working for the Jewish Social Service, my supervisor at the community psychiatric clinic, called me one day, and he said, ""You know, there is a psychiatrist who is looking for a social worker to work for him to do intakes. </sentence><sentence id="5600">Are you interested?" </sentence><sentence id="5601">And I said, "I'm interested, but I'm not leaving Jewish Social Service." </sentence><sentence id="5602">So he says, "T'll have him call you." </sentence><sentence id="5603">So he calls me, and he says he's looking for a social worker to do his intakes. </sentence><sentence id="5604">Intakes are, you know, you -- you g -- see the person for the first time, you collect all the information, and then you give it to him, and then he determines the treatment and this kind of thing. </sentence><sentence id="5605">But it's an elaborate process, I mean, the interviews have to be quite long, and to understand the problem, and this kind of thing. </sentence><sentence id="5606">So when he called me, I was leaving for Arizona the next day. </sentence><sentence id="5607">It was one of Isaac's retreats. </sentence><sentence id="5608">So I said to him, "I'm leaving for a week." </sentence><sentence id="5609">He said,    "Send me your resume, and then we'll talk when you come back." </sentence><sentence id="5610">I came back, he said, "Come and see me." </sentence><sentence id="5611">So I went to see him, we -- he decided to hire me. </sentence><sentence id="5612">So I was working for him part time, and I stayed with him 11 years. </sentence><sentence id="5613">I was working both at the Jewish Social Service, and with him. </sentence><sentence id="5614">His name is Aaron Burger, he is in Silver Spring, very nice man. </sentence><sentence id="5615">So that was a very good experience, too, because he is a good supervisor also, and a very good -- good friend, also, he became. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="5636">Q: Ho-How would you split your time, how many hours would you work at each place? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="5638">A: Well, since I was working half time at the Jewish Social Service, actually I would go -- I would work one evening for him, and I would see four or five people, once a week. </sentence><sentence id="5639">Then I would, on my days off from the Jewish Social Service, I would go to his office, and see people. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="5640">But he also gave me some people from -- for treatment, some cases that didn't require his skills, you know. </sentence><sentence id="5641">And then, when I quit Jewish Social Service in 1990, because Isaac was retiring, and I -- we were thinking a lot about traveling to Europe and all that kind of stuff, I left Jewish Social Service, and continued working with him for -- until after Ian was born, and then I told him I wanted to spend time with my grandson. </sentence><sentence id="5642">And that was it. </sentence><sentence id="5643">Which he fully understood, and -- because he has grandchildren of his own. </sentence><sentence id="5644">And I'm friends with his wife, and his daughter, we became quite good friends. </sentence><sentence id="5645">So -- </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="5646">Q: How did you feel about your career? </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="5647">A: I love my career. </sentence><sentence id="5648">And now I'm working -- for awhile I didn't work, after I left Dr. Burger, but then I worked for -- also part time as a contract worker for a company called Aging Network Services, which is located in Bethesda. </sentence><sentence id="5649">They've been in business for 20 years. </sentence><sentence id="5650">It's run by two social workers, and they needed a Master's degree social worker to supervise social workers who do care managers, and do care management. </sentence><sentence id="5651">Coordinating services, and seeing families, and this kind of thing. </sentence><sentence id="5652">And I'm still with them, very part time, but I love doing it. </sentence><sentence id="5653">I mean, I -- I do enjoy my career, my career is just the best career for me, anyway. </sentence><sentence id="5654">It's great. </sentence><sentence id="5655">Once I was thinking that I may want to change careers at times, because sometimes people's problems become too big, and you wonder how good you are at it or not, in helping. </sentence><sentence id="5656">But I think this was a phase I had gone through, so I decided to take a catering course, cause I love to cook, and I thought well, maybe I'll do that professionally. </sentence><sentence id="5657">But I did take the course, I got the certificate, I enjoyed the course, but I haven't opened a catering thing. </sentence><sentence id="5658">Isaac wasn't too happy for me to do that. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="5672">Q: Maybe you'll -- well, you must have thought about this, but it almost seems as if all these different strands, or yarns, life experiences come together to make you -- or to equip you to do one thing very well. </sentence><sentence id="5673">And maybe you've -- maybe you've -- maybe you see that. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="5676">A: Right. </sentence><sentence id="5677">I think, you know, your past experiences, I mean your history, your past history informs your present, right? </sentence><sentence id="5678">And I think I am who I am because of my past experiences, and my make-up, of course, but yes, I've learned through my experiences. </sentence><sentence id="5679">And I think my work relates very well to my experiences of other people. </sentence><sentence id="5680">Because somebody was asking me what are the major things that you understand about a client. </sentence><sentence id="5681">And I said, "I understand culture, and different culture. </sentence><sentence id="5682">I understand suffering. </sentence><sentence id="5683">I understand hardships. </sentence><sentence id="5684">I understand moving away from a country, and from family, and going to another country and starting to make a life there. </sentence><sentence id="5685">I understand loneliness, lonesomeness. </sentence><sentence id="5686">I understand raising children, I understand having a husband and working with him, and you know, with his difficulties, and all that kind of stuff." </sentence><sentence id="5687">So I understand these things. </sentence><sentence id="5688">Somehow I -- they come instinctively now. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="5702">Q: You're still -- your -- you're not in regular employment at the moment, but you are still d -- doing what seems to be very important work, still arranging, and organizing, and making things </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="5704"> happen. </sentence><sentence id="5705">I base that on you having mentioned getting performing artists t-to perform regularly for the elderly. </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="5706">A: Seniors. </sentence><sentence id="5707">Yeah, this is volunteer work. </sentence><sentence id="5708">I mean, my work for the Aging Network Services is -- is paid work. </sentence><sentence id="5709">I'm a member of WPAS, or Washington Performing Arts Society, the women's committee, and the women's committee has several subcommittees. </sentence><sentence id="5710">And one of the committees I co-chair with another woman, is called Enriching Experiences for Seniors, that started about 10 or 12 years ago. </sentence><sentence id="5711">And what we do is we bring local artists to senior centers, nursing homes, assisted livings, recreation centers for senior adults. </sentence><sentence id="5712">What we do is just we coordinate these things. </sentence><sentence id="5713">You have to coordinate the center, find the activities director, the date, coordinate the artist, and the days they are available to do this kind of things. </sentence><sentence id="5714">And also provide the volunteers from the women's committee who go to audit the performance, because this way they give us feedback on the artists and the interaction between the -- all the people and the artists, so we" ll know whether to hire them for next year or not. </sentence><sentence id="5715">This is a free program to the community -- I mean, the seniors don't pay anything for this. </sentence><sentence id="5716">WPAS has a budget for the senior program. </sentence><sentence id="5717">And that's what I do in addition to working for the gala, which is a [indecipherable] event, fundraising event, or the auction, or the embassy adoption program, which is another women's committee program, where embassies adopt school, and the -- for the semester, or for the year, and the children study about that particular country. </sentence><sentence id="5718">And I usually choose Greece. </sentence><sentence id="5719">So the children -- the school that chooses Greece, and the embassy, I'm the liaison between the two of them. </sentence><sentence id="5720">So we go -- the representative for the Greek embassy, or the other embassies go to the school, talk to the children about it. </sentence><sentence id="5721">The children study about Greece, and work with the teachers, we work with the teachers, and then at the end of the semester, they put up a presentation, the embassy invites them for -- for cookies and juice, or whatever. </sentence><sentence id="5722">And they give a presentation to </sentence></p><p><sentence id="5723"> the ambassador, or the staff members of the embassy. </sentence><sentence id="5724">And then we take the children to a Greek restaurant, so they can taste a little food. </sentence><sentence id="5725">These are sixth graders, they are 12 years old, and they are wonderful. </sentence><sentence id="5726">This -- I mean, 50 embassies participate in this -- in this program, and it's a fantastic program for teachers and children. </sentence><sentence id="5727">The teachers love this program because the children learn so much through that program about the other countries. </sentence><sentence id="5728">And it's very educational, it's a fun program, it's just great. </sentence><sentence id="5729">So I love doing Greece, as you understand. </sentence><sentence id="5730">Last year there were -- the Greek embassy was between ambassadors, so they didn't have time to participate in the program, so they were not there. </sentence><sentence id="5731">So I did the embassy of the Bahamas, which was also a nice experience, you know, and I went to a school pretty far away in someplace -- I think it was northeast Washington. </sentence><sentence id="5732">And the wife of the ambassador came to the school, they had -- they invited the children to their embassy of the Bahamas. </sentence><sentence id="5733">They had the presentation, they provided lunch at the embassy, from the whole class. </sentence><sentence id="5734">It was a good experience. </sentence><sentence id="5735">I mean, to -- to -- somehow I feel that, you know, just doing Greece every year kind of limits me to other countries, because people tell me wonderful things about the embassy of Israel, you know, and Thailand or other countries. </sentence><sentence id="5736">But I love Greece, so I'Il do anything to promote Greece, and to -- and teach children about it. </sentence><sentence id="5737">There is so much. </sentence><sentence

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="5750">Q: You d -- I was -- I was thinking back to your mother in Volos, and her community activities, and thinking of things that you are doing in your new community, maybe following in a family tradition. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="5752">A: Oh sure. </sentence><sentence id="5753">They're different things, but yes, the sense of community was very strong in my family, and giving to the community. </sentence><sentence id="5754">My mother volunteered, there was a Jewish organization in Volos, a women's organization, she volunteered that -- there. </sentence><sentence id="5755">She volunteered at the orphanage in Volos. </sentence><sentence id="5756">There was an orphan -- not a Jewish orphanage, an orphanage in Volos, and sometimes she would take me with her. </sentence><sentence id="5757">And I loved going with her, and talking with the children there, but I was also petrified that if my mother and father were to die, I would end up in that orphanage. </sentence><sentence id="5758">I was so scared of that, of them dying and me being in the orphanage. </sentence><sentence id="5759">And I remember when I had this visit in Volos, when it was like the 50 year reunion I was telling you, Yola and I had taken a taxi to go to the Jewish cemetery, because our grandparents are buried there. </sentence><sentence id="5760">So as we are passing, the driver -- the taxi driver says, "And here is, on the left is the orphanage." </sentence><sentence id="5761">And I said to him, "Stop!" </sentence><sentence id="5762">And he scratches on his brakes, and he stops the taxi. </sentence><sentence id="5763">And he said, ""What happened?" </sentence><sentence id="5764">I said, "Stop, I want to see this orphanage." </sentence><sentence id="5765">It seemed so small to me. </sentence><sentence id="5766">I said, "Is this the same orphanage that was here?" " </sentence><sentence id="5767">Oh yeah," he said, "nothing has changed. </sentence><sentence id="5768">They just painted it, but it's the same thing." </sentence><sentence id="5769">It looked so tiny. </sentence><sentence id="5770">I mean, I remember it like a big place, with a big yard. </sentence><sentence id="5771">It's -- it's so funny when you see things as an adult, and how you see things as a child, yeah. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="5797">A: Okay. </sentence><sentence id="5798">As I told you, my parents were first cousins, so my father was the second child, and first son. </sentence><sentence id="5799">There were five children in his family. </sentence><sentence id="5800">His mother was the eldest of seven children. </sentence><sentence id="5801">My grandparents had seven children, two girls. </sentence><sentence id="5802">First one, my paternal grandmother, last one my maternal grandmother, and there were boys in between. </sentence><sentence id="5803">So there were five children in my father's family. </sentence><sentence id="5804">Abusta was the eldest, my father was the second, there were two girls, and Saould, or Sauld was the youngest, who was born in 19 -- I think he was born 1909, or 1910. </sentence><sentence id="5805">So he was like an afterthought. </sentence><sentence id="5806">He was much younger compared to the other siblings in the family. </sentence><sentence id="5807">Well, none of them are alive. </sentence><sentence id="5808">They all went to hiding in different places. </sentence><sentence id="5809">My fourth aunt, the fourth child in the family was the only one who survived until 1976, I think. </sentence><sentence id="5810">She came to the United States. </sentence><sentence id="5811">She was adopted by an uncle, the brother of -- of her mother, who was married, and they couldn't have any children. </sentence><sentence id="5812">So Connie used to go to their house, and they had her there, and they played with her, and they loved her, they absolutely were in love with her. </sentence><sentence id="5813">And they decided to come -- to go to Teriester first. </sentence><sentence id="5814">So they asked if they could take her along. </sentence><sentence id="5815">And they did, and then they decided they wanted to come to the United States. </sentence><sentence id="5816">I mean, the uncle, and his wife. </sentence><sentence id="5817">So they went back to Greece, and I don't know if it's an official adoption, whether there were papers of adoption taken. </sentence><sentence id="5818">But somehow it seems like the family, or the parents, anyway, decided to -- to let her go with the uncle, because they felt she will have a wonderful life in the United States, and not in Volos. </sentence><sentence id="5819">So she came to the United States, and she didn't know she was adopted until much, much later in life. </sentence><sentence id="5820">She was an adult, I think, when she found out about that. </sentence><sentence id="5821">She got married, and had a son, whom I see, Bob Guburbon. </sentence><sentence id="5822">My aunt died in, I think, "70 -- let me see, no, she must have died in "76 or "77, yeah, in Florida. </sentence><sentence id="5823">And her husband died a few years later. </sentence><sentence id="5824">I see her grand -- h-her son, often. </sentence><sentence id="5825">This aunt, Connie, send us care packages after the war was over, with food, with clothes. </sentence><sentence id="5826">She would send fancy party clothes for me, and they looked so funny, because you know, I mean, here I didn't have any clothes, and I had a -- an organza dress, old dress. </sentence><sentence id="5827">And she would send some cans, I mean, chocolates. </sentence><sentence id="5828">And she once sent shoes for my father. </sentence><sentence id="5829">| remember they were so huge. </sentence><sentence id="5830">I mean, my father was a tall and big man, and these shoes were tremendous for him. </sentence><sentence id="5831">I mean, he couldn't wear them. </sentence><sentence id="5832">And she sended a teddy bear for me. </sentence><sentence id="5833">So I always remember her, you know, for doing these things. </sentence><sentence id="5834">Of course, I met her when I came to the United States. </sentence><sentence id="5835">But I mean, she had never met her siblings. </sentence><sentence id="5836">She was in touch with them. </sentence><sentence id="5837">I don't know if she was in touch with them before the war, but after the war, I mean, she came through with sending care packages. </sentence><sentence id="5838">And then, of course, they were corresponding with -- "scuse me -- with my father, and he was the one who would tell the news, you know, t-to -- to his sisters. </sentence><sentence id="5839">And my Aunt Julia corresponded with her, because Julia had come to the United States to visit her son who was studying, and has seen Connie. </sentence><sentence id="5840">Now, my father's younger brother, Saul was hiding in somebody's house, I think the name was aseema -- Aseemomeetees. </sentence><sentence id="5841">And there were two daughters and a son, maybe two sons. </sentence><sentence id="5842">And he fell in love with the oldest daughter, and she with him. </sentence><sentence id="5843">Saul was a handsome, beautiful man. </sentence><sentence id="5844">And after the war was over, they kept on seeing each other, and dating each other, and they wanted to get married, but of course she was Christian Orthodox, and the rabbi wouldn't marry them, she had to convert. </sentence><sentence id="5845">So she took all the lessons that she needed to do to convert. </sentence><sentence id="5846">But then there was a little detail which I don't remember now, and they decided they were gonna go to France, and get married in Paris. </sentence><sentence id="5847">So they did go to Paris and got married, and came back to live in Athens. </sentence><sentence id="5848">And she knew more about Jewish holidays than any of us did. </sentence><sentence id="5849">My mother didn't know them, and she would call -- Deena, was her name. </sentence><sentence id="5850">Deena would call my mother and say, "Do you know that today is," such and such a holiday. </sentence><sentence id="5851">My mother would say, "Oh, really?" </sentence><sentence id="5852">I mean, we observed the big holidays, but not the little ones. </sentence><sentence id="5853">And Deena knew everything. </sentence><sentence id="5854">And -- but unfortunately, a few months later, in 1950 -- I think they married deg49, or beginning of "50 -- or deg51 I think it was, he got cancer, a brain tumor. </sentence><sentence id="5855">And they went to Paris and he had surgery and died. </sentence><sentence id="5856">It was terrible. </sentence><sentence id="5857">It was devastating. </sentence><sentence id="5858">He was 40 or 41, very young. </sentence><sentence id="5859">A life, you know, just got done so young. </sentence><sentence id="5860">And of course Deena was totally, totally devastated. </sentence><sentence id="5861">Now, many years later she remarried, but she divorced, this marriage didn't go that well. </sentence><sentence id="5862">Then many years later she married somebody who was living in the United States, in Florida, so -- a -- a -- a Greek, but I think he -- he was Greek American, or someth like that, and he went -- they -- they lived in Florida. </sentence><sentence id="5863">She couldn't stand it, she didn't like Florida, she didn't like America. </sentence><sentence id="5864">So she divorced him too, and she went back to Greece, and now she -- she lives alone. </sentence><sentence id="5865">When I go to Greece she comes and sees me. </sentence><sentence id="5866">She -- she is very warm, very lovely. </sentence><sentence id="5867">I went to -- to volunteer nursing school at the Red Cross in Greece with her sister, her younger sister. </sentence><sentence id="5868">So we were both volunteer nurses at the Red Cross hospital, and we took the classes together. </sentence><sentence id="5869">So I haven't seen her sister for a long time, but Deena, she was a lovely, lovely woman, yeah. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="5956"> for my father it was devastating. </sentence><sentence id="5957">Actually, Saul was a very rambunctious young man, and when he was -- I think at the age of 13, he came to live with my mother and father, because he had diabetes, and somehow wouldn't adhere to any program, and my grandmother had very hard time controlling him, or managing him. </sentence><sentence id="5958">So her blood pressure would go very high, and they were very worried about my grandmother. </sentence><sentence id="5959">So my father said, "Let him stay with us." </sentence><sentence id="5960">And somehow my mother was much more able to -- to work with him, and he loved my mother, he absolutely adored her. </sentence><sentence id="5961">And he stayed with them, he lived with them. </sentence></p></dialogue>
