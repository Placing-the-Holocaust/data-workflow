<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="524">A: The first clue was that I usually meet my friends like I got up in the morning. </sentence><sentence id="525">We had no radio in the house. </sentence><sentence id="526">Very few people had radios; telephones, only doctors and professionals would have a telephone. </sentence><sentence id="527">Got up at eight o'clock, it was a nice sunny day and I went to the beach, a 15 or 20 minutes walk and I went to the beach. </sentence><sentence id="528">Close to nine o'clock usually my friends would show up already and nobody's there. </sentence><sentence id="529">Here and there, there's somebody there, you know. </sentence><sentence id="530">Go fora swim by yourself, how much can you be in the water by yourself. </sentence><sentence id="531">I go out just waiting for people to show up so we usually play cards. </sentence><sentence id="532">Then somebody around ten o'clock, somebody shows up. </sentence><sentence id="533">He says what are you people doing here? </sentence><sentence id="534">Don't you know there's a war? </sentence><sentence id="535">That's how I found out. </sentence><sentence id="536">Actually they bombed already cities at four o'clock in the morning. </sentence><sentence id="537">Four o'clock in the morning, Kiev was bombed, Lvov, other cities, Vilna, quite a few cities were bombed. </sentence><sentence id="538">Our city was bombed too but a little bit later, they bombed our city. </sentence><sentence id="539">That's how I found out. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="556">Q: Were you mobilized or --? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="558">A: Well, in 1941 people one year older than me were mobilized in 1941. </sentence><sentence id="559">Their year was called. </sentence><sentence id="560">Whoever was born in 1922, was 19 years old, they were mobilized like in March and April already, they went to be inducted. </sentence><sentence id="561">At that time when the war broke out, they didn't mobilize any more except whoever was still around who was not sent away to the points where they train you, they would send them right away. </sentence><sentence id="562">Again it was two weeks till the Germans came and they started to evacuate. </sentence><sentence id="563">The first week was normal. </sentence><sentence id="564">They attacked but they were holding their ground for the first four or five days or something. </sentence><sentence id="565">But then they broke through the lines and it was disaster. </sentence><sentence id="566">The first week we were still going into the office and then some of the Russian directors were evacuating their families already, mobilizing some cars or trucks if they had. </sentence><sentence id="567">In our concern too, the director was taking trucks and horse and buggies, putting furniture and stuff and sending family back to Russia. </sentence><sentence id="568">We were just standing there. </sentence><sentence id="569">The Jewish people started thinking about the evacuation because whoever was in the police, or whoever was communist or something, they didn't want to take chances. </sentence><sentence id="570">I think the second week already, it was like they were running. </sentence><sentence id="571">Soldiers were coming back from the fronts in trucks full with soldiers. </sentence><sentence id="572">People tried to get rides with them; some did, some couldn't succeed. </sentence><sentence id="573">Again my family wouldn't think of running; not only mine, the majority didn't think of anything. </sentence><sentence id="574">Even though we knew that the Germans, they're against the Jews but nobody thought of something happening whatever happened. </sentence></p></dialogue>
