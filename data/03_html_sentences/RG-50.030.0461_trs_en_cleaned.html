</sentence><sentence id="452">And it was not even war yet. </sentence><sentence id="453">And if you talk to a Dutch, forbidden means resent. </sentence><sentence id="454">You already start to. </sentence><sentence id="455">In Holland you don't need a lawyer. </sentence><sentence id="456">If you have a handshake because you agree, that is the promise that you make, and you stick to that. </sentence><sentence id="457">You can trust a Dutch word. </sentence><sentence id="458">You cannot trust a German word. </sentence><sentence id="459">It's full of lies, it's full of promises because they want to mellow you. </sentence><sentence id="460">And we are not that way. </sentence><sentence id="461">We are very cautious. </sentence><sentence id="462">So when I saw that shelters were built, when I was told you cannot have lights -- bulbs, like this bright light, forget it. </sentence><sentence id="463">It had to be covered with blue, so the light would go straight down, it would never go outside your window. </sentence><sentence id="464">Now, everybody was taped -- had taped their windows, because ev -- we were bombed. </sentence><sentence id="465">See, if -- then the windows would not break, or it would just hang on the tape. </sentence><sentence id="466">So there were all kind of insinuations. </sentence><sentence id="467">Try to get tires for your bike, because rubber would not be available. </sentence><sentence id="468">It happened. </sentence><sentence id="469">Our bikes were having wooden wheels instead. </sentence><sentence id="470">The word hoarding, here in America, that's a bad word. </sentence><sentence id="471">I hoard. </sentence><sentence id="472">I hoard strange things, because you never know if you need it to use next time. </sentence><sentence id="473">And that's one part that they say, you know, in here. </sentence><sentence id="474">But that was happening in those days. </sentence><sentence id="475">You take things in the house, in case. </sentence><sentence id="476">End of Tape One, Side A Beginning Tape One, Side B </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="525">A: We not only got very good information with the BBC, because of course, they had spies all over, already, in that time. </sentence><sentence id="526">But a -- as certain attitudes, like the next door neighbor with the NSB organization, who were against our government, and if you are very much for the queen, and you are in the military, and you take the oath of defending your country, you just don't take that, you fight back. </sentence><sentence id="527">Not necessarily with a weapon, but you can fight back with sabotage. </sentence><sentence id="528">We sabotaged plenty. </sentence><sentence id="529">So when it was the time for the Germans to go in Holland, they pretended that it was necessary, because they had to in-invade Great Britain. </sentence><sentence id="530">And we just broke the dikes, so the water was -- was all over the bolus. </sentence><sentence id="531">You know, the Netherlands is much lower on the sea level than this country is, so we were used that the water would flow down, and you just cope with the fact that you cannot grow anything any more, and everything run -- drowns. </sentence><sentence id="532">But the point was that the German heavy equipment could not go through, see? </sentence><sentence id="533">So the Germans were forced to go over in the air. </sentence><sentence id="534">It was wall to wall airplanes. </sentence><sentence id="535">And they came with -- what do you call that in -- in English. </sentence><sentence id="536">In -- in German is -- it's falsesharem. </sentence><sentence id="537">Parachutes, parachutes. </sentence><sentence id="538">So, it was a nice target to -- to -- from the ground up, to kill those parachutes when they were coming down. </sentence><sentence id="539">I always felt sorry, because those people were their own age, like me. </sentence><sentence id="540">And why would you kill an -- a young boy that is forced to do something he doesn't want to do? </sentence><sentence id="541">Because, I talked with them. </sentence><sentence id="542">We -- we had the -- you know, that we were on the beach, and I would sneak up on -- on the one guy, he had lots of hair, all black hair. </sentence><sentence id="543">And we -- we made a bet -- the girls around me, you don't dare. </sentence><sentence id="544">So I sneak behind, and I did like this over his hair. </sentence><sentence id="545">And then he would go, "Oh, what are you doing here?" </sentence><sentence id="546">In German, huh. </sentence><sentence id="547">I said, "Don't worry, I'm just -- you know, I'm having a bet, and I won." </sentence><sentence id="548">Now you can see what a crazy kid I was. </sentence><sentence id="549">So we had talks, and then they -- he said, well, don't fear us, because we are just in the army, and if we don't do it, what we are supposed to do, we get killed in our -- our own country. </sentence><sentence id="550">So I found out a lot from them. </sentence><sentence id="551">Besides, I had a girlfriend -- that was after the war, who had a castle in Germany, and she said, "When I was on my own grounds, going a certain direction, there was an -- a guard telling me to go back in my castle, because there was something fa -- fishy in that area." </sentence><sentence id="552">Where the smell came from? </sentence><sentence id="553">Concentration camp. </sentence><sentence id="554">So they had concentration camps all over, and the German population was not supposed to know about it. </sentence><sentence id="555">So, in -- in a way, I -- I always said, I feel like I hate the Germans. </sentence><sentence id="556">I cannot say that, because in every country -- now here, with the politics, you have Republicans, and you have Democrats, also divided. </sentence><sentence id="557">It's incredible. </sentence><sentence id="558">So it is in every country that way. </sentence><sentence id="559">But you had to be careful, because how did you know? </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="615">That all hinders you. </sentence><sentence id="616">So we sp -- we were sponsored after the war, because we could prove that he could come. </sentence><sentence id="617">But if I would dow -- put down on my application, Nazi, or member of that, do you think United States was crazy enough to -- to let me in? </sentence><sentence id="618">See? </sentence><sentence id="619">So -- and we had no intentions. </sentence><sentence id="620">We -- we were ready to fight for what we had to fight. </sentence><sentence id="621">You mean -- I -- I would have been a -- a coward if I would have tried to get out. </sentence><sentence id="622">My job was to protect the people, like the Jews, like the gays, like -- what do you call those people? </sentence><sentence id="623">Gypsies. </sentence><sentence id="624">The Germans had the particular type of person that they did not like, and they were persecuted. </sentence><sentence id="625">So our job was to -- to get coupons so that we could buy food. </sentence><sentence id="626">To get the -- the word Jew off their chest. </sentence><sentence id="627">The -- the word Jew was printed on a star, and that was -- was sewed on -- on any -- any clothing. </sentence><sentence id="628">So if you went on the street, you have to wear that. </sentence><sentence id="629">What we did was take it off, give them another piece of cloth, hide them. </sentence><sentence id="630">They were not allowed in the street any more. </sentence><sentence id="631">Now, yesterday was Kristallnacht. </sentence><sentence id="632">I never forget that either, because any store that belonged to a Jew was smashed in with rocks, with stone that they picked up from the street, because in Holland, every street is done with stones, you don't see concrete that much. </sentence><sentence id="633">And because my family is pretty religious, my -- my father's sister belonged to the Haranhurtus. </sentence><sentence id="634">Haranhurtus is a sect that is very religious, and -- and has a strong faith, and is very optimistic, and helps you. </sentence><sentence id="635">A person with a mental problem, for instance, would feel a lot better if you was in connection with the Haranhurta, because that's -- that was the way they were living. </sentence><sentence id="636">And so we knew a -- a watchmaker, I never forget that either. </sentence><sentence id="637">Now, my aunt lived in Utrecht, a separate city, and that poor family was stoned, and -- and the window was all busted, and people were helping themselves. </sentence><sentence id="638">All those watches were -- were in -- in the store, or clocks, whatever, they just dragged it out. </sentence><sentence id="639">The man was just robbed death. </sentence><sentence id="640">Just because he was a Jew. </sentence><sentence id="641">So I was very res-resentful, and I tell you, when the war was finished, we let them pay. </sentence><sentence id="642">We let the Germans pay before they went back to -- to the German, to their own country. </sentence><sentence id="643">We let them walk, we didn't provide any transportation. </sentence><sentence id="644">Now, that is about a three hour walk. </sentence><sentence id="645">And we had the girls who had been dating, put on the table, on the street. </sentence><sentence id="646">We threw them with rotten eggs, rotten tomatoes, and we shaved their hair off completely, to show everybody that girl is a trait -- betrayed -- for a threat. </sentence><sentence id="647">No, we were very mean. </sentence><sentence id="648">But see, you are made that way. </sentence><sentence id="649">You cannot swallow all that crap. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="705">A: I wanted to see it. </sentence><sentence id="706">I had no fear. </sentence><sentence id="707">I still have no fear. </sentence><sentence id="708">In those days my brother was like Ann Frank in my father's office. </sentence><sentence id="709">My father belonged to the RNVB, that is here, triple A, similar. </sentence><sentence id="710">So he helped motorists in trouble, and stuff like that, and my father was a secretary. </sentence><sentence id="711">Now, I'm 80 now, but I don't look 80. </sentence><sentence id="712">My father at that time, if you were 16 until 50 I think it was, you was not allowed on the street, you would be picked up and transported to Westerbork. </sentence><sentence id="713">Westerbork was a city close to the German border. </sentence><sentence id="714">You would get stripped from your clothing, and they would give you another ID, and you was then transported to a factory in Germany. </sentence><sentence id="715">To heck with that. </sentence><sentence id="716">So, we -- we got food every day to my brother. </sentence><sentence id="717">My father went once to his office, and it was very foggy that day, and a German shouted in his ear, ""Toomshta shoengain." </sentence><sentence id="718">So my father woke up like, "Are you crazy, I'm not going to do that." </sentence><sentence id="719">So he ran -- we all good runners by the way -- around the shelter in -- in that fog, and he was shot at. </sentence><sentence id="720">He heard, you know, the soldier shooting at him. </sentence><sentence id="721">My father made it at home, and he said, "Get me under the -- under the floor." </sentence><sentence id="722">So we did that. </sentence><sentence id="723">Of course, no-nobody came at the door, because they didn't know, in that fog, where he was anyway. </sentence><sentence id="724">But that was the last. </sentence><sentence id="725">We learned our lesson. </sentence><sentence id="726">So I found that out later -- course I was in - - in the hospital that -- that time, and in those days you didn't tell each other those things, because you would not worry, or make a person worry, because I would not have stayed in the hospital, I would have stayed home to protect. </sentence><sentence id="727">So I found that out after the war was finished. </sentence><sentence id="728">So we -- we had lots of things to tell to each other. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="754">Q: Tell us about when your brother -- y-you basically described your brother being in hiding, but when did your parents put him in hiding? </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="758">Q: Oh. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="760">A: They -- see they don't -- or maybe they said it, but is one ear in, one ear out. </sentence><sentence id="761">But I do know that when I was on vacation, or I had reason to leave the hospital, that I and my mother went with a pot with food. </sentence><sentence id="762">Now, you cannot keep that warm, huh, but anyway he got his food, and then we exchanged news with him. </sentence><sentence id="763">I think he had a radio. </sentence><sentence id="764">I think my father provided that. </sentence><sentence id="765">And of course, you had to do it in a way that the other people on -- in that office were not aware, because you never knew of -- if there was a traitor in that office. </sentence><sentence id="766">But since my father had an high position, they had respect for him. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="774">Q: So where exactly was your brother hiding? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="776">A: In -- in that office -- </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="777">Q: In the li -- in the office? </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="778">A: -- in -- in the center of The Hague, Barkstrout. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="784">A: Yeah. </sentence><sentence id="785">The office -- just like in Ann Frank, Buchen had a -- an -- a fake door, with the book thing, and then you would swivel that around, and then he was hiding. </sentence><sentence id="786">But see, that was normal. </sentence><sentence id="787">In those days, your -- you had to think about something, you know, to -- to protect. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="792">Q: How old was he at that point? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="794">A: Well, he is two years younger than I am. </sentence><sentence id="795">So if in 1940, I was 20, he was 18. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="800">A: Uh-huh. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="802">Q: And you didn't ask a lot of questions. </sentence><sentence id="803">You eventually saw him, but -- but that's just how it was. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="806">A: Yeah. </sentence><sentence id="807">Because he had, of course, only the news what he -- we gave him. </sentence><sentence id="808">But since my father was listening to the BBC, and I was involved with scouting, and other things, I mean, you just -- you just had to learn what was going around you, otherwise you could not function. </sentence><sentence id="809">I mean, I was a student nurse, in a way, but in that hospital were plenty people also in the underground. </sentence><sentence id="810">Now, for instance, one day I had the TBC patients. </sentence><sentence id="811">They need fresh air, so they were in the yard. </sentence><sentence id="812">So that ward was -- was empty, and I got this guy running to me, "Hide me, hide me." </sentence><sentence id="813">A Dutch person. </sentence><sentence id="814">I says, "Go on, go on in the bed, don't move." </sentence><sentence id="815">Then the German comes right behind him. </sentence><sentence id="816">"Did you see anyone?" </sentence><sentence id="817">Again, I stood like this. </sentence><sentence id="818">I said, "Do you want to get TBC? </sentence><sentence id="819">I didn't see anyone." </sentence><sentence id="820">Go eyeball to eyeball. </sentence><sentence id="821">In German. </sentence><sentence id="822">So he understood what he had to deal with. </sentence><sentence id="823">So he -- he looked with respect all of a sudden. </sentence><sentence id="824">First he looked like ch, another woman, like most men do anyway. </sentence><sentence id="825">But I had no intention to let him in. </sentence><sentence id="826">My intention was put my foot out, and then he would stumble over it, and I would jumped on his back, and he would not be alive out that door. </sentence><sentence id="827">That was my intention. </sentence><sentence id="828">So we were pretare -- prepared. </sentence><sentence id="829">So then he -- he ran to the other end of the hall, because he couldn't get any -- and this guy said, "Is it okay?" </sentence><sentence id="830">I said, "Keep mouth shut, I will tell you." </sentence><sentence id="831">So I had to find out first if everything was okay, and then we had the cellar, and we put him in that cellar. </sentence><sentence id="832">But the point was, in that time, we did not know the director of that hospital, if he could be trusted. </sentence><sentence id="833">So everything was very risky, and you had to be very careful. </sentence><sentence id="834">But I thought, well, if he goes in that -- in that basement with other people, then th-the -- the principal should be okay. </sentence><sentence id="835">Because he could find that out, if he was the -- the good type of principal. </sentence></p></dialogue>
