anything about the Holocaust. </sentence><sentence id="1583">I don't know if they did when you went to school, but there was very little in those days. </sentence><sentence id="1584">It isn't like today. </sentence><sentence id="1585">We didn't have a Washington Holocaust Museum to tell us. </sentence><sentence id="1586">He learned about the Holocaust in Sunday school and he'd come home and ask questions. </sentence><sentence id="1587">And I couldn't answer them. </sentence><sentence id="1588">I pretended that it didn't happen to me, but I didn't say this to him, I just said, "I don't want

was not a subject that was brought up. </sentence><sentence id="1597">When our son went to high school, he would come home and ask questions and I would give very little information. </sentence><sentence id="1598">I couldn't. </sentence><sentence id="1599">When he got married and our first grandson was born, he needed to know more. </sentence><sentence id="1600">For his own sake,

lied about taking parts in concentration camps and came to this country and they were finding some of them. </sentence><sentence id="1602">And those were the days when there was a janitor that lived in Hyde Park, I believe, I'm not quite sure where, and they found out that he was a Nazi in one of the concentration camps and they wanted to prosecute him and all his neighbors stood up and said, "Well, how can you do this? </sentence><sentence id="1603">He's such a good man, he's such a good neighbor, he's such a good janitor." </sentence><sentence id="1604">The fact that he committed murder

in through the Holocaust foundation in Skokie, about asking for survivors to come forth and have their stories recorded. </sentence><sentence id="1617">And yes, I saw it many times. </sentence><sentence id="1618">But those were still the days when I did not speak out. </sentence><sentence id="1619">So all this was beginning to come to a head. </sentence><sentence id="1620">My son needed to know. </sentence><sentence id="1621">The janitor needed -- the people needed to know what happened in concentration camps. </sentence><sentence id="1622">And I started to think about this and I said, "Maybe some of us do need to speak out. </sentence><sentence id="1623">Maybe it's going to hurt, but maybe we can set the world straight." </sentence><sentence id="1624">And when my son
