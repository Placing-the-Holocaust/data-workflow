<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="41">Q: Well, I was thinking sort of when the Russians picked you up. </sentence><sentence id="42">But if you want, you -- wherever you would -- wherever you would like to start from, actually, would be fine. </sentence></p></dialogue>

</sentence><sentence id="48">After we were liberated, we were put into a holding camp, which was a " Although the policy of the USHMM is never to edit or alter oral history interviews in any way, the

us and try and sort of organize. </sentence><sentence id="57">I mean, we were a -- a -- a very displaced group, a very sick group at that point. </sentence><sentence id="58">And once they took our names and asked us if we had a home to go to, or whatever -- some of us chose to go back to our original homes and some of us stayed behind and stayed in the DP camps for a long time. </sentence><sentence id="59">I was in a DP camp for quite awhile and then I chose to go back home to my hometown, hoping that possibly my brothers or someone that had survived, had come back home and that we could reunite. </sentence><sentence id="60">But I truly was mistaken, because no one came back. </sentence><sentence id="61">One aunt, who survived Auschwitz concentration camp, went to Budapest rather than coming to our hometown in Czechoslovakia, thinking that I hadn't survived, although sh -- she did see me in Auschwitz camp, so she knew I was there. </sentence><sentence id="62">But she thought that I, too had gone to the gas chambers, as millions of others had. </sentence><sentence id="63">And when she heard that I had survived, she too came back home. </sentence><sentence id="64">So actually it was just the two of us. </sentence><sentence id="65">We came back home and found our home -- my mother's home that we lived in, destroyed. </sentence><sentence id="66">Our home was used for a lookout post. </sentence><sentence id="67">It was like on a little hill and the soldiers had used that and it was destroyed. </sentence><sentence id="68">My grandmother's home -- which was my aunt's home who came back, stood. </sentence><sentence id="69">The home was totally stripped of everything inside. </sentence><sentence id="70">There were nothing but walls and windows left. </sentence><sentence id="71">And w-we moved into this home. </sentence><sentence id="72">Actually, I was the very first one to come home in our community and I was the first one to move into my grandmother's home. </sentence><sentence id="73">And I would go and meet a train that passed through our little town once a day, hoping that someone survived and people would come back. </sentence><sentence id="74">And little by little, some young  USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0020 5 people did trickle back. </sentence><sentence id="75">And -- including my aunt and we all lived in my grandmother's home. </sentence><sentence id="76">When we came back we had no money, we had no food and we just had the clothes on our backs. </sentence><sentence id="77">Our neighbors had stripped our homes, our furniture was used by neighbors. </sentence><sentence id="78">We recognized some of our clothes that was worn by some of our neighbors. </sentence><sentence id="79">But no one came, no one offered and no one asked. </sentence><sentence id="80">What we had to do was go and dig for potatoes in the field. </sentence><sentence id="81">Gather some potatoes and whatever we could from the harvest. </sentence><sentence id="82">And this is what we lived on for quite awhile. </sentence><sentence id="83">And I knew my father was in the United States, but I did not know where. </sentence><sentence id="84">And I could have never found him, except that he found me. </sentence><sentence id="85">My dad had -- after the war, my dad had contacted some of the neighbors that he remembered and he wrote to the Post Office in our town, looking for his family, looking for survivors. </sentence><sentence id="86">And I had gotten a letter through the Post Office, from my dad and gotten his address and was able to get in touch with him. </sentence><sentence id="87">And he was able to send me American dollars through the letters that came. </sentence><sentence id="88">A five dollar bill, a 10 dollar bill -- which we were selling on the Black Market. </sentence><sentence id="89">At that time an American money, we were getting a lot for it, because the money in Europe was really devalued at that particular time, so we were able to buy food after awhile. </sentence><sentence id="90">We were also getting clothes through -- I believe it's the United Restitutio -- I don -- I don't know, it was called Unrah. </sentence><sentence id="91">I don't know what it stands for, actually. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="140">Q: Right. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="142">A: And we were getting clothes from them and I remember getting packages and opening the packages and getting clothes that was actually used already and getting shoes that    USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0020 6 didn't fit and looking for the candy that was inside and we were getting gum. </sentence><sentence id="143">And we would open the package of gum and didn't know that we were supposed to chew this gum and chew it, you know, we just ate it like candy, thinking, "Gee, this is kind of funny candy," you know? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="147">Q: You'd never seen gum before? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="149">A: [had never seen gum before. </sentence><sentence id="150">And we stayed in my grandmother's home until some of the organiza -- some of the young people were able to get it -- in touch with some of the organizations and some of them were getting help in other ways. </sentence><sentence id="151">And I was able to get in touch with my dad. </sentence><sentence id="152">And then the borders closed. </sentence><sentence id="153">And I had gotten caught on the side of Communism. </sentence><sentence id="154">Both my aunt and I had gotten caught on the side of Communism and we were not able to leave. </sentence><sentence id="155">And I was not able to come to this country at that point, or get in touch with my dad any longer. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="163">Q: Can I s-stop you here one second? </sentence><sentence id="164">You said the borders closed, do you remember what year that was? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="167">A: No, I don't. </sentence><sentence id="168">Actually, I don't remember the year -- the exact year. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="171">Q: Why don't we leave your story where it is at the moment, the borders have closed. </sentence><sentence id="172">I -- if you wouldn't mind, I'd like to go back a couple steps and ask you about a -- a couple things you've -- you've mentioned already. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="175">A: Okay. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="177">Q: And bring out a little more detail. </sentence><sentence id="178">First of all, could you just tell us th-this aunt that your -- you've mentioned, could you tell us her name? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="181"> USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0020 7 </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="182">A: Yes. </sentence><sentence id="183">She was my dad's sister and she's the only one that survived on my dad's side, actually, and her name was Freida Weiss. </sentence><sentence id="184">And eventually, she was also able to make her way to this country. </sentence><sentence id="185">My aunt had my dad, who was a brother and she had two other brothers living in this country and through them she was able to make her way to this country. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="190">Q: And in your video interview, you talk about her and she was in the camp with you and you tell that story. </sentence><sentence id="191">I'd like to go back to -- oh, sorry -- </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="192">A: No, the -- my aunt that I speak of in the video was my mother's sister. </sentence><sentence id="193">The aunt that I'm speaking of now was my father's sister. </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="194">Q: Oh. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="196">A: The aunt that I spoke of in the video had not survived the camps. </sentence><sentence id="197">We were separated in the camp and she was taken to another camp and I had found out years later, through someone that knew her and was in a camp with her, that she lived to see liberation. </sentence><sentence id="198">The day she -- the day her camp was liberated, she was still alive and died that day, the day the camp was liberated. </sentence><sentence id="199">But, I think of her often, because she was my inspiration all through the camp. </sentence><sentence id="200">She was the one that kept telling me every single day, "We will make it and tomorrow will be better." </sentence><sentence id="201">I made it, she did not. </sentence><sentence id="202">But I couldn't have done it without her. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="210">Q: What was her name? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="212">A: Her name was Bella Davidovitch. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="214">Q: And which camp did she -- </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="216"> USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0020 8 </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="217">A: She -- we were separated. </sentence><sentence id="218">We were in Auschwitz together and then we were separated. </sentence><sentence id="219">I was taken to -- actually, what happened was that our -- our barracks was emptied and we were put into a holding barrack and our barrack was to go into the gas chambers and we knew it. </sentence><sentence id="220">My -- they had a separation, my aunt was chosen to go onto a truck to be taken somewhere's else and the last she saw of me was walking towards the gas chambers. </sentence><sentence id="221">And when she left me, she did not think that I had survived, she thought that we had all gone to the gas chambers, her entire family and she really did not fight for her life at that point. </sentence><sentence id="222">So, possibly, if she had known some of us had survived, she maybe too, could have survived. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="229">Q: And you -- what you tell in your video, it's a remarkable story, you actually were in the doorway, I believe, of the gas chamber? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="231">A: They -- people that were in Auschwitz, after they were in the camp for, I believe, probably an hour, they knew about the gas chambers. </sentence><sentence id="232">You know, one separation had taken place and once we were taken into the barracks and once we started to ask about our families, what had happened to our families, the people that had been in the barracks prior to us coming there, the prisoners, would point to the gas chambers. </sentence><sentence id="233">This is how we found out what had happened to millions of others, to the children that we were separated from, to our parents, to the rest of our family, by just -- they would just raise their hand and they would tell us to look at the smoke. </sentence><sentence id="234">And of course, this is how we found out about the gas chambers. </sentence><sentence id="235">We lived with it day in and day out we lived with the gas chambers. </sentence><sentence id="236">We watched the trains coming in, we watched the separations, we watched  ontectnetbnancedjusietneey for tarher biormatberabouttfisestecion USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0020 9 people marching to the gas chambers, but there was no way we could help them or do anything. </sentence><sentence id="237">So, we learned -- we learned every single day, twice a day, there was a thing called a pell, where we all had to line up to be counted. </sentence><sentence id="238">When they called a pell in the morning and at night, nobody wanted to be in the beginning of the line, or at the end of the line, cause there was always punishment. </sentence><sentence id="239">People were always pulled from the beginning of the line or the end of the line. </sentence><sentence id="240">Sometimes from the center, but basically, it was easier to pull from the beginning or the end. </sentence><sentence id="241">So everybody fought to be in the center of the lines and there were only so many middles, somebody had to be in the beginning. </sentence><sentence id="242">Because my aunt was on this particular truck, leaving, I had -- was hoping I could go with her and so I was at the very end of the line and she watched all of us marching into the gas chambers. </sentence><sentence id="243">And in the very last moment, six of us were pulled out and put onto another truck to do s -- go to a factory to do slave labor. </sentence><sentence id="244">But her truck had pulled away already and she did not see me not walking into the gas chamber, so she assumed that I too had gone into the gas chambers with the rest. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="261">Q: Yeah. </sentence><sentence id="262">And do you know if she ever knew whether you had survived? </sentence><sentence id="263">Did word ever reach her somehow? </sentence><sentence id="264">Do you have any way of knowing? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="269">A: [have no way of knowing, but I believe she did not know, because the people that were with her, that told us that they knew her and she had died, remember her speaking about everyone being killed one way or another or going to the gas chamber. </sentence><sentence id="270">So I -- lam assuming she did not know. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="273">Q: And do you know the day she died, which was the day when her camp was liberated? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="275">   USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0020 10 </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="276">A: I don't know the dates. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="278">Q: Yeah, no, no, not the date, but it was the day the camp was liberated that she died. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="280">Was that because of just, you know, illness or that she was in a run down condition, or -- </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="281">A: She was ill. </sentence><sentence id="282">She had gotten an infection in an -- in a leg -- is -- from what we had heard, and blood poisoning had set in her leg and at that point she really didn't care. </sentence><sentence id="283">She - - you know, when -- when we were in the camps, there -- there came a point, during a low moment maybe or when hope was lost, where people didn't care whether they lived or died, especially if they knew no one else survived, they just didn't care. </sentence><sentence id="284">And at that point, I believe that she didn't care. </sentence><sentence id="285">I don't know how else to express this, except that I -- I believe that she felt she was the last one of the family and -- and she too gave up. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="291">Q: Sorry to bring this up, but something just came on, is that the air conditioning, or -- </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="292">A: Maybe. </sentence><sentence id="293">I don't know. </sentence><sentence id="294">Could be the refrigerator. </sentence><sentence id="295">I don't know how to shut it. </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="296">Q: Oh. </sentence><sentence id="297">You never turn that off, huh? </sentence><sentence id="298">Okay. </sentence><sentence id="299">Occasional noises you might hear in the background, they're household appliances that can't be shut off. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="304">A: Well, it must be the air conditioner. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="306">Q: Okay. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="308">A: I don't know. </sentence><sentence id="309">But it's hot in here and we need the air conditioner, guys. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="312">Q: Okay. </sentence><sentence id="313">All right, we'll just go -- we'll go along with that. </sentence><sentence id="314">So -- do you -- you were -- do you remember -- did you even have time much, to have much of a reaction when they suddenly pulled you away from the gas chamber and sent you in another direction? </sentence><sentence id="315">Can you remember what you felt or was it just so hectic that --    </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="320"> USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0020 11 </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="321">A: Do you know, things were happening in the camp where one didn't have the normal feelings. </sentence><sentence id="322">We were, for the lack of a better word, dehumanized, maybe? </sentence><sentence id="323">We learned to accept life as it was on that particular moment and when you are with people in a barrack for a le -- any length of time and you see them marching into a gas chamber, you don't think, "Well gee, I am the lucky one, I walked away." </sentence><sentence id="324">Maybe I'm not the lucky one, maybe they are the lucky ones, because I don't know where they're going to be taking me and it might be worse than where I am now. </sentence><sentence id="325">So, the reaction was a -- was not, "Gee, I'm really glad because I'm still alive." </sentence><sentence id="326">It just -- you accept it as it comes, that particular moment. </sentence><sentence id="327">The fear is always there, that you don't know where you're being taken, that you're going to get less food than you had that particular moment. </sentence><sentence id="328">That you might be -- feel hunger more than you do that particular moment, because you're already hungry, you're already abused, you're already skinny, you're already sick. </sentence><sentence id="329">And the moment comes when you just say, "Okay, this is another thing that's happening to me today." </sentence><sentence id="330">And so you just flow with it. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="341">Q: Did you know w -- that -- where -- while you were still in the camp, did you know where your aunt was or where she'd been taken, or did you not find out what happened to her until the war was over? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="343">A: I did not know where she was being taken to. </sentence><sentence id="344">As far as I was concerned, she could have been taken to another camp and put to death in a -- in a gas chamber in another camp. </sentence><sentence id="345">I didn't know what she did or -- or even if she was alive, until after the war. </sentence><sentence id="346">Actually, we found out -- you know, it's -- it's a big world, but it's a small world. </sentence><sentence id="347">You  ontectnetbnancedjusietneey for tarher biormatberabouttfisestecion USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0020 12 know, you talk to people and one will say, "Well, I was in this camp," or "I was in that camp." </sentence><sentence id="348">And when you give a family name or when you start asking, people remember and people know and you get a little information. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="357">Q: Mm-hm. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="359">A: And this is how I found out. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="361">Q: In your video, you describe it, maybe just very briefly here you could say, you -- you did get out of the camp and then you got into the forest, basically, towards the end of the war. </sentence><sentence id="362">Where -- where'd you -- can you tell us the name of the forest, where it was? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="365">A: No. </sentence><sentence id="366">We were -- what -- what they did is, I don't know if you saw any other videos, but -- but -- or if you've read anything about the Holocaust, but towards the end of the war, when Hitler started to lose the war, he started -- I use the word he because of Hitler, but basically it's -- he didn't do it alone, obviously, he had his machinery that worked for him, all the people that ran the camps and gathered the Jews and drove the Jews to the death camps and drove the trains and so forth. </sentence><sentence id="367">I -- I will refer to them as his mach- machinery, because this is what it was. </sentence><sentence id="368">They -- the Germans started to empty the factories where slave labor -- labor was being done. </sentence><sentence id="369">They started to bring the people in from all over, wherever they did slave labor and they brought them together with the people in concentration camps and they created a group at that point, a huge, huge group. </sentence><sentence id="370">Men and women together at that point. </sentence><sentence id="371">And it is known today as a Death March. </sentence><sentence id="372">It was -- they brought us all together, we were in rags. </sentence><sentence id="373">I recall that I had -- my -- my shoes didn't fit, my clogs. </sentence><sentence id="374">I could hardly walk in them because I had outgrown them, obviously. </sentence><sentence id="375">And it </sentence></p><p><sentence id="376"> USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0020 13 was very cold and I -- I recall taking rags and wrapping rags around my feet as I was walking. </sentence><sentence id="377">And they really walked us in circles, at least it seemed to us as if we were walking in circles. </sentence><sentence id="378">They walked us through the towns, they walked us through fields. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="379">They -- we slept in -- around haystacks. </sentence><sentence id="380">I mean they -- then -- and whatever. </sentence><sentence id="381">Most of us were very sick, some people had gotten dysentery and they had to stop, of course and they were being shot on the spot. </sentence><sentence id="382">They would walk us into -- through forest areas and I recall at one point sleeping on the fields and just watching the planes -- the planes, I mean, American planes coming down low, passing us and we were hoping that they would bomb us. </sentence><sentence id="383">We were sick, we were tired, we were hungry, we were thirsty and we didn't care. </sentence><sentence id="384">At one point they started to walk us through a forest. </sentence><sentence id="385">We were on the road actually, but -- but the road was through the forests. </sentence><sentence id="386">And a friend and I realized that some of the people were trying to escape at that point. </sentence><sentence id="387">And it was also towards the very end of the war and the Germans were also tired, taking us through the fields, you know, and all of this. </sentence><sentence id="388">And when -- we were watching people escape and they were shooting at these people and -- and they were -- they were being horrible to us, even at that point. </sentence><sentence id="389">I recall, as we were walking through towns -- they would walk us through towns -- the people in town knew and saw and heard, we were like -- like a herd of cattles taking over this town and walking through the town. </sentence><sentence id="390">I recall shades being pulled down, windows being closed, doors being locked so that they wouldn't -- they pretended they didn't see and they didn't hear. </sentence><sentence id="391">But yes, occasionally, a window would open and a piece of bread would come out, a potato would come out. </sentence><sentence id="392">Something would fly out a window. </sentence><sentence id="393">We all pounced on this
