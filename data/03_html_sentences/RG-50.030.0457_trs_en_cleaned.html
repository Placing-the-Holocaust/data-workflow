<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1977">A: I think it -- on my political inclinations, yes, I think most people are pretty democratic, and liberal, and I think it has something to do with that, of course, because you can see yourself in that same position, in relation to Blacks, or whatever, minorities. </sentence><sentence id="1978">As far as religion is concerned, well, I wasn't brought up on a religious home. </sentence><sentence id="1979">My first husband was very religious. </sentence><sentence id="1980">I was not, that was a bad combination. </sentence><sentence id="1981">And it sort of, if anything turned me against it, I found it very cumbersome, and cumbering and -- and I just have a tremendous feeling about the Holocaust, and still more as I get older, as I said earlier. </sentence><sentence id="1982">I still do. </sentence><sentence id="1983">I -- I -- 1 have more -- more and more so. </sentence><sentence id="1984">And that, somehow, is like my religion, you know. </sentence><sentence id="1985">I -- I don't really -- I'm not a religious -- I like tradition, a little bit of it, you know, with the family, and we spend the holidays together, but it means more to my children than it does to me, to be honest. </sentence></p></dialogue>
