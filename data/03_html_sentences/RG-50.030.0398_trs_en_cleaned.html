<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="37">A: Oh, yes. </sentence><sentence id="38">I was born into a family of two sisters and four brothers. </sentence><sentence id="39">Two of the brothers and one sister were half-brothers. </sentence><sentence id="40">They were children of a first husband of my mother's. </sentence><sentence id="41">My parents were originally from Lithuania, as was my mother's first husband. </sentence><sentence id="42">In fact, I still possess her Ketuba from Lithuania, and her permit to travel in the pale (ph) of Russia, and she came as immigrant as many people did at the time of the turn of the century when everybody seemed to be leaving for the United States, and she was one of those immigrants that got stuck in Britain. </sentence><sentence id="43">As you probably know, almost all of them -- particularly the Jews -- intended to come to America where the streets were supposed to  be lined with gold, but my mother got left behind, and eventually met my father who married her, and I grew up in this large family as the youngest child, and it was rather nice. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="51">Q: What was your mother's name and your dad's name? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="53">A: My mother's name was Kravitz, which is, I think, is a common name. </sentence><sentence id="54">She was married -- her first marriage was to a cousin. </sentence><sentence id="55">She was an orphan, according to what she told me -- I'm sure she spoke the truth -- and was married to a cousin, and the grandfather -- her grandfather who brought her up -- felt it was important for her, also, to leave. </sentence><sentence id="56">I think she loved Lithuania and would've liked to have stayed. </sentence><sentence id="57">You know, this story that people tell of pogroms are not always true. </sentence><sentence id="58">A lot of them left for economic reasons, just as everybody else left Europe for economic reasons. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="75">Q: And What was your father's name? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="77">A: My father was Nathan Zahl, Z-a-h-l. He had relatives in England who were on the stage, and they were in theater, and they were nice family. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="79">Q: So, what was it like growing up in this family with all these children? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="81">A: Well, they weren't children to me. </sentence><sentence id="82">They were all adults. </sentence><sentence id="83">I was a child growing up ina family of adults, and since ostensibly I was a weak child, I was always being sent away to recuperate. </sentence><sentence id="84">So, I didn't grow up close to this family, close emotionally to this family. </sentence><sentence id="85">I did to my eldest sister, who is really a half-sister, but I was very much, I think, a lone child because everybody else was older than I. The next one in the family was five years older than I. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="91">Q: And are there any particular characteristics of this family? </sentence><sentence id="92">Were you religious in the family? </sentence><sentence id="93">Not religious? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="97">A: We were not religious. </sentence><sentence id="98">My father was, I would say, a-religious. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="99"> [Technical difficulty; asked to start over preceding part] </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="100">A: Oh, I'm sorry. </sentence><sentence id="101">From where? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="104">Q: Well, tell me about your family and in terms of are you a religious family? </sentence><sentence id="105">Were you not a religious family? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="108">A: We were not a religious family in the sense we didn't attend synagogue. </sentence><sentence id="109">My father did take me to the synagogue on all the holidays. </sentence><sentence id="110">He explained to me what was going on, but he was not a religious man. </sentence><sentence id="111">The nice thing I remember about being Jewish, I suppose, was the wonderful Friday evenings when we all gathered together, and on the holidays when friends would also come, and for the Passover when they would invite people who didn't have family. </sentence><sentence id="112">My mother was a very generous, warm, and kind person, and she was always inviting people into the house. </sentence><sentence id="113">She was very forward-looking, I think. </sentence><sentence id="114">I hope, that I have some of her characteristics. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="122">Q: What kind of political consciousness was there? </sentence><sentence id="123">You grew up at a time when there was a lot of upheaval in western Europe. </sentence><sentence id="124">Were you very conscious of it as you grew up in the late "20s, in the early "30s in terms of what was going on in Germany? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="128">A: In the late "20s, I would say no. </sentence><sentence id="129">In England, we had, as you had, a tremendous depression, economic depression. </sentence><sentence id="130">There was a lot of employment even -- not even, but in my family, too. </sentence><sentence id="131">I began to be aware that things were happening in Germany when I was 14 or 15, a settlement house, of which I was member, began to have youngsters from Germany come to learn English, to help pass the time. </sentence><sentence id="132">They were builted (ph) locally, and I got to know some of them and felt awful that they had been sent to Britain, let's say in deg35-"36, without their parents -- to a foreign country where most of them had no relatives, and I felt very deeply about this. </sentence><sentence id="133">I think this is what affected me when eventually the British asked for volunteers to go overseas. </sentence><sentence id="134">I felt it was important that I must go. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="142">Q: Could you please explain what a settlement house is? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="144">A: A settlement house -- we had them also in the United States -- A settlement house is a community center run usually by a voluntary agency, where youngsters and older people come. </sentence><sentence id="145">They have classes, educational classes, classes for mothers, in the old days, I suppose, they had classes teaching people English. </sentence><sentence id="146">It's a real community center. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="150">Q: So, tell me what these kids told you. </sentence><sentence id="151">I mean, I know you were conscious that they were orphans -- not orphans, but they were without their parents, without their family. </sentence><sentence id="152">Did they tell you about what had happened in Germany? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="156">A: No, they didn't. </sentence><sentence id="157">They just -- they didn't talk about it. </sentence><sentence id="158">One didn't ask. </sentence><sentence id="159">Firstly, being British, you're rather reticent, anyway, but one had a sense that these kids were alone, terribly alone. </sentence><sentence id="160">There was no family. </sentence><sentence id="161">There were no cousins. </sentence><sentence id="162">Occasionally, one would have an aunt in the country, and that would be rather nice because she had family to  relate to, but in the 30s, many German parents -- rather, not many, but a number of German parents who could afford it were sending their children to school in England because German law prohibited them from attending school. </sentence><sentence id="163">Very early on in, I think, 1933, the first law came in which limited the number of Jewish children who could attend school. </sentence><sentence id="164">And so, a number of them came to England to school, and they were taken in by families. </sentence><sentence id="165">There was an organization called B'nai B'rith, which still exists, and they helped a lot of these children, particularly the Orthodox Jewish children. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="176">Q: So, at what point do you think -- was it after the war, or in 1939 that you became very conscious of what was happening? </sentence><sentence id="177">What drew you in 1943 to join the relief effort? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="180">A: Well, firstly the war came in "39. </sentence><sentence id="181">I remember we had the bombing in London, and 90 days of bombing constantly is not very pleasant. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="184">Q: What was that like? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="186">A: That was pretty awful. </sentence><sentence id="187">Very often, I would be scared and I'd sit under a table, or I would like people to think that I was brave and so I took tea to the shelters wearing my tin hat until I was going out one day with a young friend, and a piece of shrapnel went through his tin hat, and he was no longer. </sentence><sentence id="188">It was frightening and yet, you didn't like to appear a coward. </sentence><sentence id="189">We did things that we would never do. </sentence><sentence id="190">We went into the streets and put out incendiary bombs because, since the government, I suppose, wanted to know how many incendiaries had been dropped, they would pay us a half a crown which was about half a dollar in those days, to bring in the ends of incendiary bombs. </sentence><sentence id="191">So, we'd go out and we'd pick these things up once the bomb had gone off. </sentence><sentence id="192">And, yet, we used to sit on the doorstep occasionally in an air raid, and say, "What will we tell our children of the war?" </sentence><sentence id="193">And, you know, we were eating peanuts and we'd say, "Well, we'll tell them that we sat on the doorstep eating peanuts." </sentence><sentence id="194">But, it was an interesting period because we never saw a fruit. </sentence><sentence id="195">If anybody brought in an orange, if an American soldier gave somebody an orange or a banana, we raffled it to the Red Cross. </sentence><sentence id="196">We didn't go hungry. </sentence><sentence id="197">We were never short of the most awful bread you can ever imagine, and the American powdered egg, which we even thought made good cakes, you know, we had forgotten what a good cake tasted like. </sentence><sentence id="198">But, as I say, we were never hungry, and interestingly, we always knew we were going to win the war. </sentence><sentence id="199">Don't ask me why, perhaps this was a moral booster, perhaps this was Churchill's speeches, but we never thought the Germans would overrun us. </sentence><sentence id="200">Of course, we always suspected that we would be invaded, and this influenced, of course, the British attitude toward the refugees. </sentence><sentence id="201">We suspected everybody with a German accent of being a spy. </sentence><sentence id="202">It was a very difficult period for them, much more so than for us. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="220">Q: So, then, 90 days of bombing straight? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="222">A: Ninety days of bombing on London. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="224">Q: Was your house ever hit? </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="225">A: Oh, yeah. </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="226">Q: It was? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="228">A: Yeah, but my mother was okay, you know, the heck with the house. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="230">Q: So, where did you go? </sentence><sentence id="231">Did you stay in the house? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="234">A: I met recently a woman, she called me as a result of my book. </sentence><sentence id="235">She called me and she said, "Do you remember, after the air raids when you'd done all your rounds, you used to come into our house and sleep on a bed or a mat or anywhere?" </sentence><sentence id="236">No, I went to stay with friends, and after the house was hit, we got my mother to leave London and go into the country. </sentence><sentence id="237">I wouldn't go. </sentence><sentence id="238">I felt safest in London, believe it or not. </sentence><sentence id="239">I couldn't bear the thought of being outside of London and seeing the bombs falling, because you could see the fires. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="246">Q: And your mother was okay with your staying? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="248">A: My mother was okay. </sentence><sentence id="249">We were all okay. </sentence><sentence id="250">It's very interesting. </sentence><sentence id="251">There was no counseling in those days, and I sometimes wonder if we have too much counseling when a child goes through a small trauma, true, a trauma, but in the old days going through this bombing, nobody came and counseled us and very often we were helping to dig bodies out of the Anderson shelters and finding people who were wounded badly, but we carried on. </sentence><sentence id="252">You know, this was life. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="258">Q: So, you were then how old, 13? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="260">A: I was -- no, I was older in 1939, I was 18, and in 1940, I was 19, but we had no prior experience of this. </sentence><sentence id="261">The most wonderful thing to happen to us was when Hitler invaded Russia because then the bombing began to let up. </sentence><sentence id="262">And it was extraordinary because we all felt so guilty that here the Russians were taking what we had been having, and in those days, Russia was our friend. </sentence><sentence id="263">The Cold War that came later seemed so -- so different, so difficult a period when we think of, we knew what the Russians were going through, that millions were being killed by the Germans, millions and millions of them. </sentence><sentence id="264">I don't think people even today realize how many millions of people were killed during that war outside of concentration camps. </sentence><sentence id="265">I mean, we talk of six million Jews dying, and that number, you can't imagine what six million is, and it was dreadful. </sentence><sentence id="266">There isn't a Jewish family, I think, worldwide, which didn't lose a relative, but in Russia, about 25 million people died. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="274">Q: After 1941, when Russia was attacked, did you learn what was going on in terms of the killing of Jews and did you know what had gone on in Germany in the "30s, rounding up  political opponents and Jehovah's Witnesses? </sentence><sentence id="275">Was there much knowledge that you had at that point? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="278">A: If we read The Press and The Times published a lot of material. </sentence><sentence id="279">We knew. </sentence><sentence id="280">I'm not saying I was very well-versed in what was happening. </sentence><sentence id="281">I knew Jews were being killed. </sentence><sentence id="282">I knew they were being put in concentration camps because sometimes a friend would have a cousin who was 15, who'd been brought out whose head was shaven, and he'd been incarcerated in a concentration camp. </sentence><sentence id="283">We knew that people were being killed. </sentence><sentence id="284">We knew that the Nazis were very nasty people, but when the killing really started, when the Final Solution started in 1942, I don't think we, as individuals, I don't remember, but I don't think I knew this. </sentence><sentence id="285">We didn't trust the Germans. </sentence><sentence id="286">We knew they'd kill every Jew they could get their fingers on. </sentence><sentence id="287">So, from that point of view, we knew we had to be very careful. </sentence><sentence id="288">For example, if you would walk along the country lane in England, or even an ordinary street, and ask somebody directions, they'd never tell you in case you were a spy. </sentence><sentence id="289">The sign posts were taken down. </sentence><sentence id="290">So, unless you knew the area in which you were visiting, there was nothing you could do. </sentence><sentence id="291">We were terribly afraid of being invaded. </sentence><sentence id="292">Ostens- you know, not ostensibly, obviously because we were 21 miles from the French coast, not very far, and not too far across the North Sea to get to England, and attempts were made to bring spies in. </sentence><sentence id="293">So, it was a very difficult period because, if you met somebody you didn't know, you didn't discuss anything that might in some way give them information. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="310">Q: Did you feel it was important when the Americans joined in the war effort? </sentence><sentence id="311">Was that a good sign for you, or did you actually feel before then, "We'll win anyway.""? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="314">A: I think before the Americans came, we thought we'd win, but when the Americans came, Hallelujah! </sentence><sentence id="315">Now, it was wonderful. </sentence><sentence id="316">It was wonderful because now we had an ally. </sentence><sentence id="317">Can you imagine, in 1940, we were alone, totally alone, and many of us were making plans to try to escape somewhere because we knew that, as Jews, we, too, would be taken by the Germans. </sentence><sentence id="318">But when the Americans, with the vast machinery for production, came into the war, somehow we really knew we might win. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="324">Q: Did you also make plans to leave? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="326">A: Oh, yes -- made plans, not really. </sentence><sentence id="327">Where could we go to? </sentence><sentence id="328">But, we dreamed of going up maybe to Sweden, finding our way up there, but what would do with our parents? </sentence><sentence id="329">We're a group of kids talking. </sentence><sentence id="330">You don't leave parents behind. </sentence><sentence id="331">But we thought we might find roots. </sentence><sentence id="332">We daydreamed. </sentence><sentence id="333">We daydreamed, but we really knew that if the Germans came to England, our lot was sealed. </sentence><sentence id="334">It was quite frightening. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="344">Q: So, what did you do after 1941? </sentence><sentence id="345">What happened between 1941 and "43, before you joined? </sentence><sentence id="346">What sort of a track? </sentence><sentence id="347">Had you gone to school? </sentence><sentence id="348">Had you finished high school? </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="349">A: Yes, I was taking a course in social administration, and when I finished that course, I went up to Birmingham during the course, actually to work at a settlement house in Birmingham, and then I went up to one in Nottingham where conditions were very different from London. </sentence><sentence id="350">And it was there that I heard that the British government, being the British government that it is, it always works closely with voluntary agencies, was asking for volunteers who would go overseas to any country to which they were sent with no prejudice, to help to save survivors both Jews and non-Jews, and I thought that was a marvelous idea, but I was terrified of getting on a ship because ships could be sunk. </sentence><sentence id="351">You know, we were losing so many ships during that war, but many people older than I were volunteering, and, what the heck? </sentence><sentence id="352">I must say, at that time I talked to my mother because I was her baby, and I told her what was happening and that it would be wonderful if we would find Jews who survived because even in the "30s, as young as I was, I had some daydream that I could go to Germany and rescue Jews. </sentence><sentence id="353">At least help them to get their jewelry out so they could have some money when they came to England. </sentence><sentence id="354">My mother said, "They would never let you out." </sentence><sentence id="355">Or, "They'd never let you in. </sentence><sentence id="356">You're Jewish." </sentence><sentence id="357">I said, "But, Mother, they would never know." </sentence><sentence id="358">Of course, nobody would take me at age 16, but when this call came, I did volunteer. </sentence><sentence id="359">There were some people I respected who had volunteered, and the nice thing was I was chosen to go originally to Casablanca with a man called Friedman | think his name was. </sentence><sentence id="360">He was from Manchester. </sentence><sentence id="361">An American went as well. </sentence><sentence id="362">We were going to take care of Jews in a camp, but the French at that time were having trouble in Lebanon, so I learned, and so the British wouldn't allow any women out of the country. </sentence><sentence id="363">So, Morris Friedman went for Britain, and I waited for the next unit. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="379">He went alone, and the next unit -- each unit was ten persons. </sentence><sentence id="380">The first British-Jewish unit was seven Jews and three Quakers, and there were units of the Red Cross, of the St.John's Ambulance Brigade, and all of the voluntary agencies that you know so well today. </sentence><sentence id="381">I think hundreds of people volunteered, and when I say volunteered, by the way, we volunteered to go without salary, just to go wherever the government sent us to help survivors. </sentence><sentence id="382">And I knew we were going somewhere where it was warm because we were issued with a summer kit. </sentence><sentence id="383">I couldn't tell my mother where I was going. </sentence><sentence id="384">My father, by the way, died when I was 14. </sentence><sentence id="385">So, I-- my father wasn't there to tell. </sentence><sentence id="386">But I knew we must be going somewhere where it was warm, but where? </sentence><sentence id="387">You know, one had no idea, and I must say, I lied to my mother. </sentence><sentence id="388">I said I was going to a camp in Scotland for about a month, and when we came out of the camp, I would call her. </sentence><sentence id="389">And, of course, on February the 19") 1944, we got aboard a ship and sailed, and about a month later in convoy, landed in Egypt in Port Said. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="402">Q: Can we go back for a moment? </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="495">Q: How did you use the stones for writing? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="497">A: Oh, you formed letters with them. </sentence><sentence id="498">Later on, we were able to get some paper, and the ladies from Alexandria actually were very good. </sentence><sentence id="499">When we told them what we needed, they began to send paper and pencils in, and what we did, we sent some people from our  camp over to the larger camp of refugees, where they were trained to be teachers. </sentence><sentence id="500">They were trained in one month to be schoolteachers and came back. </sentence><sentence id="501">They did a remarkable job. </sentence><sentence id="502">There was a war on, and everything was possible during the war. </sentence><sentence id="503">I think also because most -- well, I think almost all of us in Britain had suffered the bombing and suffered the war. </sentence><sentence id="504">We could compromise, we could change things around, we learned very quickly to put up tents, we were sleeping four of us in a tent. </sentence><sentence id="505">I remember the dreadful latrines, which were seemed to me a mile long, and with hession, a sort of canvas in between, and you lived like this. </sentence><sentence id="506">We ate fairly well. </sentence><sentence id="507">I was never sick. </sentence><sentence id="508">Some people got dysentery. </sentence><sentence id="509">I didn't. </sentence><sentence id="510">Everything we ate on our own, which we weren't sure of, we put potassium tablets in the water to disinfect any nasty creatures, and we lived that way until October of 44. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="525">Q: I know you're going to move the next site, but let me ask you, when you saw these folks from Yugoslavia, what was your first impression? </sentence><sentence id="526">Were they telling the stories of what had happened? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="529">A: They didn't have to tell stories. </sentence><sentence id="530">You looked at them. </sentence><sentence id="531">You looked at the babies with big stomachs and big heads, and some women were breastfeeding children of two and children of four. </sentence><sentence id="532">She was feeding two babies, because they had had no real food for so long. </sentence><sentence id="533">In our units, by the way, there were many doctors who volunteered, women, and they immediately set up a hospital, but we got a measles epidemic, and in eight weeks, I think, we buried -- no, six weeks, we buried over a hundred children, and that was dreadful because we lived within the hospital compound, and they crying of these women was absolutely dreadful, dreadful. </sentence><sentence id="534">To lose a child, no parent should bury a child. </sentence><sentence id="535">It was awful for them. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="551">Q: So, did you consider yourself now a seasoned relief worker at the end of the ten months? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="553">A: I never even thought of it that way. </sentence><sentence id="554">We had a job to do. </sentence><sentence id="555">We did our job. </sentence><sentence id="556">The Yugoslavs, as they got well, entertained us. </sentence><sentence id="557">They had beautiful singing voices, and they would sing in four, five parts. </sentence><sentence id="558">There were some others who were musicians, and they were very nice people, very nice. </sentence><sentence id="559">They were very clean people. </sentence><sentence id="560">A lot of them, I would say for the most part, were peasant people, but, you know, they were human beings. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="569">Q: And so then, why did you -- why were you sent away from that situation to another situation? </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="570">A: Oh, because southern Italy was liberated, and the allies were getting ready for the </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="572"> liberation of Yugoslavia, which we had been trained to enter. </sentence><sentence id="573">Trained in the sense that we learned the language, we knew where we were going, we knew the kinds of jobs we would do, and because of the work we had done in Egypt, we were trained to take care of Yugoslavs who had gone through hell in this war. </sentence><sentence id="574">When we got to Italy, I happened to have been in the first unit of ten people who were sent over to Italy in preparation for going into Yugoslavia, and Teeter was approached by the British American armies. </sentence><sentence id="575">I'm not quite sure of the chain of command. </sentence><sentence id="576">He said, "We'll do the job ourselves. </sentence><sentence id="577">Send us the goods." </sentence><sentence id="578">And they did. </sentence><sentence id="579">They did a very good job. </sentence><sentence id="580">So, here we were, the rest of the unit had come into Italy, we were sitting there. </sentence><sentence id="581">The Italians were very pleased to see us. </sentence><sentence id="582">The Italians were very nice actually. </sentence><sentence id="583">They were living under appalling conditions, having suffered German occupation and British occupation, and they would have liked us to have stayed, but we really had no job to do in Italy. </sentence><sentence id="584">And then we heard one organization working in southern Italy called the American Jewish Joint Distribution Committee. </sentence><sentence id="585">They had, I think it was one representative at the time, a man called Reuben Resnick, working there, and we thought it would be an excellent idea if we could be seconded or loaned to this outfit so that we could help them. </sentence><sentence id="586">We had been given by the army, as had all the units, a three hundred weight truck, and a three ton truck. </sentence><sentence id="587">We all learned to drive that Dodge which was double the clutch. </sentence><sentence id="588">It was terrifying, but we could all drive them, and we had lots of supplies. </sentence><sentence id="589">And so in talking to the army, and the heads of the units did so, we asked if we could join the American organization and they said, "Certainly, and take all your supplies with you." </sentence><sentence id="590">It was a lot of give and take in those days. </sentence><sentence id="591">They're much more difficult today. </sentence><sentence id="592">I don't know why. </sentence><sentence id="593">And so we loaned ourselves to the Joint. </sentence><sentence id="594">We went up to Rome to start with. </sentence><sentence id="595">Florence was still occupied, I remember, because as it was liberated, some of our boys took matzohs up to Florence for the first Passover of the liberation. </sentence><sentence id="596">I was helping to get ready the first legal transport going to Palestine after the war. </sentence><sentence id="597">I think it left on April the 12", if my memory serves me, and I remember Moshe Shertock - I think, yes, that was his name -- went with us, and I and somebody from the Joint, Israel, or Gaynor Israel Jacobson, worked on that transport and got that going, and it was very interesting because there were "X" number of certificates. </sentence><sentence id="598">People still had to have certificates from the British government to enter Palestine, and let's assume that we had 300, and they were all numbered. </sentence><sentence id="599">As people got on, the cards of those in front were taken and given to others at the back. </sentence><sentence id="600">So, although 300 were supposed to be on the ship, probably there were 400 or 500. </sentence><sentence id="601">I never did know how many got on, and that ship went off. </sentence><sentence id="602">That was one of the things we did. </sentence><sentence id="603">We also, which were helping people who would come in from Yugoslavia in small boats. </sentence><sentence id="604">I remember, the women would come in with hand grenades around their waists, great big burly women, very nice, but terrifying. </sentence><sentence id="605">And we met a lot of people, and then, of course, the Germans were still trying to bomb us, and I know, I remember very distinctly, when the Germans came over, of course, the Americans -- the American civilians who hadn't seen any of this stuff, any of the bombing, would rush to the windows, and we Britishers would rush under the beds because we knew what shattered glass could do. </sentence><sentence id="606">It was an interesting time. </sentence><sentence id="607">When -- yes, it was an interesting time, and as Italy began to be liberated, some of our people were going up north. </sentence><sentence id="608">When Greece was liberated, I was asked by the European director of the Joint  Distribution Committee, a very wonderful man called Dr. Joseph Schwartz. </sentence><sentence id="609">He was a rabbi by training, and really a very, very wonderful human being, one of my heroes. </sentence><sentence id="610">He asked me if, when Greece was liberated, I would go into Greece with their director, and of course, who would refuse? </sentence><sentence id="611">And, I was in Greece -- well, the war was still on -- when the camps were liberated, and people, I think, don't realize that so many thousands of people had been incarcerated in concentration camps and labor camps, and the army had no place for them once they were liberated, and the only thing they thought of doing was sending these people home. </sentence><sentence id="612">So, being in Greece at the time of the end of the war, suddenly the trains began to come in with these young men and women, many of them spitting blood from tuberculosis, no families. </sentence><sentence id="613">Out of a total, I think, of 70,000 Jews in Greece, there were about a total of 10,000 who survived all together, both in hiding and among those who came back, and I remember some of them having to sleep in the street. </sentence><sentence id="614">It was summer. </sentence><sentence id="615">It was June when they got back. </sentence><sentence id="616">They had to sleep in the street because there were no sanitarium -- no sanitarium beds for them, and it was very, very difficult because none of them family. </sentence><sentence id="617">There were girls with no sisters or brothers. </sentence><sentence id="618">There were boys with no family. </sentence><sentence id="619">Occasionally, you'd see an adult who son or daughters had been killed, and this organization, the American Jewish Joint Distribution Committee, set up a hostel in Athens with a very wonderful local Greek lady called Mrs. Mossieri. </sentence><sentence id="620">I'm sure her children are still alive. </sentence><sentence id="621">She was a go-getter, and she helped to set up this hostel. </sentence><sentence id="622">I went with Israel Jacobson to Palestine at that time to meet with Golda Meir and Mr.Sheretz Shatok (ph), and I can't think of the other gentleman's name at the moment, to talk to them about supplies that we would need and also people were beginning to go through Athens to Palestine illegally. </sentence><sentence id="623">It was very easy. </sentence><sentence id="624">Perez was next to Athens. </sentence><sentence id="625">They sent in some of their units of workers. </sentence><sentence id="626">There were people, ostensibly press agents. </sentence><sentence id="627">All the marvelous people, and one of the things that we asked at that time was that you slow down the movement because the British would come to what was known as a Hachshara, a camp, at Perez, and count the individuals there. </sentence><sentence id="628">And I remember the one day they came and they said, "Where is everybody?" </sentence><sentence id="629">And we said, "They've gone home." </sentence><sentence id="630">That was nice. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="691">Q: So, who were you working for then? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="693">A: I was working as a volunteer with the American Jewish Joint Distribution Committee. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="695">Q: So, you had left the British. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="697">A: Yes, we all split up. </sentence><sentence id="698">That whole unit of ten persons was split up. </sentence><sentence id="699">Some people went into Austria. </sentence><sentence id="700">Most of them stayed in Italy. </sentence><sentence id="701">There was a lot of work to do in Italy because people were coming into Italy to try and go either to Palestine or to register with a consulate, if an American consulate was open, to join family in the United States or to leave Europe -- one thing people wanted to do was to leave Europe at this time. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="707">Q: Were you considered -- I'm not going to use the word traitor, because that is obviously much too extreme, but British policy was one thing about illegal immigration. </sentence><sentence id="708">You were  now working for an American organization. </sentence><sentence id="709">Did you feel as if you were in some sense working against the policy of the Brits? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="713">A: No. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="715">Q: You didn't? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="717">A: No, I was working to help refugees, survivors. </sentence><sentence id="718">And that's all I was doing, and whenever or wherever I could do it best was all that matter to me. </sentence><sentence id="719">It never occurred to me. </sentence><sentence id="720">I don't think I'm a political animal, actually, but no, that never occurred to me, and the Americans had supplies. </sentence><sentence id="721">You see, after the war, I suppose, the Americans realized a) they might have done more before the war, and b) they had money. </sentence><sentence id="722">The British were bankrupt by now. </sentence><sentence id="723">The British had nothing. </sentence><sentence id="724">They had no foreign currency. </sentence><sentence id="725">Everything was bombed. </sentence><sentence id="726">They had no housing. </sentence><sentence id="727">I know how my family was living. </sentence><sentence id="728">No, I never felt disloyal at all. </sentence><sentence id="729">I was only working to help survivors. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="743">Q: So, what was this trip? </sentence><sentence id="744">You went to Palestine by boat from Athens. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="759">A: I don't think I had time to be scared. </sentence><sentence id="760">No, it wasn't. </sentence><sentence id="761">That's not true. </sentence><sentence id="762">It wasn't my first plane ride. </sentence><sentence id="763">In 1943, no, I beg your pardon, at the end of 1944, I was -- I received word that my mother was ill, and I managed to hitchhike on a plane to London, to Croyden Airport, and it was interesting because when I got to Croyden there was a big loud thump as a bomb, and I thought that the bombing was finished, and I said to the porter who was helping me off, I said, "What on earth is that?" " </sentence><sentence id="764">Oh," he said, "that's a doodlebug, lady." </sentence><sentence id="765">Doodlebug would be bombs which were unmanned that they were sending from Holland into Britain and they suddenly stopped and dropped. </sentence><sentence id="766">I saw my mother. </sentence><sentence id="767">She was delighted, of course, to see me. </sentence><sentence id="768">She did survive that illness, and I managed to get back on a ship that was going to Italy. </sentence><sentence id="769">And, so, I arrived back about a month later. </sentence><sentence id="770">That was my -- sorry, that was my first -- the trip to England was my first plan trip. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="783">Q: So, let me ask you something. </sentence><sentence id="784">You had told your mother that you were going to Scotland for a month to a camp, right? </sentence><sentence id="785">Well, obviously, you had been away for more than a month. </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="786">A: Oh. </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="787">Q: Had you been writing to her so she finally knew what it was? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="789">A: No, she only heard from me once I landed in Egypt. </sentence><sentence id="790">The mail was so bad, very few people had access to telephones, and they were often not working. </sentence><sentence id="791">I don't think it even worried her. </sentence><sentence id="792">My older brother, who actually was 21 years older than I, when I told him I was going to volunteer, he said, "Mother will be terribly upset." </sentence><sentence id="793">I said, "I have talked to her. </sentence><sentence id="794">She thinks it's a wonderful idea." </sentence><sentence id="795">Absolutely true. </sentence><sentence id="796">And I didn't tell him, either. </sentence><sentence id="797">I didn't tell anybody in the family because you were sworn to secrecy. </sentence><sentence id="798">The ship could be sunk. </sentence><sentence id="799">And so they only heard from me after I arrived in Egypt. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="811">Q: Before we talk a little bit more about Greece, are there any particular people, incidents, that you remember in Egypt or in Italy that really matter to you that you think might be important for people to know about? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="813">A: Initially, there weren't individuals that one would single out. </sentence><sentence id="814">Everybody who I knew was doing a tremendous job. </sentence><sentence id="815">As I say, living in tents in the desert. </sentence><sentence id="816">We didn't feel that we were suffering in any way. </sentence><sentence id="817">I guess we weren't being bombed, which was rather nice. </sentence><sentence id="818">We had a job to do. </sentence><sentence id="819">So, Egypt was okay. </sentence><sentence id="820">Occasionally, we could get into Cairo and see where normal people lived and had normal facilities. </sentence><sentence id="821">No, Egypt was okay. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="831">Q: You are referring to the loo? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="833">A: Yes, yes, which, you know, we were using trenches in the desert. </sentence><sentence id="834">When we got to Italy, conditions there, in a sense, were not as good as in Egypt because the Italians had no heating in the houses in which were builted (ph) and there were little fires in the rooms with pipes going out of the window. </sentence><sentence id="835">Fortunately, there was no carbon monoxide coming out of them. </sentence><sentence id="836">The Italians were suffering very badly. </sentence><sentence id="837">So, and we had no gripes. </sentence><sentence id="838">I mean, we were well taken care of. </sentence><sentence id="839">By now, we had winter uniforms. </sentence><sentence id="840">We were dressed, by the way, as American army officers. </sentence><sentence id="841">We had PX facilities, which, to us, were fantastic. </sentence><sentence id="842">You know, we hadn't seen some of the things we saw in the PX since before the war. </sentence><sentence id="843">We had very little money, but that didn't matter, you know. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="855">Q: Did they give you spending money? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="857">A: We had ten shillings, which at that time was, I suppose, something near two dollars. </sentence><sentence id="858">That paid for the dobe, the laundry, and whatever was left over. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="861">Q: Ten shillings per what? </sentence><sentence id="862">Per month? </sentence><sentence id="863">Per week? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="867">A: I think it was -- it must have been a week because there was lots of laundry -- yes, it was ten shillings a week, I think. </sentence><sentence id="868">It would've have had to been. </sentence><sentence id="869">Maybe it was a month. </sentence><sentence id="870">I don't  remember. </sentence><sentence id="871">Money never bothered me. </sentence><sentence id="872">There was nowhere to spend it, anyway, and when we were in the desert in Egypt, there certainly was no PX. </sentence><sentence id="873">The only time we met the PX was when we arrived in Italy because the Americans were there, and they had the PX and they were very generous. </sentence><sentence id="874">The American boys in the army were quite extraordinary. </sentence><sentence id="875">They would give away their bomber jackets when they thought we were cold. </sentence><sentence id="876">You know, they'd pass them over to us. </sentence><sentence id="877">They'd offer to buy anything they could for us in the PX, and those who had money were able to take care of themselves, and people were nice. </sentence><sentence id="878">You know, they'd buy stuff that we all could share. </sentence><sentence id="879">There were foodstuffs available in the PX which we hadn't seen in a long time. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="893">Q: Can you give us an idea of what? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="895">A: Well, there were canned nuts. </sentence><sentence id="896">I remember loving peanuts, which we hadn't seen in years and years and years. </sentence><sentence id="897">The only thing we had that was cheap was we could buy liquor at seven and sixpence, I remember, for a bottle of scotch, and it was very good, I gather, for bribing people. </sentence><sentence id="898">I didn't drink, so, you know, I lost out there, but you know, these things in a sense didn't bother one. </sentence><sentence id="899">We were fed but we were doing a job. </sentence><sentence id="900">We weren't concerned. </sentence><sentence id="901">I must be honest there. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="909">Q: So, what was the difference between the kind of food that the refugees would get that you met in Yugoslavia? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="911">A: In Italy. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="913">Q: I mean, in Italy, and what you had? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="915">A: Or in Egypt. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="917">Q: Or in Egypt. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="919">A: Well, they cooked Yugoslav food, and they cooked very well, and occasionally they would invite us to come and enjoy a meal with them because our food was cooked by the Arab cooks, and it was okay. </sentence><sentence id="920">There was nothing wrong with it, but Yugoslavs are very good cooks. </sentence><sentence id="921">It was heavier food than we were used to. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="925">Q: Who provided them with food? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="927">A: The army, and I suppose at that time it was the British army since the British were in Egypt, in control. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="929">Q: And then what happened in Italy? </sentence><sentence id="930">Who provided them? </sentence><sentence id="931">The same thing -- the army provided... </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="932">A: The army provided the food for the refugees. </sentence><sentence id="933">Camps were immediately set up. </sentence><sentence id="934">One in Santa Maria di Bari, which is down on the heel of Italy. </sentence><sentence id="935">That was a Jewish DP camp. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="940">Then, there was another one in Cine Citta in Rome, which was the movie studio in Rome. </sentence><sentence id="941">That was set up as a displaced persons camp because a lot of people were released who didn't belong in Italy. </sentence><sentence id="942">There were Romanians, Hungarians, they were all nationalities, and no house to go to, or they couldn't go because those places weren't liberated yet. </sentence><sentence id="943">So... </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="948">Q: So, there were a lot of holding actions? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="950">A: Yeah, lots of holding actions for these people, and for others, they were sent home. </sentence><sentence id="951">I don't know to what homes they were sent. </sentence><sentence id="952">I'm talking not only of Jews at this point. </sentence><sentence id="953">A lot of the Russians were sent back, as you probably know, and I don't think a lot of them lasted. </sentence><sentence id="954">A lot of them had been volunteer workers with the Germans. </sentence><sentence id="955">Some of them were slave laborers. </sentence><sentence id="956">It was a very, very difficult stage for the army because, for the most part, they were still flushing out the Nazis, and yet they had this civilian population whom they didn't understand, by the way. </sentence><sentence id="957">They tried to treat them when the camps were liberated as though they were former Nazis. </sentence><sentence id="958">They locked them up in other camps until, you know, the army came to understand who these people were and until there was communication with the voluntary agencies like the American Joint Distribution Committee. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="968">Q: When was the first time that you saw Jews? </sentence><sentence id="969">Was that in Italy? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="972">A: There were very few -- there were three or four or five or six in among the Yugoslavs, but I think they didn't stay long in the camp. </sentence><sentence id="973">I think they were able to cross the Suez into Palestine. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="976">Q: And was the same true in Italy? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="978">A: No, in Italy, it was different. </sentence><sentence id="979">Firstly, there were the displaced people. </sentence><sentence id="980">They were Yugoslav Jews. </sentence><sentence id="981">They were Russian Jews. </sentence><sentence id="982">They were all kinds of Jews. </sentence><sentence id="983">They were Italian Jews. </sentence><sentence id="984">In Rome, there was quite a community of Jews who had been in hiding. </sentence><sentence id="985">There was a Jewish orphanage in Rome, for example, which had been taken over by the Catholics. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="986">The Catholics had taken the Jewish children from the orphanage and had hidden them in their orphanage out of town, and then they'd hidden them again, and when the Catholic orphanage was bombed, the one that was out of town, the American Joint Distribution Committee rebuilt it for them as a thank you for having saved the Jewish children, and then our units -- because we had volunteers -- the Joint had administrators who, we had volunteers who set up the orphanages again. </sentence><sentence id="987">They had experience in working in orphanages. </sentence><sentence id="988">It was quite an exciting time in a way to do positive things -- to see children smiling, children who hadn't been incarcerated, because we'd seen firstly the Yugoslav children who had been starving, and we began to get pictures of what was happening in Germany. </sentence><sentence id="989">We used to occasionally get shown German film that had been captured of the Nazis throwing children over the balcony, you know, it was ghastly, ghastly. </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="990">Q: Did you travel around Italy or did you stay primarily in Rome? </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="991">A: No, I traveled around. </sentence><sentence id="992">I traveled around Italy. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="995">Q: So, what was your job, then, in terms of traveling around? </sentence><sentence id="996">What was your task? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="999">A: Right, for example, if I went down, let's say to Santa Maria di Bari, I would go there, first you'd see how the camp was running. </sentence><sentence id="1000">It was amazing how, without any experience, one became an expert. </sentence><sentence id="1001">I did have something kind of social administration training, and I think I was instinctively an administrator. </sentence><sentence id="1002">I would see what was needed in that camp. </sentence><sentence id="1003">For example, we had one of our unit members in charge of a search bureau which we set up immediately because the important thing was to try to reunite families. </sentence><sentence id="1004">We had no baby clothes because once people -- the camps were liberated and people began to lead normal lives, women began to menstruate again. </sentence><sentence id="1005">They hadn't menstruated all through the war, and being normal human beings they began to get pregnant and have babies. </sentence><sentence id="1006">We needed sanitary napkins for the women. </sentence><sentence id="1007">We needed baby clothing. </sentence><sentence id="1008">We needed special food for pregnant women. </sentence><sentence id="1009">There were some older people who survived. </sentence><sentence id="1010">We needed special food for them. </sentence><sentence id="1011">We needed doctors. </sentence><sentence id="1012">We needed more social workers. </sentence><sentence id="1013">And one could assess this, and gradually these people came in to work in the camps. </sentence><sentence id="1014">It was exciting in the sense that you felt you could do something positive, and then the most important thing, I think, at that time was the search bureaus that we set up. </sentence><sentence id="1015">And they were interesting because, for example, you had to very quickly learn that the name "Schwartz", for example, S-c-h-w- a-r-t-z, can be spelled 30 different ways, and how do you distinguish? </sentence><sentence id="1016">How do you find Ivan Schwartz from Belgrade, for example? </sentence><sentence id="1017">You then knew you had to have his birthdays, his parents" names, their birthdays, where they were born, and you set up a very good system internationally. </sentence><sentence id="1018">The headquarters, at one point after Germany was liberated, was Arolsen in Germany. </sentence><sentence id="1019">There was a big unit in London set up by the World Jewish Congress and there was a big unit also in New York, and I think they were right. </sentence><sentence id="1020">The most important thing was to help people find family. </sentence><sentence id="1021">This went on for years. </sentence><sentence id="1022">It still goes on. </sentence><sentence id="1023">People are still finding relatives, close relatives. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1049">Q: Could you describe how people -- there were no computers, </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1051">A: Absolutely not. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1053">Q: So- </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1055">A: And, no typewriters. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1057">Q: Right, so how did people find these lists? </sentence><sentence id="1058">Where were the lists placed? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1061">A: Okay, I'll give you an example. </sentence><sentence id="1062">If we were in Vienna, and you came and you said, "My name is Joan Koppelbaum. </sentence><sentence id="1063">I come from Warsaw. </sentence><sentence id="1064">I had a mother and father and three  sisters and four brothers, and I managed to escape. </sentence><sentence id="1065">I don't know what happened to them. </sentence><sentence id="1066">My parents, I think, were taken to a camp. </sentence><sentence id="1067">I think my brothers and sisters may have escaped." </sentence><sentence id="1068">What we would do, we would send these lists of people who are asking for relatives to each office, and each office would contact the next office to see if they had any of these people registered with them. </sentence><sentence id="1069">We did use the Red Cross, but we found we were more efficient, I must be honest, than the Red Cross. </sentence><sentence id="1070">Firstly, the Red Cross took much longer than we did. </sentence><sentence id="1071">We knew that time was of the essence. </sentence><sentence id="1072">These lists were passed around, and we all got copies of these lists. </sentence><sentence id="1073">So, if we were looking for your relatives, we could look and say, "Hey! </sentence><sentence id="1074">Your aunt, we haven't found your parents yet, but your aunt is in Salzburg." </sentence><sentence id="1075">And very often, of course, when these people came to our offices, all the walls had their names written on them, and one would write, "I'm Ivan Schwartz. </sentence><sentence id="1076">I'm going to Rome." </sentence><sentence id="1077">Or "I'm Ivan Schwartz. </sentence><sentence id="1078">I'm going to Munich. </sentence><sentence id="1079">You will find me. </sentence><sentence id="1080">I will be with so-and-so." </sentence><sentence id="1081">It was like the tom-toms working. </sentence><sentence id="1082">And in the beginning, this is how people found each other. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1105">Q: So, people would leave little messages about - </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1107">A: Oh, they'd scribble on our walls. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1109">Q: On your walls? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1111">A: Oh, yeah. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1113">Q: Not on paper? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1115">A: Oh, on the walls. </sentence><sentence id="1116">And we had, let's say -- we had five or six rooms, and these messages were on the walls. </sentence><sentence id="1117">We would also take notes from them, but -- and, sometimes, a father would find a son in the office, and I can't tell you the emotion of that moment. </sentence><sentence id="1118">Everybody was so thrilled, and everybody cried. </sentence><sentence id="1119">You know, I still get emotional because I saw so much of this. </sentence><sentence id="1120">It was wonderful, wonderful, and then you would hear the sadness. </sentence><sentence id="1121">You know, "Your mother got killed." </sentence><sentence id="1122">Or "I don't know where your mother is." </sentence><sentence id="1123">And sometimes it would take months and months to trace a family member, and as I say, they are still tracing family members. </sentence><sentence id="1124">I hear stories from Poland today where they are still finding people alive in the States who they thought had died. </sentence><sentence id="1125">You know, in the old days, where we had immigration at the turn of the century, relatives lost touch with each other, and after this calamity, they certainly lost contact. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1137">Q: Amy, you say that it was so wonderful to be able to do good things for people. </sentence><sentence id="1138">That's clear. </sentence><sentence id="1139">In these first two settings, in Egypt and Italy, it must also have been difficult. </sentence><sentence id="1140">There must have been hard times because people are not coming out of this whole. </sentence><sentence id="1141">There's so much loss. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1147">A: But we hadn't suffered. </sentence><sentence id="1148">They had suffered. </sentence><sentence id="1149">This was the difference. </sentence><sentence id="1150">We were there to help them. </sentence><sentence id="1151">I don't think we ever thought of ourselves in this -- I'm being honest, I don't  think I ever felt that I had suffered anything at all. </sentence><sentence id="1152">You know, it was just so wonderful when you found a relative for somebody or when you were able to find a house for somebody to live in. </sentence><sentence id="1153">I don't think, and I'm not saying we weren't selfish people, we were normal human beings, but the job was so in a sense exciting. </sentence><sentence id="1154">Can you imagine going up to a town that's been liberated and the Jews there finding -- there were Jews, mostly we were British or the American in charge of the Joint would come up, and they'd see us in uniform or they'd see us, members of the Jewish Relief Units with the Shield of David on our shoulders and, you know, the Star of David on our berets. </sentence><sentence id="1155">It was so hard for them to believe that Jews had survived as Jews without being taken prisoner or had come to help them. </sentence><sentence id="1156">I don't think -- I can't imagine anybody that I know of, and we were all very different people, being concerned for ourselves in that sense. </sentence><sentence id="1157">I don't think we could've been because we might eventually have gone home more quickly. </sentence><sentence id="1158">I mean, some of us stayed on for years to help until the displaced persons camps were liberated. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1171">Q: And, describe again -- you wore an American army uniform. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1173">A: Yes, I was an American army officer in uniform. </sentence><sentence id="1174">My papers said I had the status of a lieutenant colonel, and it said, in fact, on my identity card that if I were taken prisoner by the Germans, I was to be treated as an officer. </sentence><sentence id="1175">I still have those documents. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1179">Q: And you wore the American army uniform in Egypt also? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1181">A: No, in Egypt, I was in British army officer's uniform. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1183">Q: And you wore skirts, or you wore-? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1185">A: We wore skirts. </sentence><sentence id="1186">Women didn't wear trousers at that time. </sentence><sentence id="1187">We wore skirts, and some of the American women had nylon stockings. </sentence><sentence id="1188">They must have been an inch thick, now that I remember, but of course, they got them at the PX and they gave us some. </sentence><sentence id="1189">No, I think they gave us, I don't think they sold them to us, and it was wonderful to wear a decent pair of hose. </sentence><sentence id="1190">You know, we hadn't had them in years. </sentence><sentence id="1191">The Americans were very generous, I must say, very generous. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1199">Q: How did you clean your clothes? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1201">A: That's a very good question, isn't it? </sentence><sentence id="1202">When it was warm, of course, everything was washed. </sentence><sentence id="1203">I think the army had a cleaning service. </sentence><sentence id="1204">I remember, in Vienna, there was an American cleaners, and I met somebody who worked in Vienna with me, and she said, "You used to come around every week and ask if anybody had cleaning, and you would take it to the cleaners for us." </sentence><sentence id="1205">I don't remember it, but she told me this was so. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1211">Q: I was wondering because uniforms are fairly heavy. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1213">A: Yeah. </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1214">Q: Except in the summer. </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1215">A: Right, no, we had, through the Red Cross, I think, or through the PX, we had a cleaning system. </sentence><sentence id="1216">Funny, those things I don't even recall because I suppose that wasn't important to us. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1219">Q: Was there any difference in status between the women who went over in the relief group and the men who went over? </sentence><sentence id="1220">Were the men not lieutenant colonels, but higher than that? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1223">A: No. </sentence><sentence id="1224">We all had the same status. </sentence><sentence id="1225">Everybody had the same status. </sentence><sentence id="1226">We had one unit leader, a woman who ran our unit was Phyllis Gerson, who after the war, the British government gave what's known as a MB, a Master- a Member, rather, of the British Empire award to her for having served in this unit, and the British government was very interesting. </sentence><sentence id="1227">They so valued our work, I think, that after the war they presented us with the same medals they gave to fighting servicemen. </sentence><sentence id="1228">I have mine. </sentence><sentence id="1229">I would never use them, even the decorative ones, because I didn't think we earned them. </sentence><sentence id="1230">You know, we weren't fighting, but I thought it was a very generous gesture. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1239">Q: Okay, I think we'll take a break now. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1241">A: Excellent. </sentence><sentence id="1242">How's it going? </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1249">Q: Amy, let's go onto Greece. </sentence><sentence id="1250">You were describing circumstances in Greece which sounded much worse in some ways than what you found in Egypt and Italy, and these were mainly Greek Jews who were coming back? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1253">A: Yes, these were Greek Jews. </sentence><sentence id="1254">The situation was worse because in -- firstly, in Egypt, we had many volunteers working with the people who the British were bringing in from the coast of Dalmatia. </sentence><sentence id="1255">In Greece, we were two foreigners, there was the head of the Joint Distribution Committee and I, and some local workers, and in Egypt, they hadn't been in concentration camp, and no matter how much people had suffered, they hadn't suffered the brutality, the inhumanity of the Germans in the sense of the people who came back from concentration camps had. </sentence><sentence id="1256">We had girls who came back who had tattooed across their stomachs, "Nur fuer ofitserin" "Only for officers". </sentence><sentence id="1257">They were used in brothels. </sentence><sentence id="1258">The boys, very many of them, had been castrated. </sentence><sentence id="1259">So, in addition to all their suffering, in one sense, the suffering was even worse than others, and yet, none of them had families to come back to. </sentence><sentence id="1260">There wasn't a mother and a father. </sentence><sentence id="1261">If there was a brother, there was nobody else. </sentence><sentence id="1262">If there was a sister, there was nobody else. </sentence><sentence id="1263">There were no complete families left in Greece. </sentence><sentence id="1264">As I mentioned earlier, I remember very clearly, the population among Jews in Greece had been 70,000 before the war, and after the war there were 10,000. </sentence><sentence id="1265">That's a tremendous percentage of Jews who were killed. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1279">Q: Were most of the people who came back from the concentration camps from Auschwitz, or from labor camps that they had been sent to on death marches? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1281">A: They were from different concentration camps. </sentence><sentence id="1282">I don't think any of them had been in labor camps. </sentence><sentence id="1283">I think they were in concentration camps, which were death camps. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1287">Q: This young girl that you said had a tattoo on her that said, "Only for officers", was she a Jewish girl? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1289">A: Oh, yes, I'm talking about the Jews. </sentence><sentence id="1290">There were some non-Jews who came back to Greece. </sentence><sentence id="1291">I must say we helped them, too, where we could, that we didn't differentiate. </sentence><sentence id="1292">For the most part, it was Jews who were deported. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1297">Q: What was the most difficult thing for you in helping these people? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1299">A: That we couldn't help them enough. </sentence><sentence id="1300">They were so ill, so many of them. </sentence><sentence id="1301">They were suffering from TB, and there were no sanitaria where you could put them and nurse them back to health. </sentence><sentence id="1302">You had, you know, we had to set up places extempore and put them in beds. </sentence><sentence id="1303">You didn't have the medical facilities. </sentence><sentence id="1304">You didn't have the medicines, and at that time, streptomycin wasn't yet available. </sentence><sentence id="1305">So, you know, these people were really suffering. </sentence><sentence id="1306">They were very, very ill. </sentence><sentence id="1307">They suffered tremendously, and it was very difficult to see it. </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1308">Q: So, you -- tuberculosis is very catching, so did you separate all with people who had tuberculosis, or couldn't you even know who had tuberculosis? </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1309">A: One didn't know who had tuberculosis. </sentence><sentence id="1310">Some were obviously tubercular because they were spitting blood. </sentence><sentence id="1311">We were not concerned for ourselves. </sentence><sentence id="1312">It's an interesting question you ask, because it never occurred to me that this was a contagious disease that I might get. </sentence><sentence id="1313">It had never occurred to me. </sentence><sentence id="1314">I'm sure none of the other workers had thought of it in that sense. </sentence><sentence id="1315">The main concern was to get these people treated, and Greece had very few beds available. </sentence><sentence id="1316">Greece had suffered tremendously anyway under the Germans, you see. </sentence><sentence id="1317">They were occupied. </sentence><sentence id="1318">And that was a very difficult time. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1329">Q: Did many die? </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1335">A: No, I don't remember them dying. </sentence><sentence id="1336">I don't remember them dying. </sentence><sentence id="1337">Maybe they had survived because they were so strong. </sentence><sentence id="1338">Don't forget, they come out of camps, had been put onto trains, I'm sure without any nursing facilities, and sent across Europe back to Athens. </sentence><sentence id="1339">They had to have been strong to start with. </sentence><sentence id="1340">I'm sure the weak ones hadn't survived in the first instance. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1347">Q: You know, I think it's interesting, people don't necessarily think about how difficult it is after a war, what it means to clean up and repair and at the same time take care of individuals, so the picture is very graphic when you describe it this way, and you describe people sleeping in the streets because there were not enough beds. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1349">A: There weren't -- they were sleeping -- I remember, I saw it, sleeping on benches in Constitution Square in Athens. </sentence><sentence id="1350">As I say, it was a warm summer, but there were no places to put them. </sentence><sentence id="1351">Eventually, gradually, we managed to find places, but some of those men who had been through absolute hell were now sitting -- sleeping in the square. </sentence><sentence id="1352">And some of them were very angry. </sentence><sentence id="1353">I remember, one came into the office once -- it sounds funny at this point -- but, again, he was going to shoot Israel Jacobson, and I sort of stood between, the brave one yet stupid, and he said, "Hey that's a Mauser. </sentence><sentence id="1354">I always wanted a Mauser. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="1355">What do you want for it?" </sentence><sentence id="1356">And this boy, I know this instinct so clearly, and Israel Jacobson is alive -- he can tell you the story, too -- he said, "I want 25 greenbacks." </sentence><sentence id="1357">And I don't remember whether he wanted them with the yellow seal or the red seal. </sentence><sentence id="1358">They thought the different seals had different values, and we bought it from him, and I remember, we got a friend to row us out to the Aegian and we threw the gun into the water. </sentence><sentence id="1359">That was just -- I remember that particularly, because when I stood between them, this wrist was flicked out that way, and this one this way. </sentence><sentence id="1360">Eventually my wrists were put back, I had terribly swollen hands. </sentence><sentence id="1361">So, that was all right. </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1362">Q: Why did that happen? </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1363">A: Well, they went for me. </sentence><sentence id="1364">You know, they were angry. </sentence><sentence id="1365">It was all our fault, wasn't it? </sentence><sentence id="1366">No, no, you can understand these men, for heaven's sake. </sentence><sentence id="1367">They came back, there were no families, and they wanted money and they knew we had, but not in the office. </sentence><sentence id="1368">But, he came -- he was going to kill anybody, he thought. </sentence><sentence id="1369">Maybe he didn't, but, you know, this was a gesture. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1397">Q: Were there more women than men also in these circumstances, coming back to Greece, or was this a case of where there were more men than women? </sentence><sentence id="1398">Do you remember? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1401">A: I seem to remember more men. </sentence><sentence id="1402">There were some young girls who came back, a number of them from the island of Rhodes, and we couldn't send them to Rhodes because there families had been killed. </sentence><sentence id="1403">There were no families, and that's when we decided together with this wonderful woman, Mrs. Mossieri, to set up this hostel to house these girls, and we helped them, of course, immediately, also to join families. </sentence><sentence id="1404">So, some of them came to the States. </sentence><sentence id="1405">Some went to Canada. </sentence><sentence id="1406">Some of them stayed in Greece. </sentence><sentence id="1407">Some went to Israel. </sentence><sentence id="1408">We tried to help them join families wherever we could because what is life without family? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1417">Q: How did the non-Jewish Greek population feel when these folks came back? </sentence><sentence id="1418">I mean, they also had suffered during the war. </sentence><sentence id="1419">So, I don't know, were they able to help? </sentence><sentence id="1420">Did they want to help? </sentence><sentence id="1421">Or were they simply trying to get through it themselves? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1427">A: I don't remember the Greek hierarchy being interested. </sentence><sentence id="1428">Now, maybe that's because I was so busy and never contacted them, but we were in contact with Mr. McVeigh who was the American ambassador there because there was a change of currency at one point, which we tried to fight successfully. </sentence><sentence id="1429">Spiros Sikuros was there. </sentence><sentence id="1430">I went with him on a plane from Italy to Greece, and he was very nice because he helped us to get the Nuremburg laws rescinded. </sentence><sentence id="1431">They were still in effect in Greece after the war. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1437">Q: Really? </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1438">A: Yes, and I remember there was a man, a major called, Moish Perlman (ph), who later became, I think, the press attache for the Israeli government, if my memory serves me, I think that's right. </sentence><sentence id="1439">Spiros Sikuros, whose son was in the army. </sentence><sentence id="1440">I traveled with him and his son on the plane to Athens, and he was very nice, and he helped to get the laws rescinded. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="1444">It was appalling that they were still in effect, but Greece was still trying to recover itself. </sentence><sentence id="1445">I don't think they intended to keep them going, but they didn't of themselves suggest that these laws be rescinded or the property laws be rescinded. </sentence><sentence id="1446">It required this outside pressure to get them done. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1450">Q: Now, even though people came back and there were no families, was there property, like houses or apartments that they tried to take over? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1452">A: That's a good question. </sentence><sentence id="1453">There were houses, but there were people living in them, and you can't just walk into a house when somebody else has taken over your home, and this required legal procedures, and it took time, and you had to have proof, and these people had to find their papers. </sentence><sentence id="1454">These things were not easy, but there were lawyers employed by the Joint Distribution Committee to help these people to get property back, but it was difficult. </sentence><sentence id="1455">It took time, especially when you had a country like Greece where they themselves had suffered so much under the Germans. </sentence><sentence id="1456">They were still trying to provide restitution to all the Greeks, let's say, in addition to the Jews. </sentence><sentence id="1457">We were interested in helping the remnants of the Jewish community, but the Greeks were interested in helping all Greeks. </sentence><sentence id="1458">It worked slowly. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1466">Q: Excuse me, I'm sorry. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1468">A: It worked very slowly. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1470">Q: In Eastern Europe, the Joint Distribution Committee often went around to the families who were taken care of Jewish children, non-Jewish families, and sometimes kidnapped them away. </sentence><sentence id="1471">Was anything like that happening in Italy or in Greece? </sentence><sentence id="1472">Had there been children in hiding who people wanted to keep? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1476">A: You're thinking particularly of Poland. </sentence><sentence id="1477">That is a very interesting story. </sentence><sentence id="1478">Not to my knowledge. </sentence><sentence id="1479">Not to my knowledge. </sentence><sentence id="1480">I didn't come across it. </sentence><sentence id="1481">If it existed, I didn't know of it. </sentence><sentence id="1482">But the sad thing in Poland, of course, was the fact that many of these people never told the children who they kept that they were Jewish children until they were dying themselves. </sentence><sentence id="1483">And, of course, you know, you now have this Jewish school in Warsaw where those children's children attend. </sentence><sentence id="1484">It's very -- tough, tough questions. </sentence><sentence id="1485">It's very hard to take in a baby of six weeks and four years later, when you've loved it and nurtured it, to give it up. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1500">A: I didn't think of it in that sense. </sentence><sentence id="1501">I was working. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1504">Q: So, were you traveling around Greece in the same way you were traveling around Italy? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1506">A: Not as much because you couldn't -- in the beginning, you couldn't travel around Greece. </sentence><sentence id="1507">The only way to travel that's safe from Athens to Salonica was by boat. </sentence><sentence id="1508">There were no bridges. </sentence><sentence id="1509">They had to be built. </sentence><sentence id="1510">There were no roads. </sentence><sentence id="1511">That's what I'm saying. </sentence><sentence id="1512">Yes, we traveled a little to see communities that we could. </sentence><sentence id="1513">We'd go up to -- I'm trying to remember -- Yanina, which was north of Athens, or to the south, but you couldn't travel around much. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1522">Q: How did you travel when you did? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1524">A: To Salonica, by boat. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1526">Q: And on the roads, how did you go? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1528">A: We had Jeeps, army Jeeps. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1530">Q: So, you didn't go with a cart and a donkey? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1532">A: No, I didn't. </sentence><sentence id="1533">No, nobody had carts and stuff. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1536">Q: And was your work in Greece very similar to what you did in Italy? </sentence><sentence id="1537">You were setting up- ? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1540">A: I set up a welfare agency in Athens. </sentence><sentence id="1541">These people needed money to buy, and my feeling was you didn't hand out money to people. </sentence><sentence id="1542">It was degrading to them to have to receive charity in that sense. </sentence><sentence id="1543">And I set up a system of relief whereby they came to the office, if it was one person, there was that set amount. </sentence><sentence id="1544">If it was two people, or a family, there were different amounts, and we gave them checks, and they went to the bank and cashed their checks. </sentence><sentence id="1545">This was my feeling, and always has been that the only thing that people often have left for themselves is their dignity, and this to me was one way of giving it back to them. </sentence><sentence id="1546">It worked very well. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1554">Q: And how did they cash a check if they didn't have an account? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1556">A: It was a Joint check, and we had an arrangement with the bank, of course. </sentence><sentence id="1557">The bank knew us. </sentence><sentence id="1558">Our money was coming in through the Bank of Greece. </sentence><sentence id="1559">I think Varvaresso was the president, and we knew him quite well. </sentence><sentence id="1560">I remember on one occasion, when we had  deposited quite a large sum of money, and had been assured that that money would not be devalued, because Greece was constantly devaluing, and one day when Israel Jacobson was on his way by plane, I remember, up to Salonica, I heard that the bank that morning had devalued the drachma, which meant that the $150,000 we had changed was now worth about $15. </sentence><sentence id="1561">I sent somebody immediately to the airport to bring him back, stop him going, which we did, and then we got in touch with the American ambassador -- | think he was an ambassador, I'm not sure already. </sentence><sentence id="1562">I don't think he was consul. </sentence><sentence id="1563">I think he was an ambassador, Mr. McVeigh, and they said, "Well, we just have to accept this." </sentence><sentence id="1564">And Spiros Sikuros of Fox Films, I think he was, said, "Well, have to accept this." </sentence><sentence id="1565">And, I said --and I said to Israel Jacobson, "We don't accept this. </sentence><sentence id="1566">This is Jewish money that is hard to come by. </sentence><sentence id="1567">It's voluntary donations. </sentence><sentence id="1568">We've got to fight this." </sentence><sentence id="1569">And I remember we fought it, and we got our money back. </sentence><sentence id="1570">I felt very good about it. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1586">Q: How does one fight a general devaluation of currency? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1588">A: Well, you go to the president who has assured you two days before there would be no devaluation, and you face him with his promise. </sentence><sentence id="1589">I mean, you're not scared. </sentence><sentence id="1590">You can't have 150,000 then the next day have 15, and you're trying to feed people who've been starving. </sentence><sentence id="1591">It's amazing how much courage you get when, you know, there's something really important here. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1596">Q: Was there a lot of black market in these places where you were, that you remember? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1598">A: I'm sure there was. </sentence><sentence id="1599">It wasn't talked about. </sentence><sentence id="1600">In a sense, it wasn't black market. </sentence><sentence id="1601">If they got, let's say, cheese given them in cans, you got sick of that cheese. </sentence><sentence id="1602">I've tasted. </sentence><sentence id="1603">So, you changed it for eggs. </sentence><sentence id="1604">If that's black market, there was black market. </sentence><sentence id="1605">And there were people were very glad to get it. </sentence><sentence id="1606">Or there would be chocolate, which was very nutritious, horrible stuff, and you could swap that for something else, for a can of bully beef or something. </sentence><sentence id="1607">The black market never bothered me. </sentence><sentence id="1608">Firstly, it was people getting foods that they wanted, and foods they felt they needed, and they were trading. </sentence><sentence id="1609">I don't see that that was such -- they weren't stealing anything. </sentence><sentence id="1610">They were just exchanging, and since it wasn't an official exchange, it was known as a black market. </sentence><sentence id="1611">This happened in Austria. </sentence><sentence id="1612">It certainly happened in Germany. </sentence><sentence id="1613">| didn't see it as anything bad. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1630">Q: You seem to be describing barter, which I think may be somewhat different than black market, where people do make money, and- </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1632">A: Oh, you're talking of jewelry and stuff like that. </sentence><sentence id="1633">That happened, yes. </sentence><sentence id="1634">I didn't see it in Greece, by the way. </sentence><sentence id="1635">The first time I really came across it was in Germany. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1640">Q: Now, when you gave people money, or checks so they could have some money, was this sufficient so they could rent an apartment, perhaps, or was this really to enable them to get food and sustain themselves. </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1641">A: Well, it was to help them more so to find places to live, and there was a group in the community who was finding places. </sentence><sentence id="1642">They weren't all Athenians. </sentence><sentence id="1643">So, they didn't all own property in Athens, and they were able to, if they had money, they could rent a room and they could buy food, and eventually we got food in through the American Joint Distribution Committee, which we could contribute both to individuals and through the synagogue. </sentence><sentence id="1644">The rabbi was there, Rabbi Basel, I think his name was. </sentence><sentence id="1645">They were taken care of, minimally, I must say, because this is all we could do. </sentence><sentence id="1646">The war had just finished. </sentence><sentence id="1647">It was hard to get stuff put aboard a ship. </sentence><sentence id="1648">Money was the thing that you could get. </sentence><sentence id="1649">So, we would go into, or sent to Palestine for goods, for clothing, or to Egypt for goods and clothing. </sentence><sentence id="1650">We were fortunate enough that we had -- there was Mr. Charles Passman in Palestine, who was with the American Joint Distribution committee also, a wonderful character. </sentence><sentence id="1651">I knew him, and he would send us food and send us clothing, and I think we did it also through the Jewish Community in Cairo. </sentence><sentence id="1652">You bring back memories. </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1653">Q: I'm going to go back to something because I'm going to forget it if 1 don't remind you and me. </sentence><sentence id="1654">You said you met Golda Meir on a trip from Italy to Palestine. </sentence><sentence id="1655">What was she doing and what were you meeting about? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1659">A: Well, she was a member of, I suppose, the hierarchy in the British -- no, sorry, beg your pardon -- in the Palestine Jewish community. </sentence><sentence id="1660">She was one of the political animals as well as Sharett, and I can't think of the others at the moment who I also met. </sentence><sentence id="1661">We went to see her essentially because people were coming into Athens from the north, escapees. </sentence><sentence id="1662">I think the war was still on, and coming down to the hachshara (ph) that was in Perez, and there wasn't enough space. </sentence><sentence id="1663">They weren't moving out quickly enough on the leaderships. </sentence><sentence id="1664">I must say the Joint wasn't arranging illegal movement. </sentence><sentence id="1665">I know that. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1673">Q: It wasn't? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1675">A: No. </sentence><sentence id="1676">It had a very clean nose in that sense. </sentence><sentence id="1677">I think they were scared in the sense that if they did anything illegally, and the American government discovered it, they wouldn't trust them. </sentence><sentence id="1678">I know when I was working on immigration, we were terribly careful. </sentence><sentence id="1679">But the Palestinians were working their ships. </sentence><sentence id="1680">We were feeding the people, and- </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1687">Q: I was asking you about what the meeting was about with Golda Meir. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1689">A: Right, we went to see her because they were coming down rather quickly, and there wasn't enough space in the hachshara to house them, and we really went to ask her to slow down the movement a bit so that people came in more slowly, and could be shipped out, because the hachshara was rather small, and I guess she did her stuff. </sentence><sentence id="1690">It was interesting meeting these people. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1693">Q: Did you learn to speak Greek since you were there for so long, or at least, over a year? </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1694">A: I had kitchen Greek. </sentence><sentence id="1695">That's what I would say. </sentence><sentence id="1696">It wasn't very good Greek, but I had an ear for language, and could understand what was being said. </sentence><sentence id="1697">No, I used English. </sentence><sentence id="1698">I also began to learn German. </sentence><sentence id="1699">I had no idea I was to eventually going to end up in German speaking countries, but that I found easier. </sentence><sentence id="1700">And the boys, many of them spoke, or the girls also spoke German. </sentence><sentence id="1701">They spoke English, too, a number of them, and we, of course, operated with interpreters. </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1702">Q: Did you interview some of these survivors that had come back? </sentence><sentence id="1703">Did you sit down and talk with them or was work so overwhelming that that was not part of what you were doing? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1706">A: Do you mean about their experiences in the camps? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1708">Q: Yeah. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1710">A: I don't think they were ready to talk about it. </sentence><sentence id="1711">It never occurred to me at that time, when somebody came back, to talk about it experience in a concentration camp. </sentence><sentence id="1712">When you sat down with somebody, you talked to them about how many members of his family were there? </sentence><sentence id="1713">Did he know where they were? </sentence><sentence id="1714">You talked for the future, not for the past. </sentence><sentence id="1715">I must say, in all my experience, I never consciously asked them to talk about their experience in concentration camp. </sentence><sentence id="1716">Firstly, for them it was very difficult, especially since they had gone in sometimes as a family -- a father and two sons, and this was the only son who survived, and purely by the grace of God, no other reason. </sentence><sentence id="1717">We never asked them to. </sentence><sentence id="1718">Some of them did tell you of their experiences, and you listened. </sentence><sentence id="1719">We didn't ask questions. </sentence><sentence id="1720">They had a need to talk, and you had to have a good ear and listen. </sentence><sentence id="1721">Some of it was horrific. </sentence><sentence id="1722">Some of it was horrific, but no, I never remember asking about the experience in a camp. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1736">Q: Did you ever notice that the spoke with each other? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1738">A: No, I don't think they did. </sentence><sentence id="1739">They had certain codes, I think. </sentence><sentence id="1740">They hadn't all been in the same camp, and those that had, the fact that they were together meant that they had comfort. </sentence><sentence id="1741">They were lucky. </sentence><sentence id="1742">They had other people they could talk to about what they went through who would understand. </sentence><sentence id="1743">I think they might also have thought we couldn't possibly understand, and how could we? </sentence><sentence id="1744">How could we understand the brutality and the killings and the horrific things that they had to do? </sentence><sentence id="1745">No, you didn't ask. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1754">Q: As you heard some of this from people, I mean, since some people did speak with you, did you -- you seem to have an extremely positive outlook on life. </sentence><sentence id="1755">I mean, it just shows in you. </sentence><sentence id="1756">Did this depress you and make you wonder about the capacity of human beings to commit horrific acts like this that you had never thought of before? </sentence><sentence id="1757">Did you think this was just aberrant? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1762">A: No, I never thought it was aberrant. </sentence><sentence id="1763">This was very intentional by many, many people. </sentence><sentence id="1764">I think when people would tell me their stories, I used to think, "And they survived this." </sentence><sentence id="1765"> And the important thing was to get them away from this. </sentence><sentence id="1766">I mean, how could people go through the kind of thing they had? </sentence><sentence id="1767">The bombing in London was nothing compared to this, and that horrified me. </sentence><sentence id="1768">I was terrified. </sentence><sentence id="1769">No, I seem to remember also when people would come and tell some horrific stories that you couldn't cry with them. </sentence><sentence id="1770">You were there to help them. </sentence><sentence id="1771">I used to say to some of the people who work for me, particularly when I went into Austria and then Germany, "We can't cry with them. </sentence><sentence id="1772">We can cry for them afterwards, but we have to help them." </sentence><sentence id="1773">I don't know where this attitude came from, frankly. </sentence><sentence id="1774">I think it's always been there. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1788">Q: So, did you sometimes cry alone? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1790">A: Oh, when we got home and we would talk. </sentence><sentence id="1791">We were a group living in the same apartment building, and I remember Hannah Kisch, who was a wonderful woman, originally from Lithuanian who immigrated to South Africa and came up to help us, and she would tell a story and be sobbing, you know, and we would share stories that we'd heard, but it didn't last for long. </sentence><sentence id="1792">We didn't have time to do this. </sentence><sentence id="1793">You know, when we were working, we started, I suppose, at seven or eight in the morning, and who knows what time at night we'd finish. </sentence><sentence id="1794">There were no days off. </sentence><sentence id="1795">There was no closing the office because it was dark or something. </sentence><sentence id="1796">You were working all the time. </sentence><sentence id="1797">Sometimes, some of the people were in the office all night. </sentence><sentence id="1798">I don't remember being, except once or twice in Salonica, working late into the night, or in Italy when we were working on this transport to Palestine, working I think all night through. </sentence><sentence id="1799">I don't remember it, but you just did it, and it wasn't work, you see, you were helping people. </sentence><sentence id="1800">And I think we were lucky and a number of people who volunteered to go overseas were of similar ilk, and if they weren't -- some of them went home after the year's contract was up, which was just as well. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1812">Q: I can see you're seeing somebody in your head. </sentence><sentence id="1813">Yes? </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1945">Q: You were in Greece from April "45 to August deg46, yes? </sentence><sentence id="1946">So, in the beginning, it must have been much tougher, because the war is just over, or not quite over. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1951">Q: In June, right. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1953">A: The Greeks were shooting up people reading the Communist newspapers in Constitutional Square, I remember. </sentence><sentence id="1954">That was how they celebrated the end of the war. </sentence><sentence id="1955">Our office overlooked the Square. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1959">Q: You can see people being shot? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1961">A: Oh, yeah. </sentence><sentence id="1962">You know, all in a days work, kind of thing. </sentence><sentence id="1963">At a very early age, you got used to seeing this kind of thing, and it was horrible, horrible. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1967">Q: What was it like a year later? </sentence><sentence id="1968">Were there sort of incremental changes, like every three months you could see a real difference? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1971">A: No, supplies began to come in. </sentence><sentence id="1972">For example, we were very indiscriminate still at that time in using DDT to disinfest people. </sentence><sentence id="1973">You know, in Egypt, we disinfested the Arabs, poor  souls. </sentence><sentence id="1974">God knows how much we got up our own nostrils. </sentence><sentence id="1975">Who knew it was such a poison? </sentence><sentence id="1976">And we stopped using DDT at one point, but I remember puffing it into the Arabs galobiers (ph), you know? </sentence><sentence id="1977">Things began to change as people began to get a place to live, found family, decided they would immigrate, registered with a consulate, had family members contact them. </sentence><sentence id="1978">Nobody would come in, and there was very little civilian traffic between Europe and the United States or Australia, and they still couldn't go to Palestine except legally -- if they were going legally on a certificate. </sentence><sentence id="1979">So, movement was slow, but gradually things began to get a bit better, and as I say, as people began to find relatives, things were better. </sentence><sentence id="1980">It was very slow, very slow, and people were ill for a long time, a long time, and to get property back took years. </sentence><sentence id="1981">You couldn't see it in increments. </sentence><sentence id="1982">It didn't happen quickly. </sentence><sentence id="1983">Look how long it took to get reparations from Germany. </sentence><sentence id="1984">They started in deg45 and the reparations began to come through at the end of the "40s, and these were with all the great powers working together and Germany willing to give back in part. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1999">Q: How was it that you came to go to Austria? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2001">A: In August of 1946, Dr. Joseph Schwartz, my hero, a blessing really -- he really was a wonderful man with a wonderful sense of humor and a marvelous administrator -- asked me if I would go up into Austria. </sentence><sentence id="2002">He said President Truman in December of 1945, on the 22"! </sentence><sentence id="2003">of December, had passed -- had issued a directive which enabled people who were displaced persons to get priority for American visas under the quota system. </sentence><sentence id="2004">In other words, they still had to go through the quota, but they would get visas rather than people, let's say, who'd lived in England or South America, and he said they'd had somebody there working, but who hadn't panned out, and would I do this? </sentence><sentence id="2005">Well, I would have done anything this man asked me, and so I went up into Athens, but I knew nothing of American immigration law, and I must say, I sat down for four days with this American immigration law from 1924, I think it was, and then with the Truman Directive, and gradually began to get things together, and it didn't take too long. </sentence><sentence id="2006">Firstly, here was something very positive. </sentence><sentence id="2007">We were going to be able to help people to leave Austria -- displaced persons and Austrian Jews. </sentence><sentence id="2008">And the first problem we had was that those Jews from Austria who had returned to Vienna from camps were not considered displaced persons by the consuls, but the International Refugee Organization had registered them as displaced persons, which they were. </sentence><sentence id="2009">They didn't have their homes. </sentence><sentence id="2010">They didn't have their jobs. </sentence><sentence id="2011">Some of their family members had been killed, and so, we set up a test case. </sentence><sentence id="2012">When I say we, I was very brazen, I must confess, and I established a precedent case showing how this man -- I won't give you his name, he lives in the States today -- how this man had lost family, had lost his home, had come back, had no where to live, was being housed by the American voluntary agency, and essentially he was still a displaced person, and we won the case. </sentence><sentence id="2013">So, he could get a visa and go to the United States. </sentence><sentence id="2014">When this happened, we could put through other Austrian Jews. </sentence><sentence id="2015">There weren't too many left, and get them visas, and then we could help the others to get visas. </sentence><sentence id="2016">And the interesting thing was we began to work rather swiftly. </sentence><sentence id="2017">My thought was firstly we must get young people out because the young people are the future of any community. </sentence><sentence id="2018">Secondly, we must get all  those people out who have relatives who will help them. </sentence><sentence id="2019">That meant they would not be a charge on the voluntary agency's funds, which really had to harness its money, and also it would give them back a normal life, and so these people began to move rather swiftly through the pipeline, and it worked very well until the first Displaced Persons Act, American Displaced Persons Act of 1948. </sentence><sentence id="2020">This in a sense sounds like a mythical story, but I was in Vienna and some members of the Displaced Persons Commission, I'll think of their names in a moment -- Carrousi (ph) and some other people, came into Vienna, I think it was on a Saturday, maybe it was a Friday, and said, "We're ready to issue visas under the Displaced Persons Act. </sentence><sentence id="2021">Where are your job and housing assurances? </sentence><sentence id="2022">On the basis of those, we can give visas." </sentence><sentence id="2023">Frankly, I'd never seen a job and housing assurance. </sentence><sentence id="2024">I didn't know what it was. </sentence><sentence id="2025">I knew we were going to have some, but we were waiting for our American agency to send the stuff over, and I said to these men, "Our job and housing assurances are at the printers, at the Allianz gebaude," which is the office where we took all our mimeographing. </sentence><sentence id="2026">If you would write one out for me, I'll go over there and get it mimeographed. </sentence><sentence id="2027">I was lying. </sentence><sentence id="2028">I'd never seen one. </sentence><sentence id="2029">They were very nice, these gentlemen. </sentence><sentence id="2030">They wrote it out. </sentence><sentence id="2031">I went over to the Allianz gebaude. </sentence><sentence id="2032">1 mimeographed about 50. </sentence><sentence id="2033">I had all the cases which I knew were okay. </sentence><sentence id="2034">I issued a job and housing assurance for, and these went to the consulate and these people gave them visas. </sentence><sentence id="2035">I called Munich and told the director of immigration there what I had done and what the wording was on this thing so when these men eventually got to Salz -- I beg your pardon -- to Munich in a few days, they were ready. </sentence><sentence id="2036">Now, our people began to get visas, and I must say within about ten days a cable came through to the director of the Joint in Austria, Harold Trobe, telling him that was Amy Zahl was doing was illegal and please stop her at once. </sentence><sentence id="2037">And he called me on the phone and told me this, and so I went to the consulate, I picked up every Jewish case I could find whether we would have been working with them or not, issued them job and housing assurances, and then stopped. </sentence><sentence id="2038">Now, what happened was as the ships began to take passengers to the States, and we were using army transports, there were a lot of Jews in the first ship -- ship, one ship, two ships, about four ships, and the press in the United States, of course, "Only Jews are getting visas." </sentence><sentence id="2039">There were lots of anti-Semitic comments in the press, and I'm sure if you look at the press at that time, you'll find it was only because we were on the ball. </sentence><sentence id="2040">What we did do, of course, was tell the other agencies what they needed and how to go about it. </sentence><sentence id="2041">We didn't have a counsel of voluntary agencies in Vienna. </sentence><sentence id="2042">We did when I got to Germany, but that was very interesting. </sentence><sentence id="2043">I felt as though I was doing sort of some really dirty work, but we were helping people to get out. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2087">Q: Can you explain what a job and housing assurance is? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2089">A: Yes. </sentence><sentence id="2090">In order to get a visa, you no longer needed an affidavit from an individual. </sentence><sentence id="2091">What you needed was instead an assurance that you would have a job when you got to the United States and that you would have housing. </sentence><sentence id="2092">And voluntary agencies were allowed to give these out because ostensibly, the voluntary agencies in the United States were going into communities and asking them, and they were very good for all displaced persons, Jewish and non-Jewish, to give job and housing assurances which they did. </sentence><sentence id="2093">The Jewish  and all the other agencies were very cooperative, and many displaced persons did get to the United States on the basis of those job and housing assurances. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2099">Q: Amy, was the assurance of a particular job? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2101">A: A particular job. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2103">Q: For this particular person. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2105">A: For this particular person in a particular spot in the United States, in a particular town. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2107">Q: So, then, how did you do it? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2109">A: Okay. </sentence><sentence id="2110">If, Ivan Schwartz came to me, and he had met the other provisions of the Truman Directive was -- which were that you had to have been in the American, British or French zones of Austria or Germany or the British, French or American zones of Vienna or Berlin on December the 22", 1945, you were eligible. </sentence><sentence id="2111">If you were eligible, we could get a job -- we would contact the States and we would get -- this is under normal circumstances -- a job and housing assurance for Ivan Schwartz to go to Seattle to be a tailor, which he had been before, and on the basis of that, providing he passed his medical with the consulate, providing he passed his security with the CIC, the Counter Intelligence Corp, he would get a visa. </sentence><sentence id="2112">Those were the only people who were eligible. </sentence><sentence id="2113">So, what I did, since I had job and housing assurances already for people, I just had to sign a name to them. </sentence><sentence id="2114">In a sense, I did it without authority. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2121">Q: And did you do it thinking this person could do this job? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2123">A: No. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2125">Q: You just did it to - </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2127">A: I had no idea what job they did. </sentence><sentence id="2128">I wanted to get these people out, and it worked. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2131">Q: Were these mainly men? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2133">A: Families. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2135">Q: Families? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2137">A: Oh, it was families and individuals. </sentence><sentence id="2138">It was whoever was eligible under the provisions of the directive. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2141">Q: But you know why I'm asking? </sentence><sentence id="2142">Because are these jobs that are assured mainly jobs for men? </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2143">A: Mostly, I would think they were jobs for men because women weren't a large part of the labor force in "45. </sentence><sentence id="2144">They were a very small part of the labor force except in munitions factories and things like that, but in Europe women hadn't been part of the labor force before the war, and we're talking of people who hadn't worked since the war. </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2145">Q: And may not have finished school... </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2147">A: May not have finished school. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2149">Q: Was this and added burden for women then, unless they got married and were part of a family? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2151">A: We didn't -- I don't seem to remember many individual women, and maybe as many women didn't survive. </sentence><sentence id="2152">I don't remember as many women alone coming and trying to get out under the Displaced Persons Act. </sentence><sentence id="2153">That's a fascinating question because, when I think, I always think of families or husband and wives or single men. </sentence><sentence id="2154">I don't remember many single women. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2159">Q: Because one might wonder whether some of the women married sooner than they might have, knowing that they might be able to get out if they were married, but not if they were single. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2161">A: Right, and by the same token, some of the men might have married women they might not otherwise have married because they were born in Germany, let's say, where the quota was good. </sentence><sentence id="2162">They were still working on the quota system, remember. </sentence><sentence id="2163">So, people married each other for different reasons, apart from the fact that they were fond of each other. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2167">Q: So, how long did you work in Austria? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2169">A: I worked in Austria from August "46 to October "48. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2171">Q: That's a long period. </sentence><sentence id="2172">Could you describe, I mean, you were doing these visas, were you going around and explaining to people how they could get visas? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2175">A: Yes, I used to go into the camps and explain what the law was, how they could become eligible. </sentence><sentence id="2176">I had offices in Salzburg, in Linz, in Innsbruck, and I would call these people together who run the offices. </sentence><sentence id="2177">So, we all ran on the same system. </sentence><sentence id="2178">It was a tiring job ina way. </sentence><sentence id="2179">You had to be on the ball all the time, and you had to have good people, but the system worked very well, and then, when in 1948, the Displaced Persons Act was passed, I was asked, again, by Dr. Schwartz to go into Germany. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2185">Q: I don't want you to get to Germany so fast. </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2186">A: Okay. </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2187">Q: I want to talk about Austria a little bit. </sentence><sentence id="2188">What was it like to -- did you lecture? </sentence><sentence id="2189">I mean, did you get into a hall and lecture to a group of DPs to say this is what you- </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2193">A: No, I learned German very quickly. </sentence><sentence id="2194">I learned it because I didn't trust interpreters. </sentence><sentence id="2195">I didn't know if they were working for the Russians or for the French or for the British or for the Americans, trying to catch me out. </sentence><sentence id="2196">You learned to be very wary living in Vienna. </sentence><sentence id="2197">For example, we couldn't leave Vienna without a propesk, a permit, from the Russians. </sentence><sentence id="2198">I still have one as a matter of fact. </sentence><sentence id="2199">And what we, I would do when I was going up to Salzburg or to Linz, the other side of the Russian zone, I would get on -- there was an American army train known as the Mozart, and we would get on that and that was not inspected by the Russians, but you still had to have a permit to leave Austria. </sentence><sentence id="2200">What was the rest of your question? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2209">Q: I was asking whether you would get in front of a large group of DPs and lecture to them? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2211">A: No, I'm sorry. </sentence><sentence id="2212">I would go up, let's say, to Linz, and talk to the people in the office, and then I'd go into a camp and talk to them. </sentence><sentence id="2213">I learned Yiddish, also, and I learned to speak with a Polish accent. </sentence><sentence id="2214">There's a different accent if you're a Russian Jew or Lithuanian Jew. </sentence><sentence id="2215">You have a softer accent. </sentence><sentence id="2216">I would talk to them in German or in Yiddish about what they had to do, and why it was taking so long from their point of view, that there was no need to try and come, let's say, to the office in Vienna, which some of them would try to do or to go to Salzburg. </sentence><sentence id="2217">We didn't have the staff to cope with large numbers, but what was happening and what we were doing and I think the fact that we kept them informed of what we were doing helped to stop any rioting that we might have had. </sentence><sentence id="2218">I don't remember any rioting at all, actually. </sentence><sentence id="2219">We had people who would be very irate and come in and bang the table and make all kinds of threats, but I think it helped having offices where, you may laugh at this, where we set up chairs where they could sit and wait, because when I first came in, there were no chairs for visitors. </sentence><sentence id="2220">They lined up, and one by one they went in and stood by a desk. </sentence><sentence id="2221">Well, this whole thing of dignity which I'd learned at a very early age. </sentence><sentence id="2222">People -- you don't give them dignity by making them stand and you sit. </sentence><sentence id="2223">| remember, what we did in Vienna and I did it again in Germany. </sentence><sentence id="2224">We got a great big urn, and made coffee, and the nicest person I could find, usually a nice Hungarian boy, I would put in charge of the waiting room, and he'd offer people coffee. </sentence><sentence id="2225">They were unused to this. </sentence><sentence id="2226">A lot of people wouldn't drink our coffee because they were ultra-orthodox, but other people would, and we would have newspapers in the office, and as I told you, they'd go along the walls scribbling their names and where they were going to or leaving notes with somebody and they'd meet each other. </sentence><sentence id="2227">It became a meeting place. </sentence><sentence id="2228">It worked. </sentence><sentence id="2229">It worked. </sentence><sentence id="2230">Sometimes, they had to wait a long time in order to get seen because we didn't have colossal staff. </sentence><sentence id="2231">The work was tedious. </sentence><sentence id="2232">For the consuls, you had to have everything in order, and we weren't only working on American immigration. </sentence><sentence id="2233">We were working on immigration to Palestine. </sentence><sentence id="2234">No, we weren't doing the Palestine immigration now. </sentence><sentence id="2235">Palestine  was being handled by the Jewish agency. </sentence><sentence id="2236">We were not working on Palestine. </sentence><sentence id="2237">That's an error. </sentence><sentence id="2238">We were working on South America, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, South Africa, and the paperwork was very slow, but people did begin to move out. </sentence><sentence id="2239">But the Truman Directive was wonderful because, for the first time, numbers of people began to leave, numbers, and the Rothschild Hospital, which was housing so many of these people, began gradually to get -- to lessen in number its occupants. </sentence><sentence id="2240">But it was hard work. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2271">Q: Amy, in "46, there are still people in DP camps who were not technically survivors, who had left the country because of the war and they were accumulated in DP camps. </sentence><sentence id="2272">Did you have criteria for who you would give visas to? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2275">A: We didn't give visas. </sentence><sentence id="2276">We were not judges. </sentence><sentence id="2277">The people who in the DP camps, there were very few survivors of concentration camps -- I'm thinking of Vienna -- no, there were. </sentence><sentence id="2278">There were people who'd survived camps. </sentence><sentence id="2279">No, we made no criteria. </sentence><sentence id="2280">How can you decide that this need is greater than that need? </sentence><sentence id="2281">You know, because he has a new baby and these don't have a baby and they've both been through hell and only one of that couple had been through hell. </sentence><sentence id="2282">No, no, no, you couldn't afford to be judgmental. </sentence><sentence id="2283">You couldn't afford it. </sentence><sentence id="2284">But, as long as they met the criteria, and not a great number did, but a fair number met the criteria, we did everything we could to help them get in. </sentence><sentence id="2285">The Immigration and Naturalization Service, I must say, were not very kindly disposed toward these people, and did everything they could to find some fault where they could deny them entry to the United States, and then you would have to appeal. </sentence><sentence id="2286">This happened occasionally and somebody was absolutely heartbroken when you knew that they were genuine and they were refused entry by the INS having gone through all the medicals and all the other checks, and had been given visas and had written to relatives that they were coming. </sentence><sentence id="2287">They suddenly found that Immigration and Naturalization Services found their papers were not in order, let's say. </sentence><sentence id="2288">Those were very hard times, very hard times. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2303">Q: And would you appeal for them? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2305">A: We had somebody with legal experience who appealed to the INS, and very often we won our case, very often. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2307">Q: And what do you think the INS was doing? </sentence><sentence id="2308">Were they being genuine? </sentence><sentence id="2309">Were they simply not wanting these folks to come in because they-? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2313">A: Well, I remember one of the -- I know -- I remember the name of the man who was in charge of the INS in Munich. </sentence><sentence id="2314">When he told Dorothea Green, who headed up the ORT, Organization for Rehabilitation and Training, who is a very lovely lady, very handsome, and she was fighting for a case, and he said to her, "Lady, you're here to get these people in. </sentence><sentence id="2315">We're here to keep them out." </sentence><sentence id="2316">And she didn't lie. </sentence><sentence id="2317">And I'm sure this was their attitude. </sentence><sentence id="2318">They didn't like these people. </sentence><sentence id="2319">After all, they didn't speak English. </sentence><sentence id="2320">They weren't well dressed by a long shot, and these men didn't like them, and maybe they'd been given instructions to try and keep them out. </sentence><sentence id="2321">I don't know. </sentence><sentence id="2322">No, that was pretty tough, but the -- in  the first instance, these people didn't go to the INS until they got to Bremen. </sentence><sentence id="2323">So, they were held back in Bremen. </sentence><sentence id="2324">Later on, when the Displaced Persons Act came into being, they sent the INS into different regions so people didn't accumulate in Bremen, but rather went to Bremen knowing they were going to board a ship. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2337">Q: Did you sometimes take the information? </sentence><sentence id="2338">Or were you sort of the administrative head of your staff? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2341">A: What do you mean, did I take information? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2343">Q: Well, did you see with clients? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2345">A: I was in charge of the administration, but I handled what I considered to be difficult cases. </sentence><sentence id="2346">For example, if one of my workers said to me, "Amy, you know, I'm not sure that this man's papers are really genuine." </sentence><sentence id="2347">Because I must say, the Joint was very, very careful. </sentence><sentence id="2348">It would've been foolish for us to sponsor cases of people whose documents were false, because we might have ruined for everybody. </sentence><sentence id="2349">I would then take on that case. </sentence><sentence id="2350">Firstly, it was very time consuming, and there were plenty of people lined up, and I developed a means of questioning people where, if they could pass my surveillance, I would think that their papers were genuine. </sentence><sentence id="2351">If it became apparent to me that really these papers were false, I would say to this person, "You know, we can get you into Canada as either a furrier or a tailor or this or that. </sentence><sentence id="2352">So, you could -- excuse me -- you could meet your relatives in the United States. </sentence><sentence id="2353">Or, if you would like to take your family to Australia, we" ll try and get you there." </sentence><sentence id="2354">But, I would not sponsor that case. </sentence><sentence id="2355">That case became a no-no in our office. </sentence><sentence id="2356">No, we were very careful in that sense. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2369">Q: Can you give me a sense of what it would mean to have a false paper? </sentence><sentence id="2370">What is that kind of documentation people had to have? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2373">A: Okay. </sentence><sentence id="2374">It was sad. </sentence><sentence id="2375">These people had to prove that they were in Austria, Germany or Italy on December the gore. </sentence><sentence id="2376">1945. </sentence><sentence id="2377">Now, some of them had gone back to Poland to look for family and not found them. </sentence><sentence id="2378">So, on December the 22"4,1945, they were in Poland rather than in Germany, and they would make false papers to say they were in a Germany town on that date, so that they could pass. </sentence><sentence id="2379">Now, it sound became apparent, for example, the Immigration and Naturalization Service would say to them, "What color were the streetcars in the town?" </sentence><sentence id="2380">because they knew. </sentence><sentence id="2381">And very soon, of course, the survivors knew what color the streetcars were. </sentence><sentence id="2382">When you think back, it was horrid to treat people with such indignity, people who had suffered so much and who had gone to look for relatives and this was their crime because, because of that, they couldn't get visas to the United States. </sentence><sentence id="2383">It was horrible. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2395">Q: You must have gotten angry at times, no? </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2396">A: You couldn't afford to be angry. </sentence><sentence id="2397">You had to find ways to overcome this stupidity. </sentence><sentence id="2398">You got angry for your clients because you knew they were decent and fine people who perhaps been in concentration camp, or they'd be in Koraganda, in Russia because they had fled to Russia from Poland, and then come back, and they worked in the mines. </sentence><sentence id="2399">They suffered, and here are these people treating them like gangsters because -- criminals rather, because they hadn't been in a certain place on a certain date. </sentence><sentence id="2400">They may have come over three days later, by the way, and that was awful. </sentence><sentence id="2401">That made you very sad, very sad because sometimes a mother would get a visa and her adult son wouldn't. </sentence><sentence id="2402">And then what we try and do is help the adult son get to Canada because we knew that through Canada and the United States, they could work something out where the two relatives could be joined again. </sentence><sentence id="2403">It was hard to watch. </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2404">Q: Let's take a break. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2412">Q: Amy, give me some idea. </sentence><sentence id="2413">You were in Austria for a rather long time, close to two years. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2416">A: More than two years. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2418">Q: More than two years. </sentence><sentence id="2419">What was it like to be in Austria during that time? </sentence><sentence id="2420">Did you meet with Austrians as well as the refugees and the survivors that you were helping? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2424">A: We didn't meet with Austrians. </sentence><sentence id="2425">It was a very difficult situation in the sense that Vienna was occupied by the Americans, the French, the British and the Germans. </sentence><sentence id="2426">Each had a sector, and there was an international sector, and one had to be very careful not to go into the Russian sector at this time, because you could be arrested. </sentence><sentence id="2427">So, it was a bit difficult. </sentence><sentence id="2428">Also, Vienna had been bombed, and the only accommodation they had for people like us was in hotels and what were formerly known as studen (ph) hotels. </sentence><sentence id="2429">Those were hotels where somebody came for an hour, and the rooms were very tiny, and that, I found, very difficult to live with, and so I got myself a billet in a private home of some Austrians and had at least a room and a bathroom that I could move around in to myself, and it was a bit further out from the center. </sentence><sentence id="2430">So, it was fairly pleasant. </sentence><sentence id="2431">But they had no heating and I had to supply coal to heat my room. </sentence><sentence id="2432">But it wasn't bad. </sentence><sentence id="2433">You know, I'd come from England, remember, not too long ago, and we didn't have homes to heat after the bombing. </sentence><sentence id="2434">So, that was okay. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2446">Q: And were these older Austrians? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2448">A: No, these were younger people. </sentence><sentence id="2449">The husband had been a Nazi, but as he said, if he weren't a member of the Nazi party, you couldn't run a business, and I must say, I believed him also that he was a decent man because, when I was there, he was often sent packages from Jews who he'd help to get the Argentine, and they were sending him food packages. </sentence><sentence id="2450">So, he couldn't have been all bad. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2454">Q: Is that your main association with Austrian citizens? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2456">A: I beg your pardon. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2458">Q: Is that your main association with Austrian citizens? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2460">A: With Austrian citizens, well, I had Austrians working in my office, Austrian Jews, but I didn't -- I had very little contact or almost no contact with Austrians per se. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2462">Q: Did other members -- actually, how many members of your staff were there? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2464">A: In the immigration office? </sentence><sentence id="2465">I had another person from England who was my secretary and confidant, there was a man who originally had been from -- had been Austrian, he now  lived in Britain, and he helped. </sentence><sentence id="2466">And then there must have been eight other local staff, and they were Jewish, essentially because we wanted to give Jews employment, and so we were about a dozen people in my office alone. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2470">Q: But, you had -- you administered a number of offices? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2472">A: Yes, this was the Viennese office, which I worked in as well as administrating. </sentence><sentence id="2473">Then I administered the office in Salzburg, the one in Linz, which was the other side of the Russian zone, and the one in the French zone in Innsbruck, and then we had representatives in all the displaced persons camps because we would go out to them to save people having to travel to Vienna, which they couldn't do unless they had permits to go through the Russian zone, and that, nobody was keen to do at this time. </sentence><sentence id="2474">We would go into the camps, and tell them things which were necessary for them to know, or collect papers, or bring them papers for signature. </sentence><sentence id="2475">It was a bit of an awkward program, although it worked very well. </sentence><sentence id="2476">Or they could go into Salzburg, where there papers were held. </sentence><sentence id="2477">It was not an easy situation actually because we were always worried that there might be Russians around trying to pick up people because sometimes we had Russian army officers who were Jewish. </sentence><sentence id="2478">For example, a woman came to me one day dressed almost in rags with dyed hair looking very ugly, and she said her husband and daughter were in Palestine. </sentence><sentence id="2479">She was a doctor in the Russian army, and there was a certificate for Palestine for her at the British consulate, could we help her? </sentence><sentence id="2480">Well, the first thing you think is, "A ha! </sentence><sentence id="2481">She's a spy. </sentence><sentence id="2482">She wants to see what we're doing." </sentence><sentence id="2483">And I took all her particulars and I went across to the British consulate, and sure enough there was a certificate, but that wasn't enough as far as I was concerned. </sentence><sentence id="2484">I contacted friends who were working with the Jewish agency for Palestine, told them the story, and asked them to check in Palestine that she did indeed have a husband and a daughter there, because one never knew how honest these people were. </sentence><sentence id="2485">There were many ways by which you could trick somebody, and the answer eventually came back that yes, her husband and daughter were there and they confirmed her story. </sentence><sentence id="2486">Now, how was I to get her out? </sentence><sentence id="2487">She had to come at times when very few people were around. </sentence><sentence id="2488">I had to try and do everything so that she wouldn't be seen, and eventually I got her certificate, and how to send her to the airport which was in the Russian zone? </sentence><sentence id="2489">And the only way to do it was to take her myself, and don't think I wasn't scared. </sentence><sentence id="2490">I'm not so brave, but she sat in the car with me and we handed in her papers, and my propesk, my permit to go into the Russian zone, and we put her on a plane. </sentence><sentence id="2491">And there were others. </sentence><sentence id="2492">I had a young woman who was working at the Polish consulate, who had a brother in Canada. </sentence><sentence id="2493">My goodness, my memory's going back, and she said she had a visa to go to Canada, and again, I was suspicious, and checked her out in the same way. </sentence><sentence id="2494">I checked through the consulate and then I checked with the agency, the Jewish agency working in Montreal, and they confirmed her story, and she told the Poles at that time she was going on vacation, and off she went to Canada. </sentence><sentence id="2495">It was tricky doing this because you were always suspicious that perhaps these people were not genuine, and that you might be picked up yourself on the street because people were being picked up, particularly by the Russians. </sentence><sentence id="2496">People would be walking along and suddenly a car would stop, and like a  gangster film, people would be whisked off and not seen again. </sentence><sentence id="2497">It never happened to any of us. </sentence><sentence id="2498">I'm just adding drama to the story, I guess. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2526">Q: Who were they picking up? </sentence><sentence id="2527">Who were they looking for? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2530">A: Ihave no idea. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2532">Q: You don't know? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2534">A: No idea, perhaps they were Russians who'd defected, could be. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2536">Q: Now, this Russian woman who had been a doctor in the army, why did you have to bring her into your offices when very few people were there? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2538">A: I didn't want her to be seen. </sentence><sentence id="2539">Maybe I was scared, but I thought the less people who knew of her or who saw her, the better. </sentence><sentence id="2540">I remember her name. </sentence><sentence id="2541">Her name was Hasia Rapaport, and I remember it very distinctly. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2546">Q: Did you ever meet her later on? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2548">A: No, no. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2550">Q: Were you also nervous that people who would see her might denounce her to somebody? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="2552">I mean, that there was- </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2553">A: Well, they couldn't because they didn't -- she liked look any other poor person in Vienna. </sentence><sentence id="2554">She had dyed red hair, and very -- dressed very ordinarily, and heaven knows where she got her clothes from. </sentence><sentence id="2555">She wasn't in uniform when she came to my office. </sentence><sentence id="2556">She was too sensible for that, and she had guts actually to come to the office, but her story was true. </sentence><sentence id="2557">And I remember the Polish person, and often when we go to -- out in the evening in Vienna, we would meet Russian officers who were Jews in the Russian army who were not going to defect. </sentence><sentence id="2558">They were Russians, but when you had a husband and a daughter in Palestine, of course, you were going to defect if you could. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2565">Q: How did the husband and the daughter get to Palestine? </sentence><sentence id="2566">Do you know? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2569">A: They must have gone when war started, or before war started. </sentence><sentence id="2570">I have no idea. </sentence><sentence id="2571">I didn't ask her that question, but they probably went -- that's right, they couldn't have gone legally. </sentence><sentence id="2572">They must have gone the long way around -- the land route as we call it, go through Siberia, and then make their way down. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2577">Q: Did you ever have a circumstance where the story was really not true and you had to say no to somebody? </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2578">A: No, I don't remember such a story. </sentence><sentence id="2579">I don't think they would've had the guts to come to us because they didn't know how we respond, I think. </sentence><sentence id="2580">They may have been -- we had Germans who tried to pass themselves off as displaced persons, as Jews, in order to get to the United States, and sometimes somebody, let's say, at Bremen when they'd pass and they had their visa, would recognize them as having been in a concentration camp, had been one of the workers there, and of course they had to be imprisoned for their own safety, but we discovered very early on that when a German held up his arms, his blood group number was tattooed under his arm. </sentence><sentence id="2581">So, if we were suspicious, we could ask the doctor or somebody to examine him, but I'm sure Germans got through as Jewish displaced persons and probably lived a life as Jews. </sentence><sentence id="2582">People try all kinds of things and get away with it. </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2583">Q: Are there any other situations in Austria you would like to tell us about before we move to your next? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2585">A: Well, some of the things we did in Austria, we had to use our wits. </sentence><sentence id="2586">I think that's essentially the thing. </sentence><sentence id="2587">For example, I don't know if I had told you earlier about the people who had visas for Uruguay? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2591">Q: No, tell us. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2593">A: And I knew that their relatives actually were living in Para--I beg your pardon in the Argentine. </sentence><sentence id="2594">Well, obviously, the Argentine at that time was not giving visas to Jews, and so the relatives over there were sensible or smart, they got visas for Paraguay and we would get transit visas for the Argentine that one could get, and when they got to the Argentine, they had ways of whisking them off. </sentence><sentence id="2595">So, I remember I would sometimes have to go up to Prague because that's where the consulate was, and I remember having a large family of about 13 people -- Schmuck Lieberman and another name. </sentence><sentence id="2596">I don't remember them now. </sentence><sentence id="2597">And I went into the consulate, and they weren't very ready to give visas because they consuls made their living, in a way, from the visa fees they charged. </sentence><sentence id="2598">You know, they were honorary consuls; they weren't civil servants. </sentence><sentence id="2599">And so I would go in and very brazenly say, "Of course, I know your secretary will have to work extra time, and if there's anything we could do to compensate for that we would be very happy." </sentence><sentence id="2600">My way of offering a bribe, which was gladly accepted, and I would get these visas, and very discreetly in an envelope leave my payment and walk out. </sentence><sentence id="2601">But, you see, people who hadn't been used to having to -- what's the word? -- </sentence><sentence id="2602">find their way, wouldn't do this kind of thing, and I remember the very nice woman who was running the Prague office for the American Joint was astounded that I could come to her within one day and show her that Thad 13 visas. " </sentence><sentence id="2603">You must have paid," she said. </sentence><sentence id="2604">I said, "Who would dream of paying?" </sentence><sentence id="2605">You couldn't even tell your own what you were doing because if they didn't know themselves how to do it, you could never teach them how. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2619">Q: How do you think you picked this up? </sentence><sentence id="2620">Knowing how to arrange things, because you're right, people say, "I don't pay for things. </sentence><sentence id="2621">I don't barter for things. </sentence><sentence id="2622">I simply do-" </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2623">A: Well, you had to know. </sentence><sentence id="2624">I think you knew you had to do something. </sentence><sentence id="2625">You had to get these visas. </sentence><sentence id="2626">You had to get these people out, and if you couldn't do it by being honest, since the Argentineans weren't offering visas, you had to do it dishonestly. </sentence><sentence id="2627">I didn't think I was doing anything dishonest because I was helping people to join relatives, and you thought of a thousand ways. </sentence><sentence id="2628">How did people survive who didn't land in concentration camp, if they didn't think of a thousand ruses to survive? </sentence><sentence id="2629">And I suppose this is part of it. </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2630">Q: So, but there is a difference because you said a number of times that you didn't want to do anything that was illegal. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2632">A: Not if I could help it. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2634">Q: Right. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2636">A: But, when I had to get visas for the Argentine, transit visas, and I knew that the only way to get them was for the relatives to get the Paraguayan visas, there was no problem, and if I knew, as I did, that the consul was not anxious even to give transit visas to Jews, then you had to get them by other means. </sentence><sentence id="2637">I mean, look at the people who landed up in Shanghai, before and during the war. </sentence><sentence id="2638">They had no more intention of staying in Shanghai then you or I would have had, but this was their way of getting out of Germany. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2642">Q: How did you distinguish between what was illegal and what was just sort of pushing the envelope? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2644">A: I never even thought about what was legal or illegal. </sentence><sentence id="2645">I did everything to my knowledge legally, but when I had to help families get to a country that didn't want them, but I knew they relatives could help them to stay there, and the general community wasn't against them coming in, why not? </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2707">A: No, no, no, this was generally done, and I've got, you know, the father with the beard, and they would have many kids with them, and I'm sure many of those children were not their own, but how could you prove it. </sentence><sentence id="2708">They had no original documents with them. </sentence><sentence id="2709">They probably were children of relatives, and why should I ask questions? </sentence><sentence id="2710">We were saving young lives. </sentence><sentence id="2711">It was something one took for granted, one did. </sentence><sentence id="2712">During the war, the kinds of things we did in Britain, you never thought of yourself as being anything special. </sentence><sentence id="2713">You just did it. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2733">A: Mixed. </sentence><sentence id="2734">Some of the men were older, quite a bit older, but it's interesting. </sentence><sentence id="2735">I never thought of age in those days. </sentence><sentence id="2736">I never thought that somebody was older or younger. </sentence><sentence id="2737">Occasionally,  you would find you came into an office like when I came into Vienna, and there was a man working there much older than I who was very entrepreneurial, and I didn't trust him any further than I could throw a grand piano, and I knew I had to get rid of him. </sentence><sentence id="2738">And it took a little time, but very graciously, we paid him off and got him out because he was dishonest. </sentence><sentence id="2739">He was taking money from people to get them visas, and that, to me, was anathema. </sentence><sentence id="2740">So, I won't tell you his name. </sentence><sentence id="2741">I remember it. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2751">Q: You do, but you won't tell right? </sentence><sentence id="2752">So, what happened in 1948? </sentence><sentence id="2753">You then got - </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2757">A: Oh, in 1948, this was an interesting year. </sentence><sentence id="2758">The Americans passed the Displaced Persons Act, the first one where displaced persons if they had job and housing assurances, could get visas for the United States. </sentence><sentence id="2759">It didn't depend on which country they had lived. </sentence><sentence id="2760">In other words, it wasn't a quota system. </sentence><sentence id="2761">And this was fascinating because, one day, I don't know if it was a Friday or a Saturday, we were in the office -- I must say we didn't know whether it was Monday or Tuesday or Saturday or Sunday when we worked -- Mr. Gruzo and Henry Rosenfeld and some others from the Displaced Persons Commission in Washington appeared in my office, charming gentleman. </sentence><sentence id="2762">They were ready to issue visas under the Displaced Persons Act. </sentence><sentence id="2763">Well, I assure you that none of the voluntary agency personnel of all the agencies knew the first thing about what we were supposed to have had, but they were ready to issue visas. </sentence><sentence id="2764">And so, I said to them, "Unfortunately, my job and housing assurances are at the printers, but if you'd write one out for me. </sentence><sentence id="2765">I'll take it over to the allianz gebaude," which was the American building where they had mimeograph machines, "I'll get some printed out, and you can start work." </sentence><sentence id="2766">And so they were very nice gentlemen. </sentence><sentence id="2767">They wrote it down. </sentence><sentence id="2768">I took it over, and came back with 50 or 60, and we took the cases in my office and everyone they thought was eligible, I gave a job and housing assurance to, and pumps!, </sentence><sentence id="2769">a few days later they were issuing the visas. </sentence><sentence id="2770">The next day, or perhaps that evening, I called our Munich office of the American Joint and told the man who was director there what we were doing and gave him the wording so that when these people arrived in Munich, they would be ready, and quite a number of people got visas. </sentence><sentence id="2771">In about ten days, a message came through from the United States from the United Service for New Americans, which was our cooperating agency. </sentence><sentence id="2772">They contacted all the communities in the United States where there were relatives and actually arranged the immigration of relatives to relatives or of people without relatives to people who were offering them jobs and housing. </sentence><sentence id="2773">They were very efficient. </sentence><sentence id="2774">But they cabled our Paris office saying, "What Amy Zahl is doing is illegal. </sentence><sentence id="2775">Tell her to stop immediately." </sentence><sentence id="2776">And Harold Trobe who was director of the joint operation in Austria called me and said, "Amy, I've had this cable." </sentence><sentence id="2777">And I said, "Hmm, very interesting. </sentence><sentence id="2778">We will stop." </sentence><sentence id="2779">And, of course, what I did, I went into the American Consulate where they were very cooperative, let me put it that way, it was a very nice consul. </sentence><sentence id="2780">Sometimes the consuls were not at all cooperative. </sentence><sentence id="2781">In times when life was a stake before the war, the consuls were not very cooperative, but these people were very helpful. </sentence><sentence id="2782">I looked through all the Jewish cases I could find whether they were registered with the Joint Distribution Committee or with HIAS (ph), or not registered with an agency, and gave them all job and housing assurances, and then I stopped. </sentence><sentence id="2783">Now, what happened as a result was these people got  visas. </sentence><sentence id="2784">They were sent up to Bremen, and they were on the ships going to the States in larger numbers than non-Jews sponsored by non-Jewish agencies because they hadn't had this first encounter with the Displaced Persons Commission, and the press in New York was rather anti-Semitic, you know, "only Jews are getting visas." </sentence><sentence id="2785">You can look up the press at the time and see these notices. </sentence><sentence id="2786">What we did, of course, was to tell the Christian agencies what we had done, told them what the wording was so they could get started, but I think we had more support from our agency than they had from theirs. </sentence><sentence id="2787">I know when it came to children, for example, I was always horrified both when I was in Austria and later in Germany to find children -- and, when I say children, I mean youngsters under 18 -- still either in hostels or in camps. </sentence><sentence id="2788">Although the American -- I've got the name of the agency, the refugee agency taking care of orphans -- was working, they were working very slowly, and I just couldn't bear the thought that there were kids without families still sitting in Austria and this is what? </sentence><sentence id="2789">18 months after the war ended. </sentence><sentence id="2790">And so, what we would do is take these children and take them away from the other agency, and get them visas to go to the States. </sentence><sentence id="2791">It was exciting in that you thought you were helping people, and because we could work so efficiently, we saw the results in a very short time. </sentence><sentence id="2792">When I finished the first batch in Austria, Dr. Schwartz came to me again in the October of *46, and said would I go into Germany and take over the operation there? </sentence><sentence id="2793">With working very successfully in Austria and I had very good assistance working in the Vienna office. </sentence><sentence id="2794">Everybody was strained. </sentence><sentence id="2795">I always worked as though I was leaving tomorrow. </sentence><sentence id="2796">It was a good way to work because it meant if I wanted to take time off, the office would function, the files would be working, and I felt that none of us should try to make ourselves indispensable. </sentence><sentence id="2797">We, after all, were working to save people's lives. </sentence><sentence id="2798">I always felt that. </sentence><sentence id="2799">And so, on October the 28") 1948, I came up into Munich, which was the head office for the German operation, and there was chaos. </sentence><sentence id="2800">The staff there were on strike. </sentence><sentence id="2801">About 200 letters a day were coming in from the States because the American operations, as I mentioned earlier, were very efficient, and there was nobody working. </sentence><sentence id="2802">They were on strike. </sentence><sentence id="2803">They wanted better pay. </sentence><sentence id="2804">I was horrified. </sentence><sentence id="2805">I came into the office and a young woman, an American, Gladys Roth, was running the office at that time, and I wanted her to take over the volkcaserna (ph), where people went in order to get processed for America. </sentence><sentence id="2806">She was a very efficient worker, very sympathetic, spoke excellent Hungarian, spoke some German, and was a good worker. </sentence><sentence id="2807">She too felt you had to help these people to get out -- a wonderful sense of humor, by the way. </sentence><sentence id="2808">She was a lifesaver. </sentence><sentence id="2809">And I called these people together who were on strike, and I said I would look into their salary claims, but not unless they came back to work because what they were doing was stopping people leaving and they themselves were being stopped from leaving. </sentence><sentence id="2810">So, this doesn't make sense to me. </sentence><sentence id="2811">And I said, "I'll expect you all in the office tomorrow morning." </sentence><sentence id="2812">I went to the office in the morning and there was some staff, and the next morning there were a few more, and I let word out that if the rest didn't come back to work by the end of the week I was going to employ new people. </sentence><sentence id="2813">They were all back. </sentence><sentence id="2814">There were some troublemakers. </sentence><sentence id="2815">For example, the way they had been operating was if people had to go to Paris to pick up transit visas, they would hire coaches on the trains, and two of the boys who worked in the office would go on the train to Paris. </sentence><sentence id="2816">Well, you know what this leaves them open to. </sentence><sentence id="2817">They could take cigarettes. </sentence><sentence id="2818">They could do bribes. </sentence><sentence id="2819">I don't know what they did, but I knew  this had to stop, and I let it go on for a little while. </sentence><sentence id="2820">You don't change things immediately, and one day I said, "You know, we have to let these people really go out on their own so that they face the world for the first time. </sentence><sentence id="2821">So, let's try one train without you on it." </sentence><sentence id="2822">Well, no, they found a thousand reasons, but I was very firm and the first train went off, and was successful. </sentence><sentence id="2823">And then I announced that no more would we have to accompany these people. </sentence><sentence id="2824">That was my way of handling that, and then in December, they decided to go on strike again. </sentence><sentence id="2825">I was in trouble because I didn't know what I could offer. </sentence><sentence id="2826">Sam Haber was running the operation. </sentence><sentence id="2827">He was a tough guy to cope with, and I said I would see them the next day, and talk to them. </sentence><sentence id="2828">I came to the office, and there was not a soul in sight. </sentence><sentence id="2829">And I felt, "I have failed." </sentence><sentence id="2830">I was so horrified, and what could I do, and my office was on the third floor of this building, and I went up to the office and I opened the door and there was a great big shout, "Happy Birthday!" </sentence><sentence id="2831">I had forgotten it was my birthday, and they were all up there. </sentence><sentence id="2832">I wept. </sentence><sentence id="2833">I was so astounded to find them all there, and friends, obviously they were now my friends. </sentence><sentence id="2834">I've still got the birthday card they made me out of a manila folder, that big and they'd all signed it, and that was wonderful. </sentence><sentence id="2835">From then on, we got along very well. </sentence><sentence id="2836">The men who had accompanied the people to Paris, I helped to immigrate very quickly. </sentence><sentence id="2837">I thought that was the best thing for them. </sentence><sentence id="2838">And I tried not to employ people who would have to immigrate now. </sentence><sentence id="2839">The Czechs -- you may not know this historically, you may know it better than I -- had thrown out the volksdeutsch, and there were some lovely young people amongst those who came into Germany who, through no fault of their own, were thrown out as revenge, and I employed some of these girls. </sentence><sentence id="2840">I made sure they hadn't been members of the BDM, the Bund Deutscher Mddel, and by the way, it was easy to check it because the Germans were so methodical, they had lists. </sentence><sentence id="2841">So, I employed these people, but then the rabbis were insulted. </sentence><sentence id="2842">I was employing non-Jews when Jews needed jobs, and I met with them, and I said, "My job is to get the Jews out of here who don't belong here, and the only way I can do that is to employ non-Jews who are clean and let the others get out." </sentence><sentence id="2843">Some of these girls married Jewish boys. </sentence><sentence id="2844">They were lovely girls, and they worked very efficiently, but these were some of the hurdles one had to cope with. </sentence><sentence id="2845">The rabbis were always watching that we did the right thing. </sentence><sentence id="2846">For example, I had permission to send what we called "highly pregnant women", women in their eighth month, by air to the States because if they couldn't leave and they had babies, they couldn't go on these cargo -- not cargo, these military ships and the visa might expire. </sentence><sentence id="2847">It was only good for four months. </sentence><sentence id="2848">I had an arrangement with Air France. </sentence><sentence id="2849">For every ten people I put on a plane, I got one free seat. </sentence><sentence id="2850">And so these women would come to me, you know, "I'm in my ninth month." " </sentence><sentence id="2851">I'm in my eighth month." </sentence><sentence id="2852">And I got to the stage when I could look at a woman, and say, "You're seven and a half months pregnant. </sentence><sentence id="2853">You have time." </sentence><sentence id="2854">It was very funny because we played jokes together. </sentence><sentence id="2855">I'm just remembering this. </sentence><sentence id="2856">We sent a lot of people by air. </sentence><sentence id="2857">Now, some of the ships sailed on a Saturday and the Orthodox Jews would not sail on Saturday. </sentence><sentence id="2858">Some of the planes went on Friday evening. </sentence><sentence id="2859">We made arrangements with the captains of the planes and the captains of the ships. </sentence><sentence id="2860">On the planes, the passengers were allowed to embark before the Sabbath came in, therefore it was their home. </sentence><sentence id="2861">They were allowed to get onto the ship the day before the Sabbath, so that this already was their home, and there was no problem. </sentence><sentence id="2862">But, you had to think of all kinds of things to stop people from staying behind. </sentence><sentence id="2863">Occasionally, you'd have somebody  who was having a pair of trousers made, and therefore he couldn't leave. </sentence><sentence id="2864">It wasn't that he was having trousers made. </sentence><sentence id="2865">In a sense, a lot of these people were scared to leave. </sentence><sentence id="2866">I think that's what I thought about them, and so I would call his tailor and if he was having trousers made, I used to tell him, "You have to have them by tonight because otherwise he's going to lose his visa." </sentence><sentence id="2867">The tailors were usually pretty good. </sentence><sentence id="2868">They were either displaced pers- mostly displaced persons or Germans, and they knew what was happening and they would finish the pants, and these people would go on. </sentence><sentence id="2869">I only once met a man in New York when I was there who at some kind of gathering, he looked at me and said, "Zie haben mae swandon heir sukammen." ( </sentence><sentence id="2870">ph) He was a German Jew who said I forced him to come to America, and his wife said, "Ignore him." </sentence><sentence id="2871">But, he was a man who was having pants made. </sentence><sentence id="2872">It was fascinating working with those people. </sentence><sentence id="2873">People had all kinds of excuses for not going, and I really felt they were scared. </sentence><sentence id="2874">After all, some of them were coming to relatives they haven't seen since before the war or they had never seen. </sentence><sentence id="2875">A mother's relative who had come a generation ago. </sentence><sentence id="2876">I can understand it. </sentence><sentence id="2877">I would be horrified to have to go to a relative who was going to support me who I didn't know, or my mother had told me stories they didn't like. </sentence><sentence id="2878">It was fascinating, fascinating, but you had to get -- firstly, you had to get these people out of Germany. </sentence><sentence id="2879">They were not wanted in Germany. </sentence><sentence id="2880">There was no future for them in Germany. </sentence><sentence id="2881">And secondly, one knew that once they got to the States, they could begin to rebuild for themselves and the new children they had. </sentence><sentence id="2882">It was fortunate that so many of them did have children because this gave them a future. </sentence><sentence id="2883">They were concerned for their children, and that was one of the reasons for leaving. </sentence><sentence id="2884">We also had situations where non-Jews had helped Jews in hiding, and I remember Andre Bulova's sister, Bulova watch company, his sister was a Mrs. Godem (ph) came to see me, and for some reason, she liked me. </sentence><sentence id="2885">She said, "Do you have people you would like to help and you can't." </sentence><sentence id="2886">I said, "Yes, I've got heads of families who are non-Jews." </sentence><sentence id="2887">And we essentially helped families where the head of the family was a Jew because they would fit into a new community. </sentence><sentence id="2888">She said, "I will give you affidavits worth a million dollars each, and you send them to my brother and we will find jobs for them." </sentence><sentence id="2889">And there was one man who had hidden his wife through the war, and he did beautiful work, enamel on silver, and he brought in several -- I shall never forget this -- several small dishes in a way to show me of work he did. </sentence><sentence id="2890">It was all very beautiful, and when I told Mrs. Godem, because she would come back and forth, she said, "He can do watch covers. </sentence><sentence id="2891">My brother would be very pleased to see him." </sentence><sentence id="2892">And this man said to me, "Which one do you like the best?" </sentence><sentence id="2893">Well, I knew he was saying to me, "I will give you that one." </sentence><sentence id="2894">I said, "They're all beautiful." </sentence><sentence id="2895">I wouldn't admire any, and the only gift I ever have or had from a survivor or from a refugee was a dish he sent to me. </sentence><sentence id="2896">He knew I wouldn't take it. </sentence><sentence id="2897">We allowed them to bring flowers to the office, and sometimes it looked like a mortuary, there were so many flowers, but gifts were forbidden because gifts lead to bribes. </sentence><sentence id="2898">But I have at home still this lovely tray he gave me. </sentence><sentence id="2899">It's a dish about six inches in diameter, St.George and the Dragon. </sentence><sentence id="2900">I think he must have made it for me. </sentence><sentence id="2901">And, they did very well in the States. </sentence><sentence id="2902">We had some wonderful people, we really did, who immigrated to the States, and America is richer for them. </sentence><sentence id="2903">It really is. </sentence><sentence id="2904">The operation in Germany went quite successfully, I would say, because we got all the offices to work in the same fashion. </sentence><sentence id="2905">We set up some of the filing systems. </sentence><sentence id="2906">When we had people from Austria who came into  Germany, we had the same system for handing them. </sentence><sentence id="2907">There was one case of a young man who I sent ostensibly to the States via Germany. </sentence><sentence id="2908">His name was Miklaus Rezmowitz. </sentence><sentence id="2909">He was Hungarian. </sentence><sentence id="2910">I had found him on the streets in Vienna, and what I did, I got the Joint office to set up a small hostel for me where if I put kids there, they had a whole sheet to themselves on the bed, and I tried to find them jobs, and I tried to get them out of the country as soon as possible. </sentence><sentence id="2911">And I sent Mickey through Germany to the States. </sentence><sentence id="2912">When I came to Germany 18 months later, somebody told me -- because there always was a grapevine -- that Mickey was working in a garage in Munich and I was horrified. </sentence><sentence id="2913">This sweet little boy, to me he was a baby. </sentence><sentence id="2914">And I got him to come to my office and he told me when he got to Munich, for some reason something happened and the visa wasn't picked up and nobody helped him, and he didn't want to write and tell me because I'd been so kind to him, and so he let his visa lapse. </sentence><sentence id="2915">Well, I started immediately to work on his visa, and discovered he had a brother in Sweden. </sentence><sentence id="2916">I may have mentioned to you that even to this day, people are finding relatives. </sentence><sentence id="2917">His brother had escaped to Sweden and was there, and I decided when I eventually got Mickey's visa, I would bring the brother in from Sweden. </sentence><sentence id="2918">Eventually, we got a visa for Mickey, and I got his brother to come and we put him up in our apartment -- I was sharing an apartment with three, two other girls, and the next morning we brought the brother to the office -- I've got pictures of him -- and where was Mickey? </sentence><sentence id="2919">He was no where to be found. </sentence><sentence id="2920">He was out philandering somewhere, and when I brought him to the office, and he met his brother for the first time since they were both taken away, you can imagine the scene. </sentence><sentence id="2921">It was wonderful. </sentence><sentence id="2922">I then met Mickey again in New York, and he told me he was so appreciative of what America did for him, he was joining the army. </sentence><sentence id="2923">It was the Korean war, and I've never heard from him since. </sentence><sentence id="2924">So, I'm going to the museum in Washington tomorrow to see if I, hopefully, don't find him on the list that I should look at. </sentence><sentence id="2925">But there were some wonderful stories. </sentence><sentence id="2926">As I say, I've got pictures of these two brothers in my office. </sentence><sentence id="2927">There were some wonderful stories, and the older men I employed in the office, some of them had come back from Shanghai, took care of these youngsters for me, and behaved like fathers, you know, made sure they were in on time. </sentence><sentence id="2928">It just was a very nice atmosphere in that place and made it easy to work. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3102">Q: Was this a much bigger operation that you had in Austria? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3104">A: A much, much bigger. </sentence><sentence id="3105">Most of the displaced persons in Germany were in the American zone of Germany. </sentence><sentence id="3106">It was a much bigger operation. </sentence><sentence id="3107">I can tell you some interesting stories of things that happened because people think the camps were liberated and suddenly there were no more camps, but there were the displaced persons camps, and let's say people wanted to get to Canada, but how? </sentence><sentence id="3108">They were ineligible for the United States because they didn't fit in with the criterion which was necessary to immigrate to the United States, and Canada would be offering a scheme to bring in tailors, or furriers. </sentence><sentence id="3109">Well, the ORT organization was wonderful in Germany. </sentence><sentence id="3110">We got doctors and lawyers to train as furriers. </sentence><sentence id="3111">They could operate the same machines and they passed the exam, and came to Canada, and they worked as doctors and as lawyers. </sentence><sentence id="3112">They took their exams again, and they were of benefit to Canada. </sentence><sentence id="3113">Canada was foolish in many instances because they were looking for brawn. </sentence><sentence id="3114">They weren't looking for brain. </sentence><sentence id="3115">America was much more  aware of what was available because of the kinds of refugees they had taken in at the beginning or before the war, and so America got all kinds, but Canada took a long time to wake up. </sentence><sentence id="3116">But what we would do again -- we wanted it to help these people get out and if all they were taken was furriers, well you train these people as furriers, and they came to Canada. </sentence><sentence id="3117">I don't think the consuls knew. </sentence><sentence id="3118">I'm sure that the people in Canada knew what we were doing, but you know, you'd get out 25 families at a time. </sentence><sentence id="3119">It was wonderful. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3136">Q: So, who would do this training? </sentence><sentence id="3137">Did you say to the DP camp personnel, "In order to get this people out, train them as such and such"? </sentence><sentence id="3138">How would that work? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3142">A: Okay, good question. </sentence><sentence id="3143">If we heard, because we all were constantly being fed information that the Canadian government was looking for 50 furriers. </sentence><sentence id="3144">We would pass word to the representative of the Joint in the camp that the Canadians were looking for 50 furriers. </sentence><sentence id="3145">He knew through discussion with us that what these people had to be able to show the representatives of the government was that they knew how to operate the sewing machine that took fur, that they knew how to cut fur, or they knew how to stitch, and by golly, the ORT representative in the camp really showed them how. </sentence><sentence id="3146">They trained very quickly, and when they came for the exams, they passed perfectly. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3152">Q: So, how were these people chosen do you think? </sentence><sentence id="3153">Do you have any idea? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3156">A: They volunteered. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3158">Q: Isee. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3160">A: If a doctor was hoping that he could go somewhere and work as a doctor, but saw that it was useless, he'd go anywhere because he knew once he got to that new country, he could take exams again and work in his profession. </sentence><sentence id="3161">People were not afraid to do the dirtiest menial work in order to get out of Germany, number one, and secondly, they wanted to set up a new life and start life again. </sentence><sentence id="3162">So, they were very ready to do anything that they could do to get out. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3166">Q: Now, was ORT the major or the only organization in the DP camps training people or were there a number of different kinds? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3168">A: In the Jewish camps, and it was mainly ORT, I don't know of another organization that was working. </sentence><sentence id="3169">ORT trained people in mechanics. </sentence><sentence id="3170">They trained -- they still work today, by the way. </sentence><sentence id="3171">That organization was started in Russia, I think, after the First World War. </sentence><sentence id="3172">It's an extraordinary organization. </sentence><sentence id="3173">It still works around the world. </sentence><sentence id="3174">It was the ORT which had many, many training centers set up. </sentence><sentence id="3175">They had good people. </sentence><sentence id="3176">Very often they were displaced persons who were experts in their field training other displaced persons. </sentence><sentence id="3177">They were very well organized and they did a beautiful job. </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3178">Q: Because a lot of the people who were in the DP camps were too young to have even gotten a profession. </sentence><sentence id="3179">Right? </sentence><sentence id="3180">They had gone through their teenage years sometimes, late teenage years, and hadn't finished. </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3181">A: People who were in displaced persons camps, there were very few who were teenagers. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3183">Q: No, but their teenage years may have been through the war. </sentence><sentence id="3184">So, they may have lost their last couple of years of school. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3187">A: They may have. </sentence><sentence id="3188">Yes, they may have been in their twenties. </sentence><sentence id="3189">They certainly had lost schooling. </sentence><sentence id="3190">They didn't have formal education. </sentence><sentence id="3191">There weren't too many individual young people. </sentence><sentence id="3192">There weren't too many families with children who were in their twenties. </sentence><sentence id="3193">Families were decimated, you have to remember, totally decimated, and if there -- excuse me -- if there were young people, they were individuals, and you're quite right, they had lost their schooling. </sentence><sentence id="3194">They had no training. </sentence><sentence id="3195">Firstly, they hadn't been to college. </sentence><sentence id="3196">They hadn't gone to technical school, and they had no training in occupations. </sentence><sentence id="3197">ORT was a Godsend. </sentence><sentence id="3198">ORT was a Godsend to them. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3211">Q: Let me ask you something about the young women who were having babies. </sentence><sentence id="3212">There was a letter written by Kaufman who was the head of the Jewish Agency for Palestine who apparently visited the DP camps, and wrote, whether rightly or wrongly, that these young women who were having babies don't know how to be mothers, we have to send women here to train these young women because these babies are coming and they don't know what to do or they don't even want to. </sentence><sentence id="3213">Did you find in the DP camps where you were visiting that this was not an easy time? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3217">A: Well, first thing, we had social workers in the camps. </sentence><sentence id="3218">Secondly, this gentleman wasn't aware, perhaps, that these young women had lost their mothers who normally would've helped them through this period, and there were no older women around who'd had babies. </sentence><sentence id="3219">They had been killed off. </sentence><sentence id="3220">But they soon learned. </sentence><sentence id="3221">These women had mother's instinct. </sentence><sentence id="3222">They were so thrilled to have babies, to start again. </sentence><sentence id="3223">The men who were their husbands, because there was no license there, there weren't women who weren't married having babies. </sentence><sentence id="3224">These were young women who were married and having children, starting a life again, starting a family again. </sentence><sentence id="3225">They were very careful. </sentence><sentence id="3226">I think they all cared. </sentence><sentence id="3227">Some of them probably were better than others, but even in our society, we have women who are better than others in rearing children. </sentence><sentence id="3228">But it was wonderful for us when they first started to get pregnant, because while they were incarcerated or in hiding, most women didn't even menstruate. </sentence><sentence id="3229">They only started to menstruate again when they were free. </sentence><sentence id="3230">It's an interesting phenomenon how nature takes care of itself. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3245">Q: Do you know -- do we know about how long it took for women to start menstruating again? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3247">A: Yes, I think it must have been more than a year, even up to two years. </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3248">Q: That long? </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3249">A: Yes. </sentence><sentence id="3250">It was more than a year because I remember being in the camps in Germany when there was much rejoicing and we had to order from the States these sanitary napkins for the women and condoms, by the way, because women were getting pregnant. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3253">Q: So, there were not condoms in the beginning? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3255">A: No. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3257">Q: No, right. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3259">A: Where would the condoms come from? </sentence><sentence id="3260">They were ordered, which was rather nice. </sentence><sentence id="3261">You know, you -- I had never thought of that. </sentence><sentence id="3262">Who ever thinks of that kind of thing? </sentence><sentence id="3263">You know, a single girl brought up properly, but it was wonderful that they were even thinking about planning their families. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3269">Q: So, did they ask for condoms? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3271">A: I would assume so. </sentence><sentence id="3272">They didn't ask of me, and I didn't officially know of this. </sentence><sentence id="3273">I knew from the other people working in the camps that this was happening. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3277">Q: So, people were trying to be very careful knowing that- </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3279">A: Yeah, if they had one baby, they didn't want another baby immediately. </sentence><sentence id="3280">After all, they were no grandparents who were going to rejoice in these children. </sentence><sentence id="3281">There were no families that were going to help them bring up these children. </sentence><sentence id="3282">They were going into a new world all on their own, and a lot of these people in the camps wanted to go to the United States. </sentence><sentence id="3283">They did not want to go to Palestine. </sentence><sentence id="3284">I'm talking before the State of Israel. </sentence><sentence id="3285">They very definitely wanted to go to the United States because a large percentage of them had family in the States, a large percentage, and I think they wanted to get away as far as they could from the Russians and away from Europe and the Middle East. </sentence><sentence id="3286">That was another factor. </sentence><sentence id="3287">And America still held out the dream for a lot of these people. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3297">Q: Was there -- from what you remember as opposed to what you know from history -- do you remember a tension between Zionists and non-Zionists, because clearly the Zionists wanted people to say they wanted to go to Palestine. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3299">A: There was a lot of tension. </sentence><sentence id="3300">There was a lot of tension between the non-Zionists and the Zionists. </sentence><sentence id="3301">Some people were almost forced to go to Palestine. </sentence><sentence id="3302">I know I would give people letters to say they were registered with me for the United States so that they could not be forced onto a transport to Palestine. </sentence><sentence id="3303">Remember also, at this time, there was a lot of illegal immigration into Palestine and these people didn't want to go. </sentence><sentence id="3304">They'd suffered enough  from their point of view. </sentence><sentence id="3305">They had not been Zionists because if their parents had been Zionists, they would have left Poland before the war and gone to Palestine. </sentence><sentence id="3306">When one thinks of it, very few Jews really were going to Palestine from Poland, where there was tremendous poverty, tremendous anti-Semitism, long before the Hitler regime, and they didn't go. </sentence><sentence id="3307">It was a very difficult time for a lot of people, but it was a political situation and they were pushing these people to go. </sentence><sentence id="3308">I was never in favor of it, I must say. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3319">Q: Do you remember Ben-Gurion visiting the DP camps? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3321">A: He came. </sentence><sentence id="3322">Yes, he came up into the British zone. </sentence><sentence id="3323">I didn't see him, but I remember that he came and in certain camps where, for example, Yosele Rosensaft was heading the camp at Belsen. </sentence><sentence id="3324">Yosele who was getting everybody to go to Palestine except he. </sentence><sentence id="3325">He came to the United States with his wife. </sentence><sentence id="3326">Ben-Gurion was up there. </sentence><sentence id="3327">What Ben-Gurion did arrange was that some of the children who had survived who the Zionists and Belsen would not allow to come to England, Martin Gilbert has written a book about the boys, well these were some of the boys who might have been. </sentence><sentence id="3328">They were not allowing these kids to come but, Ben-Gurion spoke to Yosele and some others in the camp, and we did get a transport out of Belsen of youngsters to England, and these kids had sat there for so long, they were so ill so many of them because they wanted the men to go to Israel because they didn't like going to Spevan (ph), and they didn't like the British Government policy and so the kids suffered. </sentence><sentence id="3329">They were used as political pawns. </sentence><sentence id="3330">But Ben-Gurion, I must say, helped to ease that situation. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3341">Q: So, these people in obviously -- the war ends and life is hard as always. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3343">A: It resumes normally, politically among Jews who are Zionists and Jews who are not Zionists. </sentence><sentence id="3344">It resumes as it was before the war. </sentence><sentence id="3345">People don't change, situations change. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3349">Q: Were people taught English or were they taught other languages when they were coming to the United States? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3351">A: Yes, there were courses, and there were other courses run for people who were coming to the States or to English-speaking countries and numbers of refugees took advantage of that. </sentence><sentence id="3352">Once they knew they were going to get a visa, they were very good about learning to speak the language. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3355">Q: Were there a lot of, or some, breakdowns of people who could not adjust to the loss of not having a family, even if they got married? </sentence><sentence id="3356">Did you notice it? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3359">A: Well, there were people who were depressed. </sentence><sentence id="3360">There were people who were depressed, very understandably, when you found you had a young man who had seen his parents and brothers taken off and some policeman or another had pushed him to the side because they had known each other on the street, and saved him and he found our none of his family had survived. </sentence><sentence id="3361">A tremendous guilt feeling of being alive, and how do you help  people to get over that. </sentence><sentence id="3362">Some people never did or never have. </sentence><sentence id="3363">I know people who survived who have never gotten over the fact that they are the sole survivors of their family. </sentence><sentence id="3364">Sometimes they" I find a person who lived in the same town who went through a similar experience, and they are as close as brother and sister or brothers because they shared similar experience. </sentence><sentence id="3365">People are still suffering, and that's why I think, for many, many years, most of the people who survived the war were not able to tell their children of their experiences. </sentence><sentence id="3366">People say, "Well, why is it only now this is coming to light?" </sentence><sentence id="3367">It's been very hard to talk about it, very hard. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3377">Q: So, why do you think now? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3379">A: Now, because time has passed and the children are asking the right question. </sentence><sentence id="3380">The children are adult enough to be kind to their parents in the sense that they will ask the question kindly. </sentence><sentence id="3381">The grandchildren ask the questions, and they're gradually loosening up as well. </sentence><sentence id="3382">Some people have been for counseling. </sentence><sentence id="3383">Some didn't need the counseling. </sentence><sentence id="3384">Some needed to tell the story in order to ease their own souls, their own conscience. </sentence><sentence id="3385">People felt very guilty about remaining alive. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3393">Q: [Pause.] </sentence><sentence id="3394">How many people do you think you got out of Germany and Austria, if you had to put numbers on that? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3397">A: Well, I would think that we helped about 40,000 to get to the United States, and when you think that each one was an individual visa, nothing was en masse. </sentence><sentence id="3398">We worked seven days a week, all the hours that were given us, and we never thought of it at that time. </sentence><sentence id="3399">I used to skip out sometimes on a Sunday and go fishing, in fact. </sentence><sentence id="3400">I love trout fishing, and once I got caught fishing in illegal waters. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3405">Q: Is that your one illegal act? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3407">A: No, but a bottle of scotch handled that quite nicely. </sentence><sentence id="3408">We used to be able to buy scotch at seven and sixpence a bottle, which was just over a dollar. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3411">Q: Did you keep the trout and cook it? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3413">A: No, no, when we caught them, we threw them back. </sentence><sentence id="3414">That wasn't cricket. </sentence><sentence id="3415">You didn't keep the trout. </sentence><sentence id="3416">You just caught it and threw it back. </sentence><sentence id="3417">I didn't fish to have fish to eat. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3493">A: Oh, yes, and then I would take a group of people, let's say down to Genoa to get ona ship, and I would escort them to the border. </sentence><sentence id="3494">The police were wonderful at the Brenna (ph) Pass. </sentence><sentence id="3495">The Italians got to know me, and they would tell me, "The train's going to be a half hour, three-quarters of an hour late. </sentence><sentence id="3496">Why don't you go to bed, and when we know the train's coming, we'll wake you?" </sentence><sentence id="3497">And, so I'd go to the hotel, sometimes the train was an hour late, and somehow I'd hear the police shouting up at me or banging on the door, and I'd get up. </sentence><sentence id="3498">I had all the passports for these people, couldn't give passports out, and I would accompany them down to Genoa, and the catabaneri (ph) in Genoa were very good. </sentence><sentence id="3499">They'd invite me down to the docks, make sure that I had somebody with me, and take me to the hotel and make sure that I had my room with a side doors locked, because many hotels had rooms adjoining with doors that were unlocked. </sentence><sentence id="3500">They always made sure that the doors were locked before they would allow me into the hotels. </sentence><sentence id="3501">They were very nice people. </sentence><sentence id="3502">I was in Genoa maybe every three or four weeks. </sentence><sentence id="3503">There was a wonderful  woman working for the Joint there called Elia Eliaskovitch her name was. </sentence><sentence id="3504">She had come to Italy to study Anthropology before the war, got stuck there, and the catabaneri gave her a certificate to say that she was a Catholic. </sentence><sentence id="3505">She survived all through the war, Elka Eliaskovitch. </sentence><sentence id="3506">I lost touch with her, but she knew every consul in Genoa, and she would just take me. </sentence><sentence id="3507">We would get the visas that we needed and then she would take me down to the shipping agents because shipping was very difficult to get, and she would always manage to get shipping. </sentence><sentence id="3508">She was a wonderful woman. </sentence><sentence id="3509">She landed up I think in California, but I never heard from her after she left. </sentence><sentence id="3510">We did have some wonderful characters working in this total program. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3529">Q: So, you had to take all the passports together and put them en masse on the ship? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3531">A: No, no, what I did was I was getting the visas for all these people. </sentence><sentence id="3532">So, I needed all the passports together, and I couldn't give them back to the people because I wanted them all together and to go. </sentence><sentence id="3533">They only got their passports when they were getting on the ship. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3537">Q: Isee. </sentence><sentence id="3538">Okay, we're going to take another break. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3547">Q: Amy, I wanted to give people a sense of what the 1948 DP Immigration Act brought as opposed to what the Truman Directive was in 1945. </sentence><sentence id="3548">What was the difference? </sentence><sentence id="3549">I mean, what happened because of the Immigration Act? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3553">A: Well, it was very different from the Truman Directive. </sentence><sentence id="3554">That gave the first ray of hope to people that they might get to the United States, but when they passed the DP Act, this was the first time, really, that people could come to the United States outside of a quota number and on the basis of a job and housing assurance which somebody perhaps they didn't know had given them. </sentence><sentence id="3555">Whereas, before affidavits were generally given by close relatives who undertook, of course, to ensure that they would not be come a charge on public funds. </sentence><sentence id="3556">This was a totally different concept, and the Truman government at the time really is to be congratulated in having shown a humanitarian aspect of US immigration law which until then had really kept people out. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3561">Q: So, this made a big different to your work? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3563">A: It made a tremendous difference because we could offer hope to many more people that they could get to the United States. </sentence><sentence id="3564">They didn't have to have visas -- I beg your pardon -- they didn't have to have affidavits from relatives. </sentence><sentence id="3565">Many of them didn't have relatives who wanted to go to the States. </sentence><sentence id="3566">This also was important. </sentence><sentence id="3567">It meant that people were given a choice to an extent and how often had these people been given a choice after the war?They came out of the camps or if they were Polish Jews who had fled into Russia and worked in the mines, and had gone back to the Poland, what choices had they had? </sentence><sentence id="3568">It might interest you, by the way, to know that among the people we took care of, the first complete Jewish families I found after the war were the Polish Jews who had fled to Russia when the Germans marched in. </sentence><sentence id="3569">And, although they'd suffered tremendous hardship, we had husbands and wives and children together. </sentence><sentence id="3570">It was very interesting to see this. </sentence><sentence id="3571">As I said, they had -- many of them had suffered. </sentence><sentence id="3572">They'd worked in the mines, and when do Jews work in mines, after all? </sentence><sentence id="3573">They were tradesmen or employees, but they did survive as families. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3586">Q: Was this a source of resentment with the Jews who had come out of-? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3588">A: No, it wasn't -- people weren't even aware. </sentence><sentence id="3589">People were concerned for themselves. </sentence><sentence id="3590">You have to try and imagine what it was like to be in Germany after the war when either you were a survivor of a camp -- and there weren't too many remember -- you were somebody who had been encouraged to leave Poland, firstly because the Poles were still anti- Semitic. </sentence><sentence id="3591">There had been pogroms in 1946 in Kielce, when Jews were killed again. </sentence><sentence id="3592">You were encouraged to leave because you hoped for a better life somewhere else. </sentence><sentence id="3593">You didn't want to be among the people you had been with, and everybody in a sense was concerned for himself or herself. </sentence><sentence id="3594">And you have to imagine also in these camps there was a total lack of privacy for people. </sentence><sentence id="3595">They were sleeping in nissen (ph) huts. </sentence><sentence id="3596">There was curtain in  between families to give them some sort of privacy, but very little because it didn't stop voices carrying. </sentence><sentence id="3597">It was a very difficult time for these people, and our feeling generally was the sooner we got them out of these -- these people out of these conditions, the better. </sentence><sentence id="3598">It was a very, very tough time for these people. </sentence><sentence id="3599">And although visitors who came to Germany -- and there were many -- and saw these people and they would talk very bravely, they didn't see how these people were living, what kind of latrine facilities there were, what kind of washing facilities there were. </sentence><sentence id="3600">There were no, obviously, there were no washing machines, but what kind of laundry facilities there were, what kind of facilities there were for the Orthodox Jews. </sentence><sentence id="3601">It was an extraordinary difficult period, and these people survived it. </sentence><sentence id="3602">These are the people who were the survivors. </sentence><sentence id="3603">They were amazing people, and if there were occasionally arguments or quarrels, why not? </sentence><sentence id="3604">I mean, this too was normal. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3622">Q: So, people who visited did not see the conditions in terms of which people- </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3624">A: Oh, yes, they saw the conditions. </sentence><sentence id="3625">I'm thinking of people who visited who were interested, let's say, in raising money in the United States, and they came through and they saw the camp. </sentence><sentence id="3626">They may have even spent as much as a half a day, but you can't get a feel of a place from that kind of experience. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3630">Q: Do you remember Harrison coming through to write the report for Truman about the conditions in the DP camp? </sentence><sentence id="3631">Were you in that? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3634">A: No, he came through, I think, before I came into Germany. </sentence><sentence id="3635">I'm trying to think of which year it was. </sentence><sentence id="3636">Was it "49 that he came through? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3640">Q: I'm trying to remember, but I can't. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3642">A: I didn't meet him. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3644">Q: There's one person who came to get a visa named Oscar Schindler, can you describe the circumstances in terms of which he came to you, who came with him, how many times you met him, what you did for him, and what you thought of him? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3646">A: He was an interesting character. </sentence><sentence id="3647">Again, Dr. Joseph Schwartz, who was the European Director of the JDC, came to me and told me really a fantastic story of a man whom a whole group of survivors in Paris had just given a banquet. </sentence><sentence id="3648">Who was this man? </sentence><sentence id="3649">His name was Oscar Schindler, and I really knew nothing about him at that time. </sentence><sentence id="3650">And Dr. Schwartz told me that Oscar Schindler had saved the lives of at least 1,200 Jews by having them work in his factory in Poland, and Oscar Schindler had come back to Germany, had gone to Frankfurt. </sentence><sentence id="3651">I think he had tried to set up a concrete factory, and was not successful. </sentence><sentence id="3652">It's interesting, this fantastic character didn't do very well. </sentence><sentence id="3653">The Joint was helping to support him at this time because they were so astounded by his efforts to save people who essentially were not of his own kind. </sentence><sentence id="3654">They were Jews; he was a Catholic. </sentence><sentence id="3655">He was a  member of the Nazi party, as most Germans were. </sentence><sentence id="3656">And the fact that he had helped these people, they were ready to do anything they could to help him. </sentence><sentence id="3657">So, Dr. Schwartz said to me, "Amy, you know the ropes. </sentence><sentence id="3658">He will come to you. </sentence><sentence id="3659">Perhaps he won't even come alone. </sentence><sentence id="3660">He may come with other people. </sentence><sentence id="3661">I want you to try and send him wherever he wants to go." </sentence><sentence id="3662">Well, Oscar Schindler appeared in my office one day with his wife and two young Jewish couples, and I sort of couldn't get the hang of what the relationship was, and they explained to me in Yiddish that they always protected him because he looked like any other German Nazi. </sentence><sentence id="3663">He had blue eyes and blonde hair, and was very fair, obviously, and they were afraid if he came to my office, which was in the Jewish quarter of Munich, he might be set upon. </sentence><sentence id="3664">There were a lot of belligerent Jews at that time. </sentence><sentence id="3665">Oscar, as I said, came, and explained to me that what he really wanted to do was to set up a mink farm. </sentence><sentence id="3666">Now, what he knew about mink farming, I had no idea, but it wasn't mine to question. </sentence><sentence id="3667">And the place he wanted to do it was in the Argentine. </sentence><sentence id="3668">The Argentine, I knew the Argentine consuls. </sentence><sentence id="3669">I could get a visa for Oscar and his wife, no problem. </sentence><sentence id="3670">They were Catholics. </sentence><sentence id="3671">But, he said also, he would not go unless the two couples with him also got visas because they were like family to him, and they felt he was family to them. </sentence><sentence id="3672">He'd saved their lives, and they were never going to forget this. </sentence><sentence id="3673">Well, I set about trying to get the visas. </sentence><sentence id="3674">As I say, it was not too difficult for Oscar and his wife. </sentence><sentence id="3675">How to get visas for the two couples with him -- on the application form for a Argentine visa, they asked religion. </sentence><sentence id="3676">They did on many applications at that time, asked the religion of the applicant, but it didn't say explain anything. </sentence><sentence id="3677">It didn't say, for example, if somebody was Orthodox, were they Greek Orthodox, Russian Orthodox, Jewish Orthodox, "A ha!" </sentence><sentence id="3678">I thought. </sentence><sentence id="3679">I put Orthodox, and it was no problem. </sentence><sentence id="3680">I got the visas, and eventually they went to the States. </sentence><sentence id="3681">I'm sorry, they went to the Argentine, but they were lovely people, all of them. </sentence><sentence id="3682">Oscar was very soft voiced, very pleasant. </sentence><sentence id="3683">Who could imagine that this man -- he was diminutive, he wasn't very tall -- had the courage to do the kinds of things he did? </sentence><sentence id="3684">I don't know if you've seen the film "Schindler's List", but a lot of that -- the story in that film -- is true. </sentence><sentence id="3685">He was an extraordinary man to deal with, and in retrospect, quite a privilege to have met him. </sentence><sentence id="3686">It was interesting that we were so busy trying to help people that it never occurred to me that here was somebody who was very, very special. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3728">Q: Did you talk with his wife, as well? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3730">A: Yes, she didn't do much talking, but she also was very nice. </sentence><sentence id="3731">She's still alive, you know, living in the Argentine. </sentence><sentence id="3732">She was very pleasant, too. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3736">Q: Did he -- did you talk to him at all about what he had done during the war, or not? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3738">A: No, you didn't talk to people. </sentence><sentence id="3739">I think, firstly, he might have been embarrassed, but that isn't why he came to see me. </sentence><sentence id="3740">Firstly, it would not have occurred to me, except to tell him what a wonderful human being he was, but you know, we really had no concept at that time -- this is 1949 -- of the kinds of things that he had done to save so many people. </sentence><sentence id="3741">I mean, he got people out of Auschwitz. </sentence><sentence id="3742">Who ever got anybody out of Auschwitz? </sentence><sentence id="3743">He was quite an extraordinary man. </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3744">Q: Could you put together the man who was portrayed in the film and the man that you met in your office? </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3745">A: Yes, to an extent. </sentence><sentence id="3746">I think there's one part of the film where he goes into the basement to get wine, I think, it is Gert's basement and the young lady who works for him, a Jewish prisoner, who Gert is very nasty to, is down there and Oscar, if you remember the film, leans towards her and she thinks he's going to kiss her. </sentence><sentence id="3747">And he pats her on the shoulder. </sentence><sentence id="3748">He said, "No, I wasn't going to kiss you. </sentence><sentence id="3749">I was going to kiss you actually only on the forehead, but to tell you you will be all right. </sentence><sentence id="3750">I will take care of you." </sentence><sentence id="3751">Now, when you think of this man, he could've abused this girl. </sentence><sentence id="3752">He could've abused any of the Jewish women in his care. </sentence><sentence id="3753">He could've raped them if he had to. </sentence><sentence id="3754">He could've done anything with them because they owed their lives to him. </sentence><sentence id="3755">He didn't touch one of them. </sentence><sentence id="3756">Although in the film, he is shown as being a womanizer, it helps to sell a film. </sentence><sentence id="3757">Let's face it, and he may have been a womanizer, but the important thing about Oscar Schindler is he didn't touch one of the prisoners. </sentence><sentence id="3758">I think this tells you essentially the character of this man. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3773">Q: So, how long did it take you to get him the visa? ( </sentence><sentence id="3774">One second, please.) [ </sentence><sentence id="3775">Microphone adjusted.] </sentence><sentence id="3776">How long did take you to get him out of Argentina? </sentence><sentence id="3777">Or get him into Argentina, I'm sorry? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3783">A: I think it took me about five or six weeks. </sentence><sentence id="3784">There are all kinds of documents you have to fill in. </sentence><sentence id="3785">You have to get passports. </sentence><sentence id="3786">I had to get passports, take those passports for the people who were going with him. </sentence><sentence id="3787">They were Polish Jews, and they weren't going as Polish citizens. </sentence><sentence id="3788">It was all rather complicated, and yet in a sense it was very normal for us to be doing the kind of thing we were doing. </sentence><sentence id="3789">So, he came to the office on several occasions, and was always very pleasant, an extraordinary man. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3797">Q: Could we stop the film for just one second? [ </sentence><sentence id="3798">Tape break.] ( </sentence><sentence id="3799">Okay, we're rolling.) </sentence><sentence id="3800">Are there any other people whose stories you'd like to tell us that you helped? </sentence><sentence id="3801">That you haven't told us about? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3807">A: There were some very wonderful survivors, but each story is a different story. </sentence><sentence id="3808">The fact that they were survivors, and remained decent human beings and people with a sense of humor, and people with kindness, there are many stories of many kind people, and there were people who survived who weren't kind people. </sentence><sentence id="3809">I think people went into the camps -- rather, people who went into the camps as kind, decent human beings came out as such, and those who were gaslonim, gangsters, when they went in, were gangsters when they came out. </sentence><sentence id="3810">People don't change. </sentence><sentence id="3811">Their behavior changes, I think. </sentence><sentence id="3812">There was some very wonderful people who survived, and very wonderful people, unfortunately, who didn't. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3819">Q: So, how -- you were in Germany doing this job until 1952. </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3820">A: I stayed in Germany until the Displaced Persons Act came to an end, and then I felt it was time for me to go on. </sentence><sentence id="3821">The American Joint wanted me to go down to Morocco where they had a program, but I thought it was about time I started to sample normal life. </sentence><sentence id="3822">You have to remember that, since I was a teenager, I'd been working with displaced persons living an expatriate life, an exotic life in a way, but I felt that my biggest job had been done. </sentence><sentence id="3823">I'd helped as many people as I could to immigrate to countries outside of Israel. </sentence><sentence id="3824">We didn't handle Israel. </sentence><sentence id="3825">And it was about time I set myself up. </sentence><sentence id="3826">And, so, I waited until the Act came to an end in May of *45, and then decided I would go to the United States and see where some of these Americans with whom I'd work came from. </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3827">Q: So, from 1944, February, until 1952, May, you hadn't been back to England but once? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3829">A: Oh, no, no. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3831">Q: Had you been back more? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3833">A: Oh, I had been back. </sentence><sentence id="3834">If I got a weekend, while my mother was alive, I would pop over to see her as often as I could, which was perhaps every four months, six months. </sentence><sentence id="3835">I'd take a long week. </sentence><sentence id="3836">You know, it was a train overnight there, and spend a day with her, and come back. </sentence><sentence id="3837">Maybe it was longer periods in between, but I did go and see her. </sentence><sentence id="3838">My mother died in 1952, and I had been in London about three months before, and we had gone to the ballet, and had a lovely evening, and that was my last memory of her. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3845">Q: You were very close to your mother. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3847">A: Yes, I liked her tremendously. </sentence><sentence id="3848">She was a very kind woman, a very kind woman. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3851">Q: Was she both proud of your work and yet missing you a great deal, wishing that you were in London with her? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3853">A: Oh, I think she would have loved to have had me in London, but she was very proud of the fact that, in a sense, I was giving service, is the way that she would put it, that I was helping other people. </sentence><sentence id="3854">I think if she had been younger, she might have done it herself. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3857">Q: What age did she die? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3859">A: She was in her late 60s. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3863">A: No, no. </sentence><sentence id="3864">She'd been sick. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3867">Q: And your decision to go to the United States rather than England. </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3868">A: Well, I couldn't see myself in England having worked with the Americans for so long. </sentence><sentence id="3869">I needed a break, I felt. </sentence><sentence id="3870">I had no home in England, anyway, and I thought I would come to the States. </sentence><sentence id="3871">I had friends in the States, Gladys Roth, with whom I had worked invited me also to come and stay with her while she was on leave, and so I thought that was a good idea. </sentence><sentence id="3872">And, when I came to the States I was invited by William Rosenwald, the son of Julius -- was it Julius Rosenwald. </sentence><sentence id="3873">Or was that his brother who started Sears Roebuck? -- </sentence><sentence id="3874">who had met me in Germany, asked me if I'd come and run his philanthropies for him, and I thought I would try that. </sentence><sentence id="3875">And I was working for him for about a year when the American Joint again approached me and said they had a problem down in Brazil where the last people who had been displaced persons camps, a lot of whom had been sent down there and they were having a problem. </sentence><sentence id="3876">Would I go down to Brazil and sort the situation out? </sentence><sentence id="3877">Foolishly, I said yes. </sentence><sentence id="3878">The Brazilian community that I dealt with, largely was the refugee community. </sentence><sentence id="3879">There were about 20,000 former refugees living in San Paulo, most of them very, very fine people. </sentence><sentence id="3880">The people who had been sent in when the displaced persons camps were closing were difficult people, let me put it that way. </sentence><sentence id="3881">Some of them were mentally ill. </sentence><sentence id="3882">Some of them should never have been sent. </sentence><sentence id="3883">Some of them had no desire to be there. </sentence><sentence id="3884">It was a very, very difficult situation. </sentence><sentence id="3885">I was physically attacked down there for a change. </sentence><sentence id="3886">I hadn't been physically attacked since I'd been in Greece, and it was broadcast, by the way, over the radio and some friends, including Norman Bentwich, Professor Bentwich, heard in London, called my aunt, and I got frantic phone calls from London. </sentence><sentence id="3887">I got another dislocation from that. </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3888">Q: How did they attack you? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3890">A: Physically. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3892">Q: They just started beating you up? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3894">A: Well, they tried, yes, and you know, I'm rather small. </sentence><sentence id="3895">I'm only five foot four, and these guys were big guys, and I'm not a fighter, physically or mentally, I think, but after that I worked under police protection. </sentence><sentence id="3896">And I used to come back to the hotel in which I lived under police protection, and one of the very nice Swedish boys at the desk asked me, "Why?" </sentence><sentence id="3897">Because apparently the only other women who came back to the hotel under police protection where the prostitutes. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3902">Q: Really? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3904">A: Yes. </sentence><sentence id="3905">No, I had to explain to him that I'd been attacked, you know. </sentence><sentence id="3906">But, the community that was established there, there was a Dr. Lorch, L-o-r-c-h, from Germany, his wife who's actually Brazilian Jewish -- she was a Klabin, of the Klabin family. </sentence><sentence id="3907">The parents had come to Brazil at the turn of the century from Lithuania, and they were a very, very wealthy family, and very concerned for refugees. </sentence><sentence id="3908">They had worked on the refugees committee before the war, and they helped after the war. </sentence><sentence id="3909">They were very kind to me, and there were several other families who did a beautiful job down there, but these people  were people they hadn't met before. </sentence><sentence id="3910">I hadn't met this kind before, actually. </sentence><sentence id="3911">I set up a small loans committee to try and help them. </sentence><sentence id="3912">Their visas weren't regular visas, you know, it's coming back to the old story, and I had to legalize them, and the Brazilian government really didn't want to legalize them except for Jeiko (ph). </sentence><sentence id="3913">Yes, and it was very difficult. </sentence><sentence id="3914">Eventually, the government settled. </sentence><sentence id="3915">I must say, and I'll confess now that one or two who were Germans who didn't know what they were letting themselves in for I sent back to Germany. </sentence><sentence id="3916">One or two of them, I managed to get into Canada. </sentence><sentence id="3917">And we set up a small loans committee so that a lot of these men could become hawkers. </sentence><sentence id="3918">They bought goods on credit, and went to outlying villages just as the original Strausses did in the United States. </sentence><sentence id="3919">Some of them became very wealthy, and they calmed down. </sentence><sentence id="3920">Some of them were pretty awful people, and as with all groups, there was lovely people among them. </sentence><sentence id="3921">It was a very tough job. </sentence><sentence id="3922">I stayed in Brazil for nine months. </sentence><sentence id="3923">It was a tough assignment, a very tough assignment. </sentence><sentence id="3924">When I came back to New York, and the British asked me -- called me and said would I come to England? </sentence><sentence id="3925">Because the British government was now allowing what they called hardcore cases to come into England. </sentence><sentence id="3926">Hardcore cases for the British were families where the head of the family could not maintain his family either because of physical illness or even that they might be mentally disturbed, and so I went to England, and went into Austria, Germany, and Italy again to choose hardcore cases to come to England. </sentence><sentence id="3927">They were interesting, some of these people. </sentence><sentence id="3928">I had one young man who had been shot through the shoulder and had no profession. </sentence><sentence id="3929">We brought him to England. </sentence><sentence id="3930">He was supposed to have had TB and be cured, but when we got him to England, we discovered he still had TB, and the British were not really taking in TB cases. </sentence><sentence id="3931">They had enough illnesses of their own, and so eventually, I took this man who behaved as though he were mentally ill while he was England, eventually I took him back to Germany. </sentence><sentence id="3932">We flew, and it was quite surprising. </sentence><sentence id="3933">As we got off the plane, you never would have known that he had behavior other than normal behavior. </sentence><sentence id="3934">When they x- rayed him, he showed no signs of TB. </sentence><sentence id="3935">I'm sure they thought the British were trying to get rid of him. </sentence><sentence id="3936">He was quite an extraordinary case. </sentence><sentence id="3937">I think he couldn't face being outside the territory in which he was captured. </sentence><sentence id="3938">He was one of the strange cases. </sentence><sentence id="3939">Others were families with several sons and daughters. </sentence><sentence id="3940">Some of them Orthodox Jews who made a very good adjustment to living in England. </sentence><sentence id="3941">We moved them into areas where there were Orthodox Jews. </sentence><sentence id="3942">The Jewish Refugees Committee did a very good job on those people, and I remember another young -- not a young couple, but a young man with older parents who the British brought in, and had him trained as a surveyor. </sentence><sentence id="3943">He had no college education, but like many people in England, you could go into a profession and train on the job, and he did very well and his parents adjusted very well. </sentence><sentence id="3944">Those families on the whole, except for this young man, who was very sad, were a success. </sentence><sentence id="3945">And then, of course, I came back to the States. </sentence><sentence id="3946">I became, I suppose, a cosmopolitan in a way in that I felt at home nowhere. </sentence><sentence id="3947">I'd worked for so long with displaced persons, in a sense, it was the only thing I knew. </sentence><sentence id="3948">But after coming to the States, one of my friends convinced me I ought to work with the National Council of Jewish Women, their headquarters in New York. </sentence><sentence id="3949">And I went to see them, and I must say they were very anxious to get me. </sentence><sentence id="3950">I don't know why, perhaps my experience meant something to them. </sentence><sentence id="3951">And I did work for them for -- I'm trying to think how long -- several years, until the wanderlust got me again, and I decided together with a  friend who was a published author that we'd go off to China and see what the role of women was in the new China. </sentence><sentence id="3952">I didn't realize we wouldn't get visas, but I gave up my job. </sentence><sentence id="3953">My friend got an advance on a book about China. </sentence><sentence id="3954">She was already, as I say, a published author, and we landed in Tokyo -- or rather, I landed in Tokyo. </sentence><sentence id="3955">She was coming later by ship. </sentence><sentence id="3956">I flew in. </sentence><sentence id="3957">And the first night that I was in the Frank Lloyd Wright Imperial Hotel, it was a very interesting building. </sentence><sentence id="3958">Everything was much too big for me. </sentence><sentence id="3959">Everything was high, and the first night I was there, I met charming gentleman in the smorgasbord restaurant who eventually became my husband. </sentence><sentence id="3960">We got married in London because my family couldn't think that somebody hat at last got me to say yes, and I ended up on the prairie in Illinois, on the flat, flat prairie, which I found devastating, absolutely devastating. </sentence><sentence id="3961">Nobody knew me. </sentence><sentence id="3962">Nobody knew of the work that I had done. </sentence><sentence id="3963">Nobody was interested, and I decided, "Well, if I'm going to be stuck here" because David was a lovely, lovely man, "I'm going to do something. </sentence><sentence id="3964">I'Il go back to school," which I had tried to do before I left England. </sentence><sentence id="3965">I had gone to university in the evening, but of course couldn't continue because of the Blitz and things like that, and then I went overseas. </sentence><sentence id="3966">I said to myself, "I'll get my degree here." </sentence><sentence id="3967">And in the time it normally takes a student not having been in school for a thousand years, I maintain a straight average -- a straight-A average -- got my undergraduate degree, got a Master's degree, and then decided I would do what I always want to do and that was to get a PhD at the London School of Economics, and David thought that was a splendid idea. </sentence><sentence id="3968">He was very kind, and I came to London again. </sentence><sentence id="3969">The semester was ten weeks. </sentence><sentence id="3970">We had three semesters a year, and I had to be there for two years. </sentence><sentence id="3971">I managed to skip one while we went on sabbatical to Australia, which is another story, meeting people I'd sent there as refugees, and came back to the States, finished my dissertation, and in 1975, received my PhD from the London School of Economics. </sentence><sentence id="3972">And then I decided what one really had to do was to tell this story of what happened during and after the war because, as I say, nobody ever asked. </sentence><sentence id="3973">Nobody seemed to be interested. </sentence><sentence id="3974">There was one professor at University of Illinois. </sentence><sentence id="3975">His name was Winton Solberg. </sentence><sentence id="3976">He was an intellectual history, and he asked me to write a course on the Holocaust. </sentence><sentence id="3977">I thought this was going to be a great opportunity. </sentence><sentence id="3978">I wrote the course, but I was a woman, and the history department wasn't about to make funding available for me to teach the course. </sentence><sentence id="3979">But, women's movement was beginning to get going, and Joan Huber, who was head of the department of sociology, said to me, "Amy, you can teach that course in our department." </sentence><sentence id="3980">I have to go back and bit and tell you that I had competed for a job as an assistant to the vice president for academic affairs for the university, and there were two positions going. </sentence><sentence id="3981">There were 77 applicants, and Edith Terwilliger and I got those positions. </sentence><sentence id="3982">The former Vice President, P.T. Yankwich, now lives in Washington, as a matter of fact. </sentence><sentence id="3983">So, it was very interesting working for this man. </sentence><sentence id="3984">He was very bright. </sentence><sentence id="3985">He was an intellectual, and he gave me time off to teach the course, and since I got paid for teaching the course, it meant I could employ a graduate assistant and pay her that money, so she had money during the semester. </sentence><sentence id="3986">I gave the course over three or four semesters. </sentence><sentence id="3987">It was fascinating because the room which I was assigned filled very quickly, and the computer cut us off, and I found that the students taking the course were children from all ends, or both ends, of the Jewish spectrum. </sentence><sentence id="3988">They were children of strictly Orthodox parents, and children of non-Orthodox parents. </sentence><sentence id="3989">They were children of survivors. </sentence><sentence id="3990">They  were children of Polish immigrants who'd come after the war, and one didn't know what their parents had done during the war, and all of them were interesting because, if I told them, for example, the story of a pastor who had saved some Jews, they wanted proof, and my xeroxing bill was tremendous. </sentence><sentence id="3991">I always brought evidence of anything I told them that was positive about non-Jews who'd helped Jews, and I used to say, "There were good Germans. </sentence><sentence id="3992">There were good Poles. </sentence><sentence id="3993">There just weren't enough of them." </sentence><sentence id="3994">They were interesting groups of students because, as I discovered, those whose parents were survivors, they told me their parents told them nothing. </sentence><sentence id="3995">And I would tell them, "Perhaps you can tell them something of what you've learned in the class and see what their reaction is. </sentence><sentence id="3996">Don't push them, but gently try to get their stories from them because it is still so painful for them -- for them to tell you these stories." </sentence><sentence id="3997">They were very interesting students, and I kept in touch with them for a long time. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="4092">Q: Did they ask you -- did you tell them about what you had done after the war or did you not tell them anything? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="4094">A: I didn't tell them essentially, but I would -- I think my classes were interesting because I would tell them incidents of my experience. </sentence><sentence id="4095">I didn't tell them in the sense that I've told you, but I would tell them of incidents and that I knew of these incidents because of this experience. </sentence><sentence id="4096">I think they believed me because they felt that I was talking from experience, so they enjoyed taking my course. </sentence><sentence id="4097">I made it a difficult course. </sentence><sentence id="4098">When I say I made it a difficult course, I didn't make it easy because of my experience. </sentence><sentence id="4099">They had to pass the grade, too, but no, I didn't tell them because I -- just like with Oscar Schindler, I didn't think people were interested, and also, I find it very hard to talk about myself. </sentence><sentence id="4100">I might tell you this is the first time I've ever done it. </sentence><sentence id="4101">Nobody has ever asked me before. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="4110">Q: Well, I'm really grateful, and so is everybody else who is hearing this. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="4112">A: Thank you. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="4114">Q: Amy, you were asked to go back to England to create an archive. </sentence><sentence id="4115">Can you talk about that, and talk about one of the pieces of information that you had found that really had been lost about the St. Louis? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="4118">A: Oh, yes. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="4120">Q: Can you do that? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="4122">A: My pleasure. </sentence><sentence id="4123">After my husband died, the head of the World Jewish Fund for Jewish Relief, no sorry, got the name wrong, haven't I? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="4126">Q: British Fund- </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="4127">A: Central British Fund for World Jewish Relief called me one day because she knew of my relationship to the organization. </sentence><sentence id="4128">She said they had found a tremendous stack of files in one of the garages at one of the nursing homes, rather, one of the homes for the aged for former refugees. </sentence><sentence id="4129">Would I come and look at it? </sentence><sentence id="4130">She knew that I came into England fairly often because I did have brothers and sisters there. </sentence><sentence id="4131">And so I came and looked at the stack and was amazed. </sentence><sentence id="4132">There were a tremendous number of case histories on individuals. </sentence><sentence id="4133">They were files on children who'd been brought out from Austria and Germany on kinder transports. </sentence><sentence id="4134">There were minutes of meetings. </sentence><sentence id="4135">And I said to this woman, Ava Mitchell, "You have a treasure trove here. </sentence><sentence id="4136">You've got the archives of your agency. </sentence><sentence id="4137">Nobody knows their story." </sentence><sentence id="4138">And she originally had been a refugee, by the way. </sentence><sentence id="4139">She said, "Would you put it together for us?" </sentence><sentence id="4140">Well, I wasn't an archivist, and I knew that the agency would never have the money to employ an archivist. </sentence><sentence id="4141">We have to remember that after the war, Britain was still very poor. </sentence><sentence id="4142">I said I thought I'd like to do this. </sentence><sentence id="4143">So, I packed my bags and came to London. </sentence><sentence id="4144">They gave me a staff. </sentence><sentence id="4145">Somebody had given them some money so that we can work on this archive, and Bill &amp; Howe (ph) did our microfilming for us. </sentence><sentence id="4146">They were very helpful, and they asked me to do a booklet on the archive, which I did which was published which was rather nice. </sentence><sentence id="4147">It took us about 18 months to put this stuff together, but it has proved invaluable. </sentence><sentence id="4148">For example, one of the items we found were all the records of people who had ever registered with the Jewish Refugees Committee from 1933 on, and that would be from May the 18", 1933, when the organization was started. </sentence><sentence id="4149">It would have records of people who'd been inquired about and you would find a card which would say, "Helen Comb -- deported through Tiresenstadt (ph)" And it would give the date because somebody had come in and given this information. </sentence><sentence id="4150">And, even to this day, those cards are useful. </sentence><sentence id="4151">For example, if you want to prove that you came to England as a refugee, and claim your pension or money from Germany or Austria or some funding which was due to you, we could look up your archive and see if your name was there, and it would give the date that you arrived in England. </sentence><sentence id="4152">Now, what happened ultimately, as we were working through this archive, I began to see names which said "St. Louis", and that struck me because I knew of the story of the St. Louis, this ghastly story of these people who in high hopes went in party fashion, practically, to Cuba, not knowing that they were going to be refused entry, not knowing that all but about 22 would be refused entry because the 22 had paid the extra money that was required to get a permanent visa. </sentence><sentence id="4153">And I start to make cards on them, and I found about 110 of the people who came into England where it was marked St. Louis passengers, and I kept these cards. </sentence><sentence id="4154">And then one day I heard from the museum, your museum, that you were going to do an exhibition on the people who sailed on the St. Louis and the face of those who landed up in Europe, but you really didn't have full records of those who landed in Britain, although you had names. </sentence><sentence id="4155">And I said, "If you give me all the names, I will be able to trace all of them. </sentence><sentence id="4156">And I must say it took me quite a while, I won't tell you how many weeks, to go through these -- the microfilm, find these people, and take a picture of these people, and I found all 187 of the people who landed in Britain, and I felt very pleased because it will help complete your archive, and it shows the value of doing what we did and the money we spent on putting that archive together. </sentence><sentence id="4157">Archives are terribly, terribly important, and I only hope that people who may look at this film will realize if they have letters from people during  the war, before the war, after the war, which might be useful, to find out from an archivist where they might be useful. </sentence><sentence id="4158">The family might not be interested, but an archive will be able to put history together, and without our history we have no future. </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="4159">Q: Well, Amy Gottlieb, it's been a real pleasure talking to you. </sentence><sentence id="4160">Your book, "Men of Vision" is something people should read if they want to know about what Britain did, and the stories that you tell is particularly poignant now when we have 50-80 million refugees in the world, and how difficult it is, and how much care it takes. </sentence><sentence id="4161">And the care that you've given these people, I'm sure they all thank you, and we thank you for being here. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="4165">A: Thank you. </sentence><sentence id="4166">And I must say that there are volunteers today from many countries of the world helping refugees overseas. </sentence><sentence id="4167">I only hope they get the kind of the care that the British gave to the refugees from Germany and Austria before the war and during the war, and after the war. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="4171">Q: Yes, this history must be a repetition for you over and over again. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="4173">A: Yes, you see the same kind of things happening that happened before. </sentence><sentence id="4174">If I were younger, I would go out and help. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="4177">Q: I'm sure. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="4179">A: Thank you for inviting me. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="4181">Q: Thank you. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="4183">A: [Badge shown.] </sentence><sentence id="4184">The badge that you see was given to all members of Jewish Relief Units who volunteered to go overseas during and after the war. </sentence><sentence id="4185">For example, when Bergen- Belsen was liberated, more than a 100 people from England -- doctors, nurses, lawyers, social workers, teachers, went into Bergen-Belsen to help those people who had survived there. </sentence><sentence id="4186">This was the badge that the Central British Fund had set up for us so that we would be recognized as a Jewish team, so that survivors who saw the Shield of David would realize that we were Jews who had come to help them, and perhaps ease their burden somewhat. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="4191">Q: And where did you wear this? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="4193">A: We wore this badge on the beret that we had. </sentence><sentence id="4194">We also wore a Shield of David in blue and white on our sleeves as our insignia. </sentence><sentence id="4195">And we wore a British Army uniform at the time, British army officer's uniform, actually. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="4199">Q: Okay. </sentence></p></dialogue>
