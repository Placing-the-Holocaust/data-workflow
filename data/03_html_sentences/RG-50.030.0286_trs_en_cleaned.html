<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="5">Q: So you were very young at the time before the war. </sentence><sentence id="6">You probably don't have too much memory about what was happening prior to the war? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="9">A: No, only very sporadic memories of my father and memories that perhaps are based on stories more than memories but I do think I have very clear pictures of going to the park with my dad and playing with him and doing things that normally you would expect a boy to do with a father rather than a little girl and I thought that people usually ask me why I chose a profession that I chose and although my father was a very orthodox Jewish man and certainly would have never admitted to that feeling I think that I was his first born and I think he considered me in some ways his son. </sentence><sentence id="10">I remember the feeling of going to the park and playing with him and him being perhaps more involved with a child, particularly a man of his generation than you'd expect him to be particularly with a girl. </sentence><sentence id="11">That's what I remember. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="15">Q: You had a comfortable family life? </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="39">Q: Now what kind of business was your father in? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="41">A: I'm not sure. </sentence><sentence id="42">I think he started out delivering milk and learning how to be a diamond cutter or something of the sort. </sentence><sentence id="43">He was very, very religious. </sentence><sentence id="44">I remember that. </sentence><sentence id="45">He was always going to synagogue, coming from synagogue and praying an awful lot. </sentence><sentence id="46">In my head it seemed like too much. </sentence><sentence id="47">It seemed like not a very tense life. </sentence><sentence id="48">He was going to work and coming home and we observed the Sabbath. </sentence><sentence id="49">We would always go for walks in the park and things of that sort. </sentence><sentence id="50">This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="51">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="52"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="71">Q: Your neighbors were Jewish as well? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="73">A: Yes. </sentence><sentence id="74">The ones I knew. </sentence><sentence id="75">I mean I was a kid so I don't remember everybody who lived there but I would say the majority were Jewish. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="79">Q: Now, your mother spoke of a lot anti-semitism in Belgium before the war. </sentence><sentence id="80">Do you have any images of that? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="83">A: The only one is a story that my mom told me and that sort of became an indication of my early rebellion and that was at some point during these --right either at the beginning of the war or the pre-war period my grandfather was beaten up on the way back from synagogue or threatened or harassed and he I think people were pulling at his beard and he hid his beard in his coat. </sentence><sentence id="84">When he came home, he looked really terrible and very upset and he had told me that this was a Friday night that Friday night when men used to go to the synagogue they had a couple of angels who were watching over them and walking with them to and from synagogue. </sentence><sentence id="85">So, when he came back beaten and so on, I asked him Grandfather where were your angels then. </sentence><sentence id="86">So, that picture remained with me, his frightened look and the statement that I made then, I don't remember having made it, but it fits with the way I think. </sentence><sentence id="87">So, and several people that I have met, in fact recently, very recently just about three months ago when I was last in Belgium said you are this little girl who said that. </sentence><sentence id="88">They remember that statement. </sentence><sentence id="89">That's the only evidence I have of anti-semitism that touched us directly but before I really don't know. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="97">Q: Do you remember what your grandfather's response was to that? </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="105">A: Yes, I did. </sentence><sentence id="106">Both my mother and I wore it I think after the men, -- the husband of this neighbor and my dad were taken I think to go to a work camp, and we had to wear the star. </sentence><sentence id="107">One picture I have of that is that she used to always carry me over her should to hide her star so that we would travel in the trolley or something and she would carry me so that her star and mine were essentially hidden to avoid being harassed in the streets. </sentence><sentence id="108">She'd always do that, carry me. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="138">Q: So you were running to hide from the Germans? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="140">A: Yes, we were running to try and escape because at some point after the two husbands had gone to work, during that period some people came into the house and they weren't really Nazis, but they pretended to be Gestapo and they beat up everyone in the house. </sentence><sentence id="141">My mother and my grandfather and me and they were really beating us and I remember screaming and my mother screaming. </sentence><sentence id="142">They finally left. </sentence><sentence id="143">They ransacked the place and they were looking for money and so on. </sentence><sentence id="144">They got in on the pretense of being Gestapo and -- </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="204">A: Well, things that stand out hunger, real, real hunger. </sentence><sentence id="205">Nothing to eat, but that didn't bother me because I really didn't like to eat but I remember my little girlfriend, food was her thing. </sentence><sentence id="206">She was this plump little thing and you could always shut her up by giving her food. </sentence><sentence id="207">So, I used to run to the kitchen at night and steal whatever I could find and feed her because she was crying all night. </sentence><sentence id="208">She was crying because she was hungry, and I was crying because I wanted my mother. </sentence><sentence id="209">So, we were quite a pair. </sentence><sentence id="210">So, hunger -- and I knew there was nothing to eat and whatever there was I couldn't swallow. </sentence><sentence id="211">I just couldn't swallow any food there. </sentence><sentence id="212">The other thing I remember is lice and the worst incident which may look ridiculous now but was when you had lice they shaved your head, and I was very proud of my hair. </sentence><sentence id="213">I had really beautiful long hair and when I found out that I had lice and I could tell, because I was really itching. </sentence><sentence id="214">I hid in the outhouse. </sentence><sentence id="215">There was no indoor plumbing. </sentence><sentence id="216">There was indoor cold water to wash but no toilet. </sentence><sentence id="217">I hid in the outhouse for a couple of days and nobody could get me out of there because I knew as soon as they found out they would shave my head. </sentence><sentence id="218">So, but they eventually did. </sentence><sentence id="219">I had to get out. </sentence><sentence id="220">They shaved my head, and it was absolutely horrible, just horrible. </sentence><sentence id="221">Now, it looks kind of silly but and it wasn't just lice it was scabies, you know the things that crawl under your skin, so we were not really in very good shape. </sentence><sentence id="222">And there was always a feeling of fear and just terrible -- feeling terrible. </sentence><sentence id="223">First of all, not understanding at all why you were there what was happening, missing your family and just the terror basically. </sentence><sentence id="224">I think I acted irrationally on many occasions where I would just run out of the window in the middle of the night in the nightgown and just try to run away and being caught. </sentence><sentence id="225">You know, brought back to this, so we had songs but I don't know if they made them up or the older children probably did which referred to us having to wake up at 7:00 in the morning and having to wash with cold water and the son reflected that there was no food only some kind of vegetable, something like a sweet potatoes. </sentence><sentence id="226">That's why when people serve me sweet potato at Thanksgiving I say thanks but no thanks. </sentence><sentence id="227">I can't even look at the stuff. </sentence><sentence id="228">I don't know if it's the same, but it's so similar that it's enough to turn me off. </sentence><sentence id="229">That's all we had. </sentence><sentence id="230">SO, there was a song that reflected the realities of the time. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="275">Q: You said you were there about eight or nine months, how did you get out of there? </sentence><sentence id="276">What were the circumstances? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="279">A: Well, the circumstances are a little bit muddled but apparently my parents send someone to pick us up from there because they were escaping to Nice to the part of France that was occupied by the Italians as to the Germans. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="281">Q: How did your parents get out of 2  http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="282">Q: I don't understand Nice was under Italian occupation, Italian German occupation? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="284">A: Right. </sentence><sentence id="285">But Italian, not German. </sentence><sentence id="286">The Germans came in later, so it really was strictly Italian. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="290">Q: Did you have total freedom as Jews at this time? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="292">A: Officially no because the official party line of the Italian Nazi government with Mussolini was also that Jews had to be deported and rounded up, but the orders were not quite as effective and there was very little discipline in the Italian army, and those people who were in the army just couldn't care less whether we were Jews or something else. </sentence><sentence id="293">They simply couldn't care less so we were supposed to officially hide that we were Jews, but they knew fully well we were and I think we were fairly free to go and do as we pleased. </sentence><sentence id="294">I'm not sure, I think that the order of deportation sort of depended on your nationality and so my parents at the time might have become Czechoslovakian or something like that and giving me a different name and that name I don't remember. </sentence><sentence id="295">If you had Czechoslovakian papers it really didn't matter at the time whether you were Jewish or not. </sentence><sentence id="296">For a short period of time the authorities respected the nationality versus your ethnic background. </sentence><sentence id="297">That didn't last, but for a short period of time it was that way and the soldiers who were supposed to execute the orders couldn't care less. </sentence><sentence id="298">I mean they just did not round up people. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="306">Q: So, you were in Nice leading what you felt was a pretty nice life in the daytime anyway? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="308">A: Yes. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="310">Q: Do you remember about how long you were there? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="312">A: I would say also about ten months or so approximately and then when Italy capitulated and the Germans came marching in through the part of France that had previously been occupied by the Italians. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="314">Q: When was this? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="316">A: The end of --must have been the beginning of "44 or somewhere around there, I think. </sentence><sentence id="317">The war was over in "45 and we were in for perhaps a year, so I'd say'44  http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection transportation but try to arrange some kind of private way to join us. </sentence><sentence id="318">From there we were going to try and get through to Switzerland together. </sentence><sentence id="319">So, the train trip was uneventful, I mean my mother and myself and her friend and her two little children went along and we got to a place where I don't know if we stayed in a hotel or I don't know where we stayed exactly. </sentence><sentence id="320">In the meantime my father and his friend was going to come by ambulance. </sentence><sentence id="321">They had found someone who was going to drive an ambulance and take them as being ill. </sentence><sentence id="322">So, they established a point of meeting which was a block from the hotel where we had stayed. </sentence><sentence id="323">My father for some really stupid reason decided to go back to his hotel room because he had forgotten his prayer shawl and his , and when he got to the hotel the Germans were there. </sentence><sentence id="324">So, he didn't make it. </sentence><sentence id="325">They arrested him. </sentence><sentence id="326">Apparently Mr. waited until the evening and then the ambulance driver says I'm not going to stay any longer because we're going to get picked up. </sentence><sentence id="327">So, they left and they came and dropped off Mr. Shimmer wherever we were. </sentence><sentence id="328">And then I remember this most horrendous scene of my mother collapsing when she saw him come in alone. </sentence><sentence id="329">She immediately knew that something was very, very wrong. </sentence><sentence id="330">I just remember her just totally going completely hysterical and screaming and pulling out her hair and to me this was just the most frightening because I just came out from something that was relatively safe, and it just was everything fell apart. </sentence><sentence id="331">We stayed together for a while with those people and the family had their parents at least. </sentence><sentence id="332">The woman had her parents in Switzerland and so they decided to really push on and try to get to Switzerland and my mother at that point said she didn't care anymore. </sentence><sentence id="333">She just didn't care, and she decided to stay put in , which was the town where we were at. </sentence><sentence id="334">At that point we got papers from people who proceeded us and who we paid a lot of money to get those fake papers. </sentence><sentence id="335">So, we changed our name again. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="855">A: No, but for instance my dad was religious at the time there was school on Saturdays, and he didn't allow me to go. </sentence><sentence id="856">It was a horror show. </sentence><sentence id="857">I already had missed so much school throughout my life and of course they put Latin and Greek and math and whatnot on Saturday. </sentence><sentence id="858">This really is not easy, and the teachers refused to help. </sentence><sentence id="859">I mean I would have to go every Saturday night -- I mean that's why I became even less attracted to the religion. </sentence><sentence id="860">I had to go and beg from some girl who really didn't want to give me her notes for all the lectures that had been given that day and then try to work it out on my own because my father didn't know anything and my mother didn't know anything about that stuff. </sentence><sentence id="861">The teachers just said, her statement was, "Well, you Jewish girls don't want to come to school on Saturday, you just work it out. </sentence><sentence id="862">It's not my problem." </sentence><sentence id="863">It makes you feel that after all that hearing this business about Jewish girls -- it was a secular school, it wasn't a school that was under any kind of religious aegis or directives. </sentence><sentence id="864">That's what the public school was. </sentence><sentence id="865">It was a secular school where there was religion given according to what you wanted so there was one hour you could choose either religion or ethics so you didn't have to attend -- because there was a catholic school system just as there is one here an official catholic school system. </sentence><sentence id="866">So, the people who were there, weren't even observant, but they still had a feeling that we were foreigners. </sentence><sentence id="867">Essentially the feeling was that we were foreigners. </sentence><sentence id="868">We were different and foreign. </sentence><sentence id="869">We did not feel very well there, really not, and then later they opened a Jewish high school and most Jewish kids now go to the Jewish high school, which is now fully accepted. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="925">A: In terms of who I am today, I would have liked all this activity around survivors of the war whatever events took part in their own lives to happen earlier because even as I tell these things and some of these things bring tears to my eyes so that i know that I still feel them, but they're not -- I think I'm now perhaps able and it hasn't been that long -- able to associate my reactions to trauma and whatever from the past. </sentence><sentence id="926">So, it's hard for me to say now. </sentence><sentence id="927">The worst part of it was the fear, you know the absolute terror that I can still invoke certain times thinking back particularly --the salient points were in that home where I just didn't know where anybody was. </sentence><sentence id="928">And then when my dad was taken. </sentence><sentence id="929">These were just terrible, terrible moments. </sentence><sentence id="930">I know that until he died, my father -- I had many, many nightmares about anticipating his death that they were just really terrible and I was acting irrationally during many years in relation to him in terms of being so afraid that he would die that I could not even enjoy when I was near him. </sentence><sentence id="931">He wasn't a well man, although he pulled together and rebuilt a life for himself and helped his brothers build their own lives, so he did a tremendous job. </sentence><sentence id="932">I couldn't even appreciate any of this. </sentence><sentence id="933">I was just always afraid of losing him so that was sort of something that marred my life for a long time. </sentence><sentence id="934">In fact, I think I was liberated from that feeling only when he died. </sentence><sentence id="935">When he finally died, I sort of gained some peace which seems sort of crazy, but that's what happened. </sentence><sentence id="936">When he died, I said okay that's over. </sentence><sentence id="937">He's really gone and he's not coming back. </sentence><sentence id="938">That's it. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="939"> This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="940">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="941"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection 9 </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="942">Q: Are you at all religious today? </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="943">A: No, I'm not, but I observe the traditions because I think they're pretty and perhaps only recently I have trouble with dogma in general. </sentence><sentence id="944">I have trouble with authority, but there is sort of a deeper philosophy which guides the lives of those who are truly religious and I really don't refer to people who are shut off from the outside world like or  http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection 0 and so on and we stayed friends for a while after. </sentence><sentence id="945">She became religious and I wasn't, but a certain point in time we were going to synagogue for the high holidays and our mothers would try and make us pray and we would just giggle. </sentence><sentence id="946">I mean that's all we'd do, we'd giggle. </sentence><sentence id="947">We could just not do pray or do anything. </sentence><sentence id="948">Then when I went to study, I left home and I went to Switzerland and the very first Rosh Hoshana Eve I went to synagogue. </sentence><sentence id="949">I didn't even go inside. </sentence><sentence id="950">I stayed outside the entire time, but I was there. </sentence><sentence id="951">You know, I just felt that I had to express that I was part of that group but I wasn't going to pray because the prayers meant nothing to me. </sentence><sentence id="952">The prayers are sometimes very pretty if you look at them in terms of poetry, but I really don't believe in God. </sentence><sentence id="953">I really don't believe in that at all. </sentence><sentence id="954">So, my religion would be expressed in terms of how people should relate to one another and nothing to do with some superior being. </sentence><sentence id="955">I'm a scientist and I don't believe in that at all. </sentence></p></dialogue>
