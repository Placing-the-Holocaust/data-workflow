<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3">Q: Will you just begin by telling me your name during the war and date of birth and where you were born? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="5">A: Okay, well my name during the war was -- I had several names, but the name I was born to was Annaliza and I was born in Antwerp Belgium in December 1936. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="7">Q: So you were very young at the time before the war. </sentence><sentence id="8">You probably don't have too much memory about what was happening prior to the war? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="11">A: No, only very sporadic memories of my father and memories that perhaps are based on stories more than memories but I do think I have very clear pictures of going to the park with my dad and playing with him and doing things that normally you would expect a boy to do with a father rather than a little girl and I thought that people usually ask me why I chose a profession that I chose and although my father was a very orthodox Jewish man and certainly would have never admitted to that feeling I think that I was his first born and I think he considered me in some ways his son. </sentence><sentence id="12">I remember the feeling of going to the park and playing with him and him being perhaps more involved with a child, particularly a man of his generation than you'd expect him to be particularly with a girl. </sentence><sentence id="13">That's what I remember. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="17">Q: You had a comfortable family life? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="19">A: Yes. </sentence><sentence id="20">I remember having two dear little friends who lived with us in the same house, and my grandfather and just pictures mostly not -- I remember I had a little friend who's exactly my age a few months older and his sister who was two years younger and we lived in the same house and we were constantly fighting cats and dogs. </sentence><sentence id="21">We couldn't be without one another. </sentence><sentence id="22">So, we almost really always be together and I also remember that I didn't like dolls and I used to get dolls and I used to give them to my little girlfriend. </sentence><sentence id="23">She loved the dolls. </sentence><sentence id="24">That's what I remember. </sentence><sentence id="25">I remember being very comfortable. </sentence><sentence id="26">I'm sure we were not comfortable I mean financially but I had a very nice feeling about the family. </sentence><sentence id="27">I mean just my grandfather was a very sweet old man. </sentence><sentence id="28">He used to tell me stories. </sentence><sentence id="29">That's basically all I remember. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="41">Q: Now what kind of business was your father in? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="43">A: I'm not sure. </sentence><sentence id="44">I think he started out delivering milk and learning how to be a diamond cutter or something of the sort. </sentence><sentence id="45">He was very, very religious. </sentence><sentence id="46">I remember that. </sentence><sentence id="47">He was always going to synagogue, coming from synagogue and praying an awful lot. </sentence><sentence id="48">In my head it seemed like too much. </sentence><sentence id="49">It seemed like not a very tense life. </sentence><sentence id="50">He was going to work and coming home and we observed the Sabbath. </sentence><sentence id="51">We would always go for walks in the park and things of that sort. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="61">Q: Did you have non-Jewish friends as well, or were you mostly in a Jewish community? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="63">A: I was strictly Jewish community before the war and to my knowledge, I don't think my parents knew anyone that wasn't Jewish except in an official capacity. </sentence><sentence id="64">I don't know, postman, policeman, -- no social interaction with non-Jews at all. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="67">Q: Your neighbors were Jewish as well? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="69">A: Yes. </sentence><sentence id="70">The ones I knew. </sentence><sentence id="71">I mean I was a kid so I don't remember everybody who lived there but I would say the majority were Jewish. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="75">Q: Now, your mother spoke of a lot anti-semitism in Belgium before the war. </sentence><sentence id="76">Do you have any images of that? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="79">A: The only one is a story that my mom told me and that sort of became an indication of my early rebellion and that was at some point during these --right either at the beginning of the war or the pre-war period my grandfather was beaten up on the way back from synagogue or threatened or harassed and he I think people were pulling at his beard and he hid his beard in his coat. </sentence><sentence id="80">When he came home, he looked really terrible and very upset and he had told me that this was a Friday night that Friday night when men used to go to the synagogue they had a couple of angels who were watching over them and walking with them to and from synagogue. </sentence><sentence id="81">So, when he came back beaten and so on, I asked him Grandfather where were your angels then. </sentence><sentence id="82">So, that picture remained with me, his frightened look and the statement that I made then, I don't remember having made it, but it fits with the way I think. </sentence><sentence id="83">So, and several people that I have met, in fact recently, very recently just about three months ago when I was last in Belgium said you are this little girl who said that. </sentence><sentence id="84">They remember that statement. </sentence><sentence id="85">That's the only evidence I have of anti-semitism that touched us directly but before I really don't know. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="93">Q: Do you remember what your grandfather's response was to that? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="95">A: I don't think he said anything. </sentence><sentence id="96">He didn't say anything. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="99">Q: Did you ever have to wear the Star of David? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="101">A: Yes, I did. </sentence><sentence id="102">Both my mother and I wore it I think after the men, -- the husband of this neighbor and my dad were taken I think to go to a work camp, and we had to wear the star. </sentence><sentence id="103">One picture I have of that is that she used to always carry me over her should to hide her star so that we would travel in the trolley or something and she would carry me so that her star and mine were essentially hidden to avoid being harassed in the streets. </sentence><sentence id="104">She'd always do that, carry me. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="109">Q: Do you remember, and I assume we'll be getting into things that I think you probably have a very clear memory of -- do you remember when Belgium was occupied by Germany? </sentence><sentence id="110">Do you remember seeing troops or hearing noise? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="113">A: I remember having to leave in the middle of the night and walking through woods and being petrified and having German shepherds, hearing German shepherds barking in the distance and dragging and running through woods. </sentence><sentence id="114">I remember that, so I remember the German voices and the dogs, particularly the dogs and until maybe ten years ago I had to run if I saw any dog or heard a dog. </sentence><sentence id="115">So, I've overcome that too, but I really was very shaken by a dog. </sentence><sentence id="116">I couldn't go in a room -- and particularly a German shepherd, I would just freeze. </sentence><sentence id="117">I would completely decompensate so I remember that. </sentence><sentence id="118">I don't remember the streets of Belgium per se. </sentence><sentence id="119">I remember the terror of what appeared -- I saw my mother being frightened and I became completely petrified. </sentence><sentence id="120">I remember that march through the woods and ending up in some abandoned home somewhere and being there with a lot, a lot of people. </sentence><sentence id="121">I don't remember who these people were except for those friends that we were living with basically. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="131">Q: So you were running to hide from the Germans? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="133">A: Yes, we were running to try and escape because at some point after the two husbands had gone to work, during that period some people came into the house and they weren't really Nazis, but they pretended to be Gestapo and they beat up everyone in the house. </sentence><sentence id="134">My mother and my grandfather and me and they were really beating us and I remember screaming and my mother screaming. </sentence><sentence id="135">They finally left. </sentence><sentence id="136">They ransacked the place and they were looking for money and so on. </sentence><sentence id="137">They got in on the pretense of being Gestapo and -- </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="143">Q: These were just Belgium police? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="145">A: Yes, they were just Belgium police or Belgium hoodlums, not necessarily in any kind of official capacity. </sentence><sentence id="146">They might have just done that. </sentence><sentence id="147">This was a good time to do that. </sentence><sentence id="148">I mean it was perfectly acceptable. </sentence><sentence id="149">So, at that time my mother I think and her friend decided to leave and try to join the husbands and I think that this is when we went to France with the idea of trying to get to Switzerland because Switzerland was a safe place. </sentence><sentence id="150">If I remember when we got to the rondeveax essentially of where we were supposed to meet our fathers and someone to take us across the border, someone had betrayed and so that's when my parents went to the camps, the French camps &gt;&gt; Was one of the camps that they went to. </sentence><sentence id="151">I'm not exactly sure how we got out of there and they went to another camp and that period my friends and I went to that home that we were hidden in. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="159">Q: I just want to backtrack a second so I don't get confused. </sentence><sentence id="160">Now you had mentioned that your father and his friend your neighbor were sent to a work camp? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="163">A: In France. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="165">Q: This was before you went out into hiding into the woods? </sentence><sentence id="166">I'm trying to get the sequence here. </sentence><sentence id="167">If you remember, through researching any dates, maybe that would help me too. </sentence><sentence id="168">I mean that I know that you -- </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="173">A: I think the first time we left, because we left twice. </sentence><sentence id="174">The first time we might have gone all of us together to in France, and that must have been "40, "41 somewhere around there. </sentence><sentence id="175">And then we came back to Belgium. </sentence><sentence id="176">I think subsequently the men went to work again to that place in France. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="181">Q: Which was called? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="183">A: or something like that. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="185">Q: This was near I think? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="187">A: Yes, in the north of France somewhere. </sentence><sentence id="188">And during the period that they were away that's when we had the incident of people breaking into our home and then we left I think that's when we went through the woods and were supposed to meet up with the fathers and then supposed to meet up with someone who was going to take us across the border to Switzerland, but we didn't make it. </sentence><sentence id="189">So, and we got caught that time. </sentence><sentence id="190">The first time we were simply sent back home. </sentence><sentence id="191">The second time we got caught by the French police who then put us into these sort of transient camps which are really deportation but I certainly didn't know. </sentence><sentence id="192">I don't know how much my parents knew of what these places were going to lead to. </sentence><sentence id="193">I'm not sure they really knew. </sentence><sentence id="194">At some point they heard that people who left there never got back. </sentence><sentence id="195">I mean that through the grapevine that sort of information started to filter through and so they found that out and that's when I was in the children's home they were at a camp and that's when they decided to run out of the camp before they were sent to Germany. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="205">Q: Now, as I understand it, the second camp they went to was ? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="207">A: Right. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="209">Q: Were you in that at all with them? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="211">A: No, I think that when they were transferred to they had made some arrangements to take the children away and try to hide them, and that's when we were, my friends and I in that camp in that home near : </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="213">Q: Tell me a little bit about the home, who was there, what was it like? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="215">A: Well, the children ranged from about four of five years of age, somewhere around there until they looked very big to me, but actually they were 16. </sentence><sentence id="216">I think the oldest were 16 to 17. </sentence><sentence id="217">There was a mixture. </sentence><sentence id="218">They were all refugee children. </sentence><sentence id="219">Many of them were not Jewish and many were actually refugees from the Spanish civil war because this place was very close to Spain. </sentence><sentence id="220">It's in the part of France that borders on Spain almost so the catholic archdiocese of that area had taken in some children from that war and kept all of them together in that home. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="227">Q: So, this was a catholic home? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="229">A: It was a catholic run home but it ha connection to Jewish organization who was able to channel some of their kids into that particular home. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="231">Q: Now you were about how old then? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="233">A: At that time I must have been about seven, six or seven because I was born in "36 and that must have been "42, "43 somewhere around there. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="235">Q: How long were you in this home? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="237">A: In this home I was approximately eight to nine months and that part I remember quite well. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="239">Q: Tell me about it. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="241">A: Well, things that stand out hunger, real, real hunger. </sentence><sentence id="242">Nothing to eat, but that didn't bother me because I really didn't like to eat but I remember my little girlfriend, food was her thing. </sentence><sentence id="243">She was this plump little thing and you could always shut her up by giving her food. </sentence><sentence id="244">So, I used to run to the kitchen at night and steal whatever I could find and feed her because she was crying all night. </sentence><sentence id="245">She was crying because she was hungry, and I was crying because I wanted my mother. </sentence><sentence id="246">So, we were quite a pair. </sentence><sentence id="247">So, hunger -- and I knew there was nothing to eat and whatever there was I couldn't swallow. </sentence><sentence id="248">I just couldn't swallow any food there. </sentence><sentence id="249">The other thing I remember is lice and the worst incident which may look ridiculous now but was when you had lice they shaved your head, and I was very proud of my hair. </sentence><sentence id="250">I had really beautiful long hair and when I found out that I had lice and I could tell, because I was really itching. </sentence><sentence id="251">I hid in the outhouse. </sentence><sentence id="252">There was no indoor plumbing. </sentence><sentence id="253">There was indoor cold water to wash but no toilet. </sentence><sentence id="254">I hid in the outhouse for a couple of days and nobody could get me out of there because I knew as soon as they found out they would shave my head. </sentence><sentence id="255">So, but they eventually did. </sentence><sentence id="256">I had to get out. </sentence><sentence id="257">They shaved my head, and it was absolutely horrible, just horrible. </sentence><sentence id="258">Now, it looks kind of silly but and it wasn't just lice it was scabies, you know the things that crawl under your skin, so we were not really in very good shape. </sentence><sentence id="259">And there was always a feeling of fear and just terrible -- feeling terrible. </sentence><sentence id="260">First of all, not understanding at all why you were there what was happening, missing your family and just the terror basically. </sentence><sentence id="261">I think I acted irrationally on many occasions where I would just run out of the window in the middle of the night in the nightgown and just try to run away and being caught. </sentence><sentence id="262">You know, brought back to this, so we had songs but I don't know if they made them up or the older children probably did which referred to us having to wake up at 7:00 in the morning and having to wash with cold water and the son reflected that there was no food only some kind of vegetable, something like a sweet potatoes. </sentence><sentence id="263">That's why when people serve me sweet potato at Thanksgiving I say thanks but no thanks. </sentence><sentence id="264">I can't even look at the stuff. </sentence><sentence id="265">I don't know if it's the same, but it's so similar that it's enough to turn me off. </sentence><sentence id="266">That's all we had. </sentence><sentence id="267">SO, there was a song that reflected the realities of the time. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="295">Q: What was a normal day like in this home? </sentence><sentence id="296">What did you do? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="299">A: As little as possible. </sentence><sentence id="300">I mean I'm not a psychologist but if I look at myself back then I must have been -- I would qualify myself as a really depressed child, entirely depressed. </sentence><sentence id="301">I couldn't do much of anything. </sentence><sentence id="302">We were very regimented so we had to get up at 7:00 and we lined up. </sentence><sentence id="303">I don't know if you saw the several films about children's homes, catholic homes I think is one of them where children just line up and they wash and then they go to breakfast and then they go to prayer. </sentence><sentence id="304">They used to pray but we sort of didn't pray along. </sentence><sentence id="305">I believe that there were some kind of organized games, like playing ball or something like that and there were various levels of instructions, but I don't think I learned a tremendous amount. </sentence><sentence id="306">I just don't remember anything that was organized. </sentence><sentence id="307">There was some instruction but I'm sure the way I feel when I think about it I was just there, but I wasn't there basically. </sentence><sentence id="308">That was that. </sentence><sentence id="309">We had to make our rooms and we had to help in the kitchen. </sentence><sentence id="310">We had to peel the few potatoes there were, the sweet potatoes, whatever this vegetable was. </sentence><sentence id="311">We had to help clean up and that was it. </sentence><sentence id="312">There was nothing else going on. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="327">Q: Was it crowded? </sentence><sentence id="328">Did you sleep in the same area with a lot of other kids? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="331">A: Yes. </sentence><sentence id="332">There were two areas, there as a female area and there was a male area, boys and girls. </sentence><sentence id="333">We were lined up like in the old hospital wards, a number of beds together one next to another. </sentence><sentence id="334">We had essentially no possessions. </sentence><sentence id="335">We didn't have anything. </sentence><sentence id="336">We just had our beds and I don't remember if I had any change of clothes. </sentence><sentence id="337">I mean I don't think I had anything. </sentence><sentence id="338">Maybe they provided us with some old clothes, but we didn't have -- I don't remember having a cubicle I could call my own you know with my stuff. </sentence><sentence id="339">I had nothing. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="349">Q: How many kids were there? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="351">A: I really don't know. </sentence><sentence id="352">I'd say 100 or so, not more than that. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="355">Q: Were the people who took care of you nice? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="357">A: No, I don't think so, but it's hard to tell. </sentence><sentence id="358">I was just so unhappy. </sentence><sentence id="359">I don't have good feelings about anybody there, but it may not be them. </sentence><sentence id="360">I don't remember-- for instance, this incident with the hair, I thought they were barbarians when they did this. </sentence><sentence id="361">I felt that this was a middle age torture but in retrospect maybe that was the only way to deal with the lice. </sentence><sentence id="362">SO, I Thought they were mean, but maybe they weren't. </sentence><sentence id="363">I don't remember anybody being particularly kind to me or particularly paying attention to me but then they probably were understaffed and lots of kids and all of us were miserable and unhappy. </sentence><sentence id="364">I know for a fact that I was extremely rebellious and did exactly the opposite of what I was told. </sentence><sentence id="365">It didn't matter what it was, I would just fight it. </sentence><sentence id="366">I would continuously argue and fight scream run a way. </sentence><sentence id="367">So, you really would have to be a very well trained professional to handle a child of that condition and they weren't. </sentence><sentence id="368">I assume they were volunteers from the church or from other relief organizations and I guess they did the best they could but I can't say that there was somebody there that was nice. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="381">Q: You said you were there about eight or nine months, how did you get out of there? </sentence><sentence id="382">What were the circumstances? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="385">A: Well, the circumstances are a little bit muddled but apparently my parents send someone to pick us up from there because they were escaping to Nice to the part of France that was occupied by the Italians as to the Germans. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="387">Q: How did your parents get out of ? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="389">A: From what they told me is that they were told that they were going to be sent somewhere else and they sort of smelled a rat and they asked for one day off to come in and say goodbye to their children or visit their children and then of course they ran away to Nice during that supposed trip, but they didn't come to pick us up because they were afraid. </sentence><sentence id="390">So, they apparently sent some lady to pick us up, but my friend whom I spoke to yesterday, said that this person was afraid to travel with three children, so she gave us the money and left and told us how to get there. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="393">Q: Were you the oldest? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="395">A: He and I were the oldest. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="397">Q: At age seven or eight? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="399">A: Yes. </sentence><sentence id="400">And I do remember parts of that trip like getting on trains and getting off trains and somehow getting to Nice, but I cannot recall the details of that but I know we made it. </sentence><sentence id="401">My recollection is that there was no adult with us and he confirmed that that this lady had at least given us the money, she didn't take it and run, but she was afraid to travel with three children. </sentence><sentence id="402">She thought -- the way we looked with our shaven heads and with the lice and the scabs. </sentence><sentence id="403">We really looked awful so she decided to just tell us how to get there. </sentence><sentence id="404">We had grown up pretty quickly, and we got there. </sentence><sentence id="405">We simply made the rondevoux with our parents in Nice. </sentence><sentence id="406">That was --that's why I say it sounds like it's not true and just like a dream, but it is true. </sentence><sentence id="407">We did get there and we did find our parents. </sentence><sentence id="408">But I then in Nice it actually was a very happy period. </sentence><sentence id="409">It sounds also crazy but we were living in a hotel and in the same hotel we had Italian soldiers and they were very, very nice. </sentence><sentence id="410">They were not too interested in what the directives were from the Nazi government. </sentence><sentence id="411">I remember them giving me chocolate and I used to go up with them and play with them. </sentence><sentence id="412">I mean they were just very lovely people. </sentence><sentence id="413">And we were together but the remnants of that previous experience were there with me and so by that time I was eight or so and I was wetting my bed and I was screaming, having nightmares every night and waking up and screaming even though the days were fairly happy, the nights were just terrible, really terrible. </sentence><sentence id="414">But that stands out as a nice time in Nice because we were all together and we would go to the beach and I wasn't at the time fully realizing -- we lived pretty much for the present. </sentence><sentence id="415">As a child in general you don't anticipate much in the future, you know, at that age. </sentence><sentence id="416">We were together and we were having a good time. </sentence><sentence id="417">I could not imagine that first of all things would get worse again and that was not a temporary arrangement, that it wasn't a full time solution to the problem. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="437">Q: I don't understand Nice was under Italian occupation, Italian German occupation? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="439">A: Right. </sentence><sentence id="440">But Italian, not German. </sentence><sentence id="441">The Germans came in later, so it really was strictly Italian. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="445">Q: Did you have total freedom as Jews at this time? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="447">A: Officially no because the official party line of the Italian Nazi government with Mussolini was also that Jews had to be deported and rounded up, but the orders were not quite as effective and there was very little discipline in the Italian army, and those people who were in the army just couldn't care less whether we were Jews or something else. </sentence><sentence id="448">They simply couldn't care less so we were supposed to officially hide that we were Jews, but they knew fully well we were and I think we were fairly free to go and do as we pleased. </sentence><sentence id="449">I'm not sure, I think that the order of deportation sort of depended on your nationality and so my parents at the time might have become Czechoslovakian or something like that and giving me a different name and that name I don't remember. </sentence><sentence id="450">If you had Czechoslovakian papers it really didn't matter at the time whether you were Jewish or not. </sentence><sentence id="451">For a short period of time the authorities respected the nationality versus your ethnic background. </sentence><sentence id="452">That didn't last, but for a short period of time it was that way and the soldiers who were supposed to execute the orders couldn't care less. </sentence><sentence id="453">I mean they just did not round up people. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="461">Q: So, you were in Nice leading what you felt was a pretty nice life in the daytime anyway? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="463">A: Yes. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="465">Q: Do you remember about how long you were there? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="467">A: I would say also about ten months or so approximately and then when Italy capitulated and the Germans came marching in through the part of France that had previously been occupied by the Italians. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="469">Q: When was this? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="471">A: The end of --must have been the beginning of "44 or somewhere around there, I think. </sentence><sentence id="472">The war was over in "45 and we were in for perhaps a year, so I'd say'44 or so, but maybe you can check the accuracy of that. </sentence><sentence id="473">At that point the news spread rather quickly that -- well they already knew what the Germans were doing to various people in various other places, so when they heard that Germans were coming they decided to run and again try to get to Switzerland the second time around. </sentence><sentence id="474">Things moved very quickly so it also became known that entire families were subject to being arrested and they would be preferable for women and children were still sort of led through without being bothered or had a better chance. </sentence><sentence id="475">So, my mother and her friend and neighbor and my two little friends, we decided to leave from these to a border town Switzerland and to leave the men behind and they were going to try and find someway to get there, not by public transportation but try to arrange some kind of private way to join us. </sentence><sentence id="476">From there we were going to try and get through to Switzerland together. </sentence><sentence id="477">So, the train trip was uneventful, I mean my mother and myself and her friend and her two little children went along and we got to a place where I don't know if we stayed in a hotel or I don't know where we stayed exactly. </sentence><sentence id="478">In the meantime my father and his friend was going to come by ambulance. </sentence><sentence id="479">They had found someone who was going to drive an ambulance and take them as being ill. </sentence><sentence id="480">So, they established a point of meeting which was a block from the hotel where we had stayed. </sentence><sentence id="481">My father for some really stupid reason decided to go back to his hotel room because he had forgotten his prayer shawl and his , and when he got to the hotel the Germans were there. </sentence><sentence id="482">So, he didn't make it. </sentence><sentence id="483">They arrested him. </sentence><sentence id="484">Apparently Mr. waited until the evening and then the ambulance driver says I'm not going to stay any longer because we're going to get picked up. </sentence><sentence id="485">So, they left and they came and dropped off Mr. Shimmer wherever we were. </sentence><sentence id="486">And then I remember this most horrendous scene of my mother collapsing when she saw him come in alone. </sentence><sentence id="487">She immediately knew that something was very, very wrong. </sentence><sentence id="488">I just remember her just totally going completely hysterical and screaming and pulling out her hair and to me this was just the most frightening because I just came out from something that was relatively safe, and it just was everything fell apart. </sentence><sentence id="489">We stayed together for a while with those people and the family had their parents at least. </sentence><sentence id="490">The woman had her parents in Switzerland and so they decided to really push on and try to get to Switzerland and my mother at that point said she didn't care anymore. </sentence><sentence id="491">She just didn't care, and she decided to stay put in , which was the town where we were at. </sentence><sentence id="492">At that point we got papers from people who proceeded us and who we paid a lot of money to get those fake papers. </sentence><sentence id="493">So, we changed our name again. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="519">Q: To a French name? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="521">A: A French name so my name was . [ </sentence><sentence id="522">had one or two names in between but I just don't remember and that was a terrible thing because they tell you you are no longer such and such but you are such and such, and you keep repeating it to yourself until you actually believe that you are this other person. </sentence><sentence id="523">It gets extremely confusing. </sentence><sentence id="524">At that point, I must have been around eight or so, eight and half, and I mean I was very angry. </sentence><sentence id="525">At that point I just became very, very angry about everything and we moved into an apartment in a private house where they were -- actually it was owned by the people who lived downstairs and there were two floors above. </sentence><sentence id="526">The first floor was inhabited by a Jewish family who were German Jews. </sentence><sentence id="527">They had become French, but they were German Jews originally, and then we had an apartment which was not really a real apartment but just under the roof where the roof actually meets the floor. </sentence><sentence id="528">It's called , like an attic apartment essentially. </sentence><sentence id="529">I don't know if we had three or four rooms there, but really two rooms maybe, just two room, one which was an everything room and one which was a bedroom. </sentence><sentence id="530">We stayed there pretty much to the end of the war with the false identity and at that time, my mother became involved with the resistance not officially part of it but harboring people who were in the resistance and also harboring a lot of people who were in transient trying to get to Switzerland. </sentence><sentence id="531">She would provide them with hiding place and with food and when they left they left their papers behind and we'd get their ration cards for food. </sentence><sentence id="532">So, at that point, we were really wealthy in terms of food availability. </sentence><sentence id="533">It was a time for me where I was pretty much like a street child. </sentence><sentence id="534">I did whatever I wanted. </sentence><sentence id="535">I was supposed to go to school but I never did. </sentence><sentence id="536">I mean I said I was going but I played hookey and I was hanging out with sort of the worst characters of the town, but compared to what worst characters are now, I guess they were pretty mild. </sentence><sentence id="537">But we just would go and hide and play. </sentence><sentence id="538">We'd play three musketeers and we'd play all these fighting games. </sentence><sentence id="539">I didn't go to school, I just never showed up, and when I was there I was so disruptive that they used to throw me out, so it really didn't matter. </sentence><sentence id="540">But I learned how to read by myself. </sentence><sentence id="541">Two things I was doing. </sentence><sentence id="542">I was reading voraciously. </sentence><sentence id="543">I didn't understand a thing of what I was reading. </sentence><sentence id="544">I just simply didn't understand. </sentence><sentence id="545">I was just reading books and books. </sentence><sentence id="546">Whatever it was, it didn't matter what it was. </sentence><sentence id="547">It could have been the phone book. </sentence><sentence id="548">It didn't matter. </sentence><sentence id="549">It was an escape, you know, and I could just not be in the present. </sentence><sentence id="550">It was away from everything. </sentence><sentence id="551">I had another friend then who lived nearby. </sentence><sentence id="552">I was friends with all the village kids, basically. </sentence><sentence id="553">Then, the people who were renting us the place were very, very nice. </sentence><sentence id="554">They were French, but they pretended not to know, but they knew of course that we were Jewish. </sentence><sentence id="555">They never questioned anything, but they knew and I used to go to church with them on Sundays because it was kind of accepted and would be better that I would show up. </sentence><sentence id="556">And my mother's French was not great. </sentence><sentence id="557">It still has a very foreign accent, whereas I as a child had really become completely fluent from that time in Nice and in that home I was perfectly fluent so I could pass for French kid easily. </sentence><sentence id="558">They thought it would be a good idea for me to go to church, so at least the child goes even if the mother doesn't show up. </sentence><sentence id="559">I was quite taken by that service. </sentence><sentence id="560">As much as I had been anti-religious to my own religion, there was something very comforting about the church and the priests and there was a very safe feeling in that big building and the way the voices resounded. </sentence><sentence id="561">That I remember that feeling for the church. </sentence><sentence id="562">Now, I hate the catholic church, but I really felt very comforted by that whole atmosphere. </sentence><sentence id="563">The daughter of the people who were renting the place to us had her solemn communion as they call it, and I was very envious. </sentence><sentence id="564">They wore this white dress and this white veil and to me this was like I don't know, utopia, to be able to do all these things. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="611">Q: Do you think unconsciously anyway that you knew these people were not being annihilated the way Jews were. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="613">A: Oh, I knew that going to church was a safe thing that once you belonged to that group you were okay. </sentence><sentence id="614">So, I guess it was wanting to be safe and wanting to be part of another group. </sentence><sentence id="615">I mean I knew that I couldn't tell who I was. </sentence><sentence id="616">And, as I said, I was really very angry and I was very nasty. </sentence><sentence id="617">One of the people that my mother had taken in in the meantime until they got someone to take them to Switzerland was extremely fearful for good reasons and was not leaving the apartment at all. </sentence><sentence id="618">I mean it was just really sequestered and would not go out. </sentence><sentence id="619">My mother was circulating freely with her fake papers. </sentence><sentence id="620">I mean if they would really look into it they would have found that her French was not great and she would have been picked up, but she braved it so to speak. </sentence><sentence id="621">I certainly could pass for a French kid, but this man and his wife were there and they were absolutely petrified. </sentence><sentence id="622">He, in particular was just I mean, he wouldn't leave and we had curfews where we had all the windows and so on, and I used to come home supposedly from school, but from wherever I was hanging out and I would scream at the top of my lungs for him to come down and I used to tell him that he had to carry my bookcase up. </sentence><sentence id="623">I had this little thing, and if he didn't I was going to give him away to the Germans. </sentence><sentence id="624">You could see the warped feelings that in some way I could pass for not being Jewish. </sentence><sentence id="625">I convinced myself that I was catholic and I was going to be find. </sentence><sentence id="626">I also knew this wasn't true, but somehow I took it out on this poor guy who was really terribly frightened. </sentence><sentence id="627">I mean I can still see myself standing at the foot of those stairs and screaming, you come there and pick up my bag and if you don't I'm going to tell on you. </sentence><sentence id="628">He would come, you know, he would just come. </sentence><sentence id="629">He didn't know what to say. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="648">Q: You were trying to exercise some sort of control? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="650">A: Yes, like I could go out and he couldn't. </sentence><sentence id="651">But deep inside I knew this was just really not true, but somehow we managed to fake him out a little longer and he didn't have papers and he did nothing and he didn't know French, and he looked real Jewish. </sentence><sentence id="652">He would have been picked up very quickly. </sentence><sentence id="653">In incidents like that where I was just doing really nasty, very nasty things. </sentence><sentence id="654">They were really a way of saying, you know, I can do what I want basically. </sentence><sentence id="655">I'm not going to school. </sentence><sentence id="656">I can just do whatever. </sentence><sentence id="657">Nobody can tell me what to do. </sentence><sentence id="658">There were some terrible moments for me because my mother was frequently gone, and I never knew if she was going to come back, and there were nights where there were alarms for bomb raids, and those were really horrible. </sentence><sentence id="659">They were just just horrible. </sentence><sentence id="660">I would be totally, totally petrified and I had to run to the shelter by myself. </sentence><sentence id="661">I was afraid to get out of bed let alone -- it was all in the dark-- let alone go down the stairs and go to the shelter by myself. </sentence><sentence id="662">I usually managed to somehow make it to the people below and we'd go together. </sentence><sentence id="663">So, when she wasn't home, but then to go back to my place. </sentence><sentence id="664">I mean she didn't want to always say that she was leaving, you know, to the other people. </sentence><sentence id="665">You don't know. </sentence><sentence id="666">They could put a trace on her. </sentence><sentence id="667">She was going to Switzerland. </sentence><sentence id="668">She was getting watches and she was then going to Paris and she was selling them. </sentence><sentence id="669">She was doing all sorts of weird things just to get some money to survive, and she was helping people get across the border, so she really never wanted to say what she was doing and she didn't tell me either. </sentence><sentence id="670">She would just tell me I'll be back as soon as I can, but to an eight year old, that's not that reassuring particularly having been separation where I didn't know if I ever was going to see her again having seen her reaction to my father's disappearance and knowing that that certainly was not really good. </sentence><sentence id="671">I was really scared, I mean really, really scared. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="694">Q: Was the bomb shelter in your building or in the town? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="696">A: It was not in the building, it was somewhere further away. </sentence><sentence id="697">I don't exactly know where it was, but we had to go walk in the dark, run basically and to this day I must say that I'm still afraid of the dark. </sentence><sentence id="698">If I'm in the house alone, I'll have every light on. </sentence><sentence id="699">I just won't be -- I really have to talk to myself to be able to turn off all the lights and say nothing will happen. </sentence><sentence id="700">We were in the dark because of curfew to begin with and then you weren't going to start taking flashlights going to a shelter. </sentence><sentence id="701">That was really better. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="708">Q: The Jewish family on the first floor, did people know they were Jewish? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="710">A: Well, they looked awfully Jewish, but they were French citizens and so they thought -- I don't remember, or I don't think that papers in France said that you were Jewish. </sentence><sentence id="711">The French documents, I don't think that they mentioned religion but I'm not sure. </sentence><sentence id="712">They looked awfully Jewish, because she had a wig, but he was a lawyer and he was a very distinguished gentleman, German origin, and perhaps he thought that was going to save them. </sentence><sentence id="713">It turned out that he was picked up a day or two before the liberation and he never made it back. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="718">Q: Did you help your mom with any of these activities in small ways or --? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="720">A: Well, I'm sure I helped just with housekeeping things. </sentence><sentence id="721">I'm sure I did some of the shopping where she'd send me to buy food. </sentence><sentence id="722">I remember going to the grocery store and doing all of that stuff. </sentence><sentence id="723">In a more concrete way in terms of I mean I remember seeing all these people, being upset because sometimes we had ten twelve people sleeping in one room. </sentence><sentence id="724">We had five or six people in one bed, so I was not thrilled and I did sort of threaten some of these people, but for the most part I was probably helping her as much as I could. </sentence><sentence id="725">I know that as I said I'm sure I did the shopping and I brought food home and I helped her with cleaning up and that sort of thing. </sentence><sentence id="726">I didn't go to Paris with her to sell watches. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="734">Q: It's interesting that your mother, as you described it, really fell apart when she didn't see your father, and yet it sounds like she was pretty courageous. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="736">A: She was extremely courageous but she was courageous throughout but that first impact, that first shock and this is what I remember. </sentence><sentence id="737">Now, I think there's nothing worse for a child than to see the mother fall apart. </sentence><sentence id="738">As long as the mother is still in tact then they know they have somebody to lean on. </sentence><sentence id="739">I realize at that moment that something terrible had happened to my father but I didn't realize exactly what but when I saw her, it just hit me like a sledge hammer. </sentence><sentence id="740">She was really gone. </sentence><sentence id="741">I mean she was just not -- I don't know that it lasted a few hours and maybe the next day she sort of composed herself and she certainly picked up the pieces and went on and survived, and not only survived but helped me survive. </sentence><sentence id="742">There is no question about it, I would not survive without her. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="750">Q: When you think back on the kind of person your mother is, do you think it was predictable that she would get so involved in illicit activities like this? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="752">A: No, not at all. </sentence><sentence id="753">But one thing about her is that even though she came from this small village from this very orthodox background, she was quite somewhat of a maverick within her generation. </sentence><sentence id="754">She was orphaned very early, I don't know if she told you that, but she was about six years old when her mother passed away, mother and one brother went with the Russian flu, so she was very young at the time. </sentence><sentence id="755">She became really the housekeeper for her father for a short period of time, his mother came and took care of the household, and then she got killed in some stupid accident. </sentence><sentence id="756">She got kicked in the belly by a horse. </sentence><sentence id="757">She went to market, so she lost her grandmother maybe a year after that. </sentence><sentence id="758">So, she really became the woman of the house at age eight or nine or something, so she was quite independent. </sentence><sentence id="759">She had to be. </sentence><sentence id="760">She's a really intelligent person and she was always interested in a lot of things so she became interested in zionism, and so she took Hebrew lessons secretly because it certainly was considered inappropriate for a girl to do that. </sentence><sentence id="761">So let's say that it's not totally out of character to do things which one would not have expected of a woman of that generation and that background. </sentence><sentence id="762">She adapted. </sentence><sentence id="763">She learned Hebrew, she learned French. </sentence><sentence id="764">She even learned English at that point on her own. </sentence><sentence id="765">She didn't have any formal schooling, and she's really a very educated person and it's all self made. </sentence><sentence id="766">I think that she had no inclinations to be a delinquent let's say but certainly to take charge of herself when needed, and so she did. </sentence><sentence id="767">This was the only thing that was opened to her, so she did that. </sentence><sentence id="768">I mean the smuggling of the watches with the resistance that was really self preservation. </sentence><sentence id="769">I think to some extent she I don't know that she really cared that much about herself at that point. </sentence><sentence id="770">I think she just forgot about herself. </sentence><sentence id="771">She just did things for the wider picture if you wish, but she was no longer afraid for herself. </sentence><sentence id="772">She sort of thought well, you know the worst has happened as far as her husband is concerned. </sentence><sentence id="773">She had to leave her father behind in Belgium. </sentence><sentence id="774">She couldn't take him because he wouldn't come. </sentence><sentence id="775">He had to cut his beard off and he wouldn't do that so he stayed behind. </sentence><sentence id="776">She already had lost her mother and a brother so somehow she felt it doesn't matter anymore. </sentence><sentence id="777">There was her child, and so I think she did a lot for me, for my sake. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="805">Q: Even though the people like your landlord who probably looked the other way and knew you were Jewish and was very kind, he must have had some concerns about all the people coming in and out of your attic apartment. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="807">A: He might have, but I wasn't aware of any frictions. </sentence><sentence id="808">That she could tell you much better. </sentence><sentence id="809">I was very welcome in their household. </sentence><sentence id="810">These people were -- he had been a fighter in World War I and he had actually lost a leg or suffered a severe injury so he was limping or had a wooden leg. </sentence><sentence id="811">I just remember him limping rather heavily, and she was just a very sweet lady and they could not have children. </sentence><sentence id="812">In fact their daughter was a adopted one. </sentence><sentence id="813">She was one of 14. </sentence><sentence id="814">The woman's sister had 14 children so she adopted her youngest. </sentence><sentence id="815">Then I was sort of a welcome addition in a sense because she had hoped to have a large household with a lot of children, and she didn't. </sentence><sentence id="816">I felt so good in that household. </sentence><sentence id="817">It was very warm and just normal. </sentence><sentence id="818">Basically it was just normal. </sentence><sentence id="819">So, that I really always felt very good there, and my mother still writes to them every Christmas. </sentence><sentence id="820">Every Christmas she sends them a box of chocolates. </sentence><sentence id="821">The older couple is now gone, but the one girl, the one whose communion I envied so much is now a grandmother. </sentence><sentence id="822">She's in her 60s. </sentence><sentence id="823">I don't think there could have been too much antagonism. </sentence><sentence id="824">Like I said, he fought in World War I and he was not very fond of the Germans at all, and he was a really strong French patriot and this invasion did not sit too well with him, and he was sort of in a way sorry that he was too old to fight. </sentence><sentence id="825">So, I think in that sense, he knew we were Jewish, but he wasn't quite too sure and all that activity to him sort of looked like a good thing in the sense of being resisting the occupation. </sentence><sentence id="826">Although he wasn't personally involved in my knowledge, he sort of turned away. </sentence><sentence id="827">They were in their 60s at the time I think. </sentence><sentence id="828">They looked very old to me, but again, now that I'm going to 58, it doesn't look that old. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="851">Q: How did you hear about the liberation? </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="857">Q: Do you remember when this was? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="859">A: It was May 8 of "45, I think. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="861">Q: This area wasn't liberated until then? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="863">A: No, I don't think so. </sentence><sentence id="864">It was the final -- it was when they gave up. </sentence><sentence id="865">There was no liberation there in France. </sentence><sentence id="866">I mean they were there until the very last, because they picked up this gentleman, my neighbor, a few days before, literally a few days before. </sentence><sentence id="867">She had a baby right then after he was gone and something really very moving. </sentence><sentence id="868">My mother went to the maternity with her, for the delivery, and he turned 50, this young man just recently and his mother lives in Israel and so does he and the mother called up my mother from Israel to remind her of the night when she gave birth that she had been present at that time. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="869">That was 40 years ago, so that "44, the end of "44 beginning of "45. </sentence><sentence id="870">I don't think it was liberated before that. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="871"> End of Tape 1 Tape 2 </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="872">A: When we went back to Belgium on that final trip back, we stopped again, me and my complete negative and angry nasty self, we stopped several times on the road to drink and at one point the only thing that was available was beer and I said I would rather die than drink beer. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="892">Q: You were all alone then? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="894">A: At that point I remained with the landlords. </sentence><sentence id="895">I was in the apartment, but in the same house. </sentence><sentence id="896">I had been pretty much alone for a long time, so at that point I wasn't even all that scared because it sounded good. </sentence><sentence id="897">So, as I said my mother came back. </sentence><sentence id="898">I don't know how long she was gone, whether it was a week or a month. </sentence><sentence id="899">I don't know. </sentence><sentence id="900">She said we are going back. </sentence><sentence id="901">She had found my dad and that was that. </sentence><sentence id="902">So, we went back and finding him was the real disappointment, because he had changed from the memories. </sentence><sentence id="903">I mean I had this illusion you know as a four year old child your father and the way he was involved with me and he was really -- he was not the same person and by then I was nine years old and I could see things very differently. </sentence><sentence id="904">He came back. </sentence><sentence id="905">I saw him, he had no hair. </sentence><sentence id="906">His teeth were shaking. </sentence><sentence id="907">He looked like a skeleton. </sentence><sentence id="908">He just looked frightening to me, very frightening. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="924">Q: Where had he been? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="926">A: He had been in Auschwitz mostly. </sentence><sentence id="927">And, he was extremely -- he had become very impatient and irritable and I just wanted to cling to him and it was broken. </sentence><sentence id="928">It just wasn't there anymore. </sentence><sentence id="929">We were just coming from different places all together, and he had become even more religious and rigid about it. </sentence><sentence id="930">I had at that point completely rejected. </sentence><sentence id="931">I mean I just couldn't deal with that at all. </sentence><sentence id="932">I was doing whatever I wanted during the war. </sentence><sentence id="933">Certainly not observing the Sabbath, and all of a sudden we're back to not turning on lights, and not going to the movies on Saturday and all that sort of stuff. </sentence><sentence id="934">I just couldn't deal with that at all. </sentence><sentence id="935">I mean I just couldn't deal with that. </sentence><sentence id="936">So, we had lots of fights, really a big arguments and right after we came back we lived in a place that belonged to one of the people that we had met in , a Jewish lady whose husband did not come back and who had owned a house with her husband and so we lived in that place and I remember the three of us, my mom, my dad, and I sleeping in the bed and he was having the worse nightmares and he would scream int he middle of the night and of course I would just relive all my terrors. </sentence><sentence id="937">It was just not what I had hoped for or what my fantasies had about how it was going to be when my dad came back. </sentence><sentence id="938">The reality was very, very different. </sentence><sentence id="939">Not only that, we pretty much had no money so we had very cheap bed and the bed would collapse every so often so between the screaming and the collapsing bed I mean it was really terrible and we didn't have any warm water. </sentence><sentence id="940">We just had a pump in the kitchen. </sentence><sentence id="941">It really was very primitive. </sentence><sentence id="942">And then in my view what really made things completely disastrous was when my father found out about his surviving relatives in Russia. </sentence><sentence id="943">He sent for them, and where I was really craving just my mom and my dad, all of a sudden these people descended upon us. </sentence><sentence id="944">There were two brothers, a sister and a grandfather, and we all lived together. </sentence><sentence id="945">There were ten people every day, all the time without any space for anybody. </sentence><sentence id="946">It was literally a nightmare. </sentence><sentence id="947">To me, this was a nightmare. </sentence><sentence id="948">I resented them for a long time. </sentence><sentence id="949">I mean there was nothing else to do but I really couldn't say I was very thrilled with that whole set up and then to top it off, my brother was born. </sentence><sentence id="950">My mother couldn't handle it. </sentence><sentence id="951">She simply couldn't handle the food for all these people, so I essentially was trusted as the permanent babysitter for my brother. </sentence><sentence id="952">I was in charge of him basically. </sentence><sentence id="953">I had nothing to say about it. </sentence><sentence id="954">I had to feed him and dress him and just take care of him, except for going to school. </sentence><sentence id="955">Things were just not great. </sentence><sentence id="956">Then, at that point, all my fears came through. </sentence><sentence id="957">I could not stay alone. </sentence><sentence id="958">I tried, I remember that my parents wanted to go for a walk on a Friday night after dinner and I would say sure I'll stay, and as soon as they walked out I was just overcome by such fear that I would just scream by myself in the house and my neighbor upstairs would come and get me. </sentence><sentence id="959">I was trying. </sentence><sentence id="960">I always said, sure you can go. </sentence><sentence id="961">I'm fine. </sentence><sentence id="962">I'm great, no problem. </sentence><sentence id="963">As soon as maybe five minutes after they walked it would just come and engulf me and I couldn't really function very well. </sentence><sentence id="964">Then school was another nightmare because we were people of all ages put into the same class. </sentence><sentence id="965">Now, I was put in the right grade for my age, but I really knew nothing. </sentence><sentence id="966">I just knew how to read because I had read -- and I spoke French beautifully because finally I began to understand what I was reading and I developed a very nice vocabulary. </sentence><sentence id="967">So, on account of that they decided to put me in the proper grade for my age. </sentence><sentence id="968">I knew nothing, so I was in school feeling like I was among -- just what am I doing here. </sentence><sentence id="969">I don't know, but I made it. </sentence><sentence id="970">I don't know how I made it. </sentence><sentence id="971">I just picked up whatever had to picked up and there were people there who were speaking Polish and there were people speaking Yiddish and there were those who were speaking German and I was speaking French. </sentence><sentence id="972">The teachers were themselves, they came from concentration camps or other places. </sentence><sentence id="973">They didn't know anything about anything except they had sticks and when they misbehaved they hit us. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1023">Q: This was the Jewish school? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1025">A: Yes. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1027">Q: They just rounded up whom they could find as teachers and there were no one that you could really call a teacher. </sentence><sentence id="1028">But I don't know, I just somehow started to click and I became their prize student, so that was another thing that I always had this thing of taking out this anger in some way, so they had these donors, these potential donors and they were trying to raise funds. </sentence><sentence id="1029">It was a private school, so they would parade the bright kids around and they didn't have that many. </sentence><sentence id="1030">This was like an ape in the circus, do this trick and do this trick. </sentence><sentence id="1031">I would recite, they would ask me a question and I would always know the answers. </sentence><sentence id="1032">Then, after that, there was nothing in terms of discipline that I would obey. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="1039">We had these individual benches you know, and I would just run across on top of the benches and teachers would run after me with a ruler. </sentence><sentence id="1040">I mean some of these teachers are still alive and when they see me they say all this grey hair is from you. </sentence><sentence id="1041">I mean, I was just impossible. </sentence><sentence id="1042">When I think about it now, really I under normal circumstances would have gone to a reform school or something. </sentence><sentence id="1043">It sort of calmed down and at that point, somewhere around the age of nine or so or ten I said I'm going to do something with me life. </sentence><sentence id="1044">I'm not just going to be a housewife and sit here passively and have some guy tell me what to do. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1051">Q: At age 10? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1053">A: Yes. </sentence><sentence id="1054">I had a big argument with my mother's friends who told me I should think of getting married when I'm 18. </sentence><sentence id="1055">I said no way, not ever, and I decided to get there I had to get toa better school, and so I was in that school for two years. </sentence><sentence id="1056">This time in Belgium it's divided into six and six. </sentence><sentence id="1057">Elementary and then high school is six years, and I decided to go to the public high school. </sentence><sentence id="1058">The public high school which was at the time considered the top high school because from that one you could go straight to university without having to take special entrance examinations. </sentence><sentence id="1059">So, after two years I applied to that high school which was unfortunately in Flemish and that was a language I didn't know at all. </sentence><sentence id="1060">So, the only Flemish I knew was from talking to the cleaning woman who used to come once a week and that was the extent of it. </sentence><sentence id="1061">But I made it. </sentence><sentence id="1062">I mean I got in somehow. </sentence><sentence id="1063">I guess I faked it. </sentence><sentence id="1064">Whenever I think about it objectively I should have never gotten in there because my knowledge of everything was completely sporadic and having big gaps in various places. </sentence><sentence id="1065">I never learned how to do multiplication, things like that. </sentence><sentence id="1066">Big, big gaps, but I got into high school, because it wasn't automatic. </sentence><sentence id="1067">You had to apply to get into that particular school. </sentence><sentence id="1068">So, but there was anti-semitism in the high school. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1086">Q: After the war? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1088">A: After the war, quite a bit, and there was only two Jewish girls in that whole school, another one and myself. </sentence><sentence id="1089">We really had a tough time. </sentence><sentence id="1090">It took us years to be accepted and to make friends only a few friends we made on the whole the atmosphere was not welcoming at all, not at all. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1094">Q: Were you blamed for the war? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1096">A: No, but for instance my dad was religious at the time there was school on Saturdays, and he didn't allow me to go. </sentence><sentence id="1097">It was a horror show. </sentence><sentence id="1098">I already had missed so much school throughout my life and of course they put Latin and Greek and math and whatnot on Saturday. </sentence><sentence id="1099">This really is not easy, and the teachers refused to help. </sentence><sentence id="1100">I mean I would have to go every Saturday night -- I mean that's why I became even less attracted to the religion. </sentence><sentence id="1101">I had to go and beg from some girl who really didn't want to give me her notes for all the lectures that had been given that day and then try to work it out on my own because my father didn't know anything and my mother didn't know anything about that stuff. </sentence><sentence id="1102">The teachers just said, her statement was, "Well, you Jewish girls don't want to come to school on Saturday, you just work it out. </sentence><sentence id="1103">It's not my problem." </sentence><sentence id="1104">It makes you feel that after all that hearing this business about Jewish girls -- it was a secular school, it wasn't a school that was under any kind of religious aegis or directives. </sentence><sentence id="1105">That's what the public school was. </sentence><sentence id="1106">It was a secular school where there was religion given according to what you wanted so there was one hour you could choose either religion or ethics so you didn't have to attend -- because there was a catholic school system just as there is one here an official catholic school system. </sentence><sentence id="1107">So, the people who were there, weren't even observant, but they still had a feeling that we were foreigners. </sentence><sentence id="1108">Essentially the feeling was that we were foreigners. </sentence><sentence id="1109">We were different and foreign. </sentence><sentence id="1110">We did not feel very well there, really not, and then later they opened a Jewish high school and most Jewish kids now go to the Jewish high school, which is now fully accepted. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1126">Q: Still? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1128">A: Yes, oh yes. </sentence><sentence id="1129">They go to a Jewish high school, which the Jewish high school is accepted. </sentence><sentence id="1130">It's a completely official school and they can get from there to the university, again without entrance examinations, so and that's what I had wanted but there wasn't anything at the time. </sentence><sentence id="1131">We were, as I said, in fifth grade, everybody was together, all ages, all languages. </sentence><sentence id="1132">This high school developed just a few years after I started high school. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1139">Q: What happened to your grandfather? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1141">A: My grandfather I think was essentially beaten to death. </sentence><sentence id="1142">My mother's father, the one who's picture is there. </sentence><sentence id="1143">He refused his son, my mother's brother, left I believe it was the last boat that left Antwerp and they went to Brazil and then somehow got to the states, and he didn't want to go because you had to cut your beard to get on that boat. </sentence><sentence id="1144">I think when we fled, he refused to come for the same reason and so apparently my mother had asked a neighbor, a non Jewish neighbor to take care of him and she said she would but she heard when she came back to Belgium that he had essentially been beaten to death on the streets. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1149">Q: What other aspects to your life during these years do you think are real important to remember? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1151">A: You mean during the war years? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1153">Q: Yes. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1155">A: In what sense. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1157">Q: I don't know if I have all the right questions. </sentence><sentence id="1158">I think that we covered the areas that I had some idea about, and if there's anything else that you think would be useful to record that I haven't asked you, I want you to feel free to say it. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1161">A: In terms of who I am today, I would have liked all this activity around survivors of the war whatever events took part in their own lives to happen earlier because even as I tell these things and some of these things bring tears to my eyes so that i know that I still feel them, but they're not -- I think I'm now perhaps able and it hasn't been that long -- able to associate my reactions to trauma and whatever from the past. </sentence><sentence id="1162">So, it's hard for me to say now. </sentence><sentence id="1163">The worst part of it was the fear, you know the absolute terror that I can still invoke certain times thinking back particularly --the salient points were in that home where I just didn't know where anybody was. </sentence><sentence id="1164">And then when my dad was taken. </sentence><sentence id="1165">These were just terrible, terrible moments. </sentence><sentence id="1166">I know that until he died, my father -- I had many, many nightmares about anticipating his death that they were just really terrible and I was acting irrationally during many years in relation to him in terms of being so afraid that he would die that I could not even enjoy when I was near him. </sentence><sentence id="1167">He wasn't a well man, although he pulled together and rebuilt a life for himself and helped his brothers build their own lives, so he did a tremendous job. </sentence><sentence id="1168">I couldn't even appreciate any of this. </sentence><sentence id="1169">I was just always afraid of losing him so that was sort of something that marred my life for a long time. </sentence><sentence id="1170">In fact, I think I was liberated from that feeling only when he died. </sentence><sentence id="1171">When he finally died, I sort of gained some peace which seems sort of crazy, but that's what happened. </sentence><sentence id="1172">When he died, I said okay that's over. </sentence><sentence id="1173">He's really gone and he's not coming back. </sentence><sentence id="1174">That's it. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1189">Q: Are you at all religious today? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1191">A: No, I'm not, but I observe the traditions because I think they're pretty and perhaps only recently I have trouble with dogma in general. </sentence><sentence id="1192">I have trouble with authority, but there is sort of a deeper philosophy which guides the lives of those who are truly religious and I really don't refer to people who are shut off from the outside world like or that type of think. </sentence><sentence id="1193">I'm thinking of my brother who is really an exceptional human being in that he lives his religion. </sentence><sentence id="1194">This is who he is in terms of his interaction with his wife and his children, his family. </sentence><sentence id="1195">He lives in Jerusalem because that's the only place where he can be the full Jew in his view, but he's politically left wing so -- and when I see him, there's a deep meaning to the rituals that is not the superficial type of thing that many people see and rebel against which is the things that I rebel against. </sentence><sentence id="1196">You can't go here, things that look totally idiotic to me. </sentence><sentence id="1197">It's a lot easier to take an elevator let's say for a person my mother's age and condition than to walk upstairs. </sentence><sentence id="1198">That kind of thing, but when you go deeper and you make it part of an entire frame work and what it means, then I'm beginning to appreciate it although I think I live my life in a certain way in that sense, in terms of how I relate to my mother and to my family and I'm really a very good friend. </sentence><sentence id="1199">People know that I'm really a loyal friend, that you couldn't have a more loyal friend. </sentence><sentence id="1200">But I have no inclination to do the ritual, but I do like to go to synagogue on high holidays only because I identify with the group, because I like to be identified with the Jewish people. </sentence><sentence id="1201">I'm proud of them. </sentence><sentence id="1202">But not in terms of observing the things that I consider interfering with the conduct of modern life. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1215">Q: The obvious reason I asked that was clearly during the war years you appeared to be a little bit resentful of it and sort of embraced the security of the catholic church and all these other things and I think people certain people after the Holocaust felt stronger about their Judaism, some felt irrelevant. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1217">A: I don't want any part of it. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1219">Q: Or they had been abandoned by it. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1221">A: I think those that felt abandoned by it I felt abandoned by it, but as I said the story about my grandfather and the angels, I was maybe four years old when I asked him that, which I mean this is a logical question to ask. </sentence><sentence id="1222">Where are your angels, and there's no logical answer to that. </sentence><sentence id="1223">So, then of course there was no time to practice the religion after that whole incident because we weren't supposed to be Jews anymore. </sentence><sentence id="1224">That's one of the things I resented when my dad came back. </sentence><sentence id="1225">I embraced catholicism only because it represented a safe haven and not because of anything that had to do with Jesus or anything like that, didn't appeal to me very much. </sentence><sentence id="1226">What appealed to me really was the ritual and not the content. </sentence><sentence id="1227">What appeals to me in Judaism really is more the content and not the ritual. </sentence><sentence id="1228">The ethics behind it and so I think I'm a very Jewish person and I don't hide that anywhere. </sentence><sentence id="1229">Perhaps if I were in a place where nobody observed anything I would do it just to express my Judaism to the rest of the world that way, but I don't feel that I have to do that. </sentence><sentence id="1230">But as I said, I do identify with the group, so --my mother says that after the war my little girlfriend, the one that I had spent all this time with in the home and so on and we stayed friends for a while after. </sentence><sentence id="1231">She became religious and I wasn't, but a certain point in time we were going to synagogue for the high holidays and our mothers would try and make us pray and we would just giggle. </sentence><sentence id="1232">I mean that's all we'd do, we'd giggle. </sentence><sentence id="1233">We could just not do pray or do anything. </sentence><sentence id="1234">Then when I went to study, I left home and I went to Switzerland and the very first Rosh Hoshana Eve I went to synagogue. </sentence><sentence id="1235">I didn't even go inside. </sentence><sentence id="1236">I stayed outside the entire time, but I was there. </sentence><sentence id="1237">You know, I just felt that I had to express that I was part of that group but I wasn't going to pray because the prayers meant nothing to me. </sentence><sentence id="1238">The prayers are sometimes very pretty if you look at them in terms of poetry, but I really don't believe in God. </sentence><sentence id="1239">I really don't believe in that at all. </sentence><sentence id="1240">So, my religion would be expressed in terms of how people should relate to one another and nothing to do with some superior being. </sentence><sentence id="1241">I'm a scientist and I don't believe in that at all. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1264">Q: Anything else you want to add? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1266">A: Well, the only thing is that you can overcome anything. </sentence><sentence id="1267">You at some point have to take responsibility for your own life, no matter how bad. </sentence><sentence id="1268">If you do that, you won't be alone. </sentence><sentence id="1269">If you persist in living in the past and saying that you can't do anything and nothing is going to work out because you went through this terrible thing, then you will remain stagnate and people will shy away from you and you'll just be a very lonely person. </sentence><sentence id="1270">I like to be with people. </sentence><sentence id="1271">I don't like to be alone. </sentence><sentence id="1272">That's all I have to say. </sentence></p></dialogue>
