<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="4797">A: You have to imagine that the nearer the 16" of October came, yes, when I was a child, the more -- not of my mother, but of my siblings, and the relatives, was the urge to celebrate. </sentence><sentence id="4798">To celebrate a man and the innocentess of a man which I, even then, despised, yes, without really knowing what he has done, when I was young. </sentence><sentence id="4799">Nine, eight, 10, 11 years old. </sentence><sentence id="4800">And this is a big pleasure on a little soul like mine, when you are young. </sentence><sentence id="4801">And it was just a relief, it was just a relief. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="4817">But, your f-- your -- your father never rejected Hitler til the -- til the end. </sentence><sentence id="4818">And I-I'm just wondering if you see any parallel there, if you see any cause -- cause the whole book seems to be about fathers and sons. </sentence><sentence id="4819">Mostly about your relationship with your --with your father, but there's also -- I kept thinking, there's this -- there's some kind of filial relation between Hitler and -- and Hans Frank that's not being fulfilled,   137 Interview with Niklas Frank June 6, 2016 the way Hans Frank wants it to be fulfilled. </sentence><sentence id="4820">So that's not really a question, it's just sort of an observation, and a -- and a -- and -- and a--I-- I'm just wondering what you think about that -- that theory. </sentence><sentence id="4821">You can tell me it's bullshit, if you want. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="4847">You know, he -- he --I --I mean, you do that in general, but -- but there are several points where you're saying, you know, you didn't -- you didn't mean anything to Hitler. </sentence><sentence id="4848">Hitler didn't -- rejected you in the following way. </sentence><sentence id="4849">So I -- I thought that was sort of an interesting device to -- to -- to use. </sentence><sentence id="4850">Now I'm just sort of giving my own opinion, so I'm going to try and stop that. </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="4851">A: [""m thankful that you're giving this opinion. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="4853">Q: Let's see. </sentence><sentence id="4854">Oh, so okay, this is -- this is interesting. </sentence><sentence id="4855">What -- what did or do you think about the sort of minor criminals who s -- who escaped with their lives, and even went back to normal life? </sentence><sentence id="4856">Did you ever pursue any kind of -- legally, or as a -- to cover them journalistically, or try to expose them? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="4861">A: No. </sentence><sentence id="4862">I tried in all my articles to defend democracy, but I started as a cultural editor, so I wa -- mostly together with the German writers, and actors, and so. </sentence><sentence id="4863">And later on, when I was a war correspondent for "Stern" magazine, it was also quite another thing to deal with. </sentence><sentence id="4864">And no, it -- it's now -- now I am doing it, with my last book on this earth, about denazification. </sentence><sentence id="4865">I went into the -- into the archives in Germany, too, and telling them, I don't give you names, but you hand me over files from A to Zed, just to get a clue what's a middle class, lower Nazis, th-the -- the  Interview with Niklas Frank -- June 6, 2016 Firher of villages and of some areas, what they have done, and how do they defend themselves? </sentence><sentence id="4866">And it was really great. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="4900">Q: Just in Germany. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="4902">A: Because now you can see, that I never thought about refugees, because it was a brand new problem, and you see it exactly how the silent majority of the Germans  Interview with Niklas Frank " June 6, 2016 really think, how they really behave, what -- and that -- wow, that I'm very much afraid of. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="4913">Q: Yeah. </sentence><sentence id="4914">And why? </sentence><sentence id="4915">What do you think is -- is the benefit? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="4919">A: The benefit is that maybe a little bit more people who are reading the newspaper, or who are attending the trial, find out what we have really done, and maybe they" ll think it over again, and acknowledge what we have done. </sentence><sentence id="4920">But most of them are very old now, about 95 years old, and the -- it's most -- most of them are gone. </sentence></p></dialogue>
