I mean, they each had their own profession. </sentence><sentence id="139">They all did. </sentence><sentence id="140">And...and we learned, and slowly we all learned French. </sentence><sentence id="141">I started to forget my German. </sentence><sentence id="142">And uh...we were there for awhile. </sentence><sentence id="143">And they had beautiful grounds and trees. </sentence><sentence id="144">They had fig trees. </sentence><sentence id="145">I remember that very well (laughter).And I do say that, being so young, I think you forget. </sentence><sentence id="146">You...you forget the bad things so quickly. </sentence><sentence id="147">And we were there long enough to be placed. </sentence><sentence id="148">Everyone was placed...uh to a different uh foster home. </sentence><sentence id="149">And I was placed to a foster home in Noyers, France--southern part of France. </sentence><sentence id="150">It was a Christian family, Catholic family. </sentence><sentence id="151">There was a husband, wife; and they had a grown daughter, and they had a very small farm. </sentence><sentence id="152">They had one cow, few chickens, a little garden. </sentence><sentence id="153">And they took me in as their foster child. </sentence><sentence id="154">And uh...then they told me that my name, Freya, was too German and I could not have a German name, a Jewish name, anymore. </sentence><sentence id="155">I had to become uh...a Catholic, if I wanted to survive. </sentence><sentence id="156">They talked to me, and they made me Frieda. </sentence><sentence id="157">So I went from Freya to...to Frieda, and they sent me to Catechism school. </sentence><sentence id="158">We went Sunday school. </sentence><sentence id="159">We went to church. </sentence><sentence id="160">And uh...they also sent me to school. </sentence><sentence id="161">I really did not lose schooling. </sentence><sentence id="162">I learned French so good, in fact, that I forget my German. </sentence><sentence id="163">I couldn't speak German anymore. </sentence><sentence id="164">I was a French little girl. </sentence><sentence id="165">I was a French little girl. </sentence><sentence id="166">My name was Frieda, and I used to help with the chores. </sentence><sentence id="167">We all, you know, we all had to help. </sentence><sentence id="168">And I used to herd one cow, and uh...feed the chickens and go to school and come home and do my chores. </sentence><sentence id="169">And after a few months of...I was there, she informed me that the money--she was getting money from the Red Cross, in fact. </sentence><sentence id="170">I think the Red Cross was paying foster homes to take care of us children. </sentence><sentence id="171">And uh...she said that even with the money she just couldn't take care of me anymore. </sentence><sentence id="172">She just didn't have enough food, you know, to feed me and them, too. </sentence><sentence id="173">And they were getting older and... Uh, their name was Godin, Mr....Madame and Mr. Godin. </sentence><sentence id="174">And they said I would have to leave. </sentence><sentence id="175">So someone came from the French Red Cross, and they were going to take me to another town. </sentence><sentence id="176">But it just so happened that in the same town, a larger farmer in the same town, Noyers, said that she would take me. </sentence><sentence id="177">That she could use an extra hand to help. </sentence><sentence id="178">There was a big farm, big orchards; and so she took me in. </sentence><sentence id="179">So I never had to leave the city. </sentence><sentence id="180">I just moved to another family. </sentence><sentence id="181">And she didn't have just me. </sentence><sentence id="182">She had other children that she took care of. </sentence><sentence id="183">And she was hiding a Jewish family, actually. </sentence><sentence id="184">And I will never forget that red brick house. </sentence><sentence id="185">Two red brick houses next to each other. </sentence><sentence id="186">And in the other house, lived a Jewish family that she was hiding. </sentence><sentence id="187">But, unfortunately, someone found out. </sentence><sentence id="188">And they came...the Gestapo came and got the family, and never was heard from them again. </sentence><sentence id="189">And I lived there, and uh...I went to school. </sentence><sentence id="190">I was very, very religious--very Catholic. </sentence><sentence id="191">I had little Jesus over my bed at night. </sentence><sentence id="192">And we prayed; and, in fact, uh when my classmates had their communion, I wanted to have communion, too. </sentence><sentence id="193">After all, you wore a pretty white dress and you walked down the church. </sentence><sentence id="194">And uh...Madame Didier was the lady that...uh was the farmer lady. </sentence><sentence id="195">She said uh...that I couldn't have my communion, because she didn't want to deprive my parents of seeing me become communion. </sentence><sentence id="196">She didn't tell me why--that I was Jewish and that I couldn't have communion, that I was only acting that out. </sentence><sentence id="197">So she told me that I couldn't. </sentence><sentence id="198">I had to wait for my parents to come home, so they could be there. </sentence><sentence id="199">Of course, I cried. </sentence><sentence id="200">I was very hurt. </sentence><sentence id="201">I was upset, because I didn't know anymore that I was Jewish. </sentence><sentence id="202">I didn't know any different. </sentence><sentence id="203">And uh...but we worked. </sentence><sentence id="204">We worked in the fields. </sentence><sentence id="205">We made our own  bread, our own flour. </sentence><sentence id="206">They had big machines. </sentence><sentence id="207">Uh...wheat, they had wheat fields; and when harvest time came, we walked...the children with baskets behind the machines and we picked up the wheat that the machines dropped. </sentence><sentence id="208">And we put in our basket; and uh...and that's how we helped. </sentence><sentence id="209">And she had big orchards with apple trees and cherry trees--everything. </sentence><sentence id="210">And we worked. </sentence><sentence id="211">And she taught me how to knit. </sentence><sentence id="212">She taught me how to sew. </sentence><sentence id="213">She taught me how to darn socks. </sentence><sentence id="214">We had to darn our own socks. </sentence><sentence id="215">We only had one dress; so when that dress was being washed, we missed a day of school. </sentence><sentence id="216">Because we each had just one... one dress, and we had to miss school when we had our clothes washed. </sentence><sentence id="217">Uh, learned how to make fire in the wood stoves and everything; and uh...when we came home from school... The highlight of coming home from school was to a glass of milk and jam sandwich. </sentence><sentence id="218">We made our own jam. </sentence><sentence id="219">And we had enough to eat, and never needed... I never went hungry, the children. </sentence><sentence id="220">But a lot was expect of us. </sentence><sentence id="221">We had our chores to do. </sentence><sentence id="222">We had our homework. </sentence><sentence id="223">We had to go school. </sentence><sentence id="224">We had to get good grades. </sentence><sentence id="225">And by that time, I was uh very uh... French girl that...French Catholic girl; and I didn't know any...anything else. </sentence><sentence id="226">That...that was my way of life. </sentence><sentence id="227">Well, what I didn't know is someone found out that Madame Didier was harboring a Jewish child, and went to the Gestapo and told them. </sentence><sentence id="228">Well, what happened... One day, she sent me away to get something. </sentence><sentence id="229">I don't even remember what it was. </sentence><sentence id="230">I was out of the house, and the Gestapo came. </sentence><sentence id="231">She said 4, 5 Gestapo with the guns. </sentence><sentence id="232">One was guarding the outside of the house. </sentence><sentence id="233">And they went through the house from cellar to attic. </sentence><sentence id="234">And in France, they have the cellars outside--you know, the stone cellars. </sentence><sentence id="235">They...[ mean, they checked. </sentence><sentence id="236">They even slashed the mattresses. </sentence><sentence id="237">I mean, they went through that house with a fine tooth comb. </sentence><sentence id="238">And she kept saying, "I don't have a Jewish child here, and I don't." </sentence><sentence id="239">And they left. </sentence><sentence id="240">They didn't find me. </sentence><sentence id="241">I came home to the disaster of the house. </sentence><sentence id="242">And uh never...she never told me what happened; and it was because of...of me. </sentence><sentence id="243">And uh...but time went by the same, you know, the everyday routine. </sentence><sentence id="244">Again, for some reason, I wasn't home. </sentence><sentence id="245">She sent me to get something. </sentence><sentence id="246">Gestapo came a second time. </sentence><sentence id="247">The same thing happened. </sentence><sentence id="248">They didn't find me, and they never came again. </sentence><sentence id="249">It was the last time that they came. </sentence><sentence id="250">And time went by. </sentence><sentence id="251">It was already wintertime--must have been in...near "40...1944, I guess. </sentence><sentence id="252">And one day after school, Madame Didier was sitting in the kitchen with a lady. </sentence><sentence id="253">And I walked in. </sentence><sentence id="254">And she said that this lady came to pick me up and take me away to a children's home. </sentence><sentence id="255">I could not stay there anymore. </sentence><sentence id="256">Well, I cried. </sentence><sentence id="257">I was very upset. </sentence><sentence id="258">This was my life. </sentence><sentence id="259">I didn't know any...anything. </sentence><sentence id="260">And the lady sat down, and she told me that I was not a Catholic child. </sentence><sentence id="261">I was a Jewish child, and I had to go back with...with my people. </sentence><sentence id="262">And in Saint-Etienne was a children's home that was run by a Polish rabbi and his staff. </sentence><sentence id="263">And he was gathering Jewish children from all over France, wherever they could find us; and bring us together again under...under one roof. </sentence><sentence id="264">So I had no warning or anything. </sentence><sentence id="265">And Ijust packed my little suitcase. </sentence><sentence id="266">I really didn't have anything. </sentence><sentence id="267">And I had to say goodbye. </sentence><sentence id="268">And I...L..I'll never forget. </sentence><sentence id="269">It was on a Friday, on a Friday afternoon. </sentence><sentence id="270">And I left with the lady. </sentence><sentence id="271">I think what actually saved my life through all this was I was a very passive child. </sentence><sentence id="272">I never asked any questions. </sentence><sentence id="273">I might have cried or been unhappy, but never [said], "Why is this happening?," </sentence><sentence id="274">or "Why that?" </sentence><sentence id="275">I think now, in later years, maybe that saved me. </sentence><sentence id="276">Because I just did whatever told to do. </sentence><sentence id="277">I was told to be Catholic. </sentence><sentence id="278">I was told to learn French. </sentence><sentence id="279">And I did whatever I was told to do. </sentence><sentence id="280">So being that it was a Friday afternoon, we arrived at the children's home...
