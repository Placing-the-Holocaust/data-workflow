Uh, their name was Godin, Mr....Madame and Mr. Godin. </sentence><sentence id="175">And they said I would have to leave. </sentence><sentence id="176">So someone came from the French Red Cross, and they were going to take me to another town. </sentence><sentence id="177">But it just so happened that in the same town, a larger farmer in the same town, Noyers, said that she would take me. </sentence><sentence id="178">That she could use an extra hand to help. </sentence><sentence id="179">There was a big farm, big orchards; and so she took me in. </sentence><sentence id="180">So I never had to leave the city. </sentence><sentence id="181">I just moved to another family. </sentence><sentence id="182">And she didn't have just me. </sentence><sentence id="183">She had other children that she took care of. </sentence><sentence id="184">And she was hiding a Jewish family, actually. </sentence><sentence id="185">And I will never forget that red brick house. </sentence><sentence id="186">Two red brick houses next to each other. </sentence><sentence id="187">And in the other house, lived a Jewish family that she was hiding. </sentence><sentence id="188">But, unfortunately, someone found out. </sentence><sentence id="189">And they came...the Gestapo came and got the family, and never was heard from them again. </sentence><sentence id="190">And I lived there, and uh...I went to school. </sentence><sentence id="191">I was very, very religious--very Catholic. </sentence><sentence id="192">I had little Jesus over my bed at night. </sentence><sentence id="193">And we prayed; and, in fact, uh when my classmates had their communion, I wanted to have communion, too. </sentence><sentence id="194">After all, you wore a pretty white dress and you walked down the church. </sentence><sentence id="195">And uh...Madame Didier was the lady that...uh was the farmer lady. </sentence><sentence id="196">She said uh...that I couldn't have my communion, because she didn't want to deprive my parents of seeing me become communion. </sentence><sentence id="197">She didn't tell me why--that I was Jewish and that I couldn't have communion, that I was only acting that out. </sentence><sentence id="198">So she told me that I couldn't. </sentence><sentence id="199">I had to wait for my parents to come home, so they could be there. </sentence><sentence id="200">Of course, I cried. </sentence><sentence id="201">I was very hurt. </sentence><sentence id="202">I was upset, because I didn't know anymore that I was Jewish. </sentence><sentence id="203">I didn't know any different. </sentence><sentence id="204">And uh...but we worked. </sentence><sentence id="205">We worked in the fields. </sentence><sentence id="206">We made our own  bread, our own flour. </sentence><sentence id="207">They had big machines. </sentence><sentence id="208">Uh...wheat, they had wheat fields; and when harvest time came, we walked...the children with baskets behind the machines and we picked up the wheat that the machines dropped. </sentence><sentence id="209">And we put in our basket; and uh...and that's how we helped. </sentence><sentence id="210">And she had big orchards with apple trees and cherry trees--everything. </sentence><sentence id="211">And we worked. </sentence><sentence id="212">And she taught me how to knit. </sentence><sentence id="213">She taught me how to sew. </sentence><sentence id="214">She taught me how to darn socks. </sentence><sentence id="215">We had to darn our own socks. </sentence><sentence id="216">We only had one dress; so when that dress was being washed, we missed a day of school. </sentence><sentence id="217">Because we each had just one... one dress, and we had to miss school when we had our clothes washed. </sentence><sentence id="218">Uh, learned how to make fire in the wood stoves and everything; and uh...when we came home from school... The highlight of coming home from school was to a glass of milk and jam sandwich. </sentence><sentence id="219">We made our own jam. </sentence><sentence id="220">And we had enough to eat, and never needed... I never went hungry, the children. </sentence><sentence id="221">But a lot was expect of us. </sentence><sentence id="222">We had our chores to do. </sentence><sentence id="223">We had our homework. </sentence><sentence id="224">We had to go school. </sentence><sentence id="225">We had to get good grades. </sentence><sentence id="226">And by that time, I was uh very uh... French girl that...French Catholic girl; and I didn't know any...anything else. </sentence><sentence id="227">That...that was my way of life. </sentence><sentence id="228">Well, what I didn't know is someone found out that Madame Didier was harboring a Jewish child, and went to the Gestapo and told them. </sentence><sentence id="229">Well, what happened... One day, she sent me away to get something. </sentence><sentence id="230">I don't even remember what it was. </sentence><sentence id="231">I was out of the house, and the Gestapo came. </sentence><sentence id="232">She said 4, 5 Gestapo with the guns. </sentence><sentence id="233">One was guarding the outside of the house. </sentence><sentence id="234">And they went through the house from cellar to attic. </sentence><sentence id="235">And in France, they have the cellars outside--you know, the stone cellars. </sentence><sentence id="236">They...[ mean, they checked. </sentence><sentence id="237">They even slashed the mattresses. </sentence><sentence id="238">I mean, they went through that house with a fine tooth comb. </sentence><sentence id="239">And she kept saying, "I don't have a Jewish child here, and I don't." </sentence><sentence id="240">And they left. </sentence><sentence id="241">They didn't find me. </sentence><sentence id="242">I came home to the disaster of the house. </sentence><sentence id="243">And uh never...she never told me what happened; and it was because of...of me. </sentence><sentence id="244">And uh...but time went by the same, you know, the everyday routine. </sentence><sentence id="245">Again, for some reason, I wasn't home. </sentence><sentence id="246">She sent me to get something. </sentence><sentence id="247">Gestapo came a second time. </sentence><sentence id="248">The same thing happened. </sentence><sentence id="249">They didn't find me, and they never came again. </sentence><sentence id="250">It was the last time that they came. </sentence><sentence id="251">And time went by. </sentence><sentence id="252">It was already wintertime--must have been in...near "40...1944, I guess. </sentence><sentence id="253">And one day after school, Madame Didier was sitting in the kitchen with a lady. </sentence><sentence id="254">And I walked in. </sentence><sentence id="255">And she said that this lady came to pick me up and take me away to a children's home. </sentence><sentence id="256">I could not stay there anymore. </sentence><sentence id="257">Well, I cried. </sentence><sentence id="258">I was very upset. </sentence><sentence id="259">This was my life. </sentence><sentence id="260">I didn't know any...anything. </sentence><sentence id="261">And the lady sat down, and she told me that I was not a Catholic child. </sentence><sentence id="262">I was a Jewish child, and I had to go back with...with my people. </sentence><sentence id="263">And in Saint-Etienne was a children's home that was run by a Polish rabbi and his staff. </sentence><sentence id="264">And he was gathering Jewish children from all over France, wherever they could find us; and bring us together again under...under one roof. </sentence><sentence id="265">So I had no warning or anything. </sentence><sentence id="266">And Ijust packed my little suitcase. </sentence><sentence id="267">I really didn't have anything. </sentence><sentence id="268">And I had to say goodbye. </sentence><sentence id="269">And I...L..I'll never forget. </sentence><sentence id="270">It was on a Friday, on a Friday afternoon. </sentence><sentence id="271">And I left with the lady. </sentence><sentence id="272">I think what actually saved my life through all this was I was a very passive child. </sentence><sentence id="273">I never asked any questions. </sentence><sentence id="274">I might have cried or been unhappy, but never [said], "Why is this happening?," </sentence><sentence id="275">or "Why that?" </sentence><sentence id="276">I think now, in later years, maybe that saved me. </sentence><sentence id="277">Because I just did whatever told to do. </sentence><sentence id="278">I was told to be Catholic. </sentence><sentence id="279">I was told to learn French. </sentence><sentence id="280">And I did whatever I was told to do. </sentence><sentence id="281">So being that it was a Friday afternoon, we arrived at the children's home...
