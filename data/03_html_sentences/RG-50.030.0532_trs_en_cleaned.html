same town in a ver -- in a Jewish community there, we lived. </sentence><sentence id="15">And my aunt and uncle had a bakery. </sentence><sentence id="16">And that's the only family we really had. </sentence><sentence id="17">Most of my father's family was in Poland, and my mother had some family left in Latvia, Russia, and -- which we never met, but we were very close to my family, my mother's aunt and uncle -- ma -- my aunt and uncle, and I always would go there as a little girl and on the holidays and we -- my mother and -- would make wine with her sister, and I -- I loved the goodies in

Interview with Lucie Ragin , July 23, 2009 we were very happy family and all of a sudden they said it wouldn't be good for the Jewish people to stay in Antwerp because the war was broke -- breaking out. </sentence><sentence id="19">So my parents and my aunt and uncle, we decided to leave Antwerp, and we packed whatever we could in a -- in a rush to leave, and -- for France. </sentence><sentence id="20">And I was a little girl, I really didn't understand too much. </sentence><sentence id="21">I saw people taping the window, because they were afraid that their houses would be bombed, and they put tape on the window so it wouldn't shatter. </sentence><sentence id="22">And we took a duffle bag, whatever we could, and we left by train to go to France. </sentence><sentence id="23">And I remember the Red Cross in the -- in La Gare, in the station, and they would help all the people and give them hot chocolate and things like that. </sentence><sentence id="24">And when they packed in a rush, one of the scissors that they packed was sticking up, and I sat on that bag, and I had to be treated by the Red Cross, and that's why I remember that incident. </sentence><sentence id="25">And the train went on, and we really didn't know where we were going in France, and we went towards this -- I guess on the -- the southern part of France, and my aunt and uncle were with us, we were all i-in a place called Brens(ph), which was a camp. </sentence><sentence id="26">And from there we went to Recebedou, or vice-versa. </sentence><sentence id="27">And then we ended up in Rivesaltes, which was the worst one, I think, of them all. </sentence><sentence id="28">I remember barbed wire, but I don't remember -- I think I was wearing a Jewish star, but I'm not positive. </sentence><sentence id="29">I was a little girl, and my mother was pregnant, and it was very hard for her because we didn't have any food, and we   ontectnetonancedjusetneey for tarher biormatoerabouttfisestecion Interview with Lucie Ragin deg July 23, 2009 didn't have many things. </sentence><sentence id="30">And whatever she had, she would give to her children. </sentence><sentence id="31">And I rem -- and my father in camp, he's -- he knew -- he was a plumber there, they used him to do plumbing, and he helped people get out of the camp, and they paid him by giving him like an egg, a tomato, a few potatoes and this way he would make his food. </sentence><sentence id="32">But they were aware of what he was doing, so he had to leave the camp and not come back. </sentence><sentence id="33">He had to leave my mother and me there and not come back, because there were -- and every day they would come and they would pick up my mother, I don't know if it was the Vichy. </sentence><sentence id="34">I remember a German Shepherd also, and they would take my mother for questioning, because they thought she knew where he was, but she didn't. </sentence><sentence id="35">And I -- I used to see my cousin in camp, and my aunt. </sentence><sentence id="36">I don't remember about my uncle and my boy cousin. </sentence><sentence id="37">But we were very hungry, very, very hungry.

window in the infirmary, and there were other children there, and the mothers would come by the window and they wanted to give things for their children, and I would -- I know I wasn't allowed to take it, but they like more or less forced me to do it. </sentence><sentence id="45">And then they took me away from by the window so I couldn't see anybody. </sentence><sentence id="46">And we were there, and also I was in a little nursery where I cried all the time because I wanted to be with my mother. </sentence><sentence id="47">And one day I escaped when the milkman came, and I ho --I heard all the loudspeakers talking, you know, listening to my name, and -- and somehow I thought I would find my mother, but all the barracks looked alike, and I couldn't find her. </sentence><sentence id="48">So somebody recognized me and they took me to my mother and somehow she must have convinced them -- convinced them to let me stay there. </sentence><sentence id="49">And -- but I know everybody was very, very hungry, and there was a lot of suffering all around me. </sentence><sentence id="50">My girl cousin was very close to me and I would see her once in a while, but she was older and you know, they divided you by age. </sentence><sentence id="51">The rabbi in the camp heard that they were going to send everybody to Auschwitz, so he told my mother to try to escape. </sentence><sentence id="52">My brother had -- and my father were no longer there. </sentence><sentence id="53">We didn't know where they were. </sentence><sentence id="54">You have to remember that in those days there was no radio, no communication from the outside, nothing. </sentence><sentence id="55">So you really didn't know what was going on. </sentence><sentence id="56">After the war we found out that my brother was given away to a French family. </sentence><sentence id="57">But the rabbi gave my mother a few francs and told   http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection Interview with Lucie Ragin " July 23, 2009 her to escape. </sentence><sentence id="58">So we had a pass to see my sister, who was born at the maternity [indecipherable]. </sentence><sentence id="59">And instead of going to see her, we escaped. </sentence><sentence id="60">And my mother had spoken to one of the nurses there and she said not to worry, that she's gonna try and get her out of camp. </sentence><sentence id="61">My mother was unbelievable, very strong lady, very strong, that she could survive all of this. </sentence><sentence id="62">And with a few francs we went -- we didn't go to see my sister, my mother took me to the La Gare, which is the railroad station. </sentence><sentence id="63">And she tried to buy tickets for us, she just had enough money to buy us tickets to go to Marseilles. </sentence><sentence id="64">And in Marseilles, she knew my father would be there. </sentence><sentence id="65">There was a hotel where all the Jewish people stayed, and she figured somebody there would know where my father was. </sentence><sentence id="66">So -- but at the station, I started to cry and she was afraid that the Germans would -- because you had to show a pass wherever you went, so she was afraid that the Germans would notice me crying, so she bought me soda. </sentence><sentence id="67">I wanted soda to keep me quiet. </sentence><sentence id="68">So when she went to buy the ticket, the money that she used for the soda, she didn't have enough for the tickets. </sentence><sentence id="69">So she met a woman there that she's a French lady, and she sold her -- she had a piece of soap, and she sold her the piece of soap and the lady and my mother bought the tickets and she took us on the train and spoke for my mother, cause my mother only spoke Yiddish and very little French, and they used to come on the train to ask for identity. </sentence><sentence id="70">But my mother made believe like she was sleeping, and I was a little girl, I   http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection Interview with Lucie Ragin deg July 23, 2009 spoke a little French, so that was all right, and the woman took care of me. </sentence><sentence id="71">But the minute we arrived in Marseilles, she -- she told my mother, I can no longer stay with -- with you, because -- she kissed us goodbye and she left us right there. </sentence><sentence id="72">So we didn't know really where to find my father, but we knew there was a place in Marseilles called Hotel Avant(ph). </sentence><sentence id="73">I don't know exactly how she found that out, but we tried to go there and I was afraid of anybody that wore a uniform, so my mother was going to stop, she saw a mailman, and ask him. </sentence><sentence id="74">And I carried on so that she couldn't even ask him, but somehow she did after a while, and we found a place, Hotel Avant(ph) in Marseilles, where all the Jewish people were assembled. </sentence><sentence id="75">But it wasn't a very good place to stay, because the Germans would come with big trucks and they would raffle -- they would do a raffle at night and take everybody to Auschwitz. </sentence><sentence id="76">So we were in that hotel, it's like a miracle. </sentence><sentence id="77">My father's friend was there, and he said he hasn't seen my father for a while. </sentence><sentence id="78">Sometimes he comes in there, but he hasn't seen him for a while. </sentence><sentence id="79">But that night we went to sleep and my father cut his finger while he was -- he was a lumberjack during the war, in th -- in the forest, that's what he said. </sentence><sentence id="80">And he cut his finger, this finger here, the pointer. </sentence><sentence id="81">I always remember, because he had a big scar. </sentence><sentence id="82">And he had to see a doctor because the bleeding wouldn't stop. </sentence><sentence id="83">So he -- he came in to see the doctor and my father's friend said, you know, Mr. Zale, your wife and daughter are here. </sentence><sentence id="84">He said, come on, don't   ontectnetonancedjusetneey for tarher biormatoerabouttfisestecion Interview with Lucie Ragin deg July 23, 2009 joke around, it's impossible. </sentence><sentence id="85">So it just turned out that that's what happened. </sentence><sentence id="86">So in the morning we saw my father and it was the most exciting time. </sentence><sentence id="87">I'm sorry. </sentence><sentence id="88">And my father went to suture -- oh, my father went to the doctor to suture his wound, and my mother like almost collapsed because my brother wasn't with him. </sentence><sentence id="89">My brother and father, in the beginning they were like homeless people. </sentence><sentence id="90">But then my father saw that he couldn't take care of my brother, so he gave him away to a French fa-family. </sentence><sentence id="91">And they took very good care of him. </sentence><sentence id="92">So my mother said she's not leaving unless he gets my brother, so it took a -- well, we went to this vil -- little village which is called Aix-en-Provence and from there we went with my father to Tres, which was in the southern part of France, where he was living. </sentence><sentence id="93">And the landlady, Madame Laville(ph), she was the landlady where my father lived, and she gave us a bigger room, and my broth -- my father got my brother back from the French people, and we all lived in that room: my mother, my father, my brother and me. </sentence><sentence id="94">And my sister was still at Erna(ph). </sentence><sentence id="95">So the French lady was a wonderful, wonderful lady and she didn't like the Germans because they killed her son during the war, whatever. </sentence><sentence id="96">And she would take me with her all over. </sentence><sentence id="97">She would take me to the cemetery, she would take me to church. </sentence><sentence id="98">So she wanted to really baptize me. </sentence><sentence id="99">And she gave us like food, and she gave us -- and she let us live there all through the war without paying rent. </sentence><sentence id="100">We all lived in a big room that looked like a restaurant, all of us. </sentence><sentence id="101">And the Germans,   http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection Interview with Lucie Ragin " July 23, 2009 when they came to town, lived upstairs in that hotel. </sentence><sentence id="102">And they didn't know we were Jewish, so that's another miracle. </sentence><sentence id="103">I mean, it's -- it's incredible. </sentence><sentence id="104">So we had a little car --and then, the Ozay(ph), or the Red Cross, the Swiss Red Cross got my sister out of concentration camp -- out of the internment camp and they brought her to us, to my mother. </sentence><sentence id="105">And my mother had to go to meet her in Marseilles, and on the way back they didn't like her pass -- you know, they came to see, this one, to see if everything was all right, and they -- they almost didn't let her get off the bus, because they didn't like the papers. </sentence><sentence id="106">It didn't have some kind of signature, and the bus driver said, come on, let's -- let her go, you know, and then he took off, and she came to Trespeux(ph) Giraud(ph), and we stayed there until liberation, but a lot of things happened in that little village. </sentence><sentence id="107">Sometimes they would come through town, the Germans, and they said ammunition was -- a plane came by and dropped ammunition and whoever has it, they took the whole village, put them in the middle of this little park and they said they're gonna shoot the priest if-- they're gonna shoot the priest if the ammunition is not found. </sentence><sentence id="108">But finally, after I don't know how many hours, they let us go. </sentence><sentence id="109">But we understood everything they said, because Yiddish and German is very similar. </sentence><sentence id="110">And also, in the hotel where we lived, this German soldier was talking to my mother, I don't know, in German, I guess, and he said, he doesn't know what's going to happen to him, he really doesn't want to be a   Interview with Lucie Ragin " July 23, 2009 soldier, he might never see his kids again because you know, it's war. </sentence><sentence id="111">And he always used -- and he gave me a few candies. </sentence><sentence id="112">So I didn't know, we didn't let on that we were Jewish or anything like that. </sentence><sentence id="113">And we lived in that little village and we really were hungry too, we didn't have any food. </sentence><sentence id="114">And we had a little carriage for my sister, and inside there was like an opening where she sat. </sentence><sentence id="115">So we would go into the fields and we would steal like potatoes and fruit. </sentence><sentence id="116">And my sister would sit -- we would put it in that opening and my sister would sit right on top and that's how we would come back to town. </sentence><sentence id="117">And I would -- I went to school there and my brother too, and my little sister stayed with my mother. </sentence><sentence id="118">And we had a very hard time, but all of a sudden they said that the town will be -- would be bombed. </sentence><sentence id="119">And so everybody went into the mountains and -- everybody went into the mountains -- what I forgot to mention, I'll go back to the mountains later, is that my -- th-the landlady, Madame Laville(ph) wanted to baptize me and my mother said no. </sentence><sentence id="120">Sh -- sh -- I was bor --- my daughter's born Jewish and she will die Jewish; because they were pretty religious before the war. </sentence><sentence id="121">So she didn't do anything. </sentence><sentence id="122">But she was always dressed in black because of the death of her son, and she had two little gi -- dogs, one white one and one black one. </sentence><sentence id="123">And she was very good to me, and to my whole family. </sentence><sentence id="124">But when we went up in the mountains, when they said they were gonna bomb the town, that was almost at liberation, but we didn't know it. </sentence><sentence id="125">We saw planes going by, bombs falling,   Interview with Lucie Ragin deg July 23, 2009 all kinds of things, and we stayed up there. </sentence><sentence id="126">And then all of a sudden they came and they told us that the war is over, we can go back. </sentence><sentence id="127">So everybody was so excited, but they didn't let the children go back because they weren't sure. </sentence><sentence id="128">So they said, let the grown-ups, some grown-ups go back and see if everything's all right. </sentence><sentence id="129">And then I remember liberation, it was great. </sentence><sentence id="130">All the American tanks came through town, and everybody was so happy, everybody was kissing everybody, they were drinking. </sentence><sentence id="131">And one day I was playing at a fountain right there in the middle of town, and an American soldier, who was a Zionist, I guess, he was looking for Jewish people in that town, if there were any Jewish people. </sentence><sentence id="132">So I was playing with my friends and he came over and he said, which one of you little girls speaks Jewish? </sentence><sentence id="133">And I said, I do. </sentence><sentence id="134">And he says, take me to your mother. </sentence><sentence id="135">So my mother lived right across the street in that hotel. </sentence><sentence id="136">So he -- he went to my mother, and my mother said she had a s-sister in the United States, and he says, on my furlough, I'm gonna try and find out where -- if you -- if she's still alive, if she's interested and so on. </sentence><sentence id="137">So the next time he came back to town, he brought my -- he heard from my aunt, he brought us goodies, and every American Jewish soldier that came through town, came to our house and brought us things. </sentence><sentence id="138">And they -- they didn't know whether they were gonna make it because our little village was the beginning of liberation, but they still had to go on to Paris and France and -- and things like that, so they were a little bit -- some of   ontectnetonancedjusetneey for tarher biormatoerabouttfisestecion Interview with Lucie Ragin 8 July 23, 2009 them were even crying to my mother. </sentence><sentence id="139">And from there we left nac -- we left that little village and we went back to Marseilles, because we wanted to get back to Belgium to find out what happened to the rest of our family. </sentence><sentence id="140">So we went to Marseilles, I went to school there with my brother and my sister, and they still had air raids where you had to go into the shelters in the middle of the day. </sentence><sentence id="141">They still had all these things, and my father worked for the American army, and we saved up enough money and then we went back to Antwerp, Belgium. </sentence><sentence id="142">In 19 like "45, at the end of, and my -- and we had to find a little apartment, it was very hard, you couldn't -- you couldn't find anything. </sentence><sentence id="143">And we found a little apartment and -- and we lived there and every time people would come back on buses to the school that I went to, that's wha -- they had like a country yard, they would come back there and they would -- my mother would go to see if her sister, my uncle, my aunt, my -- my cousins were alive, and nobody ever came back. </sentence><sentence id="144">And she would never walk in that street ever again, she would go all around. </sentence><sentence id="145">And we -- I forgot to mention that also, when I lived in France, I was in children's homes, I was in Villa Marianne, which is in south Raphael, and I was very hungry there too, I used to eat the peels from the garbage when we went to the beach. </sentence><sentence id="146">I hated it. </sentence><sentence id="147">First of all, I wanted to be with my mother and father, and we would go to the beach, and I-I didn't like it because they made you bathe without a bathing suit. </sentence><sentence id="148">They kept you very badly, and the    Interview with Lucie
