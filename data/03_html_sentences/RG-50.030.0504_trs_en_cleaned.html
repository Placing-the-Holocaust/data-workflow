<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="939">A: And, you know, in my mind as a child, I was looking forward to this big trip we're going to take someplace, somewhere. </sentence><sentence id="940">And some people started talking about going to Shanghai. </sentence><sentence id="941">Shanghai, being an international city, it -- you didn't need any papers, any visas, or anything like that. </sentence><sentence id="942">All you needed was to get on a ship and get there. </sentence><sentence id="943">But it had a bad reputation, and people didn't want to go there, including my parents. </sentence><sentence id="944">So one time after Crystal Night, we had friends over the house for a dinner -- I don't know if it was a Friday night dinner or not, but one person said, you know what? </sentence><sentence id="945">I'm not sticking around her any more. </sentence><sentence id="946">I'm going to Shanghai. </sentence><sentence id="947">Second person said I'll join you, my father said, I'll join you. </sentence><sentence id="948">If that wouldn't have happened, we probably would have been stuck in Germany. </sentence><sentence id="949">By this time we had an affidavit from the United States and in my parent's mind we'll go to Shanghai for a year or two until our number gets called up and then we go to the States. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1002">Q: Yeah? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1004">A: To get all your heavy stuff on, you got from the freight company something they called a lift, which was like a big box, size of a room, and everything gets put in there. </sentence><sentence id="1005">And when you were packing that, somebody from the Gestapo was there watching what you were packing. </sentence><sentence id="1006">Well, when they came to do this packing, my mother sent me outside to play. </sentence><sentence id="1007">And I had some play money, which was back from the German inflation in the 20's, had absolutely no value. </sentence><sentence id="1008">And she was getting ready to pack that, and the guy from the Gestapo was -- put up a fuss, you can't take that. </sentence><sentence id="1009">And she was arguing, that's my kid's play money, it has no value. </sentence><sentence id="1010">I don't know for sure any more whether we left -- let him keep it or not, but I told my mother, "Let him have it, I don't care." </sentence><sentence id="1011">You know, it's just play money. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1024">A: Yes, yes, I walked in and -- </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1025">Q: Were they nasty? </sentence><sentence id="1026">What were they like? </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1027">A: No. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1029">Q: No? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1031">A: They were actually a little nasty at the beginning and then my mother gave them a drink, and they calmed down a bit. </sentence><sentence id="1032">And some of the little knickknacks that we had, she gave one person this and one person that. </sentence><sentence id="1033">It wasn't really bribery in any sense, but it softens them up in a way. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1037">Q: Right, right. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1039">A: And my parents also had the idea that maybe we can get off the ship somewhere before we get to Shanghai. </sentence><sentence id="1040">I mean, India was still part of Britain, the Philippines was part of the United States, Singapore was part of Britain. </sentence><sentence id="1041">We thought we could maybe get off there. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1045">Q: Right, right. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1047">A: So they decided that this lift with all our belongings should be kept by the freight company until they got the word from us. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1049">Q: Uh-huh. </sentence><sentence id="1050">Instead of going on the shi -- </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1051">A: Instead -- instead of being shipped at the same time as we were. </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1052">Q: Right, right. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1054">A: I mean, the ship we were on was a passenger ship, it wasn't a freighter, and the lift would have to go on a freighter. </sentence><sentence id="1055">The -- obviously we didn't get off anyplace. </sentence><sentence id="1056">Ended up in Shanghai and then contacted the freight company, she -- send it to us, this is our address. </sentence><sentence id="1057">But in the meantime it's July of 1939. </sentence><sentence id="1058">By the time this lift gets onto a freighter it's September, and the war breaks out. </sentence><sentence id="1059">And all German ships get the signal, go into a neutral port. </sentence><sentence id="1060">The Dutch is -- East Indies, which are now Indonesia, were still neutral, so the ship ran into a neutral port in Dutch East Indies, and we had to pay a fair amount of money to get it from there to Shanghai. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1068">Q: Get it to Shanghai. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1070">A: But eventually we got it all. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1072">Q: When -- when your mother was packing the lift, did you have to pack a little suitcase, or did she pack it for you? </sentence></p></dialogue>
