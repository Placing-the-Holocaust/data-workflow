from the other side, from the German occupied Poland, from Poland occupied by the Germans, they used to come in and they used to tell us stories how the Germans used to take away Jews and they never

be so mean. </sentence><sentence id="101">It's such a civilized country. </sentence><sentence id="102">It couldn't be so bad. </sentence><sentence id="103">But after a while we did find out that it happen to us too, because when the Germans came in, in the beginning they didn't know who is a Jew and who is not a Jew, and but our non-Jewish neighbors used to point out the Jewish people. </sentence><sentence id="104">The kids with whom we used to play outside in the yard or on the street, they used to point point out a Jew, because we lived altogether in the same section and they used to take away the Jews. </sentence><sentence id="105">The SS with the help of the Ukrainian police or the Lithuanian police, they used to take away the Jews. </sentence><sentence id="106">Whenever we used to stand in line, they used to point out a Jew and they used to drag us out of the lines and every once in a while they used to come in to our houses and take away some people and...it was a very scary time for us, especially for the young people, because we didn't know what [they would do]...we were afraid they'll come and take our parents away always, every time we saw a German, and we had to walk around [them] [and] we had a curfew. </sentence><sentence id="107">Until five o'clock in the evening we were allowed to walk and we weren't allowed to walk on the sidewalk. </sentence><sentence id="108">We had to walk in the middle of the street and bow for every German. </sentence><sentence id="109">It it was a very scary time. </sentence><sentence id="110">We didn't know who is going to be next and what's going to happen to us and we we weren't allowed to go to school anymore and life was going on like that until "41 right before the Jewish holidays. </sentence><sentence id="111">They...the SS decided to make a ghetto in our town, in Vilno and there a poor section where a lot of Jews used to live there and the Jewish home for the aged was there. </sentence><sentence id="112">The biggest synagogue of the city of Vilno was there. </sentence><sentence id="113">The orphanage. </sentence><sentence id="114">The Jewish hospital was there, and a lot of poor Jews lived around this section and one night the SS, with the help of the Ukrainian police and the Lithuanians, they came in and took out all the Jews from there and they drove them to a place, Ponary [in the] outskirts of Vilno there and they shot them all there. </sentence><sentence id="115">We heard screaming and yelling and crying during the night, but we weren't allowed to look of the window because those who looked out were shot. </sentence><sentence id="116">We didn't know what was going on anyway until the next day our neighbors told us what was going on. </sentence><sentence id="117">We had a lot of relatives there. </sentence><sentence id="118">My mother's cousins, all of my mother's relatives lived there and couple of weeks later they round up all the Jews from the city and the suburbs and they put us all in this ghetto, and surrounded us with walls and with guards and we had to live in one apartment, two to three families in a two room apartment. </sentence><sentence id="119">When we came in those apartments, we saw some of the beds were still made still where people were still asleep. </sentence><sentence id="120">They were disturbed. </sentence><sentence id="121">They took them out in the middle of the night from the beds. </sentence><sentence id="122">Some the tables were still set. </sentence><sentence id="123">People evidently were still eating, and this made a very bad impression of us, for us because our relatives, our our families were taken away. </sentence><sentence id="124">They were killed. </sentence><sentence id="125">We had the Judenrat, Kehilla changed the name to Judenrat and my father was still working in the Judenrat there. </sentence><sentence id="126">We had our own police there. </sentence><sentence id="127">They organized police, fire department. </sentence><sentence id="128">They had stores in the ghetto. </sentence><sentence id="129">We had even schools for children. </sentence><sentence id="130">The little kids used to go to school. </sentence><sentence id="131">I personally was too old to go to school already. </sentence><sentence id="132">When the war started I was seventeen years old and we had to have a permit to live. </sentence><sentence id="133">At first they gave us yellow cards. </sentence><sentence id="134">Those who didn't get a yellow card were taken away from the ghetto and we never saw those people. ( </sentence><sentence id="135">and a couple months..) We used to, people used to go out from the ghetto to work in factories or in railroad station, wherever they  needed some help, workers, they sent out our Jews there. </sentence><sentence id="136">And couple months later they decided to change those cards again for different kind of cards. </sentence><sentence id="137">Pink cards, and then they took away those that didn't have any pink cards and we never saw those people again. </sentence><sentence id="138">And it was pretty frightening all the time. </sentence><sentence id="139">Every time they used to give us a little more bread or horse meat we knew that's it's going to be a roundup of Jews the next couple days. </sentence><sentence id="140">They even came in one day, the SS, with the help of the Ukrainian police and the Lithuanian police and took away all the children from school, and those little kids never had a chance to say goodbye to their parents. </sentence><sentence id="141">The parents, when they came home from work they didn't find their kids anymore. </sentence><sentence id="142">We we lived all the time in fright; we were frightened all the time. </sentence><sentence id="143">We didn't know what was going to be next or who is going to be next. </sentence><sentence id="144">One time they caught my father walking on a street. </sentence><sentence id="145">They round him [up] too, but he escaped from there somehow. </sentence><sentence id="146">I don't remember how, but he did escape. </sentence><sentence id="147">My mother was sick at the time in the ghetto and she died. </sentence><sentence id="148">She was in the hospital and we didn't have enough medication to help her, and she died in the ghetto. </sentence><sentence id="149">We weren't allowed to go to the cemetery even to see where she was buried. </sentence><sentence id="150">My father went because he helped to dig the grave in the cemetery and he knew exactly where, but the children weren't allowed to go out of the ghetto. </sentence><sentence id="151">We lived in fear all the time. </sentence><sentence id="152">And every day was about the same thing as the previous day. </sentence><sentence id="153">We didn't know...then right before the holidays in 1943, right before the Jewish holidays, the New Year, the SS decided to liquidate the ghetto and they told us over the loudspeaker that the ghetto is going to be liquidated and we are going to be resettled. </sentence><sentence id="154">They didn't tell us where, and and we can take only what we can carry with us, no more. </sentence><sentence id="155">Naturally we didn't have much what to carry, only our clothes. </sentence><sentence id="156">That's all we could take. </sentence><sentence id="157">And the next day we all congregated at the gate and they took us to a field in right outskirts of Vilno. </sentence><sentence id="158">I don't remember the name where it was, but when we came to the field we saw three people hanging, a young woman, and two young men and they told us over the loudspeaker that in case somebody has in mind to run away, to escape from this field, will be shot or hanged right in front of us. </sentence><sentence id="159">Men were taken away separately from the women. </sentence><sentence id="160">The men were taken to a concentration camp in Estonia and there they were killed. </sentence><sentence id="161">They were all burned alive for...they put logs and people and logs and burned and brought gasoline in and burned them and couple a years ago when we were in Israel, we went to visit the kibbutz Lokhamei haGettaoth and I saw the picture how they put up the people and I saw my father's name and his number and it was very emotional to see. </sentence><sentence id="162">Then how thorough the Germans were to record all what was happening to these Jews and we had to stay the whole night in the field, the women. </sentence><sentence id="163">Only my sister and myself. </sentence><sentence id="164">It was a very cold, miserable, rainy evening. </sentence><sentence id="165">When a child was crying or baby was crying, our guards used to take away the child from the mother and take it for (by?) </sentence><sentence id="166">their feet and tear it in half and throw it back to the mother. </sentence><sentence id="167">Some mothers, from fright, even choked their own children. ( </sentence><sentence id="168">Pause) It was going on like this the whole night. </sentence><sentence id="169">The next morning, we stayed in line and we were sorted. </sentence><sentence id="170">Those who went left went to extermination camps like Majdanek or Treblinka or some other camps, and I was fortunate enough with my sister went to the right. </sentence><sentence id="171">I was lucky enough that they put us...they sorted us the same... they didn't separate us, and we went to the right. </sentence><sentence id="172">Then they put us in cattle cars, about a hundred women to a car, and no bathrooms, no food, no  water. </sentence><sentence id="173">We had to ride for a couple of days in the cattle cars until we came to Latvia, to Kaiserwald. </sentence><sentence id="174">That's a suburb of Riga, and we were met by SS men and they told us that this concentration camp is built on Jewish graves. </sentence><sentence id="175">All the Jews from Riga were concentrated there. </sentence><sentence id="176">They were shot and they buried them and they built the concentration camp there. </sentence><sentence id="177">We had to go through the showers. </sentence><sentence id="178">They shaved our heads in case somebody will run away they should find [her], they should know that we are the Jews from the concentration camp, recognize us. </sentence><sentence id="179">They gave us stripped clothes with numbers. </sentence><sentence id="180">From then on we never were called by the name, only by the number. </sentence><sentence id="181">Then they put us in barracks. </sentence><sentence id="182">We had to sleep on boards. </sentence><sentence id="183">No blankets, no pillows. </sentence><sentence id="184">We used to get up five o'clock in the morning and be counted and sometimes our kapo made a mistake in counting us, [then] we had to stay for another couple of hours and for punishment. </sentence><sentence id="185">Then they used to give us a piece of bread and some black water that they called coffee and we used to go out to work from the concentration camp to dig ditches or at the railroad or in factories. </sentence><sentence id="186">Some people were lucky enough worked in the concentration camp sorting the clothes that they took away from us and while I was working digging ditches, there was a guard who asked me from where I was and I told him that I was from Vilno. </sentence><sentence id="187">Then I asked him where ...and he told me is from Lithuania. </sentence><sentence id="188">I said oh, I told him that my mother comes from Lithuania. </sentence><sentence id="189">He asked me from where, and I told him from where, from Vilkoviskis. </sentence><sentence id="190">He says oh he comes from there too, and he knew my uncle. </sentence><sentence id="191">They were friends before the war. </sentence><sentence id="192">They went to school together and they were very good friends, and he told me how my uncle was killed in Vilkoviskis. </sentence><sentence id="193">They shot them all there. </sentence><sentence id="194">They didn't take them in any concentration camps or in any ghettos, nothing. </sentence><sentence id="195">They shot them all there. </sentence><sentence id="196">And then we used to come back to the concentration camp and be counted again and then they took us and then they gave us some coffee and bread again and we used to retire to our barracks. </sentence><sentence id="197">In the barracks we used to sit and talk, talk about old times, talk about our parents and the schools that we went to and every once in a while, couple times a week, a German SS woman used to come in with a big whip and beat us up without any reason. </sentence><sentence id="198">Used to curse us. </sentence><sentence id="199">Used to yell at us. </sentence><sentence id="200">It was very frightening. </sentence><sentence id="201">We never knew what time it was. </sentence><sentence id="202">We never knew what day it was, because we didn't have any clocks. </sentence><sentence id="203">We didn't have any watches. </sentence><sentence id="204">We didn't have any calendars. </sentence><sentence id="205">We didn't know anything what was going on in this world. </sentence><sentence id="206">Then one day, beginning of 1944 or so or in the middle, somewhere around there, they told us that the next day they are going to take us to another concentration camp and they took us again by cattle cars to a concentration camp in east Germany somewhere, called Stuthof. </sentence><sentence id="207">When we came there they took away everything what we had again and they shaved our heads again. </sentence><sentence id="208">They gave us different numbers, but it was much worse in this concentration camp. </sentence><sentence id="209">It was much bigger and we weren't allowed to go out from the camp. </sentence><sentence id="210">We had to stay in the camp all the time. </sentence><sentence id="211">We weren't allowed to go to the bathroom by ourselves. </sentence><sentence id="212">We had to have permission. </sentence><sentence id="213">If our kapo felt like taking us, it was alright. </sentence><sentence id="214">If not, it's too bad. </sentence><sentence id="215">We couldn't wash ourselves. </sentence><sentence id="216">We couldn't go to to clean up, to wash our hands or faces. </sentence><sentence id="217">We were filthy there. </sentence><sentence id="218">We were hungry. </sentence><sentence id="219">We looked like skeletons all the time. </sentence><sentence id="220">And I was sick with typhoid and my sister was sick with typhoid and we weren't allowed to go to see a doctor. </sentence><sentence id="221">But we had to nurse ourselves. </sentence><sentence id="222">We did...I helped my sister. </sentence><sentence id="223">My sister helped me and women were dying there like flies. </sentence><sentence id="224">We were  treated very badly there. </sentence><sentence id="225">The German SS treated us very very bad there. </sentence><sentence id="226">Some women couldn't take it any longer. </sentence><sentence id="227">They used to sneak out at night and go to the barbed wire and touch the barbed wire and kill themselves. </sentence><sentence id="228">We used to get up early in the morning. </sentence><sentence id="229">We used to get our rations, bread and black coffee and once in a while they used to give us soup. </sentence><sentence id="230">It was called soup. </sentence><sentence id="231">It was from rotten potato peels or rotten cabbage soup, and then at the evening again they used to get the same thing...bread and coffee, and whenever we all sat around there and talked all the time or we were quiet. </sentence><sentence id="232">We couldn't do anything. </sentence><sentence id="233">We were so sick and we were so tired there. </sentence><sentence id="234">We were, we looked like skeletons. </sentence><sentence id="235">We were dirty. </sentence><sentence id="236">Our faces were black from dirt and in 1944, at the end, it was in December, end of December, right before Christmas, they decided to liquidate this concentration camp I guess and because the war was going on...getting bad and they told us and the next day they took us out of the concentration camp, but this time we had to walk. </sentence><sentence id="237">We didn't have any warm clothes, only that what we had on ourselves and we didn't have any shoes. </sentence><sentence id="238">We had to cover our feet with rags and when somebody, a woman died we used to take away her rags from her feet and cover our feet with with more rags to keep our feet warm. </sentence><sentence id="239">We used to take away her clothes to keep ourselves warm, to put on something else on us. </sentence><sentence id="240">While we were walking we saw some people lying on the ground, frozen, men frozen dead. </sentence><sentence id="241">We knew that a transport of Jews went by there. </sentence><sentence id="242">We used to start out about six o'clock to walk, in the morning, six o'clock in the morning to walk with a piece of bread and the black coffee and walk the whole day until we find a place at night where to stay. </sentence><sentence id="243">There was a barn somewhere, or a church...wherever they could find a place for us. </sentence><sentence id="244">Then they used to give us again a piece of bread and coffee and we used to go to sleep. </sentence><sentence id="245">We walked like that for six weeks. </sentence><sentence id="246">We weren't allowed to to bend over to take some snow to wet our lips. </sentence><sentence id="247">Those who did went over to take, they were shot by the guards. </sentence><sentence id="248">Those who helped each other to walk were shot. </sentence><sentence id="249">We weren't allowed to do that either. </sentence><sentence id="250">We walked like that for six weeks. </sentence><sentence id="251">Then we came to a barn and when we woke up the next day, we didn't see our guards anymore. </sentence><sentence id="252">We saw some old German SS men. </sentence><sentence id="253">They took away the young ones because they needed them on the front, and they substituted with old SS men. </sentence><sentence id="254">They were even worse than the young ones. </sentence><sentence id="255">They used to beat us up. </sentence><sentence id="256">Used to curse us. </sentence><sentence id="257">We were so sick in this barn that we couldn't do anything. </sentence><sentence id="258">We were lying around all day long in the barn. </sentence><sentence id="259">We didn't have bathroom facilities. </sentence><sentence id="260">We had to go right behind in back of the barn. </sentence><sentence id="261">We used to get coffee in the morning with a piece of bread and sometimes noontime they used to give us a little soup and then in the evening again the same bread and that was our food for the day. </sentence><sentence id="262">We were in this barn for a couple of months and women were dying all day, every single day. </sentence><sentence id="263">We started out with five thousand women. </sentence><sentence id="264">About two hundred and fifty survived. </sentence><sentence id="265">And one night, one day one SS man told us that the next day we are going to be digging ditches for ourselves, because the war is going very badly and they don't want us to fall in anybody's hands, and we're going to be shot and buried there, not to fall into anybody's hands. </sentence><sentence id="266">But the next day...during the night we heard some shelling and bombing and we didn't know what was going on, but when we got up in the morning we didn't see any guards. </sentence><sentence id="267">We didn't see anybody. </sentence><sentence id="268">And we were afraid to go anywhere and we didn't have the strength to go anywhere. </sentence><sentence id="269">But a couple hours later we saw a jeep full with soldiers came, Russian soldiers...and they told us that the  war was over right here in this part of Germany and we can go wherever we want to. </sentence><sentence id="270">We couldn't go anywhere. </sentence><sentence id="271">We didn't have the strength and we were so filthy. </sentence><sentence id="272">We full of lice. </sentence><sentence id="273">Our bodies were beaten up. </sentence><sentence id="274">We were dirty. </sentence><sentence id="275">Lot of people have frozen hands and their feet were frozen. </sentence><sentence id="276">Couple hours later a truck came and took us in to the village and we came in to the village. </sentence><sentence id="277">We didn't see any Germans there, because the people retreated with the German army and they let us loose and we started to grab food, whatever we could find. </sentence><sentence id="278">We ate whatever we found, whatever we could. </sentence><sentence id="279">Some people overate too much. </sentence><sentence id="280">They they didn't eat the right food. </sentence><sentence id="281">They didn't eat normally. </sentence><sentence id="282">They took sick and died. </sentence><sentence id="283">Some had to have their feet amputated because they were so frozen they couldn't walk anymore on them. </sentence><sentence id="284">We had to bathe ourselves in kerosene every day to get rid of the lice. </sentence><sentence id="285">Burn our clothes every day until we got rid rid of all the dirt and all the lice. </sentence><sentence id="286">We were in this village for a couple of months. </sentence><sentence id="287">Then after we started to feel better, my sister and myself decided to go back to Vilno. </sentence><sentence id="288">We knew that our mother is dead and we heard in Struthof that my father was killed in Estonia, but we still wanted to go back to our city because we left a lot of household goods and some personal stuff with our non-Jewish neighbors, and we thought maybe we can get back from them and sell it and use the money for clothes or other
