<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="5">A: My name is Jack Ahrens. </sentence><sentence id="6">I was born in Lida, which was Poland at the time of my birth, and I was born, born July 26, 1921. </sentence><sentence id="7">Q. Tell me a little bit about your boyhood in Lida, what it was like. </sentence><sentence id="8">A. I grew up in a normal family. </sentence><sentence id="9">My -- I was the only child. </sentence><sentence id="10">My father was an engineer who owned, together with my mother's uncle, a foundry which used to make agricultural equipment like plows, which were horse-pulled. </sentence><sentence id="11">Very primitive, to compare what's going on now. </sentence><sentence id="12">We lived next to the factory, and I used to visit it, and I guess that's what installed my love for engineering, because my father was an engineer. </sentence><sentence id="13">Unfortunately, he died in 1932. </sentence><sentence id="14">I was 10 and half years old at the time. </sentence><sentence id="15">Three years later, I think, my mother remarried. </sentence><sentence id="16">She remarried an American. </sentence><sentence id="17">She came, she and -- to the States. </sentence><sentence id="18">She was in the states until 1938. </sentence><sentence id="19">I was brought up by my grandparents. </sentence><sentence id="20">Lived together with my aunt and uncle and finished the gimnazjum! -- </sentence><sentence id="21">that is the Polish high school -- with the last graduating class, in 1939. </sentence><sentence id="22">My mother never became an American citizen because of involvement in properties in Poland, but she came to visit h-- us in 1938, and when the war broke out, she got stuck. </sentence><sentence id="23">She had papers which would allow her to reenter the United States, but she was not a citizen. </sentence><sentence id="24">After graduating high school, my grandfather, who happened to be one of the wealthiest Jews in our little town of Lida -- was a town of " Grammar school (Polish). </sentence><sentence id="25">approximately 30,000 people, out of which between 10 and 15,000 were Jewish. </sentence><sentence id="26">He was one of the wealthier men. </sentence><sentence id="27">He had, he had connections, of course. </sentence><sentence id="28">He knew a lot of other people, and he knew someone who was connected with -- to the creator of modern Poland in 19-- in 1918, Marshal Pilsudski. </sentence><sentence id="29">The reason why I'm mentioning it is because for Jews to enter a school of higher learning was extremely difficult. </sentence><sentence id="30">They were -- there were quotas, and you had to be extremely brilliant in order to be admitted within the quota. </sentence><sentence id="31">But he was told that if I pass the entrance exam for the Polytechnic Institute of Warsaw, I would be admitted, as long as I pass it. </sentence><sentence id="32">So, in 1939 in August, I went to Warsaw to study with the Union of Jewish Students of the Polytechnic Institute of Warsaw -- sort of preparatory course prior to the exam; and that's when I saw the posters of mobilization that -- and the war broke out at that time. </sentence><sentence id="33">That was when Hitler attacked Poland, on September Ist, 1939. </sentence><sentence id="34">That night of September Ist, I was on the last train from Warsaw traveling to Lida, after I had left all my possessions in Warsaw. </sentence><sentence id="35">I just -- I was glad to get out. </sentence><sentence id="36">The train, the train trip that normally took 12 hours, took pro-- about 24 hours. </sentence><sentence id="37">We were bombed along the way, but we did make Lida, and when I got home, I got scolded: Why did I leave all my possessions in Warsaw? </sentence><sentence id="38">I said, "I just couldn't carry it." </sentence><sentence id="39">I mean, that's how people trivialized the war. </sentence><sentence id="40">They didn't think that things will happen. </sentence><sentence id="41">We didn't realize what actually is going to happen. </sentence><sentence id="42">We were at home watching -- listening to the radio, watching Poland, the Polish army collapse -- not from the broadcasts, the Polish broadcasts, but from broadcasts from abroad because the Poles didn't want to admit. </sentence><sentence id="43">They thought their cavalry, their horses, would actually overcome the German tanks. </sentence><sentence id="44">Fortunately for us, Stalin and the Russian Army -- and the Red Army, came in from the east, went towards the west and they divided Poland and that time. </sentence><sentence id="45">Hitler and Stalin, they divided Poland and fortunate for us, my town, Lida, was in the Russian territory, in the Russian area. </sentence><sentence id="46">Q. Ok, before you continue, I want to ask you a couple questions. </sentence><sentence id="47">A. Sure. </sentence><sentence id="48">Q. When you left Warsaw, you had the -- a sense that you had to get out and get back to your family? </sentence><sentence id="49">What was going on? </sentence><sentence id="50">A. They were mobilizing just about everybody, except not 18 year-olds. </sentence><sentence id="51">I was 18 at the time. </sentence><sentence id="52">I think anyone -- I, I don't remember. </sentence><sentence id="53">Anyone who was in the army prior to that: the reservists, plus anyone who was over 20, I think; they had to report to the nearest army post. </sentence><sentence id="54">I was not included, but -- I just didn't want to be separated from the family. </sentence><sentence id="55">I sort of realized that Poland had no chance against Germany, against Hitler after the way he showed -- after his show of force in Czechoslovakia and Austria. </sentence><sentence id="56">Q. So you already had a fairly strong awareness of Hitler and Nazism? </sentence><sentence id="57">A. Yes, definitely. </sentence><sentence id="58">I did belong to the -- prior to the war, I did belong to a group, to the Zionist movement, and I was an admirer at that time of Ze'ev Jabotinsky, which is a -- I did belong to the Betar also. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="114">Q: And then, just going back a little further to the town and the community in Lida, before </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="116"> we go on, I'd love it for you to tell me a little bit more about what life was like before the war, and whether you experienced antisemitism, whether you mingled with the Christian people in the town -- what, what, what it was like. </sentence><sentence id="117">A. Jews usually did not mingle with the, with the Christians. </sentence><sentence id="118">In going to school -- there were two high schools in our town, one actually closed after that. </sentence><sentence id="119">There was a private high school and a high school which was run by the State. </sentence><sentence id="120">The State high school was the privileged school and there's -- there was a quota with the, with the State High -- with the State gimnazjum. </sentence><sentence id="121">Not all the Jews that wanted were allowed to go there. </sentence><sentence id="122">By strange coincidence, the other high school was a private high school; however the majority of Jews, Jewish children, went to a school which was called the handlowka." </sentence><sentence id="123">That was a commerce school where you were prepared for accounting, for bookkeeping, so something like that. </sentence><sentence id="124">And that school was run by a order of, of Cath-- Catholic priests. </sentence><sentence id="125">But Jews were accepted there. </sentence><sentence id="126">There was no quota in that school. </sentence><sentence id="127">Because I was one of the few who was accepted to the high school, to the Catholic High -- to the State high school from the very beginning -- and in Poland we had eight years of high school. </sentence><sentence id="128">B. Later, during my time, they changed it. </sentence><sentence id="129">It was six years of high school and two years of lyceum. </sentence><sentence id="130">It was like the last two years of high school, they changed it. </sentence><sentence id="131">They called it lyceum. </sentence><sentence id="132">The quota was sort of rescinded and many, many more Jews were allowed into this, into this high school. </sentence><sentence id="133">We formed a very close circle of friends, none of us were non- Jewish -- strictly by religion. </sentence><sentence id="134">If Jewish girls were out with a Christian boy, it happened -- ? </sentence><sentence id="135">Commercial school (Polish). </sentence><sentence id="136">the opposite happened very, very seldom. </sentence><sentence id="137">It more often that the Jewish girls were out with Christian boys, it was sort of like a black mark on their record. </sentence><sentence id="138">It was held against them. </sentence><sentence id="139">But we did make friends. </sentence><sentence id="140">In school we were quite friendly. </sentence><sentence id="141">However, like everywhere, the high school kids were -- the Christian high school kids -- were in, in the front of ideas. </sentence><sentence id="142">So when Marshal Pilsudski died in 1935, and the reactionary, the real chauvinistic -- I forgot the man, the man's name, took over, there was one of the few pogroms in Lida. </sentence><sentence id="143">The pogrom consisted basically of not killing people, but destroying property. </sentence><sentence id="144">There were some broken windows. </sentence><sentence id="145">There were some broken stores, and maybe a few Jews were beat up, but no one got killed. </sentence><sentence id="146">No one was tortured. </sentence><sentence id="147">It was more or less you had to stay off the street because you knew if they catch you, you were going to get a beating. </sentence><sentence id="148">That lasted a day or two and then it was forgotten, and we were good friends all over again. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="182">Q: Did you personally -- </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="184">A: It was sort of, it was sort of directed by the government. </sentence><sentence id="185">They were told, "You have to do it." </sentence><sentence id="186">Sorry. </sentence><sentence id="187">What was your question? </sentence></p><p><sentence id="188"> Q. I'm sorry. </sentence><sentence id="189">Did you personally ever get beat up, or people say things to you, or experience any of this? </sentence></p><p><sentence id="190"> A. Oh, I was told many things. </sentence><sentence id="191">I was told, but never physically. </sentence><sentence id="192">I never had any physical harm, but I saw them breaking windows and walking around with what you would describe now as a baseball bat. </sentence><sentence id="193">Actually we didn't play any baseball, they were just </sentence></p><p><sentence id="194"> sticks. </sentence><sentence id="195">Hitting Jewish businesses, because most of the downtown Lida was Jewish businesses. </sentence><sentence id="196">I would say probably 95 percent or more of the businesses in town were Jewish, Jewish-owned. </sentence><sentence id="197">The Poles were mostly farmers. </sentence><sentence id="198">It's strange but many times on, on some occasions we were told by our friends, Watch out. </sentence><sentence id="199">Don't go out this evening because there will be like a rumble." </sentence><sentence id="200">We were friendly with them. </sentence><sentence id="201">So, you stood home, and that's it. </sentence><sentence id="202">It's -- the division was strictly on a religious basis, and in opposite to what you have in here as far as Jews, are concerned, you had the Hasidim, the real Orthodox, and the traditional, what you would describe here. </sentence><sentence id="203">But still men and women were separated, or they were on different -- they were usually on different floors in the, in the synagogue. </sentence><sentence id="204">The women were upstairs, the men were downstairs. </sentence><sentence id="205">But there was no such a thing as modern Judaism, the Reform Judaism. </sentence><sentence id="206">It didn't exist in, in our town at all. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="207"> Q. What about your family? </sentence></p><p><sentence id="208"> A. My grandfather, who basically raised me with my grandmother, they were I would say Orthodox, but not Hasidim. </sentence><sentence id="209">They observed all the holidays. </sentence><sentence id="210">They did everything according to the good book, but they were not what I would say in their dress and their behavior, they were modern. </sentence><sentence id="211">But I did have an uncle who married my grandfather's sister -- it's not my uncle, my mother's uncle -- who was a hosed." </sentence><sentence id="212">In fact, I became quite acquainted with the, with the Hasidim, because I said Kaddish* for my father for 11 months after he died, and the only one that would go to -- that went to temple three times a day was my mother's uncle. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="213"> 3 Follower, admirer (Yiddish). </sentence></p><p><sentence id="214"> 4 Hebrew prayer for mourners (Hebrew). </sentence></p><p><sentence id="215"> So, I used to go to his temple, to his Hasidishe shtibl,deg to say Kaddish for my father. </sentence><sentence id="216">And that's what I, more or less, I got acquainted with the Hasidim. </sentence><sentence id="217">It's not that I -- I did admire them for their staunch behavior, for their staunch belief, for the way they behaved in spite of all the adversity, because the town was -- didn't exactly admire them, because they, they were different. </sentence><sentence id="218">See, the Jews in Poland from what I -- at least in my town, tried to more or less assimilate. </sentence><sentence id="219">They didn't try to separate themselves. </sentence><sentence id="220">They tried to live like the other people. </sentence><sentence id="221">In fact, they lived better than the other people. </sentence><sentence id="222">They were more Polish than the Poles themselves. </sentence><sentence id="223">Now, I remember that in my parent's home -- because my father came from Russia; my mother met him when my -- her parents, my grandparents, ran away from Lida. </sentence><sentence id="224">They were in Lida for several generations, but they ran away from Lida in the first World War. </sentence><sentence id="225">Lida was a battlefield, so they ended up in a town called Tsarizin in the -- in Russia. </sentence><sentence id="226">Tsarizin was known by another name, Stalingrad, during the second World War. </sentence><sentence id="227">They lived there for a few years, and they met my father, who was from Khar'kov in the Ukraine, which is now Ukraine. </sentence><sentence id="228">At that time it was all Russia. </sentence><sentence id="229">My father married my mother. </sentence><sentence id="230">He was 10 or 11 years older than her, but she was a beautiful girl, and they -- he came together with his in-laws to Lida. </sentence><sentence id="231">They built that factory I have mentioned. </sentence><sentence id="232">I used to go there with him, watch them pour molten iron into forms, and they liked me, I think, the people that worked for him, they liked me because -- they, they, they liked me even later. </sentence><sentence id="233">But after he died, and my mother remarried, the factory sort of reverted to the rest of the family. </sentence><sentence id="234">It was my uncle that was running it, and, and my mother's uncle actually paid my mother off, and he had that factory. </sentence><sentence id="235">He took it over. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="236"> Q.

When the Russians came in 1939, the change-- the changes were major. </sentence><sentence id="240">First of all, the Russian classified everybody in many ways. </sentence><sentence id="241">The first classification was: were you a working man, or were you a capitalist, or so-called "bourgeois." </sentence><sentence id="242">Second, they also, on your passport which they gave you, besides your social status, if you were a working man or not, they listed your religion. </sentence><sentence id="243">I had a friend whose father was the chief engineer of a rubber factory in our town. </sentence><sentence id="244">Our -- the town of Lida was quite industrial. </sentence><sentence id="245">It had two foundries. </sentence><sentence id="246">It had a factory that produced nails used for construction, and a factory that produced rubber; usually they produced -- what's the English? </sentence><sentence id="247">Galoshe-- Galoshen (ph). </sentence></p><p><sentence id="248">What's that? </sentence><sentence id="249">Rubber, rubber boots. </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="250">A: Galoshes. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="252">Q: Galoshes. </sentence><sentence id="253">The chief engineer of that factory, his son, we went to school together, we were the best of friends. </sentence><sentence id="254">So when the Russians came in, and they na-- of course immediately they nationalized all the factories, but they left the chief engineer in charge, because, after all, he was a working man. </sentence><sentence id="255">He gave me a job. </sentence><sentence id="256">He gave my mother a job. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="262">So, I was able to get a passport which stated that I was a student working, but the Jew, the "Evrei,""(r) remained on the passport. </sentence><sentence id="263">My mother was able to get a passport that she was working -- "Rabochiy,"" but still Jew. </sentence><sentence id="264">All the, the rest of the family got passports that they were capitalists, and they were banned from Lida, because Lida was too close to the 6 Jew (Russian). </sentence><sentence id="265">T Working (Russian). </sentence><sentence id="266">border. </sentence><sentence id="267">You had to be at least a hundred kilometers from the border. </sentence><sentence id="268">Lida was closer than a hundred kilometers, so they were banned and my grandparents had to move into a small -- very, very small town. </sentence><sentence id="269">It's not even a town, it's -- was a settlement, whatever you want to call it. </sentence><sentence id="270">More inland, more father away from the border. </sentence><sentence id="271">In the meantime, my mother's younger sister -- she had two sisters. </sentence><sentence id="272">That would have been the middle sister. </sentence><sentence id="273">She was married to an engineer, a chemical engineer, whose brother was an electrical engineer. </sentence><sentence id="274">They built in Lida a little factory which made rubber heals. </sentence><sentence id="275">Prior to that, he gained these experience by building factories. </sentence><sentence id="276">He built -- he was -- he built a factory in Spain. </sentence><sentence id="277">He built a factory in Greece, and my aunt was traveling with him. </sentence><sentence id="278">He spent, spent a few years in each place because he could not find work in Lida -- or in Poland, actually. </sentence><sentence id="279">Then he decided he and his brother build a factory where -- that was making rubber heals. </sentence><sentence id="280">When the Russians came in, they of course nationalized the factory, and they had to run away. </sentence><sentence id="281">So him and his brother and the brother's family went to Vilna. </sentence><sentence id="282">When the Russians came in, they gave Lithuania a short-lived independence. </sentence><sentence id="283">The border was not closed immediately, so you could travel actually to Vilna. </sentence><sentence id="284">My aunt, my mother's sister, remained in Lida to liquidate her possessions. </sentence><sentence id="285">She was selling everything off. </sentence><sentence id="286">She sold everything, and she decided to cross the border illegally with some other people that I knew, and they got caught by the, by the Russians. </sentence><sentence id="287">The trial was immediate. </sentence><sentence id="288">The sentence was immediate. </sentence><sentence id="289">They were sent to Siberia to Kazakhstan, banished there. </sentence><sentence id="290">We knew all that. </sentence><sentence id="291">There is a reason why I am mentioning that. </sentence><sentence id="292">That's part of my general experience. </sentence><sentence id="293">Also, we had a cousin. </sentence><sentence id="294">It's not, not my cousin, it's my mother's cousin. </sentence><sentence id="295">It's all -- but I still call him a cousin, who was a doctor, and being, being a doctor, being of draft age, he and his brother, both of them were drafted into the Polish Army. </sentence><sentence id="296">The brother, being just an accountant, was a private. </sentence><sentence id="297">The doctor, because he was a doctor, became an officer. </sentence><sentence id="298">They were -- they became pri-- Russian prisoners of war. </sentence><sentence id="299">The private escaped, and he survived in a different way. </sentence><sentence id="300">But the doctor, eventually he perished in Katyn, in the mass graves when 10,000 Polish officers were killed by the Russians on Stalin's orders. </sentence><sentence id="301">But his wife and daughter were arrested, sentenced immediately, and sent to Si-- to Siberia, also, also to Kazakhstan. </sentence><sentence id="302">That's where my aunt met both of them. </sentence><sentence id="303">The reason why I am mentioning it is when we decided -- when we ended up in Lvov -- I'm jumping again. </sentence><sentence id="304">When we -- when my mother and I got the good passports, I still wanted to go to Polytechnic Institute, but the nearest Polytechnic was in Lvov, which was 600 kilometers south of Lida, approximately. </sentence><sentence id="305">That was too far to leave the family, so my compromise was to study physics at the University of Vilna. </sentence><sentence id="306">I went to Vilna, and I tried to enroll there. </sentence><sentence id="307">However, they closed the border between Lida and -- between Russia -- between the Soviet Union and Lithuania, and travel would have been impossible. </sentence><sentence id="308">So, I came back to Lida, and I think it was already March of 1940, we decided with my mother to go and settle in Lvov. </sentence><sentence id="309">Now the -- when the Russians came into Lida, beside nationalizing the factories, they requisitioned all the homes. </sentence><sentence id="310">They requisitioned all the living quarters. </sentence><sentence id="311">I lived with my grandparents and with my mother. </sentence><sentence id="312">They had a big house and they had a sort of an apartment in the back, and we lived in that apartment with my mother. </sentence><sentence id="313">They chased everybody out. </sentence><sentence id="314">They limit -- gave us, I think, two or three rooms, and that was for seven people. </sentence><sentence id="315">In the beginning, we had a Russian colonel -- a Russian general -- living with us. </sentence><sentence id="316">But that was sort of, more or less -- I became friendly with, with some Russian, with some Russian airmen. </sentence><sentence id="317">We used to indulge in vodka together, Have gefilte fish on a Friday with vodka. </sentence><sentence id="318">We became friends. </sentence><sentence id="319">I was doing nothing at the time, except working occasionally in the rubber factory to maintain my status that I am still a working man, but my goal was to get out and go to Lvov. [ </sentence><sentence id="320">Technical conversation] When we left -- and this is rather important -- when we left Lida and went for Lvov, we didn't realize how crowded Lvov was. </sentence><sentence id="321">All the refugees, mostly Jews that escaped Hitler from Warsaw and Krakow, came to Lvov. </sentence><sentence id="322">Lvov at that time had a Jewish community of over 150,000. </sentence><sentence id="323">The population of Lvov actually more than doubled with the refugees because of the war. </sentence><sentence id="324">Finding living quarters was absolutely impossible. </sentence><sentence id="325">So, when we came, we started to look and look, and eventually we found an apartment with a Polish family. </sentence><sentence id="326">It was an older Pole. </sentence><sentence id="327">He was at that time in his 60s. </sentence><sentence id="328">He had a -- with his wife. </sentence><sentence id="329">They lived on the outskirts of Lvov. </sentence><sentence id="330">He was like a general contractor. </sentence><sentence id="331">He was, I'd would say, about a kilometer from the last stop of the streetcar, and that Pole actually played a major part, an extremely major part in my life. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="405">Q: Ok. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="407"> Q. Ok, you've arrived in Lvov, and I want you to tell me something about the life there in the community, and, and I know it was an important city, so what was your life like? </sentence></p><p><sentence id="408"> A. It was a big city. </sentence><sentence id="409">We found an apartment, which was an extremely important thing with the -- this Polish family: Czachor; his name was Jan, her name was Marja. </sentence><sentence id="410">They were both elder Poles. </sentence><sentence id="411">I had a lot of conversations with him because on the beginning my main aim was to enroll into the Polytechnic institute of Lvov, which actually didn't -- that was April, and school wouldn't start for at least five months or more. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="412"> Q.

The fact that they went to school didn't make them human. </sentence><sentence id="687">They were sort of like a split  Pe'ahot (Hebrew) is the plural of pe'ah, the long sidelocks worn by some observant Jews. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="688"> personality. </sentence><sentence id="689">Did anyone -- would anyone believe that civilized Germans that gave us big ph-- such great philosophers and mu-- musicians and you name it, were capable of the atrocities they committed? </sentence><sentence id="690">That was a complete split of per-- personality. </sentence><sentence id="691">The same people that were admiring -- going to museums during the day or -- the next hour they were capable of killing, massacring, maiming people because they considered the Jews being subhuman, being not of the same class, not the same -- they were not human beings. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="692"> I was very disappointed with that Polish family because they were the ones that pointed out me to a German officer. </sentence><sentence id="693">We were home -- I was home with my mother, a knock on the door, German officer comes in. </sentence><sentence id="694">You leap to, sort of, "Attention!" </sentence><sentence id="695">You d-- you don't know what's going to happen; an SS officer dressed in full uniform, and so on. </sentence><sentence id="696">I didn't -- I never spoke German. </sentence><sentence id="697">I could speak Yiddish. </sentence><sentence id="698">But -- in, in high school I took French as a foreign language. </sentence><sentence id="699">We were told by the teacher that was teaching German that "If you think that if you are Jewish, and you think that you're going to be using Jewish for German as a substitute, I'll fail you. </sentence><sentence id="700">German is German, and Yiddish is Yiddish." </sentence><sentence id="701">So, I said, "Why should I argue with him?" </sentence><sentence id="702">I went and I took French. </sentence><sentence id="703">Anyway this German officer came in and made himself understood. </sentence><sentence id="704">I mean, he says, "I heard that you have a camera." </sentence><sentence id="705">And I had a beautiful Kodak camera that my mother brought me from the United States. </sentence><sentence id="706">And I knew that it was a good and original Kodak. </sentence><sentence id="707">Said, "No, I don't have it. </sentence><sentence id="708">I sold it." </sentence><sentence id="709">He says, "You want me to search the place?" </sentence><sentence id="710">So my mother says, "You </sentence></p><p><sentence id="711"> better -- what, are you going to start up? </sentence><sentence id="712">Give it to him." </sentence><sentence id="713">So I said, "I forgot. </sentence><sentence id="714">I thought my mother sold it. </sentence><sentence id="715">I thought that she nee-- sold it because she needed -- she wanted -- needed it for bread." </sentence><sentence id="716">I took the camera out, and I gave it to the German officer. </sentence><sentence id="717">He says, "No. </sentence><sentence id="718">I am not going to take it from you. </sentence><sentence id="719">Here is a receipt. </sentence><sentence id="720">I'll give you a receipt for five German marks that you sold it to me voluntarily. </sentence><sentence id="721">No one will accuse an SS officer of st-- taking a camera from a Jew." </sentence><sentence id="722">I had that receipt for quite a while. </sentence><sentence id="723">Wish -- I wish I had it now. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="724"> Q. Was there a, a -- an atmosphere of fear? </sentence></p><p><sentence id="725"> A. Yes. </sentence><sentence id="726">There was a time already at, of -- where Jews had to wear armbands, and they were prior to the ghetto. </sentence><sentence id="727">If a German approached you, a Jew was not supposed to be on the sidewalk. </sentence><sentence id="728">You had to walk in the gutter. </sentence><sentence id="729">Rain, mud -- you had to get off and let the German pass. </sentence><sentence id="730">You had to salute. </sentence><sentence id="731">Salute, by that time, meant take off your -- bow, and take off your hat to a German officer or a German soldier that walked, if you passed one. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="732">If there was any way how they could humiliate you, they found a way how to do it. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="733">Again, I didn't live in the Jewish -- in the real Jewish area, but the things that I have heard -- and I saw it myself -- where they used to grab the real religious one and cut the pe'ahsin, cut the beard, make them lick their boots to a shine, beat them to a, to a, toa point where they were unconscious. </sentence><sentence id="734">They wouldn't bother -- maybe they wouldn't bother young people like myself, because after all, we di-- didn't look different. </sentence><sentence id="735">We still had the armband. </sentence><sentence id="736">But it during -- while this was going on, I still kept in touch with that Polish family. </sentence><sentence id="737">The only way how I could do it is you used -- we -- I used to get dressed a little </sentence></p><p><sentence id="738"> better, not report to work, slip the armband off into my pocket, grab the streetcar, take the streetcar to the end of its run, and then walk that kilometer and go over to his house for a talk -- just to maintain a friendship. </sentence><sentence id="739">We were talking to each other. </sentence><sentence id="740">He told me he was working with the Polish underground resistance. </sentence><sentence id="741">He gave me some names of the contacts -- "In case you need it, you can rely on some people." </sentence><sentence id="742">I knew that he had a radio transmitter, and radio receiver, and a cache of arms. </sentence><sentence id="743">The reason why he was able to have all that; he had a big house. </sentence><sentence id="744">The front of it was like a shop, like a carpenter's shop, and he was able to hide all these things between the stacks of lumber and stacks of other things, between his tools, and they never bothered him. </sentence><sentence id="745">As the ghetto was tightening, and the Aktions became prevalent every couple of weeks, we were lined up. </sentence><sentence id="746">We had to line -- first of all they built a fence around the ghetto. </sentence><sentence id="747">You had to enter through a main gate. </sentence><sentence id="748">And I remember one time that was in the -- late in the fall of "41, we were coming from work, because my job for most of the time through that cousin that I have mentioned that was a, a makher in the ghetto with the other family. </sentence><sentence id="749">Unfortunately, I don't remember the name of the other family, and they didn't survive. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="750"> This cousin and himself and his wife -- rather, no, his wife was the cousin -- they didn't survive; but their daughter and her sister, they survived. </sentence><sentence id="751">I was able to get the right documents for work. </sentence><sentence id="752">My job was what you call "Rohstuffverfassung"" -- "gathering raw materials." </sentence><sentence id="753">We used to go to demolish places, to demolished houses, to places where they used to gather all kinds of raw material and put copper to copper, steel to steel, brass to 3 Gathering raw materials (German). </sentence></p><p><sentence id="754"> brass, gold to gold, silver to silver. </sentence><sentence id="755">God forbid if anyone took a piece of gold or a piece of silver. </sentence><sentence id="756">That meant, if they caught you, that one meant immediate execution on the spot, right on the spot. </sentence><sentence id="757">Because you were searched at their whim. </sentence><sentence id="758">But the documents were excellent. </sentence><sentence id="759">There were many times where the group, when we were lined up to go to work, and there were thousands of people on the main square of the ghetto, thousands and thousands, and the Germans used to come in and say, "This group, go to the left; and this group, go to the right." </sentence><sentence id="760">We used to show them our papers and, "This group, go." </sentence><sentence id="761">And we always happened to go in the right direction where we, we were able to survive. </sentence><sentence id="762">The document saved -- definitely saved our lives by being in the right group with the right -- the beatings during the, during the work, while we were working, were rather rare. </sentence><sentence id="763">We didn't get paid. </sentence><sentence id="764">Occasionally they gave us some food; you had to sort of maneuver yourself. </sentence><sentence id="765">But being on the outside, we were able to be in touch with the outside world and talk to people and do a lot of finagling where we were able to smuggle in things into the ghetto. </sentence><sentence id="766">They didn't check us as well as they checked the other people. </sentence><sentence id="767">We were, sort of call it, the Rohstuffverfassung was the elite, in a way. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="768"> We survived -- I survived that way the Aktions where they went after the old. </sentence><sentence id="769">They went after the young. </sentence><sentence id="770">They went after the sick. </sentence><sentence id="771">They went after just about anybody. </sentence><sentence id="772">I have witnessed atrocities beyond anybody's belief, belief and description. </sentence><sentence id="773">Because when they used to put us aside to wait what's the whim of the ghetto commander, or whoever he was, I -- one was Wilhelm (ph), I think. </sentence><sentence id="774">Another one -- I don't recall their names. </sentence><sentence id="775">Gr-- </sentence></p><p><sentence id="776"> Gruber (ph), I think; I don't recall. </sentence><sentence id="777">We were -- I saw them beat to pulp, execute, kill, shoot. </sentence><sentence id="778">I saw them take a little baby and tear it in half. </sentence><sentence id="779">That's one image I'll never forget in my life. </sentence><sentence id="780">It, it, it just -- how subhuman. </sentence><sentence id="781">Germans did it. </sentence><sentence id="782">The Ukrainians did it. </sentence><sentence id="783">Now, how would you -- Germans were in German uniforms. </sentence><sentence id="784">The Ukrainians, they had their own uniform. </sentence><sentence id="785">Poles were not there, but there were -- they had a group of Russian prisoners of war which turned on the Russians. </sentence><sentence id="786">They gave them a name which I don't recall -- which co-- collaborated with the Germans that, that, that did the dirty work. </sentence><sentence id="787">The ghetto was practically reduced to, to nothing, because from 150,000, when 1943 came there was 20,000 left through de-- through killings, deportations to concentration camps, local executions. </sentence><sentence id="788">They used to kill and bury them. </sentence><sentence id="789">They had, outside of Janowska, there were places where they used to -- with mass graves where they were just killing one on top of the other. </sentence><sentence id="790">And all this time they were shrinking and reducing the ghetto, moving the fence and making it smaller and smaller until -- it was right after New Years of 1943. </sentence><sentence id="791">We had a place where this Gajkowski, that's my cousin's husband, my uncle. </sentence><sentence id="792">There was another man by the name of Pupko that was from my hometown, and I was, I was there. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="793"> My mother wasn't there already. </sentence><sentence id="794">Came to us and told us that "The next three nights are going to be absolutely awful. </sentence><sentence id="795">You better try to get out. </sentence><sentence id="796">If you survive, you-- you'll be able to come back, but it's going to be absolutely awful." </sentence><sentence id="797">Now, the reason why my mother wasn't there is sometimes that summer toward fall she was in touch with a Polish woman, a peasant Polish -- Polish peasant woman that used to come to the ghetto wall, and she </sentence></p><p><sentence id="798"> used to sort of give her items of clothing, items of jewelry, and exchange it for bread for, for food with her. </sentence><sentence id="799">You could do it in certain spots in the ghetto. </sentence><sentence id="800">So the woman said to her, "Why don't you come and stay with me?" </sentence><sentence id="801">My mother was very skeptical. </sentence><sentence id="802">Can I trust her? </sentence></p><p><sentence id="803">Because many people -- there were many, many things known where people used to let in Jews, then chase them out or call the Germans and take away all their belongings, all their property, all their jewelry -- whatever they had. </sentence><sentence id="804">So, my mother said, "I'll try. </sentence><sentence id="805">After all, I still have you. </sentence><sentence id="806">I'll leave some things with you, and I'll go there." </sentence><sentence id="807">So, she went there. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="808">It was about 35 kilometers out of Lvov, in the direction of Ternopol. </sentence><sentence id="809">She went there, and she stood there for several weeks until -- and I know it because she told me that. </sentence><sentence id="810">My mother told me. </sentence><sentence id="811">The woman came to her that someone said to me -- </sentence></p><p><sentence id="812"> [Technical interruption] </sentence></p><p><sentence id="813"> So the Polish woman said that she was told by someone that, "You must have someone. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="814">You're hiding someone because we saw strange shadows moving in the middle of the night." </sentence><sentence id="815">See, my mother was hidden in a barn on top but she had to take out all her body waste in the middle of the night and dump it somewhere. </sentence><sentence id="816">So someone noticed someone running around in the middle of the night. </sentence><sentence id="817">So she says, "You can't stay here and you have to come back to -- you, you have to get out of here." </sentence><sentence id="818">She left -- so she left the woman and started to go back to Lvov to come back to the ghetto. </sentence><sentence id="819">As they were coming -- she met -- as she was coming, she met another woman, and you know two Jews -- two Jewish women, they sort of, you recognize each other, even if you are dressed like a Polish </sentence></p><p><sentence id="820"> peasant with a babushka and all that, but you sort of you know, you recognize each other. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="821">They recognized that they were both Jewish women, and they both proceeded to Lvov, and not far from Lvov, they were caught by a patrol, by a German patrol, who was out searching for escaped Jewish boys from, from, from Janowska street, from the concentration camp. </sentence><sentence id="822">The guy, they beat him up and they gave my mother and the other woman shovels. </sentence><sentence id="823">He says, "Dig yourself a grave. </sentence><sentence id="824">You're going to be shot right here." </sentence><sentence id="825">What are you going to do? </sentence><sentence id="826">They started to dig. </sentence><sentence id="827">In the meantime, the patrol came out of the woods with a couple of other women, and the, the SS guy said to the other women, "What are you doing here?" " </sentence><sentence id="828">Oh," she says, "will you save us. </sentence><sentence id="829">We came to see our boys who are on Janowska street. </sentence><sentence id="830">We wanted to see them. </sentence><sentence id="831">We know that they are in Janowska." " </sentence><sentence id="832">You verfluchte Juden!""4 He shot the other two women. </sentence><sentence id="833">He put them in the graves, in the holes that my mother and the other woman dug. </sentence><sentence id="834">He made them cover them up, and he said, "I had enough killing today. </sentence><sentence id="835">Verschwinden"! -- " </sentence><sentence id="836">get lost," to my mother and the other woman. </sentence><sentence id="837">They made their way back into the ghetto. </sentence><sentence id="838">When I came that day from work, I didn't recognized my mother, because after all I never saw her with black eyes, with a swollen face. </sentence><sentence id="839">I never saw her like that in my life. </sentence><sentence id="840">But I said to her, "That's not the place for you. </sentence><sentence id="841">Let me try," because I go outside the ghetto, "let me try to talk to Czachor," to this Pole. </sentence><sentence id="842">And I went to work. </sentence><sentence id="843">I slipped the armband. </sentence><sentence id="844">I went to -- and I went to visit that gu-- that Po-- that Polish guy. </sentence><sentence id="845">He says to me, "I can't give you an answer." </sentence><sentence id="846">He said, "Let me think about it." </sentence><sentence id="847">I said, "Please, I mean, things are very bad. </sentence><sentence id="848">You -- try to help me." </sentence><sentence id="849">I appealed to his patriotism. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="850">4 "vou damned Jews!" ( </sentence><sentence id="851">German) 1S "Disappear" (German). </sentence></p><p><sentence id="852"> To his -- more than his Polish patriotism is to him -- I said, "You are a human being. </sentence><sentence id="853">You are trying to save another human being which is not guilty of anything. </sentence><sentence id="854">The only guilt is that she was born a Jew, but what did she do? </sentence><sentence id="855">She didn't do anything to you. </sentence><sentence id="856">She didn't do anything to anybody. </sentence><sentence id="857">Take my mother and let her stay with you." </sentence><sentence id="858">I was able to get back in time to come back to the ghetto. </sentence><sentence id="859">A few days later I went there again, and he said, "Ok, let her come, but I must get paid for it." </sentence><sentence id="860">I said, "How do you want to get paid?" </sentence><sentence id="861">He says, "T don't want your money. </sentence><sentence id="862">I'm not going to take your money and all that." </sentence><sentence id="863">He says, "I want an equivalent of a pound of butter, the value of a pound of butter" -- of a kilogram of butter, actually; that's two pounds -- "per week, per week of stay. </sentence><sentence id="864">Whatever -- and you give it to me in any denomination, any currency that you want -- that you can give me." </sentence><sentence id="865">So, we had some dollars. </sentence><sentence id="866">Fortunately, we had singles. </sentence><sentence id="867">So my mother took a lot of singles, and we exchanged some dollars. </sentence><sentence id="868">You could exchange the money in, in ghetto for singles. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="869">You could do all these things. </sentence><sentence id="870">And this man that I have mentioned, Pupka, was one of the guys that used to deal with gold, with currency, and all that. </sentence><sentence id="871">He was from Lida as well. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="872">My mo-- I got my mother there. </sentence><sentence id="873">In fact, she went there by herself. </sentence><sentence id="874">I didn't go with her because two people would have been much easier to detect. </sentence><sentence id="875">One was easier to get, to get through. </sentence><sentence id="876">I mean, after all, it was easier for one pu-- she, she wa-- she got dressed like a peasant woman. </sentence><sentence id="877">I smuggled her out of the, out of ghetto and put her on the streetcar and she -- I got word that she's there. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="878"> Q.
