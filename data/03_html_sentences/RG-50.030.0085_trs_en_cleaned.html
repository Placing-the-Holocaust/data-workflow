<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="121">A: A kid from the ghetto. </sentence><sentence id="122">A youngster who was turning thirteen and it it was just a delight because a Saturday morning what does he have to do for bar mitzvah - not the speech. </sentence><sentence id="123">He gives a portion of the Talmud - he gives a portion where he asks an impossible question, and I myself said to myself, what is the answer to that question. </sentence><sentence id="124">Then he answers it on the spot. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="125">And while he's answering, he's thinking. </sentence><sentence id="126">He's going na-na-na, and then he gets stuck because he's a little stuck in his own thought. </sentence><sentence id="127">As he gets stuck, the whole congregation sings ya-ba- bam, ya-ba-bam, ya-ba-bam. </sentence><sentence id="128">Then he raises his hand. </sentence><sentence id="129">He's got it. </sentence><sentence id="130">They stop on a dime. </sentence><sentence id="131">He continues na-da-da. </sentence><sentence id="132">Whenever he gets stuck they sing and then they, he carried through with this dissertation of one hour on an impossible subject with an impossible question at the age of thirteen. </sentence><sentence id="133">I was visibly impressed that this is the way they celebrate a Bar Mitzvah. </sentence><sentence id="134">And then I went to the schools the next day. </sentence><sentence id="135">They invited me to school. </sentence><sentence id="136">And I went to the juniors and seniors in high school because they already had learned English. </sentence><sentence id="137">They were studying English. </sentence><sentence id="138">And I decided to have them write a composition and the composition is "Home Is Where Your Heart Is.". </sentence><sentence id="139">I said where is your home?. </sentence><sentence id="140">Where is your heart now that you've come from all over the world?. </sentence><sentence id="141">And how thrilling it was to have youngsters who had never heard of Israel but now they say we don't want to go back any place, any place. </sentence><sentence id="142">We want to go place to a land that we can call our own and the only land in the world that we would trust today would be Israel. </sentence><sentence id="143">So the 90%, then 10% of course said they'd like to go to America, so they were there. </sentence><sentence id="144">But I have used some of their original, their letters to quote from them to show of this universal love that they had to go to a homeland, to Israel. </sentence><sentence id="145">Now here we are in China, and I don't know how - what you want to continue in here, but I have... </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="146">Q: Let let me let ask you if I could a couple of questions. </sentence><sentence id="147">Can you describe for me uh the Jewish ghetto in Shanghai as you found it?. </sentence><sentence id="148">You have given me two incidents but after the service and after the bar mitzvah, uh you learned about the Jewish community. </sentence><sentence id="149">Tell me what you learned?. </sentence><sentence id="150">What what how was it structured?. </sentence><sentence id="151">What had people done?. </sentence><sentence id="152">That sort of thing. </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="153">A: Well, the Jewish community of Shanghai which I came into and this was already uh this was right after the war, the Joint Distribution Committee and uh of of the Jewish people heard about their Shanghai ghetto...well first of all, how did we become a ghetto?. </sentence><sentence id="154">How did it become a ghetto?. </sentence><sentence id="155">The Japanese became very friendly with Nazis, and they didn't want to be outdone when they heard what Hitler was doing to the Jews. </sentence><sentence id="156">The Jews were living very peacefully in China and in Shanghai. </sentence><sentence id="157">But as they came and conquered Shanghai they decided that they must follow and imitate uh the Nazi empire. </sentence><sentence id="158">Otherwise they wouldn't be uh good allies, so they immediately started to introduce some of the customs that were prevalent in Nazi Germany. </sentence><sentence id="159">They immediately said, here, you Jews have to be within the scope of this.__...(PH) settlement so to speak. </sentence><sentence id="160">This is where you have to be. </sentence><sentence id="161">You have certain hours you can't go out. </sentence><sentence id="162">This is where you will be. </sentence><sentence id="163">Your schools will be here, and they made a complete and they actually had uh I I don't know, I remember some of the kids saying they had badges which after the war they ripped off, and had all kinds of symbols to remind them that they are Jews, that they are Jews. </sentence><sentence id="164">That they are different from all other people and this was the stigmata that that the Japanese carried over merely to ape uh Hitler's concept of what should be, this image of the Jew to the world. </sentence><sentence id="165">And this is what they tried to imitate in the ghetto. </sentence><sentence id="166">But the the Joint Distribution Committee came in immediately with food and with equipment and I was amongst the first that was standing there and I have a picture with me with little children where we're giving them food baskets and and trying to show them that there are other people out there who care for them, who want to help them. </sentence><sentence id="167">And this is where I met them. </sentence><sentence id="168">And then I have stories of their schooling, and ... </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="186">Q: Tell me some of those that as you know them, as your experiences were in the schools? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="188">A: Well, they had two types of schooling. </sentence><sentence id="189">There was a man there by the name of Saul Livery (ph). </sentence><sentence id="190">Does the name ring a bell?. </sentence><sentence id="191">Saul Livery was in the Shanghai ghetto. </sentence><sentence id="192">He was the spirit of Judaism in the Shanghai ghetto. </sentence><sentence id="193">He decided that even though we're in these dismal surroundings, there's one thing that we need to know. </sentence><sentence id="194">We have to know our heritage. </sentence><sentence id="195">We have to know our history. </sentence><sentence id="196">We have to know our literature. </sentence><sentence id="197">And so Saul Livery was the spirit that motivated and energized not just the Yeshiva learning, but that the Jews should know literature and history even on a Hebraic (ph) secular level. </sentence><sentence id="198">Hebrew literature, see. </sentence><sentence id="199">He wanted to teach them Hebrew so he formed a series of religious schooling which was the saving grace of these young people. </sentence><sentence id="200">Then they had to have their secular schooling so there were there were two great schools - one was the Kaduri (ph) School and the other was another high school which I, slips my mind but I have it in my notes, and in these schools the children went to high school to learn their secular subjects. </sentence><sentence id="201">When I came in to the little Jewish schools, I found out that they had nothing to write on. </sentence><sentence id="202">The kids would pick up a piece of paper from the trash and pick up a piece of paper from the trash and pick up a piece of  black slate that writes and these were their notebooks. </sentence><sentence id="203">And I saw that. </sentence><sentence id="204">I thought I must do something about it. </sentence><sentence id="205">So I sent back home and they sent me books and and paper and notebooks and pencils and so on - the greatest gift. </sentence><sentence id="206">Imagine children considering it the greatest gift I could give them. </sentence><sentence id="207">When I came one day to their to their little schools and I handed out notebooks with pencils, with pens, with books, with with all the equipment that they needed. </sentence><sentence id="208">They said I revolutionized the the school system in the ghetto because we gave them pens and pencils. </sentence><sentence id="209">When I think of what a gift means to somebody - they they they kissed my hands, the kids, for for the fact that I brought them this. </sentence><sentence id="210">The same as after that first service. </sentence><sentence id="211">At at the end of that first service I'm standing at the door trying to see who these people are as they leave to say goodbye, and they started kissing my chaplain's insignia which I have there. </sentence><sentence id="212">The Jewish, because I had a Jewish star on it - they say you brought freedom, freedom to us and these, the whole the whole ghetto felt that America saved them. </sentence><sentence id="213">That we brought freedom to the people from the Nazi empire. </sentence><sentence id="214">It was a very thrilling moment in in American history when we were considered the proponents of freedom. </sentence><sentence id="215">It's being recapitulated right now in every country of Eastern Europe that that that when you .. OK.Any other questions? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="245">Q: Yes. </sentence><sentence id="246">Tell me some more about other places in the vic...uh in the ghetto that you visited. </sentence><sentence id="247">Tell me about people's homes. </sentence><sentence id="248">What were they like? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="253">A: Well, the homes that I visited, and I'll give you an example of this bar mitzvah - I went into a little house. </sentence><sentence id="254">They must have had about five or six in one room. </sentence><sentence id="255">They they they went from hand to mouth as far as food is concerned. </sentence><sentence id="256">Uh some standing on food lines and some uh trying to eke out a living from each other, just like in in the ancient in the in the ghetto of of of former times, of of three, four hundred years ago. </sentence><sentence id="257">What I found most exciting was the fact that the the Judaism which to many of them had never meant anything, I found that the the Jews of the survivors went one way or another. </sentence><sentence id="258">I thought that most of them would turn against their faith and I thought that as I went in one home after another these were survivors and these were the children and these were children without any parents who they adopted as their own. </sentence><sentence id="259">As I went into these homes I felt why would they want to carry on this heritage where there they were told - by the way some of them are so assimilated, so far-removed from anything Jewish - they looked so German that they could be an example of blonde hair, blue eyes, clipped - an example of German aristocracy, and went into their pitiful homes and saw their lovely children, saw that these children weren't even their children. </sentence><sentence id="260">They were adopting orphans who - by the way that's quite a story that these orphans were brought half way around the world and I found out later, you remember there's a story about Hannah Szenes [NB: Sennesh] who who who said I'm a match that was not to be consumed, where she volunteered to help save - I found out that Haganah, that the Jewish underground, had formed a railway and taken youngsters and put them into Christian homes who put their lives on the stake to save Jewish kids where the kids would be hidden in these Christian homes by day, and in the evening, at sunset they would pick them up and ride them through the mountains and ride them to the next town where they had another Christian home. </sentence><sentence id="261">I didn't know that story. </sentence><sentence id="262">And here I find that these kids were telling about the Israelis who who from  from Haganah, went out there to save these kids. </sentence><sentence id="263">This was a chapter that that that really was hair-raising to me, to find these kids saved from in that kind of situation. </sentence><sentence id="264">As far as the - let me give you this bar mitzvah. </sentence><sentence id="265">Here's a lovely little kid, little boy who would have known nothing if it weren't for the fact that a fellow like Saul Livery so to it that there was Jewish education. </sentence><sentence id="266">And took the few that knew Jewish education and made schools around them. </sentence><sentence id="267">By the way, not only schools - they created a choir, a choir of forty voices that came and sang at my first service. </sentence><sentence id="268">They had uh men with such beautiful voices - they called them cantors. </sentence><sentence id="269">They had operatic voices. </sentence><sentence id="270">I had an operatic singer conducting my Friday night service. </sentence><sentence id="271">With such a voice I wish I had video and I wish I had sound recording to hear that voice. </sentence><sentence id="272">To me it was, an operatic tenor like like Jan Peerce or Richard Tucker the days of...so here was my service where these people walked in and and and they - forty voice choir. </sentence><sentence id="273">An operatic singer to help me conduct a service, so at the beginning it was very cold because they did their Germanic music and I didn't get in to it. </sentence><sentence id="274">It wasn't until they let me take over with an opening hymn "Shma Israel" that the whole group got together. </sentence><sentence id="275">That that's an aside. </sentence><sentence id="276">But the beauty of that experience is that I see this youngster who could easily - first of all, how he survived - he was an orphan - how he survived the Nazi massacre and ended up in Shanghai in itself is is beyond understanding. </sentence><sentence id="277">Since he was only thirteen he wasn't one of those that wrote my compositions, so I started to talk with him and its another one of those stories. </sentence><sentence id="278">He he saw his - the knock on the door - he he saw them take his father and his mother and his sister and he were left and then and then two days later his sister was taken because she was a beautiful girl, and this kid saw it at four, five, six years old and he's telling this story and now he's going to be bar mitzvahed in Shanghai, all alone. </sentence><sentence id="279">His mother disappeared. </sentence><sentence id="280">So this is the kind of story that I got in in in the ghetto and and when you get it directly, when you hear it from a kid's lips, it's different than than the whole six million story again and again. </sentence><sentence id="281">It's just different. </sentence><sentence id="282">A bar mitzvah. </sentence><sentence id="283">This kid to have such a Jewish bar mitzvah. </sentence><sentence id="284">When they had to celebrate after the service, I, they said come and join us in a drink. </sentence><sentence id="285">They had one bottle of schnapps, of liquor, which they had kept for the whole year and every time they take a few they fill it with water. </sentence><sentence id="286">They filled the bottle with water so it says liquor. </sentence><sentence id="287">I said I don't drink. </sentence><sentence id="288">They says this you can drink. </sentence><sentence id="289">I said I don't drink. </sentence><sentence id="290">They said this you can drink. </sentence><sentence id="291">Take a look. </sentence><sentence id="292">I'm drinking water. </sentence><sentence id="293">But they have a big bottle of Jewish liquor, uh liquor, and they, everybody drinks it as if LALHAIM (ph) and they make believe they're they're getting drunk on it. </sentence><sentence id="294">It's the same. </sentence><sentence id="295">They have five bottles like that, practically all water, but this was their their schnapps. </sentence><sentence id="296">This was their SABBATH THING and a little old piece of herring which was this big - I didn't want to take anything because here I come from where we have everything in the service. </sentence><sentence id="297">They insisted. </sentence><sentence id="298">From their nothingness they insisted that I have something. </sentence><sentence id="299">So I have a picture of one of these bigger homes, a big basement where we were meeting sabbath morning, after the service. </sentence><sentence id="300">So there's a a little bit of the flavor of what I'm talking about in in in in Shanghai. </sentence><sentence id="301">Now I can, I don't know - based on your timing experience I would uh I could uh I could tell you the end of that story. </sentence><sentence id="302">Alright. </sentence><sentence id="303">The end of the story is that I started badgering the Pentagon that I want these kids out. </sentence><sentence id="304">I want a ship. </sentence><sentence id="305">I want somebody to come. </sentence><sentence id="306">It's after the war now. </sentence><sentence id="307">By the way, we couldn't get out after the war because there were no, there was no transportation. </sentence><sentence id="308">They felt that the, that the people from Europe were more entitled to get back than we who came in a little later. </sentence><sentence id="309">So all the boats and all means of  transportation, they gave us no idea of when we would get out of of Shanghai. </sentence><sentence id="310">Uh my luck was that my wife was pregnant with a child, and at the end of that period uh the doctor said look, something has gone wrong, and it's only because of her uncertainty of where you are - it's getting worse. </sentence><sentence id="311">She can't conceive of having the child without your presence. </sentence><sentence id="312">Since the war is over, he wrote to my colonel - so the colonel saw to it that I was able. </sentence><sentence id="313">I took a plane that goes around the world every week - we called it the Marco Polo flight - every week it takes mail from all the Army bases - I got on the mail plane with all the Army - and I got a lift to Chicago where my wife was. </sentence><sentence id="314">And and I traveled day and night and came just a few days before the child came to be. </sentence><sentence id="315">It was a very exciting experience. </sentence><sentence id="316">I didn't tell them I was coming because I didn't know I'd get there, so it's a wonder she didn't have the child when I walked in. </sentence><sentence id="317">But that's that's a story in itself. </sentence><sentence id="318">I did come home in time for my...but that meant that I would not be there to fulfill my mission which was to get these people out, to get these kids out. </sentence><sentence id="319">And I badgered them and badgered them and finally I learned that they finally sent a ship and the ship took a thousand of them out of Shanghai and that picture of the thousand of them out of Shanghai was shown last summer at the B'nai B'rith Museum, at the Klutznick Museum. </sentence><sentence id="320">They had a whole section on Shanghai, and in the section on Shanghai, over my torah, they had a picture of all these young people or whatever ages they were, who who finally got out, and I never let up until they one day they said yes, we will get you a ship. </sentence><sentence id="321">Enough telegrams, enough. </sentence><sentence id="322">And that's how I knew that my hope for mission. </sentence><sentence id="323">And the end of that story is even more exciting. </sentence><sentence id="324">Uh well, first of all, 1 was given a dinner here by the Jewish War Veterans for all the service uh found out that I had more medals than most chaplains who served in the service. </sentence><sentence id="325">Uh I didn't know that at that time, but they had all my medals and clusters and all that, and then the fellow who ran it was a fellow by the name of Kiwi (ph) - I had never heard his name. </sentence><sentence id="326">I said what makes you so excited about this dinner, and you've given your life to it. </sentence><sentence id="327">Why?. </sentence><sentence id="328">He says because when you come and take a look at this picture, you'll see that I'm on it. </sentence><sentence id="329">I was one of those that you saved from Shanghai. </sentence><sentence id="330">And so the man who ran the dinner here at the Hilton, Jewish War Veterans and and let's see, who who was with me. </sentence><sentence id="331">We honored I think the Ambassador of Israel and myself, but the man worked on it so hard because he was on that picture. </sentence><sentence id="332">That picture by the way at this point is in limbo. </sentence><sentence id="333">It went from the B'nai B'rith Museum to whatever museum supplied it or whatever individual supplied it. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="417">A: We'll discuss that later, because I'd like you to find it. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="419">Q: OK. </sentence><sentence id="420">We move on. </sentence><sentence id="421">Let's go back to Shanghai. ( </sentence><sentence id="422">Alright -just a word, another word about Shanghai...). </sentence><sentence id="423">We have time. </sentence><sentence id="424">We have time. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="431">A: We have time. </sentence><sentence id="432">As far as I'm concerned I'm coming to the end of my story unless we want to give more of the other parts, but what happened to the end of the Shanghai story?. </sentence><sentence id="433">After I left, I just wan to tell you after I left, a few years ago I took a number of doctors - for some reason or another a lot of them were gastrologists - why I got into that I don't know - but they  had sons who wanted to be bar mitzvahed. </sentence><sentence id="434">And they were members of my congregation in uh HAR (ph) Shalom. </sentence><sentence id="435">As you know I uh I am very privileged that of the eight synagogues that I was, that God has enabled me to found on the outskirts of Washington, one of them went out of its way to name the sanctuary for me, so in the Rabbi Morris Gordon sanctuary, they were members, and they went with me to to Israel to have their sons bar mitzvahed on Masada, who we had forty, with their families, all of us on Masada celebrating a double bar mitzvah and then we decided to go to Elat, so our buses, our filled bus, we're traveling to Elat and we suddenly come to a little cross-road. </sentence><sentence id="436">It looked like this one was a newer road. </sentence><sentence id="437">We didn't know exactly - there were men standing with drills making the rocks of of drill...of cracking the rocks of which to make the road to the south. </sentence><sentence id="438">So I got off the bus since this is my people and I was the tour leader, and I said uh.___..
