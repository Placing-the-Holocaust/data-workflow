<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3">Q: This is a United States Holocaust Memorial Museum interview with John Meyerstein. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="5">A: Stein. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="7">Q: John Meyerstein, conducted by Nina Ellis on July first, 2004, in Washington, D.C. This is tape number one, side A. Just for the record, would you tell me your name, where you live now, and when and where you were born. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="9">A: Okay. </sentence><sentence id="10">My name is John Meyerstein. </sentence><sentence id="11">I was originally called Hans Meyerstein, but when we arrived in England after the St. Louis voyage, it was suggested to my parents that -- that they give me an English first name, and the name John was chosen, I'm not sure how, and it's -- from that moment onwards it became that, and my parents never used any other name but that, at the time. </sentence><sentence id="12">I currently live in Oakville, Ontario, which is about 20 miles west of Toronto. </sentence><sentence id="13">I was born in Halle, Germany, on the 21" of March, 1935. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="19">Q: Mm-hm. </sentence><sentence id="20">Tell me, do you have many memories of those first years in Germany? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="23">A: Truthfully I have to say no. </sentence><sentence id="24">I know that some people say that they can remember everything when they were in a pram, or a cradle. </sentence><sentence id="25">I have to be truthful and say I do not recall those sort of things. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="29">Q: Okay. </sentence><sentence id="30">Tell me about your parents, their names, and where they were from. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="33">A: My father was Ludwig Meyerstein. </sentence><sentence id="34">He was born in Rosslau, Germany in -- on March the 10", 1893. </sentence><sentence id="35">My mother was Alice Meyerstein, born Alice Eisner, and she was born in a -- a place called Gutentag, in Upper Silesia, Germany, on the 29" of June, 1910. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="39">Q: And do you know wh-where they met, and how -- how they came to be married? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="41">A: How they met I don't know, I rather suspect it was one of these arranged marriages. </sentence><sentence id="42">Both my families -- both my parent's families were financially very well off, and I can only conclude that it was assumed that this would be a good way of having a marriage. </sentence><sentence id="43">My mother never discussed it, in fact she probably talked to my wife years later on things which she didn't discuss with me. </sentence><sentence id="44">But how they actually met, and -- I don't know, I rather think it was a -- an arranged marriage, but how that was done, if -- if my assessment is correct, I have no idea. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="49">Q: And your father served in World War I, I understand. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="51">A: Yes, he was -- he served in -- four years in -- in World War I, together with an older brother, who also served fo -- four years, and a younger brother, who was also in -- in World War I, but who did not come back, he was killed in -- in 1918, I think, a week or two before Armistice Day, and was listed as missing in action, and never -- never found again, actually. </sentence><sentence id="52">So there were three brothers, of which my father was one, went to the wars, in 1914 - "18, and only two came back. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="55">Q: You know what -- what kind of service your father performed, or where he was -- </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="56">A: My -- I-- I -- I think my father's younger brother was in an infantry regiment. </sentence><sentence id="57">My father and his elder brother, Hugo -- and I should say that my father's younger brother, the one who was killed in 1914 - "18, was called Hans, and that was why I was originally called Hans, because my grandmother wanted to have a -- a grandson following that name. </sentence><sentence id="58">My father and his elder brother Hugo both served in cal -- cavalry regiments to begin with, and I s -- I don't know how far the cavalry went, because as you know, things changed, and cavalry re -- regiments then became extinct almost, and presumably went into infantry regiments. </sentence><sentence id="59">My father's elder brother Hugo came out at the end of the war as a captain, and my father ended the war, I think, as a second leftenant. </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="60">Q: Do you know where he served, and -- </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="62">A: No. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="64">Q: -- did he see combat? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="66">A: | -- I -- I think they both did, I do not know where they served. </sentence><sentence id="67">I believe it was always on the western front, because I think that my father would have mentioned something if -- if -- if it had been elsewhere on the eastern front at that time. </sentence><sentence id="68">I have my father's military b-book, you know, of the class of -- of 19 f -- I can't think what they call it now, class of 1914, or -- or something like that. </sentence><sentence id="69">But it doesn't show exactly where all these things were, it wa -- just like a military record book, which I had years later in the British army, when I was drafted. </sentence><sentence id="70">But I've also since, in the last -- since my father's death, found my grandfather's military book, and he was in the class of 1879, in the militia, in an artillery regiment. </sentence><sentence id="71">So, on my father's side of the family, military activity was not a -- an unusual activity, despite what the -- the Germans said, that there were that few -- not that many Jews volunteered or fought, that was totally incorrect. </sentence><sentence id="72">I do recall that my father mentioned to me that he provi -- that his father, my grandfather, provided the horses, and gave them money and so forth, because in the units which they had to serve, particularly since they ultimately ended up in -- with -- in the commission rank, that required more funding, and my parents were obviously in -- in a position to -- to -- to -- to -- to -- to provide that. </sentence><sentence id="73">The other thing which I found rather interesting, contrary to what I sometimes read, is that my father, on one or two occasions, and these were things which we could always discuss, said to me that when he entered the -- the cavalry regiment, or was in -- was -- w-was organized to go to this unit, that the -- the colonel of the regiment said to him, "Well, Meyerstein, you can't say that there are any anti -- anti-Jews here, otherwise you wouldn't be here." </sentence><sentence id="74">So again, I find it sometimes a bit awkwa -- difficult to understand when I read various documents, as to what took -- actually took place. </sentence><sentence id="75">Obviously there were anti-Jewish Germans, and there were Germans who didn't view this in any shape or form. </sentence><sentence id="76">Whether that's normal, I can't say actually, you know. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="89">Q: Right, right. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="91">A: And they -- and my brother -- and one other thing which I think you might find interesting -- and this was apparently -- this wa -- given to me by my mother, who had a very good relationship in terms of -- of f-friendship with my father's brother, is after World War I, when the German army was reorganized -- this was told by my Uncle Hugo to my mother, they got in touch with my Uncle Hugo, who obviously had a very good military record, and said, "Why don't you come back into the German army?" </sentence><sentence id="92">And he said, "Well, you know, I'm Jewish." </sentence><sentence id="93">And - - and apparently they said to him, "Well, why don't you just say you're Christian, it won't any difference," and -- and left it. </sentence><sentence id="94">He didn't, of course, do that. </sentence><sentence id="95">What I'm getting at it's so peculiar and so strange in what subsequently took place. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="101">Q: What business was your father's family in? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="103">A: My father's family had a -- what you would call a small department store in Rosslau. </sentence><sentence id="104">They were the only Jewish family in this entire community. </sentence><sentence id="105">In fact my grandmother, my f-father's mother, was also born in this -- in Rosslau, and I have the documents, the birth certificate, and the marriage certificate to my grandfather, also i-in -- in my files. </sentence><sentence id="106">And apparently he was quite successful in that respect, and -- and was continued, I think, until the German -- until the Nazis came to power, and of course ultimately that was all taken away from them. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="111">Q: They were the only Jews in that town? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="113">A: Yes. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="115">Q: Huh. </sentence><sentence id="116">So there was no synagogue or community there that -- </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="117">A: No. </sentence><sentence id="118">No -- not at all. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="121">Q: Were they just full assimilated [indecipherable] </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="122">A: Absolute -- I -- I -- I would have to say yes, because I have -- if you look at the birth certificates, and the marriage certificates of both sides of my grandparents, you will find that the names are all traditional German names. </sentence><sentence id="123">M-My father is Ludwig. </sentence><sentence id="124">My elder -- his elder brother Hugo, my -- hi-his younger brother Hans, the one who was killed, and who I was named af -- Hans. </sentence><sentence id="125">My grandmother was named Rosian, which literally trans -- mean little rose. </sentence><sentence id="126">My -- my grandfather was Max. </sentence><sentence id="127">If you look at his parent's birth certificates, it's Magnus, which is really like a Latin name, and the grandmother, I think was -- great-grand -- was Regina. </sentence><sentence id="128">But this also applies to my father's -- grandmother -- my mother's grandparents in like manner. </sentence><sentence id="129">So when people say to me, well what Jewish names did they have, I have to be honest and say I don't honestly know. </sentence><sentence id="130">My mother, for example is Alice, spelled the same way in English as it is in -- in -- in German, except in German it's a different pronunciation. </sentence><sentence id="131">So the documents which I have finally found among my father's papers, after a long time, so far I've -- I've sor -- deciphered that they've gone back to about 1822, and they're all -- the Christian names, the first names, were all literally almost -- you could say either they were English or they were German, but totally integrated. </sentence><sentence id="132">And I suspect that that -- the shock of what subsequent happened, they probably couldn't believe what was taking place. </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="133">Q: Yeah, yeah. </sentence><sentence id="134">Your father's family, you said, had a department store in that time -- </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="135">A: Well, I would call it a department store in the like manner, and I have seen pictures of it a little bit. </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="136">Q: And your father worked there? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="138">A: No, my father -- my father became a barrister and a judge, moved to Halle, where I was ultimately born, practiced criminal law. </sentence><sentence id="139">And ironically -- Halle is a very big chemical loca -- area, even I think to this day. </sentence><sentence id="140">And i-ironically, which I didn't realize, he never discussed it, but my mother mentioned it to me, and also my cousin who lives in Australia, whose mother is my father's -- was my father's sister, told me that he was also the outside counsel for I.G. Farben, the big German chemical company, which ultimately made the -- the material which was doing the gas chambers. </sentence><sentence id="141">Course, this all -- we're not talking about that particular period, we're talking in the -- in the 30's and so forth. </sentence><sentence id="142">So my father had a very successful, an-and according to my mother was a very well known criminal barrister i-in Halle. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="149">Q: And he would have been there through the 20's? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="151">A: Ah, yes. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="153">Q: An-And then you were born there in 1934? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="155">A: 735. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="157">Q: deg35 - deg35. </sentence><sentence id="158">And what about your mother's family, what business were they in? </sentence><sentence id="159">You said that they were also -- </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="160">A: My -- my mother's parents lived, as I mentioned, in -- in Gutentag, which is an interesting name because it means good day, or good morning -- in Upper Silesia, almost on the -- on the Polish border. </sentence><sentence id="161">My -- she had one brother called Lota, and her father was Ludwig Eisner, and my grandmother, my mother's mother, was Rosa Eisner. </sentence><sentence id="162">They owned what you would call a farm equipment wholesale business. </sentence><sentence id="163">And I have pictures, I found pictures. </sentence><sentence id="164">I have no idea how they managed to keep these particular pictures, or bring them with them considering all the other problems which they were experiencing. </sentence><sentence id="165">Where my grandfather had -- you could see the trucks outside his -- th-the fi -- th-the family business and home, with the telephone number, and on the truck, branded names of things like percil and so forth, even American products. </sentence><sentence id="166">They did farm equipment, I would sort of say, you know, which supplied the farming community, which was </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="174"> predominantly Polish speaking, although this Upper S-Silesia was of course Germany, and had been for 150 years or so. </sentence><sentence id="175">And very successful as well. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="178">Q: So let's start now with -- with -- your father was arrested, I understand, in -- in 1938? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="180">A: Well, actually, he was initial -- he was arrested twice. </sentence><sentence id="181">The first ti -- my fa -- my father's sister emigrated with her husband to Australia as a result of friends which they had who -- who helped them there. </sentence><sentence id="182">And one of the -- also from Germany, also German Jews. </sentence><sentence id="183">And one of the German Jews had some business things which were required to -- to be handled, and I believe, and this is only -- I'm only surmising this, cause we never di -- I only heard this from my mother, my father took over some activities. </sentence><sentence id="184">This was, or been public perhaps early "38 or so. </sentence><sentence id="185">And for some reason or another, you know, at that time, the -- the German government was already starting to try and take money, or -- and various other things from -- from German -- from German Jews, and their businesses. </sentence><sentence id="186">And he was arrested and held for six weeks in Halle -- but it was obviously nowhere near anything which subsequently took place -- and was released. </sentence><sentence id="187">And then, I think after Kristall night, which was in the latter part of 1938, my father was arrested and taken to Buchenwald. </sentence><sentence id="188">My mother's father was also arrested and taken to Buchenwald. </sentence><sentence id="189">My father's -- my mother's brother, Lota, was also arrested and taken to Buchenwald. </sentence><sentence id="190">And they found each other there, of all -- I mean, most incredible, found each other. </sentence><sentence id="191">All three got out. </sentence><sentence id="192">Now, you have to remember, my father was a first World War veteran, my grandfather, my mother's mother -- father was also a veteran. </sentence><sentence id="193">And I have subsequently read books and documents which indicate that the Germans basically said to some of these people, "Because of your activities as, you know, in World War I, we're going to let you go. </sentence><sentence id="194">But you have so many days or weeks, and if you are still here in Germany, then we -- if when we re-arrest you again, we"|l never -- you" ll never get out." </sentence><sentence id="195">So I believe my father must have got out, probably in early 1939. </sentence><sentence id="196">I don't know which day, and my grandfather. </sentence><sentence id="197">My Uncle Lota also got out, but I don't know exactly when, and under what conditions, but they did, and I have proof of the fact, perma -- documentation that my father then applied for visa to the United States in, I think, February of 1939. </sentence><sentence id="198">So between Kristallnacht and entry into Buchenwald, and now it must have been somewhere between that time, and shall we say the end of January, or -- so he was rather lucky to get out at that time. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="219">Q: Let me go back and ask you when your -- your father's sister left Germany to go to Australia. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="221">A: That would have been somewhere in 1938, I go -- I believe. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="223">Q: [indecipherable] in the same year, then. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="225">A: But before Kristallnacht. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="227">Q: Before? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="229">A: Yeah. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="231">Q: And it was an escape in a sense, a sense of -- of being unsafe for Jews and the decision to leave [indecipherable] </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="232">A: Well, I -- yes, I -- I think you're right, but I think the motivating factor might have come more from my aunt's husband, as distinct from other things. </sentence><sentence id="233">My mother has mention -- mentioned to me on several occasions as a boy when I asked questions, that I think sometime in "38 -- when, I don't know, I think before Kristallnacht, okay, that the families got together. </sentence><sentence id="234">My father's family, of which really, was really in my grandmother, because my -- my grandfather on my father's side, died in 1929, so th -- you know, none of this would have applied, got together, and sort of said what we could -- what -- what should we do, because at that time you still, from what I've been given to understand from my mother, you could still take out all your money and belongings without any problems. </sentence><sentence id="235">But they couldn't come to any conclusion. </sentence><sentence id="236">And you have to remember, from my father's side of the family, it was -- I have the documents to the early 1800's </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="242"> and my father always used to say to me it was even before, you know whe -- they were more German than the Germans. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="244">Q: Yeah. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="246">A: Okay, if you want to put it this way. </sentence><sentence id="247">Now, I don't th -- I don't think that that was quite as di -- as long on my mother's side of the family, because I understand that from their aspects, my mother's grandfather, m-my gra -- my great-grandfather came from Poland in the days when Poland was under Russian law, and rode across the border into Germany, into -- into Silesia. </sentence><sentence id="248">Because in those days the Russians used to call people up for military service, and it wasn't just a two year stint, it was 20 years before they were released. </sentence><sentence id="249">So I suspect that they -- his parents, great-great-grandparents, sort of said you'd better get out and -- and -- and go somewhere else. </sentence><sentence id="250">But, if you follow what I'm getting at, it's that depth of -- of period. </sentence><sentence id="251">But my parent, when they had the meeting with -- with the two families, obviously couldn't come to lo -- to a conclusion. </sentence><sentence id="252">We're sitting here today saying why not? </sentence><sentence id="253">I can't answer that question. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="262">Q: Yeah, yeah. [ </sentence><sentence id="263">indecipherable] interesting to know what that conversation was like, what the arguments were [indecipherable] </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="264">A: | -- I get the impression from her mother that -- th-the -- the women on the one hand wanted to go, and the men -- you have to remember that my father was a very successful barrister, even though things had already declined, I don't know to what degree how far. </sentence><sentence id="265">Everything which I read, where everything is stated, regulations do this, yes it's true, but things still somehow, how did they manage to survive and live with no income coming in? </sentence><sentence id="266">Because although things were tightening, you could still spend money, if you had it. </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="267">Q: Yeah, right. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="269">A: And, you know, perhaps they just thought that this was just an aberration. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="271">Q: Yeah. </sentence><sentence id="272">And the women wanted to go, the women were clearer -- </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="273">A: Well, I understand on my mother's side, her mother, and my mother wanted to go. </sentence><sentence id="274">My father's mother was not enthusiastic, but I don't know that, I'm just giving you comments which my mother said to me. </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="275">Q: Right, right. </sentence><sentence id="276">So your father comes home from Buchenwald, do you have any memory of that? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="279">A: No. </sentence><sentence id="280">I can only tell you that my mother went to pick him up, so she must have been notified. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="281">And she had to go by train because Halle to Buchenwald is not, you know, a -- a bus ride. </sentence><sentence id="282">And my mother said that nothing happened to her physically, they were just, you know, they just told to go sit in a corner in the -- of the waiting room, or wherever. </sentence><sentence id="283">Of the entrance or whatever it was. </sentence><sentence id="284">Nobody bothered her, but nobody was very -- nobody was terribly polite, but nobody was terribly rude, they just said go sit over there, and -- and -- and that was it. </sentence><sentence id="285">And I have to assume that it was done by train. </sentence><sentence id="286">My mother said that, you know, from that day onwards, my father -- there were no -- no more argument about leaving. </sentence><sentence id="287">And I have to conclude that -- that my father was too stunned and shattered at what had happened. </sentence><sentence id="288">And even though he'd been four years in the first World War, I have to conclude that there was -- the -- what -- what he saw and experienced in Buchenwald had no comparison to what we read about, what took place in World War I, where it was strictly military and -- and not the other scenarios, but he was on th -- we never discussed that, he -- he -- he could not -- he could not -- </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="289">Q: Talk about it. </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="290">A: No, or he wouldn't talk about it, let's put it that way. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="292">Q: Well then, we're coming close to the time when you -- you and your mother and father, and your grandfather, you mother's father, left together to go on the [indecipherable] </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="294">A: Well, that's an interesting aspect, yes. </sentence><sentence id="295">My grandfather, on my -- ma -- my mother's father, had some relatives who had emigrated to the United States. </sentence><sentence id="296">I think it would have had to be in the very late 18 -- the latter part of the 1800's. </sentence><sentence id="297">How they got in touch with these relatives, I really don't know, but they did. </sentence><sentence id="298">And where the exact relationship was I don't know, because I ultimately met these people in the United States, and they were the ones who provided the sponsorship bond documents. </sentence><sentence id="299">And they couldn't really explain the exact relationship as to how -- whether it was their mother, mother's mother or so. </sentence><sentence id="300">And as you know, when people went through Ellis Island, names got changed, or people married each other on the boat, I -- I really can't te -- I'm sorry, I really can't tell you how that happened, other than that two of the relatives -- and I have [indecipherable] gave me some of the documents, which I didn't know </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="301">Q: [indecipherable] </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="302">A: Yeah. </sentence><sentence id="303">I don't -- "ve met them. </sentence><sentence id="304">Years later I met them, and they viewed me as very distant, we viewed each other as very distant cousins, but none of us could exactly explain where the connection -- the third person shown on those documents, I have no idea, other than it was obviously a very generous individual. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="308">Q: Let's look at that, as long as we're talking about it, because we can mention the names on tape, because I have those document here as well. </sentence><sentence id="309">This is the one you're talking about. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="312">A: Yes. </sentence><sentence id="313">Edna Cohn, when I met her was already in her -- I -- either late 60's or early 70's and we're now talking over 30 - 40 years ago, almost -- or -- or longer. </sentence><sentence id="314">Edna was not married, and apparently she spent her life in -- in a stockbroking -- most of her career in a stockbroking office. </sentence><sentence id="315">When we met it was in California, not in Chicago, they'd retired for health or weather reasons. </sentence><sentence id="316">Samuel Fox was married to Edna Cohn's sister, Miriam. </sentence><sentence id="317">Samuel Fox was not a relative, or any connection, but he was married to Miriam, and had been a pharmacist in [indecipherable] and -- and had his own business in Chicago. </sentence><sentence id="318">Aaron Stein, also from Chicago, who is the third affiant here shown in the documents, I don't know who that is, other than obviously a very generous person. </sentence><sentence id="319">They put up the money for the bonds, which enabled my parents and my grandfather, where the connection was, Ludwig Eisner to -- to put applications in, and I believe the -- the sort of certificates, the -- what do they call them, visa application numbers are the ones shown here as well, for the three of us. </sentence><sentence id="320">This document also shows Ludwig Eisner, which the museum here didn't know who it was, although it was -- he was listed in all the -- the museum documents. </sentence><sentence id="321">But he happened to be my grandfather, and he's shown here actually. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="359">A: And they didn't know themselves, when I met them years later. </sentence><sentence id="360">And -- and the re -- the relationship was -- was tremendous. </sentence><sentence id="361">And years later Edna Cohn and her sister Miriam Fox, visited England, and at that time -- to see my parents, and at that time my parents financially were in a position to repay -- </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="362">Q: The bond. </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="363">A: -- the bond. </sentence><sentence id="364">And I have comments -- I have letters in my -- in my father's papers, which I found in -- in -- really in the last year or so, because where my parents -- my father died six weeks short of 93, and my mother subsequently, almost 20 years younger, died two ye -- in 2001, at 91 and a half. </sentence><sentence id="365">So you imagine, I had almost a hundred years worth of com -- amalgamated documents to look through, that which had survived, and so forth. </sentence><sentence id="366">And I found letters which Edna Cohn [indecipherable] written to my father in England, to sort of say -- they were still sending them some money, not to worry about that, so I imagine that must have depressed my father considerably. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="371">Q: Yeah, yeah. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="373">A: But they were able to repay that. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="401">A: Okay. </sentence><sentence id="402">I don't know a great deal of how it was done. </sentence><sentence id="403">I can only conclude from my mother's comments, that the moment my father was released from Buchenwald, and them -- and i-in -- in similar manner, I suspect, although probably not on the same day, my grandm -- my mother's fath -- my grandfather on my mother's side. </sentence><sentence id="404">They didn't really have much choice about leaving, because that which I've read in more recent times would indicate that they were probably told you have a minimum period of time, and if we find you again, you have to go. </sentence><sentence id="405">We're -- we're -- we'll arrest you and -- and you" ll never be let out again. </sentence><sentence id="406">How they got tickets on the St. Louis, who organized that, and in what manner, I don't know. </sentence><sentence id="407">I do know that my parents -- and this is only what my mother told me, that they already knew that they would have to leave, even though my father and my grandfather were in Buchenwald, something would have to be done, or immediately after Buchenwald. </sentence><sentence id="408">And my grandmother -- my -- on my mother's side, came down from Gutentag, presumably to Halle, and they went -- they bought things, including jewelry, which they sewed -- from what I'm told, stitched into furnitu -- into the furniture, cause in those days, and this is where the anomaly is so incredible is, you could take everything that you had, or you could buy it. </sentence><sentence id="409">So they took two complete containers, which I would be -- the equivalent of say -- I don't know what a container in those days would be viewed. </sentence><sentence id="410">Today, two con -- small containers would be 20 foot containers, which I gather was furniture, stove, fridge, whatever. </sentence><sentence id="411">In fact, I've often wondered about it, and said to my mother, why on earth would you take electrical appliances, that don't apply when we ended up in -- in -- in England, and -- and so forth. </sentence><sentence id="412">Clo -- everything which they had. </sentence><sentence id="413">And these all came on board the -- the St. Louis with us. </sentence><sentence id="414">We never got them at the end, but I mean, that -- that's a different story, and we can get to that in due course. </sentence><sentence id="415">How they did that, I don't know. </sentence><sentence id="416">I think the jewelry, and it was viewed as being a dangerous thing, but they didn't think that people would -- the -- the Germans would be tearing open the -- the -- the -- the furniture and so forth. </sentence><sentence id="417">They might check your clothing, but they wouldn't do anything else. </sentence><sentence id="418">And that was -- they hope would, if they got to wherever they were going, they could then sell those things and which -- provide some money. </sentence><sentence id="419">Because as you know, when we left on the St. Louis, I think -- I don't know what the amount was, probably, you know, five or six U.S. dollars at that time -- or I don't know, not much more. </sentence><sentence id="420">So in other words, you had money when you -- before you left the ga -- the dockside, you climbed on the St. Louis, and you had nothing left at the time, so we -- we had no money on -- on that. </sentence><sentence id="421">Everything had already been paid for on the St. Louis. </sentence><sentence id="422">But how that actually happened, I really don't know. </sentence><sentence id="423">At th -- it was never explained to me, and I -- I've asked my -- I have some cousins in Australia from my mother's side, and they don't know. </sentence><sentence id="424">They know even less than I do. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="450">Q: Mm-hm, mm-hm. </sentence><sentence id="451">Do you have any memory of the ship? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="454">A: Not a great deal. </sentence><sentence id="455">I -- I gather that I was apparently -- I got lost on -- it was -- it was like a luxury liner. </sentence><sentence id="456">Perhaps the word luxury's a bit too strong, but it was -- it was a very pleasant cruise ship. </sentence><sentence id="457">It was like -- for b -- I -- a-again, and it's not something that my parents discussed with me, but what I've subly read is, you know, it was used for -- people would, in better times, go on holiday. </sentence><sentence id="458">And apparently I -- I got lost somewhere, and that caused a great panic for my mother, and then they found me, or my grandfather found me, and with no problem. </sentence><sentence id="459">But that's about the only thing I can remember. </sentence><sentence id="460">I've got one or two pictures, but they really aren't -- three or four, that you wouldn't know it's the St. Louis, it -- a-and they're not in groups of people, and quite frankly, I don't -- I don't have a big recollection on that. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="469">Q: Did your parents take those photographs? </sentence><sentence id="470">Do you know? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="473">A: I don't know. </sentence><sentence id="474">I'm not convinced that they did. </sentence><sentence id="475">I think my father -- I think my father was too stunned. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="479">Q: Stunned, yeah. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="481">A: I ga -- the pictures which I have, and there are only about two or three, I can see a cor -- wh- whe -- when -- when people were taken to Buchenwald, s -- as I understand it, you know, it was like a -- you know, it was already -- it wasn't a death camp as they subsequent became, but it was already a death camp, so everybody got shaved. </sentence><sentence id="482">And I -- and when we -- the pictures on the St.Louis with my father, you can see his hair growing back again, but he looked still, quite gaunt. </sentence><sentence id="483">My grandfather was always bald, and so you can't tell from those pictures. </sentence><sentence id="484">And of course, they're all dressed again in -- in clothes and suits and ties and so forth. </sentence><sentence id="485">But you can see in my father's picture, at least I can, perhaps to me, th-the trauma of what had happened, and I'm not so sure that he took them. </sentence><sentence id="486">He -- he -- for years he didn't want to be photographed, and whether that was a reminder of the way these things happen, I don't know. </sentence><sentence id="487">Even in better times, you know. </sentence><sentence id="488">But I'm not sure. </sentence><sentence id="489">I don't think so. </sentence><sentence id="490">He wouldn't be standing around. </sentence><sentence id="491">He -- he was not the -- he was not an outward going person. </sentence><sentence id="492">My mother was, he was more reserved. </sentence><sentence id="493">Perhaps it related to his profession, perhaps it related to his -- he was a 19" century person, having been born before the turn of the century. </sentence><sentence id="494">And I -- I -- he once said to me that, you know, he -- he didn't like the 20" century at all, which of course is understandable. </sentence><sentence id="495">He was much more comfortable in -- in that era. </sentence><sentence id="496">And wit -- wi -- reflects itself in the -- the relationship which we had together. </sentence><sentence id="497">It actually changed a little bit when we had grandchildren -- when I had grandchildren, which of course he always used to say to me he never thought he would have because he was so much older in that respect. </sentence><sentence id="498">And he lived long enough to s -- to see my eldest daughter go to university, which of course was a great thing for him. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="519">Q: Mm-hm. </sentence><sentence id="520">So the -- the stories that you may have from the voyage, are all things that your mother -- </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="521">A: Correct. </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="522">Q: -- and par -- and father -- </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="523">A: No, my father discus -- </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="524">Q: No -- not your father. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="526">A: -- scussed not a single thing. </sentence><sentence id="527">No, we could never talk on those matters, and my mother asked me not to. </sentence><sentence id="528">I tried once as a -- as a mid-teenager, and my father started to get emotionally very upset. </sentence><sentence id="529">And my mother came in the room, and -- and saw what was happening, gathered what was happening, and just pulled me to one side and said, don't ask, and stop it, and I said I'm sorry, and he calmed down and that was the end. </sentence><sentence id="530">We could talk on other matters, prior to 1933. </sentence><sentence id="531">Now, the -- the horrendous things didn't really affect -- didn't happen till somewhat later, but in looking back it's that period which he -- obviously he could not look. </sentence><sentence id="532">But he ca -- but as time -- as the years went by, he mellowed -- not that we could talk about these things, whereas my mother still retained the emotional problems which I suspect she experienced having to wi -- watch this in a more active role than I did, as a small boy. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="540">Q: Mm-hm, mm-hm. </sentence><sentence id="541">So the -- whatever stories then are from your mother, from the [indecipherable]    </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="544">A: Entirely from -- entirely answers to questions which I posed over a few -- period of few -- of a few years. </sentence><sentence id="545">Now, in England, when we had -- and we can come to that later, but in England, where we ultimately ended up at, there again was not a Jewish community per se, and there were also a few other German refugees. </sentence><sentence id="546">Mostly women whose husbands had -- had -- had been left behind, or couldn't get out, and they got together -- and because my mother was -- I was a small boy, and you -- you know, the days of leaving with babysitters was unheard of, so I was always carted around, and then put in a corner and given a book to read. </sentence><sentence id="547">So I would sometimes hear some of these things which they would talk about. </sentence><sentence id="548">And -- and of course all these things also got played out, so it was comments as a result, and further comments, and answers to questions which my mother gave, among a group of three or four other ladies, some a little bit older, with no children, but in the same sort of situation. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="554">Q: Mm-hm, mm-hm. </sentence><sentence id="555">So what -- what stories do you have of the voyage itself, that in -- </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="556">A: My mother told me -- well, apparently up to the -- up to the arrival in Cuba, it was -- it was very -- seemed to be very pleasant, in fact unbelievably, I mean, not that she said that, but when you read the background, you have to really question yourself. </sentence><sentence id="557">Here they are forced out of a country, and suddenly being, you know, provided with -- with -- with a staff, you know, waiters and everything else, at beck and call, considering what was taking place. </sentence><sentence id="558">But I think a great deal, from what I've read, or what I've heard, would indicate that the captain of the St. Louis was an extremely decent individual, and determined to -- he was determined to -- to have this as if there was no -- no animosity against anybody in particular. </sentence><sentence id="559">And I believe the -- the Israeli government honored him with a -- with a -- with a medal after the war, and I've also read that as a result of his activities, he was relieved of command when the St. Louis ultimately returned empty in -- in - - to Germany. </sentence><sentence id="560">Never given another command, although he was a career naval officer from World </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="566"> War I days. </sentence><sentence id="567">But he was left alone, which is always again, you do -- you'd have thought he'd have been put on trial for being decent to Jews. </sentence><sentence id="568">That did not happen. </sentence><sentence id="569">So I think a lot the -- the -- the way the -- the -- the staff and the crew of the St. Louis conducted themselves, probably in my -- I can only surmise, was the way the captain felt they should handle themselves. </sentence><sentence id="570">So I think the voyage to Cuba probably was very pleasant. </sentence><sentence id="571">The voyage back from Cuba was not so pleasant. </sentence><sentence id="572">My -- my mother told me that things started to go downhill emotionally for people. </sentence><sentence id="573">And I -- I don't know the name, I can't recall the name of it, I'm sure it's listed somewhere, there was one person who threw himself overboard in -- off the St. Louis in -- in -- in the harbor. </sentence><sentence id="574">I think, you know, t-trying to commit suicide, you know. </sentence><sentence id="575">And my mother knew the wi -- or had met the wife of -- of that ba -- if -- if -- if my memory is correct. </sentence><sentence id="576">Ya -- people talked among themselves sometimes, but to what degree I don't know. </sentence><sentence id="577">On the voyage back, they apparently had to have committees, which were -- the captain requested the men to form, if they were willing, various committees which would -- which would sort of patrol the decks, certainly during the night, or during the day and night, to avoid people from trying to commit suicide, and my father -- my mother told me that my father was -- was a member of one of these committees. </sentence><sentence id="578">I don't know what my grandfather, whether he was that way. </sentence><sentence id="579">It's just that she responded, or she mentioned that to me, because there was serious -- a -- a serious thought by various people that others would perhaps do this. </sentence><sentence id="580">Whether that's right or wrong I don't know, actually. </sentence><sentence id="581">I'm not aware that anybody did do it, but there was that particular feeling. </sentence><sentence id="582">And of course there must have been, and I suspect, although my mother didn't mention it, a tremendous apprehension as to what was going to happen, because if the ship really returned to Hamburg again, then -- or wherever we sailed, the re -- the results would have been extremely dire. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="600">Q: Sure. </sentence><sentence id="601">An-Anything else from the time in Havana, or -- </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="604">A: Well, we were never in Havana -- </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="605">Q: Right, I know, in the harbor. </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="606">A: You know, in the harbor. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="610">A: I don't know whether the passengers at the time knew what was taking place, and I -- I-"ve got to be careful here now in how I respond to you, because I could be making comments about what I've read. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="612">Q: Right. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="614">A: My understanding is that the Jewish relief agency in -- in the s -- in the United States was trying to negotiate -- </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="615">Q: Release. </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="616">A: -- the -- with -- with the mexi -- with the Cuban authorities, or the Cuban president, because I -- I gather -- and this is only what I've read, is that the -- the entry certificates were not signed by the president, but they were signed by Benito, if that's the -- o-or whoever was the immigration minister, and were already ada -- you know, illegal documents, before we ever sailed. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="618">Q: Right, right. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="620">A: Okay. </sentence><sentence id="621">And I don't know whether -- what would have happened if people had known that. </sentence><sentence id="622">I've also read that one or two passengers, who had tickets, Jewish passengers, never believed these tickets were valid from the Hamburg American line, and went to the Cuban authorities in Berlin or whatever, and got landing visas separately, on their own, before they ever doc -- you know, boarded the ship. </sentence><sentence id="623">And the -- and th-these were people who were, in fact, allowed to land. </sentence><sentence id="624">But how far that's accurate, I don't know. </sentence><sentence id="625">I suspect -- I can only cou -- my mother certainly had no idea, and I could never ask my father, that, you know, they were not going to be -- and all I've -- to be allowed to land, and all I've heard is that there were negotiations on -- whether they knew that, on board, I don't know. </sentence><sentence id="626">The vessel cruised up and down the -- the eastern seaboard. </sentence><sentence id="627">And I think that was done deliberately by the captain from what I've read, in the hope that something would materialize. </sentence><sentence id="628">I gather it was really a negotiating tactic, with the -- again from what the -- what I've read or seen published, and that the -- the then president of the -- of Cuba couldn't -- wouldn't -- you know, wanted more money and there was a negotiating thing, and then suddenly the negotiation dropped down. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="639">Q: Right, right. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="641">A: What would have happened had one lump sum been offered at that time, and they accepted, I don't honestly know. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="760">A: Which would have helped. </sentence><sentence id="761">And having no ability to -- to do anything, must have caused my father even bigger depression, I suspect, you know, or stunned silence. </sentence><sentence id="762">We've -- I was able to talk to my mother about this years later, and we just hope that if they were left there, that ultimately they got bombed. </sentence><sentence id="763">If they were taken to Germany when the Germans marched into Antwerp, and they were put into some German storage houses, hopefully they got damaged and burned, because they would never have known what they were sitting on. </sentence><sentence id="764">You know? </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="779">A: And then we took the boat to Southampton. </sentence><sentence id="780">We arrived in Southampton as far as I understand, and were taken by train. </sentence><sentence id="781">And this is really memory -- not really such accurate memory other -- you know, I've read about this. </sentence><sentence id="782">And we arrived in London. </sentence><sentence id="783">And we at -- we ended up in as -- the four of us -- I'm including my grandfather now, Grandfather Eisner, my mother's father, were put up either in a two, or three, and I really don't know -- certainly not more -- upstairs in a house, in a -- in a -- in an area of London called Camden town. </sentence><sentence id="784">The only thing which I really remember about this is that directly opposite the front of the house was a small park on the other side of the street, and that I -- my parents allowed me, or I was able to play there. </sentence><sentence id="785">It -- it was in summertime, we arrived in June -- all the time. </sentence><sentence id="786">And I think that's where I learned my English. </sentence><sentence id="787">Very quickly, because when -- children have that ability, I think, if you follow what I'm getting at. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="876">A: And I'm not sure that they all turned up released. </sentence><sentence id="877">It was not over but -- for my father and my grandfather, I -- I get the impression it was not a long internment. </sentence><sentence id="878">And that's the one thing which my father, he never referred to it as an arrest. </sentence><sentence id="879">He was able to comment to me about that, and he said it was really like being in a barracks in the military, and I think he was trying to compare it to World War I.

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="891">Q: Right. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="893">A: So I never -- and they certainly when I came out, there was no -- it didn't look -- you know, I mean obviously it's like being in an army camp, but it wasn't in any other way. </sentence><sentence id="894">And ultimately they both joined us in Bedford. </sentence><sentence id="895">When, I don't know, and where they came together, I don't -- I can't really recall. </sentence><sentence id="896">If it was 1940, then I was already five. </sentence><sentence id="897">And in those days, you went to school at the age of five in England. </sentence><sentence id="898">So my concern -- my ma -- mother's concern wasn't getting me off -- off to school -- and you have to remember, by this time I was speaking English already, and it was not a long distance away, but again my mother spoke that the Quakers in Bedford, it was not a Jewish -- End of Tape One, Side B    Beginning Tape Two, Side A </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="914">A: Yes, yeah, I don't know exactly what -- when that year. </sentence><sentence id="915">The one thing which is interesting, the -- the -- the -- the German air raids on Britain at that time, had re-really started, and I remember my mother had a school friend, somewhat older. </sentence><sentence id="916">I used to call her Aunt Margot. </sentence><sentence id="917">She was not married, but she was more like a sister to my -- in other words they were school friends, but the relationship was almost like sisters, okay. </sentence><sentence id="918">And she had fa -- I can't tell you how, but she got to London on her own, and she was living in London, and my mother apparently contacted her and said, "Why don't you come and live in Bedford? </sentence><sentence id="919">You can get a job in Bedford. </sentence><sentence id="920">And -- and come stay with me." </sentence><sentence id="921">I think my mother was worried, you know, with the air raids, and nightly bombing, my father not there, my grandfather not being there. </sentence><sentence id="922">And so Margot Lewin, who had a brother in New York, and was also, I think, hoping to get a visa to the States, which ultimately came through, but not until World War II was -- was over, and so forth, said all right, apparently, and -- and came to Bedford, and very shortly got a job in a major manufacturing company, an ironwork company in Bedford, as a secretary. </sentence><sentence id="923">She obviously knew enough English to be able to do these things. </sentence><sentence id="924">And she actually lived with us, and we all lived in one room. </sentence><sentence id="925">And I think it made my mother feel a little bit more safe and secure. </sentence><sentence id="926">I would call her Aunt Margot, you know, and she really became more of an aunt than a real aunt would have been, if you follow what I'm getting at. </sentence><sentence id="927">And you know, we had nightly bombing raids at -- you know, sometimes two or three times during the night, and ri -- my mother -- my -- and we were living on the top floor of a -- of a building, of -- of a three story ap -- house, okay? </sentence><sentence id="928">And my mother -- you know, you get very tired when you have to get up and dress and all the rest of these things. </sentence><sentence id="929">And my mother said to me -- said to us, and I think it was a general agreement, not bu -- I mean, they didn't ask for my approval, I was -- that they weren't going to get up any more. </sentence><sentence id="930">If it was -- if -- I think my mother said if it was God's will the bomb was going to go down, it won't make any difference if we're upstairs or down in the cellar. </sentence><sentence id="931">It's going to take us all. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="951">Q: Right. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="953">A: So we ended up just sleeping through all this, not getting up any more. </sentence><sentence id="954">And we would be woken up by the air raid warning to say that this was -- the -- the planes were coming, or the all clear siren, when they were all gone. </sentence><sentence id="955">But, you know, we just didn't get up any more. </sentence><sentence id="956">My -- my mother just made that decision, she said ge -- you kill yourself, I think -- or we will -- we will -- we will die out of sheer exhaustion, you know, or I don't know quite, you know, how it's -- </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="957">Q: Right. </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="958">A: -- anyway, they stayed -- they were -- they were there together, and if fact I visited my aunt in New York -- not -- she's not my real aunt -- </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="959">Q: Right. </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="960">A: -- but if you understand what I mean, many years later, as -- as a married person, when I was already married, and she in fact -- and I then brought her from New York in -- in -- in a car. </sentence><sentence id="961">I had a business ve -- trip, and I drove to New York for that specifically, picked her up from her apartment, drove her back to Canada, to Toronto. </sentence><sentence id="962">She stayed with us for two or three weeks, and then we put her on a plane back to -- to New York. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="981">A: She was that close to my mother, you see. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="983">Q: To your mother, right. </sentence><sentence id="984">That must have been a great comfort to your mother, to have a companion, sure. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="987">A: I think so. </sentence><sentence id="988">And it was a gr -- and -- and you know, it was very nice. </sentence><sentence id="989">She was the type of aunt who was the accommodating type, in the sense that she made no demands on me. </sentence><sentence id="990">If anybody made any demands, it was me on her. </sentence><sentence id="991">And -- and she was always obliging with -- with -- with so forth, so I have my -- my memories of her were -- were -- were very good. </sentence><sentence id="992">Then my father was released from the Isle of Man, and at that juncture we obviously couldn't live together. </sentence><sentence id="993">And then we -- we then moved to another -- </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="994">Q: Because you didn't have enough space? </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="995">A: No, well, we were in one room, and w -- and my -- and -- and my mother's school friend -- </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="996">Q: Was there. </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="997">A: -- was there. </sentence><sentence id="998">So we had to move, and it was -- and we needed a bit more space, or wer -- we -- you know, the landlady was not exactly the greatest. </sentence><sentence id="999">I -- I don't -- she was a -- she had a temper, I don't mean that she was anti-Jewish, I think she was just a -- not a very accommodating person. </sentence><sentence id="1000">She rented rooms out to various other people. </sentence><sentence id="1001">And I remember my telling how that one of the -- there was an old man living on one of the rooms, and he said, "Don't take any attention to Mrs.Morgan, she's just naturally irritable." </sentence><sentence id="1002">You know? </sentence><sentence id="1003">So it wasn't anything -- if -- if you understand me, it wasn't anything bi -- against that. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1012">Q: Personal, yeah. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1014">A: She was just making money renting out rooms, okay. </sentence><sentence id="1015">And -- but I think the rooms were -- bu - - that money came in from either the Quakers, or other liberal people in the -- in -- in Bedford, in the sense of decent people, actually, until such time. </sentence><sentence id="1016">And then at some point, and I don't know when, probably sometime in the 40's, my father came to Bedford, was released, so did my grandfather. </sentence><sentence id="1017">We -- my mother made arrangements to move to another place where the three of us could be together, not far away from where we were staying. </sentence><sentence id="1018">My -- she also made arrangements for my f -- grandfather to have a room by himself somewhere, in another house. </sentence><sentence id="1019">And Aunt Margot, quote, unquote, also got a room for herself, and we went, and we progressed from there. </sentence><sentence id="1020">My father then got a job. </sentence><sentence id="1021">The one thing which I have always found very interesting is that we -- my parents did not, neither my father, my mother, or my grandfather, particularly after they ki -- were released from -- from the Isle of Man were not request -- did not have to go to the police station daily or weekly or monthly in any shape or form. </sentence><sentence id="1022">And I gather that that was a -- I -- I could be wrong, but I read somewhere years later, that that was a decision made by Prime Minister Churchill to say, look, if we've checked these people out, let's not create a problem. </sentence><sentence id="1023">We've got more important things to do than worry about having people go -- but whether that's accurate or not, I don't know. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1034">Q: Yeah. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1036">A: But I'm not aware that my parents or my father, or my grandfather had to report on a regular basis to the police. </sentence><sentence id="1037">And we were left alone. </sentence><sentence id="1038">Nobody ever bothered us. </sentence><sentence id="1039">Nobody ever bothered us. </sentence><sentence id="1040">In fact, it -- you -- it was perhaps typical English, you've got your freedom, you're on your own now. </sentence><sentence id="1041">Which I found rather interesting in today's context, where immigrants in various countries, when they arrive, want -- make demands on all sorts of things. </sentence><sentence id="1042">We were just only too happy. </sentence><sentence id="1043">I'm sure my parents, you know, depressed, stunned, whatever, but they were left alone. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1054">A: They did not have to worry about being knocked up in the middle of the night by a police warrant or -- or what have you. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1056">Q: Yeah, yeah. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1058">A: And I think that -- I know from my father's point of view, that that impressed him, years later. </sentence><sentence id="1059">We didn't actually talk about that, but I think he -- he -- his indication was that that -- that was something which made him, I suspect, feel a little bit better. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1171">A: In relationship to what he'd experienced, because nobody ever bothered. </sentence><sentence id="1172">They didn't ask. </sentence><sentence id="1173">English people generally, bit more reserved, so didn't ask questions. </sentence><sentence id="1174">And he wasn't the type to want to answer, so he was just left alone. </sentence><sentence id="1175">They thought he was a very nice person, he was courteous and pleasant, but he wasn't forced to express himself to anybody. </sentence><sentence id="1176">I think that made a major difference. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3183">A: "ve often wondered how he got out of Buchenwald. </sentence><sentence id="3184">You know, y -- I -- and I -- I -- I've -- I've -- I -- I -- the only rea -- and there's nothing on paper, and he never discussed it, but "ve read documentation to say that, you know, World War I veterans were -- were released with an understanding. </sentence><sentence id="3185">However, I've also pondered my father being -- having been the outside counsel for LG. </sentence><sentence id="3186">Farben, and knowing so many people in Halle, in -- in -- where his career was. </sentence><sentence id="3187">And my mother would tell me that even in -- even in -- in the period between hi -- "33, and perhaps up to </sentence></p><p><sentence id="3188"> -- up to the -- deg38, they would have like -- they call it in -- in German -- in -- in -- in German, it was like a -- the equivalent of Bridge scart and once a week -- </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3189">Q: The equivalent of what? </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3190">A: It's -- it was a card game, like Bridge. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3192">Q: Oh. </sentence><sentence id="3193">Oh, oh, oh. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3196">A: And per -- I don't know whether it's weekly or monthly, my mother would have -- the -- it would be arranged that my parents -- a combination -- my father had his business on a fourth floor of an apartment building. </sentence><sentence id="3197">Half the fi -- a -- the floor, was the apartment for living and the other half was his private practice. </sentence><sentence id="3198">And the -- you know, this would be a table of four and six, and she would have a buffet done. </sentence><sentence id="3199">This is after Hitler still is around, can you beat this, you know. </sentence><sentence id="3200">And Is -- used to ask -- I asked her [indecipherable] I said -- I said, "And they were all Jewish people?" </sentence><sentence id="3201">And is -- no, there might have been a couple of Jews, and the rest were, you know, people from either a judge or somebody else, who were not Jews. </sentence><sentence id="3202">And my -- my -- I do recall my father saying to me, that had things got very bad, he had already made arrangements with people he knew, who would take me -- and they were obviously all known Jewish people, and -- but it never came up, okay. </sentence><sentence id="3203">Now who they were, what they were, I don't know. </sentence><sentence id="3204">And I've often wondered whether some of these people may not have -- you know, they were not, you know, they were pretty senior people in the city of -- I suspect [indecipherable] people who were known in the city, you know, if it was -- if it was legal or otherwise, whether that didn't help him get out, you know. </sentence><sentence id="3205">You can't tell, you know. </sentence><sentence id="3206">It's -- it's a strange -- I don't know. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3218">Q: These are questions that you" ll always have. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3220">A: Yeah. </sentence><sentence id="3221">And I don't know the answers -- </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3222">Q: Yeah. </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3223">A: -- to those, and then nobody's alive to this day. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3225">Q: Yeah, yeah. </sentence><sentence id="3226">I wanted to ask you about this -- this is sort of a museum kind of centered question, but since you received this notice that this search was going on for survivors, and you've come into contact with all this information and been thinking about it, and maybe in -- in a different kind of way, or through a different kind of lens, and come here to Washington, and you've answered this question partially, but how has this brought you either any kind of new understanding, or specific kind of information about your family that otherwise may not have happened to you? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3229">A: That's it -- you've got -- there's several questions in that one question. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3231">Q: I know, I know. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3233">A: New understanding? </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3241">Q: Okay. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3243">A: Okay. </sentence><sentence id="3244">What I -- what has happened is, in coming here, and -- and -- and through the generous help of people like yourself and others, I've managed, after all these years, on behalf of my cousin in Australia who is in her 80's now, to get closure on my grandmothers. </sentence><sentence id="3245">I have a -- I have a -- a date on which she died. </sentence><sentence id="3246">So we now know where she died, and on the day in which, cause you know, it -- it turns out the Germans were meticulous, it seemed, in stating -- </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3247">Q: Right. </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3248">A: -- where the dates are. </sentence><sentence id="3249">That was my main reason, I have to be truthful with you. </sentence><sentence id="3250">I can't do anything about the St. Louis. </sentence><sentence id="3251">I didn't initiate the project, you're initiating the project, or the museum, and I think it's great. </sentence><sentence id="3252">And it -- and -- but I have to say to you, there's not much I can --    </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3258">Q: Gain from it. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3260">A: -- gain, because even though I was on it, from my personal experience it wasn't horrendous. </sentence><sentence id="3261">At least I don't think it was. </sentence><sentence id="3262">I can't answer for my parents any more, because they're dead. </sentence><sentence id="3263">Whether I ca -- and they really made no reference to the St. Louis -- St. Louis, other than it was a voyage. </sentence><sentence id="3264">And they couldn't get into Cuba, and they couldn't get into the States. </sentence><sentence id="3265">Well, Cuba was really their -- the -- the -- the -- the weigh station, if you want to put it that way. </sentence><sentence id="3266">I don't know, you know, beyond that I don't know. </sentence><sentence id="3267">I -- I'm glad that I -- I got acquainted with you all, because the -- the people here at the museum are doing their best to answer some other questions. </sentence><sentence id="3268">I got my first answer yesterday. </sentence><sentence id="3269">I think I posed three questions -- actually four, but three of the more serious ones. </sentence><sentence id="3270">My fourth question really was to the museum, what are you planning to do with all this, you know, as far as the St. Louis is concerned, but that's not a -- that's not a -- a -- a family issue, okay, in that context. </sentence><sentence id="3271">I had three serious questions. </sentence><sentence id="3272">The first one got answered. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3286">Q: About your grandmother. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3288">A: About my grandmother. </sentence><sentence id="3289">And was -- my cousin, | al-already guessed, we had no closure date. </sentence><sentence id="3290">So this means I don't have to -- to -- to -- to -- to have a -- a what do they call it, a plaque put up somewhere else to do th -- I do now know where she is, okay, and I can, in -- in -- in any little family book, I can put down died so and so, okay. </sentence><sentence id="3291">How she died, I don't want to think about. </sentence><sentence id="3292">I suspect that there's a -- she was only in her mid-70's, people live to much older ages these days. </sentence><sentence id="3293">So why should it have happened, how could it have happened? </sentence><sentence id="3294">I don't even ask those questions, cause I won't get any answer, and all I'll do is make myself angry. </sentence><sentence id="3295">If you -- if you understand. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3304">Q: Sure. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3306">A: Okay. </sentence><sentence id="3307">So I've got closure. </sentence><sentence id="3308">What I really would like to do, perhaps on my father's behalf, is find out what happened to his elder brother, and that's going to be a lot harder. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3312">Q: Hugo. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3314">A: Yeah, now he obviously died early in -- and in -- where, and under what circumstances, we don't know. </sentence><sentence id="3315">My mother always said that he had sort of fled eastwards. </sentence><sentence id="3316">But if he fled too far east, how did he end up getting a cable -- how did he get to find out where we were in London to send us a telegram? </sentence><sentence id="3317">And why did he end up coming back the other way, and dying in a -- as a result of quote unquote, the term hospitalization which my grandmother, well, it was typed out for her, and we have to ask what that means. </sentence><sentence id="3318">How would she have known about that so early in the war, okay? </sentence><sentence id="3319">So where was he, if she'd have known that. </sentence><sentence id="3320">I mean, I can't believe that everybody [indecipherable] these unoccupied territories would have been so keen to start sending out. </sentence><sentence id="3321">And - - and I think the museum has mentioned that it's really more in Germany that all these things were kept meticulously, you know. </sentence><sentence id="3322">Just as well they were now today, because that means we can trace them, and we can complain about them, and -- and -- and quote for some people, perhaps it may give them some claim in their old age where they might need the restitution which they're entitled to. </sentence><sentence id="3323">But I don't know, that's really what I'd want to get out of this thing, and I'm not -- and because if y -- I hadn't been made aware of this, and I didn't even see it in the -- I -- you know, the Washington Post isn't read daily by everybody overseas. </sentence><sentence id="3324">And it isn't read everywhere daily in the United States, you know. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3336">Q: That's right. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3338">A: We winter down in Houston in -- for three months with our daughter, younger daughter who lives there permanently, and we had the Houston Chronicle delivered to us every day, so you know, I wasn't rushing out to get the Washington Post. </sentence><sentence id="3339">And I didn't -- wasn't aware of it, even though apparently it was advertised in other papers, and a friend of ours, who is actually the -- the godfather of our younger daughter in Houston, who lives in -- here in -- and worked as a -- </sentence></p><p><sentence id="3340"> we met each other years ago in -- overseas, and he became -- he and his wife became godparents to my daughter. </sentence><sentence id="3341">He was in the foreign service, and we've kept in touch over the -- over the time, and he called me, and said, "Did you know about this?" </sentence><sentence id="3342">I said no. </sentence><sentence id="3343">He said, "You haven't seen," - - I said, "Well, I don't normally take the wa -- Washington Post." </sentence><sentence id="3344">I said, "The easiest one to get, where we are, is actually the New York Times, actually." </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3345">Q: New York Times. </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3346">A: And I'm not trying to denigrate the Washington Post. </sentence><sentence id="3347">But I said, "I didn't see anything like that in the Wall Street Journal," I get that every day on my doorstep at six in the morning at home, and -- with our other papers -- and he said, "I'll send it to you." </sentence><sentence id="3348">And that's where it all started. </sentence><sentence id="3349">But for me at that juncture, it was important because your colleagues here all offered to be of help if they could, which was very generous and I appreciate that very much. </sentence><sentence id="3350">The other thing is, it wasn't until my mother died, in 2001, that I got a chance to go through all these papers, cause up to that time, she was really -- kept them boxed, bagged, and everything else. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="3351">And it was quite a difficult process, because when you consider when th -- their ages when they both died -- so the Germans didn't win that game -- it was almost a hundred years of documentation. </sentence><sentence id="3352">And the very serious things were all in German, and in all German writing. </sentence><sentence id="3353">You know, not the Romanized way we see it today, you know [indecipherable] we're talking about. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="3354">And I've had to really, piece by piece, and it wasn't until last year that I went -- that I took back with me, or went through the li -- in England, the last box of papers and pictures, which somebody very gener -- kindly and generously kept for me, you know. </sentence><sentence id="3355">You know, it's -- it's not easy to take things back in bags, and all the rest of this, you know -- </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3356">Q: No, I can't imagine it, yeah. </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3357">A: -- you understand. </sentence><sentence id="3358">And so that has, to some degree, sparked off. </sentence><sentence id="3359">And then when my cousins asked me on both sides to submit these claims, I then really had to dig into this material. </sentence><sentence id="3360">Luckily, [had it now, but it's still very time consuming, because the answers aren't always there. </sentence><sentence id="3361">So then when this thing came up, at the end of last year, al -- I thought to myself -- perhaps I'm being a bit selfish here, perhaps this is a way in which I can get some answers, not so much for claims or anything else, but on what happened to my grandmother, which I did. </sentence><sentence id="3362">What happened to my Uncle Hugo. </sentence><sentence id="3363">Those were the two -- </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3364">Q: Right. </sentence><sentence id="3365">Pressing -- pressing questions for you. </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3366">A: -- priority questions actually. </sentence><sentence id="3367">I am a little skeptical about what I get [indecipherable] mind, because even downstairs in the museum, the people who deal with that, the ones who found what happened to my grandmother said it's very -- that could prove to be very, very difficult, you know. </sentence><sentence id="3368">And why would he have been rounded up immediately, that's you know, do you under -- do you follow? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3372">Q: Mm-hm. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3374">A: You know, the real serious round-ups -- I mean my grandmother wasn't -- wasn't deported to Theresienstadt until 19 -- 1942. </sentence><sentence id="3375">The war broke out in deg39, if Hitler was putting all the Jews in, why didn't they all go in wa -- in one fell swoop? </sentence><sentence id="3376">So I don't know. </sentence><sentence id="3377">It's -- it's very confusing. </sentence><sentence id="3378">But who s -- who knows what [indecipherable]. </sentence><sentence id="3379">I -- I -- I don't know how other than to answer you -- that question, and then put some of these things to rest. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3386">Q: Yeah. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3388">A: "m -- I'm not a great believer in dwelling indefinitely on these things, mentally and physically, it doesn't do you well. </sentence><sentence id="3389">I can't -- I couldn't stop it then, I can't stop -- stop it now. </sentence><sentence id="3390">I don't want to leave my daughters with an inheritance of trying to find something. </sentence><sentence id="3391">They know </sentence></p><p><sentence id="3392"> where they came from. </sentence><sentence id="3393">They know how they got from A to B, they know who their parents are, they know who their grandparents are, they both met the -- one set of grandparents, okay. </sentence><sentence id="3394">They -- they know from pictures and everything else where they came from, and how far they can -- they can trace back their particular roots -- </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3395">Q: Pretty far. </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3396">A: Pretty far. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3398">Q: Yeah. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3400">A: So they really don't need to do chasing. </sentence><sentence id="3401">It's not easy, and sometimes it's really quite -- how can I put it? </sentence><sentence id="3402">Draining. </sentence><sentence id="3403">You know, for the simple reason that reading or looking at these things can make people very angry. </sentence><sentence id="3404">And I must admit it causes me some anger. </sentence><sentence id="3405">Other people view it differently, so perhaps I'm being a little bit selfish in having the museum do these things for me. </sentence><sentence id="3406">If this is a way in which I can, from my point of view, to aid what you're talking about, do this oral history, of which the St. Louis is a part, then it's -- it's my way of saying thank you very much. </sentence><sentence id="3407">And I think it's worthwhile, but how much the contribution is to future generations, I'd like to believe that it will be, but I've lived and worked in quite a few parts of the world, and I've had to step in ironically on behalf of others, purely as a westerner in some parts of the world, for people who came -- I sometimes -- I -- I'm perhaps -- I say to myself -- you know, I -- let's hope that these things don't happen again, irrespective of -- to whichever group of people or otherwise -- and that's about as much as I can say to you. </sentence></p></dialogue>
