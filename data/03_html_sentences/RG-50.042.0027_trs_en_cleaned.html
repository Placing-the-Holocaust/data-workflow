<body><dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="1">We're starting now. </sentence><sentence id="2">Can you talk about how things changed with the coming of the Nazis, and talk about the suddenness and the gradualness sort of mixed together, and how people were, didn't realize what was going on. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="3">We immediately at the end of the hostilities, uh, there was a return to relatively normal life in the little town of Meyerhof, where I lived in, in Poland, but then, gradually there was a, an increase in the persecution by, by the Germans. </sentence><sentence id="4">First the military left and the SS came and then with the SS came the uh the Ukrainians and the Lithuanians, who really were rather cruel towards the Jews. </sentence><sentence id="5">So there was an ever-increasing intensity of persecution. </sentence><sentence id="6">Then, establishment of the ghetto, uh, and ultimately the uh deportations or whatever are the term one wants to use. </sentence><sentence id="7">I think the term deportation is a bit misleading. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="8">Let's cut because is that the answer you think? </sentence></p><p><sentence id="9">Yes. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="10">Wait till he gets slated. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="11">Beep. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="12">At the end of the hostilities, that is when Poland was defeated, life came to relatively uh normal type of situation in the little town of Veerhoff where I lived. </sentence><sentence id="13">Uh, but then there was a ever- increasing intensity of persecution. </sentence><sentence id="14">First of all, the, the military left. </sentence><sentence id="15">The Wehrmacht, the, who were relatively uh non- uh punitive towards Jews or for that matter anyone. </sentence><sentence id="16">Uh, then comes the civil administration, the German administration, the SS, and with them come the uh, they hire the guns so to say the, uh, the Lithuanians and the Ukrainians, who were really very vicious and cruel towards the Jews particularly. </sentence><sentence id="17">Uh, then ghetto is formed, and once and first the ghetto, there are very inhuman conditions uh through enough, but one can still go back and forth. </sentence><sentence id="18">But, the main point is that there is a slow increase in the, uh, in the nature of persecution, that there is a kind of a, uh, things are not all that bad. </sentence><sentence id="19">It's quite possible to survive. </sentence><sentence id="20">Uh, and after all, all along, we hope that those big powers, France, England, United States, any moment, they're going to come uh, into real war, and quickly defeat Germany. </sentence><sentence id="21">So, all along, there is the notion, we can somehow make it, and when the uh, you know, when the deportations, or as we called them, Ausedlung, or Actions, Action in German, uh come, uh then generally it is really too late to do anything. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="22">Were people, once those things started, tell me what those things were, and once things started, did people know what was going on in the ghetto. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="23">No, we uh, my, was a shock to me that when I looked into it, once I was in United States, that a This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence

information about this collection </sentence></p><p><sentence id="26"> reader of the New York Times knew a great deal more, and I have copies of those, uhhhh, newspapers, than we did, who were there! </sentence><sentence id="27">Because we had no way of communicating with each other. </sentence><sentence id="28">Uh, in fact, in our little town, the community hired a Pole to follow the trains, so that we know where the trains are going, because we didn't. </sentence><sentence id="29">And he lost track. </sentence><sentence id="30">You know, he couldn't follow it, and we didn't know. </sentence><sentence id="31">That's a absolute fact that we did not know what was going on uh, until it, until after the war really. </sentence><sentence id="32">Now, somebody got the, you know, there are some people I have uh examined a lot of uh survivors who didn't know when they arrived in Auschwitz what was going on. </sentence><sentence id="33">So, there was a general lack of knowledge. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="34">Can you talk about different conditions in Eastern and Western Europe, and also how readily recognizable Jews were. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="35">For a Jew in Poland to hide was generally, virtually impossible, to hide by I mean, I mean, to adopt a non-Jewish identity, I don't mean hiding in some closet. </sentence><sentence id="36">Uh, to be on false papers, because Jews talked differently, they had clear cut accent, Jewish accent, they looked differently, Poland is a homogeneous society uh where uh there are no outsiders. </sentence><sentence id="37">Americans uh are used to Italians and Spaniards and uh Norwegians. </sentence><sentence id="38">You don't have that in Poland. </sentence><sentence id="39">It's a homogeneous society. </sentence><sentence id="40">Uh, Jews were the only, generally, the only outsiders. </sentence><sentence id="41">They spoke differently, they behaved differently, and they looked differently. </sentence><sentence id="42">And last not least, if they were males, they were circumcised. </sentence><sentence id="43">The only men who were circumcised were Jews. </sentence><sentence id="44">So, if you had any doubts about a male's identity, all you had to do is drop his pants and you knew he was a Jew. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="45">And how was that different from other parts of Europe? </sentence></p><p><sentence id="46">In other parts of Europe, the Jews were different because the Jews were assimilated. </sentence><sentence id="47">In Poland, they assimilated group of Jews with uh a min--tiny minority. </sentence><sentence id="48">Uh, in Germany, majority of Jews were indistinguishable from the Germans. </sentence><sentence id="49">It took all kind of research to determine that somebody was a Jew. </sentence><sentence id="50">There were lots of uh German Jews who just found out thanks to Hitler that they were Jews. </sentence><sentence id="51">You didn't have that kind of quote unquote "problem" in Poland. </sentence><sentence id="52">You knew you were a Jew. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="53">Poles around you made it clear to you that you were a Jew, so there was no doubt about it. </sentence><sentence id="54">So Jews were assimilated in, in other parts of, of Europe. </sentence><sentence id="55">The other, the level of antisemitism was entirely different. </sentence><sentence id="56">Even in Germany. </sentence><sentence id="57">The Germans who, after all are responsible for the genocide of the Jews, were certainly not as antisemitic as Poles. </sentence><sentence id="58">I don't think anyone would argue that. </sentence><sentence id="59">So, that's another factor. </sentence><sentence id="60">But the Germans behaved differently. </sentence><sentence id="61">I challenge anyone to say that the Germans were the same in Poland as they were in France. </sentence><sentence id="62">The same troops, I don't mean that they were physically different. </sentence><sentence id="63">You take a SS unit, and you station the SS unit in Krakow, and you transfer it them to Par-to Paris or Amsterdam, and they are different, because they are among humans. </sentence><sentence id="64">In Poland, they were not among humans, but a-among barbarians. </sentence><sentence id="65">Their contempt for Poles was just a little bit less than for Jews. </sentence><sentence id="66">I mean, Jews were non-human, poles were sub-human. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="67"> And, so they could behave without any kind of restraint, towards the Jews and towards the Poles. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="68">In Denmark, a Danish citizen, annoyed with how the Germans behave, spit into the face of an SS man, and got a 30 day suspended sentence. </sentence><sentence id="69">In Poland you get a bullet between your eyes on the spot. </sentence><sentence id="70">It was a different world. </sentence><sentence id="71">The Germans behaved differently in Poland than in Western Europe. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="72">What were deportations, and what did people think they were. </sentence><sentence id="73">It was announced from time to time </sentence></p><p><sentence id="74"> This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="75">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="76"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection that there would be a deportation, that people would go to work in the east. </sentence><sentence id="77">Now remember, the east was someplace out in Russia, uh, it was as far removed as if somebody told you that you're going to travel to outer space. </sentence><sentence id="78">Well, you'd probably know more about outer space now than we did know what's out there in, in Russia. </sentence><sentence id="79">And, the assumption, at least they said, you go there to work. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="80">And they directed to bring certain implements with you, and food and whatever. </sentence><sentence id="81">It would vary from locality to locality. </sentence><sentence id="82">So, there was a kind of a feeling of anxiety and they unknown, there's something terrible happening, but it was not clear, there was no clear cut knowledge as to what was the purpose of it, and after all, as all human beings, uh, the Jews of Poland did engage in some denial. </sentence><sentence id="83">I mean, one wanted to be hopeful, and again, it's very difficult to conceptualize, to think of something that is unthinkable. </sentence><sentence id="84">How do you imagine the unthinkable. </sentence><sentence id="85">Now we know, but then we didn't. </sentence><sentence id="86">It was just inconceivable to us, that something that terrible could be happening. </sentence><sentence id="87">It was true in my family. </sentence><sentence id="88">My father who was educated in Vienna, and who spoke fluently German um was much more reluctant to... </sentence></p><p><sentence id="89">We have to stop, we just ran out. </sentence><sentence id="90">We have to reload. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="91">Beep. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="92">Okay, you were talking about how difficult it was to realize what was going on, and you had just started about your father, so why don't you pick it up there. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="93">My father was educated, at least in part, in Vienna, spoke fluently German, and was really sort of familiar with the German culture, and that in a way, was his downfall because he just could not believe uh that Germans would engage in something so barbaric, whereas my mother was responding more to uh to sort of clues that came from the environment, became very anxious, bordering on sort of almost irrational in her anxiety. </sentence><sentence id="94">She was just roaming around asking uh, uh even strangers could they somehow help, you know in terms of doing something for uh, like for me, and my mother was indeed the one who was responsible for securing for me the place in the monastery through a woman that she barely knew, uh was a woman who was selling sweets uh in our town and my mother spoke to her and somehow through that uh established on a very short notice uh my ability to, to leave and go to the monastery. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="95">Okay, I want to back up and ask you to define for me again as though I don't, I don't know what a ghetto is. </sentence><sentence id="96">I don't know about the formation of the ghetto. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="97">Well, one day, there came an announcement that there would be a Jewish quarters, which has come to be known as the ghetto, but they, the Germans call it the Jewish quarters essentially in in German, and uh it gave you a perimeters where Jews could live, which was a tiny portion of the town, and I'm speaking of the town where I lived, but it was similarly true in other towns, and uh, the Poles who lived in that area had to evacuate, but that wasn't a problem because there was the area that the Jews left was a much wider one so who, whatever a Pole was displaced from the Jewish designated area for Jews, they got much better quarters anyway, but not the other way around, uh, in terms of the, the Jews moved in few families into one room, two families. </sentence><sentence id="98">Maybe one family in one room in the beginning, because the ghetto, they have the Jewish area, the Jewish part of town, would become smaller and smaller and smaller, but at first it was open, so you could get in and out in certain hours. </sentence><sentence id="99">For example, there were uh a Jew could not be in the street after 7 This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="100">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="101"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection o'clock. </sentence><sentence id="102">But at other times, you could get out and mingle, be outside. </sentence><sentence id="103">One day there was an announcement, the ghetto is closed, and there were gates, there were walls -------------- and you couldn't get out, so you see there was this ever-increasing uh level of persecution. </sentence><sentence id="104">I think that is the critical issue both in terms of ghetto, in terms of what, what happens in the ghetto, even when they closed the ghetto there was still enough food somehow brought in, but then suddenly there is less food. </sentence><sentence id="105">Suddenly the ghetto is being made smaller instead of there being forced blocks. </sentence><sentence id="106">Now there are only 2 blocks. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="107">You talked about what things were punishable by death in the ghetto. </sentence><sentence id="108">What kinds of things were-- what were the punishments? </sentence><sentence id="109">What was against the law? </sentence></p><p><sentence id="110">Virtually everything that was contrary to the, uh, not the law, because there was no law, but contrary to a kind of an order given by the local German uh administration, was punishable by death. </sentence><sentence id="111">So, for example, uh, going after the time that was forbidden for Jews, let's say after 8 o clock, or after 7 0 clock at one point, was punishable by death. </sentence><sentence id="112">Not wearing your armband was punishable by death. </sentence><sentence id="113">Getting outside of ghetto was punishable by death. </sentence><sentence id="114">Having white bread, I mean that is a fact, where that I know of someone who got shot on the spot, and I hope I can tell it without reacting as I often do, uh, that that person got shot. ( </sentence><sentence id="115">Crying, long pause). </sentence><sentence id="116">That always gives me trouble. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="117">Tell me what it was like to live on areas -----------------, and tell me why you were able to do that. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="118">What special things made it so you were able to? </sentence></p><p><sentence id="119">(Long pause) Well, my parents, unlike virtually um all of the Jews in our, in our town, that varied from town to town were assimilated, that is they spoke very well polish, and were generally indistinguishable from the rest of the population, and certainly that applied to me as a, as a youngster, so I could pretend that I was not a Jew, uh with some difficulty. </sentence><sentence id="120">Obviously at first when I came to the monastery, my familiarity with prayers, my familiarity with uh catholic uh liturgy, and so was limited but I had some so I could, I could uh, uh pretend. </sentence><sentence id="121">Most Jews, or most boys my age would not be able to do that uh, in Poland that is. </sentence><sentence id="122">So, that accounts for my uh ability to live on false papers, but that was the only, that was the beginning. </sentence><sentence id="123">Uh, I would, one also had to have great deal, I can say it now in retrospect without having to be falsely modest, it required resourcefulness, courage, and an ability to sort of adapt to circumstances and perceive, you know, you looked at another person, and you knew that that person had a look in his or her eyes, is he a Jew? </sentence><sentence id="124">And then you had to take some action. </sentence><sentence id="125">Say something. </sentence><sentence id="126">I would, for example, if I was on a street car, and, and, and a person had a look like, ah, that kid might be a Jew, I would go to that person, and ask something, or maybe make some kind of a comment, and a fairly aggressive comment, and maybe, like you know in a train I would say, "Would you move your suitcase," or something like that, and that would right away dispel that person's suspicion, because first of all my language would be clear, so that most likely he's not a Jew, and my behavior would be then different, so you see it wasn't only the language, the appearance, but also the behavior. </sentence><sentence id="127">There was in Poland a kind of a expression that they could recognize a Jew by sadness in his or her eyes or false papers. </sentence><sentence id="128">Now remember that there was generally fear of having a Jew live somewhere nearby because you could get punished for it, and great many people also were antisemitic, and approved of the persecution of Jews. </sentence><sentence id="129">That is quite inconceivable to many Poles nowadays, the new Polish uh generation, young people find this offensive when one mentions that it was perfectly acceptable in Poland during This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="130">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="131"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection World War Two to see Jews tormented because it is not acceptable now. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="132">I only have a little bit left, I'm trying to think of something short. </sentence><sentence id="133">Tell me what were liquidations in the ghetto? </sentence></p><p><sentence id="134">Liquidation was a term that we used, meaning that the ghetto would be closed, that there would be not, see one never knew, is this the final type of uh deportation or would they permit or some people remain. </sentence><sentence id="135">See as, as a ghetto was being, as the deportation would start, people would have certain papers that allowed them to stay, there were certain, there was a hierarchy, okay? </sentence><sentence id="136">You worked in this place, you worked in that place, those papers were good, these ones were not, and one never knew for sure, well, is this the final liquidation of that particular ghetto in this locality or not? </sentence><sentence id="137">So, you could only for sure tell in retrospect. </sentence><sentence id="138">There were small, see they, the procedure that they followed that we didn't know about, they always concentrated, they closed the smaller ghettos. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="139">Then they made the bigger ghettos. </sentence><sentence id="140">Ultimately there was, for example in the, in the county where I lived, there were number of Jewish communities... </sentence></p><p><sentence id="141">We just ran out. </sentence><sentence id="142">We have to reload. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="143">Well, just do whatever-- Beep. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="144">Sometime in 1942, probably early in summer of 42 it became pretty apparent that there would be a final liquidation of the ghetto, and my mother became very anxious and just talked to anyone she could to create some type of a setting where she and my sister, and I, I was 14 years old at the time, not quite 14, uh, and my mother did, through an acquaintance, arrange for a man named Godumsky, to come, she lived in Chanstohova?? </sentence><sentence id="145">to come to Mierhow, and take me to the monastery of Mogilla. </sentence><sentence id="146">Now you have to keep in mind that there was no way of communicating, and one couldn't trust, there were some phones, but one couldn't really communicate. </sentence><sentence id="147">This, this lady contacted Mr. Godumsky, who didn't quite know what she wanted from him, so he came, and because we anticipated that the ghetto would be liquidated the next day, my mother left me with this lady, and I stayed there. </sentence><sentence id="148">The many came and he did agree to take me to the monastery, but obviously he didn't know if the monastery would accept me. </sentence><sentence id="149">And it so happened that that very day indeed, as he and I were going to the train station, there was the final liquidation of the ghetto, and as I walked with him, Jews were being driven in the streets to the trains, and I bought a ticket, uh, I had uh a false document, but he didn't, I didn't have to show it, and he and I didn't go together. </sentence><sentence id="150">Mr. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="151">Godumsky and I didn't go together, because if they caught me, he would be also uh punished. </sentence><sentence id="152">So, we got on a train, and we took the train to Krakow, which was what uh, maybe just 40 miles I think it's 60 - 70 kilometers from Mierhoff and then from the train station, we had to walk to the monastery, which was quite a distance at the time, and while I waited outside, he went and talked to the prior, whom he told a lie, mainly that I was a converted Jew, that my family was not really Jews, but converted Jews, and the prior agreed to accept me into the seminary, into the novitiate, and I at that point became a student so to say, for priesthood, and I uh lived there, again, I can't be certain for how long, uh because when I start add up all various experiences, and add the amount of time they lasted, I end up with ten years, and the war was 5 years, so but I, I assume I was there more than a year, and I remained in a monastery until the day that I perceived one day that a priest This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="153">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="154"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection who was my teacher of catechism who I knew quite well somehow suspected that I was a Jew, and the way he tipped me off that I was at first not even aware of it, was that he corrected my Polish pronunciation, and when, and I knew that was a mistake, and he did it with a certain smirk on his face, and that night I was so anxious about it, and Mr. Godumsky, who was a , who used to be a monk, but now was in a monastery as a worker, he did uh, I told him what my feelings were, and I did hide in the organ that night. </sentence><sentence id="155">And that night, the Gestapo came and broke into my, we call them cells, but they were nice little rooms, the monastery was beautiful and rich and uh really beautiful place, they broke in, broke the door down, and didn't find me, and then Mr. Godumsky came where I was hidden, and we sneaked out, and went to another uh place where he had a friend, uh, whose names was Yagoginsky, with whom I communicated great deal to the present time, uh, who has then taken over and helped me afterwards. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="156">Tell me about some of your experiences that, in your time at the monastery. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="157">The monastery was really a, an experience where, where there were good things too, you know, uh, believe it or not, (laughs), my first sexual experience occurred in the monastery, not in the monastery grounds, but in the, just outside, because there were girls there from nearby who were quite interested in the boys from the monastery, uh, there were constant fear, however, of being recognized as a Jew. </sentence><sentence id="158">Uh, one day I, because I was nearsighted, um, I went to Krakow, and acquired glasses. </sentence><sentence id="159">As soon as I came in, one of my fellow seminarians looked at me and said, "Yanuk," that was my, my name, which was sort of a diminutive of John, uh said, "Oh, you look like a Jew!" </sentence><sentence id="160">And there was the last time I wore those glasses. </sentence><sentence id="161">Uh, there were many experiences that were close calls. </sentence><sentence id="162">For example one time I'm, one of my functions was to pick up the mail from the post office, and so I was known to everyone and they, at that time it was a village, today it's that part, that village is part of the town of Krakow, but at that time it was the village of Mogilla, and everybody knew me, and they were marching a group of Jews through the village to work at the nearby uhhhh military, German military establishment, and one of the fellows was somebody who knew me, and yelled out my name, and you know, I, I mean just unthinkingly he just yelled out and other people looked like what, what is it. </sentence><sentence id="163">So, you know, there were situation like that. </sentence><sentence id="164">Uh, Mogilla wasn't all that far from our town, uh and sometimes I encountered people who knew me from Promiehov. </sentence><sentence id="165">Uh, so there were many, many situations, which were quite dangerous and uh quite action... </sentence></p><p><sentence id="166">Tell me about the time when the head of the monastery sprinkled you incessantly with holy water. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="167">The Father Kuhar, who was the Prior, was a really a, a wonderful person, he was, uh, at least to my recollection, he uh maybe was six foot or six foot three, and very heavy set. </sentence><sentence id="168">He was not uh from Poland, he was from Yugoslavia, and he was a, a very benevolent person. </sentence><sentence id="169">I remember one time I was serving mass, you know, uh, I mean, I was, you know the , uh the boy who, I can't even describe it in English even though my English is relatively well, but those, the Catholic terminology is still Polish in my mind, and uh, he sprinkled me excessively uh with the holy water, and later on, I, I and I could see a twinkle in his eye, and uh later I ask him about it, and he said,with a smile, uh, in German, he said, "Zieher, zieher," which means, "Certain is certain," which was his way of now, of telling me "I know it was a lie that you are baptized, but it doesn't matter." </sentence><sentence id="170">This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word.

reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection We have time for one more little short story in the monastery. </sentence><sentence id="173">Have you got anything-- You know, Father Kuvar was a benevolent person, who helped me, who helped my mother. </sentence><sentence id="174">Well, my mother had black hair, black hair meant you were a Jew, my mother was on false papers, and we had to make sure that her hair was changed to sort of more blondish look, and that required transporting her from a hiding place in Krakow, and you know, bleaching your hair was not as simple as nowadays, and uh, I spoke to him about it, and what he arranged, now he had a big carriage with 2 horses, and so on, he arranged for it, he picked up my mother, I mean with a driver you know, and took her to this place in Krakow where her hair was changed. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="175">------------------Camera roll 4 just went up; Sync take 5 is up. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="176">When

</sentence></p><p><sentence id="179">I, this particular priest, who recognized at least claimed that he recognized some kind of a speech uh impediment or accent that was Jewish I believed, I was very sensitive, uh suspicious of him because I have on more than one occasion during a sermon heard him make antisemitic uh comments. </sentence><sentence id="180">Uh, for example, one time he was ---------- the congregation for the fact that they were doing business on Sunday, which was forbidden in Poland, anyway Poland was a strictly Catholic country, but people were doing it, selling, buying things, and he was saying "At one time, Jews were doing that, but thank God we got rid of them." </sentence><sentence id="181">Now, there was part of a sermon, so I uh, I knew how antisemitic he was. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="182">Tell me now in general about this monastery, and all kinds of, all the kinds of things they were involved in from resistance to uh... </sentence></p><p><sentence id="183">They And what happened to the head of the monastery too. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="184">The Mogilla Monastery is uh is ------------ Monastery.

</sentence><sentence id="188">It was a place of great scholarship. </sentence><sentence id="189">It also was a place where number of people who were in the resistance, in the Polish underground resistance, were uh, hiding under number of uh of pretexts, as workers, as priests, etc. </sentence><sentence id="190">and uh when I escaped there after they came to get me, uh later on I didn't know that Father Kuhar, the Prior, a number of others, were taken to Auschwitz, and in fact, for a long time, I thought that it was because of me. </sentence><sentence id="191">It turned it didn't have

example, he would give me the key to empty the collection boxes. </sentence><sentence id="201">And the was a big large church, and people would put money into the collection boxes, and in fact, to my

camp in some situation and uhh maybe later killed. </sentence><sentence id="207">The Poles who were guilty of assisting Jews, uh, were often, not always, but on many occasions killed or sent to to a camp. </sentence><sentence id="208">In some villages, uh, the house was burned down. </sentence><sentence id="209">I know, for example, uh of a man who did assist my family, but that didn't have to do

( </sentence><sentence id="232">Long silence) Uh, you know, this is problem that a teenager will have, or a youngster, uh, no doubt a parent would put a child into a relative safety situation, but would not do it for himself or herself. </sentence><sentence id="233">Uh, you know, my mother could not, or my father leave, and say, uh, whatever will happen to the children will happen, but the other way around they did it. </sentence><sentence id="234">You know, one of the reasons that my father didn't leave the camp uh later on where he was because he felt uh, we needed a place where there was some sort of headquarters, maybe that wasn't the entire reason, so you know, parents had bigger responsibilities, whereas, as a youngster, you did what your parents told you, and somehow you assumed that parents in their omnipotence are going to make it, whereas parents didn't have that illusion. </sentence><sentence id="235">And what were the parents" chances versus the kids?Well, it had great deal to do I believe with who the parents were, adults, uh, if you talk in terms of chances, surviving, where? </sentence><sentence id="236">Uh, are we talking on false papers, or are we talking in hiding? </sentence><sentence id="237">Are we talking in a camp? </sentence><sentence id="238">Uh, at all phases, uh, there were accidental factors and there were factors that had to do with the personality. </sentence><sentence id="239">Certainly, if you were a man, you had less chances to survive out on false papers because you would be so readily identified as a Jew by the fact that you were circumcised, whereas you couldn't absolutely prove it uh to a to a woman. </sentence><sentence id="240">And that uh again, that had to do also, at what point. </sentence><sentence id="241">You see, time is a tremendous factor here. </sentence><sentence id="242">It was so different in 19 uh late in 1942, than it was in 43 and when you get to 44 becomes impossible. </sentence><sentence id="243">We have to reload. </sentence><sentence id="244">That's a good point. </sentence><sentence id="245">Beep. </sentence><sentence id="246">Let's finish talking about that. </sentence><sentence id="247">How different were conditions in during different years over the course of the war?The chances for survival depended upon at what point in time, uh, a Jew found himself, and, and various situation, be it on false papers, be it in hiding, uh, be it in, ina camp. </sentence><sentence id="248">First of all, uh, personal resources were exhausted. </sentence><sentence id="249">For example, in, in our case, my mother and sister and I, even though separate, we were on false papers. </sentence><sentence id="250">Our resources were exhausted in terms of money even, having some, uh, in terms of having people that we could rely upon. </sentence><sentence id="251">Now, you have some contacts. </sentence><sentence id="252">Those get exhausted. </sentence><sentence id="253">So that the longer it lasted, the less chances that that one have for survival. </sentence><sentence id="254">The same thing was true in camp. </sentence><sentence id="255">Uh, you know, a, a, if a camp was liberated a week sooner, many more people would have survived. </sentence><sentence id="256">Uh, if the war ended six months earlier, a great many more would have survived. </sentence><sentence id="257">Remember that the Germans were so dedicated to the uh Final Solution of the Jewish question, that to the last minute, they were diligently working on this project. </sentence><sentence id="258">So there, the more time, it was really fighting for time. </sentence><sentence id="259">Every day, every hour, mattered. </sentence><sentence id="260">Can you give me a general picture of how you survived from when you left the monastery until the This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="261">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="262"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection end of the war. </sentence><sentence id="263">The kinds of things you did. </sentence><sentence id="264">After I escaped the monastery, I lived with this young man, who was on false papers himself. </sentence><sentence id="265">He was not a Jew, but he was a underground fighter. </sentence><sentence id="266">His name, his real name was Stefan Yagoginski, and he lives to this day. </sentence><sentence id="267">Uh, he and I lived together, he pretended that I was his uh nephew, and uh, he worked, he was repairing an organ in a large village. </sentence><sentence id="268">There was nothing wrong with the organ, but that was the cover, he was working on repairing the church organ because his father owned a factory of organs and there was the connection, and he and I, and I was assisting him in it. </sentence><sentence id="269">But then also, we had no funds, I had no funds anymore, no money, and we smuggled, we smuggled food from the villages surrounding Krakow to uh you know, to Krakow, and then we smuggled uh food to Warsaw, which was dangerous, and we smuggled from Warsaw, a, a Vodka, but not the real Vodka, but called, it was called Bimber, which was like Moonshine. </sentence><sentence id="270">That certainly was punishable by death. </sentence><sentence id="271">Uh, in fact, I was in Warsaw smuggling Bimber when uh when the Warsaw ghetto uprising started. </sentence><sentence id="272">I remember like today I, we were there, Stefan and I, uh, and then, it became increasingly too dangerous and through some contacts, we found out that one could uh, escape to Hungary. </sentence><sentence id="273">And Hungary at that time from what I was told, was really like paradise to us, and we did manage to escape to Hungary, and that's a long story, it was, it had, we had to cross a border, we got uh apprehended, escape, it was a complicated situation, and we did uh arrive in Hungary in 1943, sometimes in fall. </sentence><sentence id="274">My mother, sister, and, and I, and a childhood girlfriend of mine, whose father was killed in a camp. </sentence><sentence id="275">My father knew where he was, where she, where the girl was, her name was Gina, and we arrived in Hungary, and we were there as Poles on false papers, but in March of 44, the Germans occupied Hungary also. </sentence><sentence id="276">So the whole same situation started again. </sentence><sentence id="277">I attempted to escape with a Jewish underground group to Rumania, because there was a connection to Palestine at that time, but got apprehended on the border between Hungary and Romania. </sentence><sentence id="278">Hungary was occupied. </sentence><sentence id="279">Rumania was not. </sentence><sentence id="280">And I was taken to a camp in Yugoslavia, and then from that camp, I was transported to a prison in Budapest. </sentence><sentence id="281">In fact it was the prison where the famous Hanna Schenish was, she was on the same floor where I was, and I managed to escape from there with help of, of, of friends. </sentence><sentence id="282">Tell me about the escape. </sentence><sentence id="283">The escape really occurred through assistance of a , a Gestapo man, who was of, who was sort of half German, uh and half Yugoslavian, and I was in a, uh, and I do take credit for that, I established the contact with him, and I trusted him. </sentence><sentence id="284">Uh, uh, and uh, which was risk, because I gave him my mother's address, and my mother was still in Budapest on false papers. </sentence><sentence id="285">And I, I established, you know, contact with him while we were in this prison, uh, he could have been just playing me for a sucker, you know, uh, but I trusted him and it turned out he really engineered the escape. </sentence><sentence id="286">I mean, it's a long story, but it was his doing, and he engineered the escape. </sentence><sentence id="287">What was, when you said you were there at the beginning of the Warsaw Ghetto uprising...Oh no, I was only that day. </sentence><sentence id="288">I was that one day when the Warsaw ghetto uprising started, it so happened that Stefan and I were just making one of our periodic trips to pick up the, the moonshine. </sentence><sentence id="289">And it was, suddenly there was tremendous amount of activity, uh shooting and so on. </sentence><sentence id="290">There was something going on, and we heard that there was a an uprising in Warsaw ghetto. </sentence><sentence id="291">This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="292">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="293"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection So you just left?Oh, we just left, we left in a in a great hurry. </sentence><sentence id="294">Can you talk about what you think survival is a matter of?Of, what made difference in survival were the personal uh qualities of the individuals. </sentence><sentence id="295">There were many other factors, but everything else being equal, unless you were a person who had a tremendous will to survive, who had courage, resourcefulness, and uh, uh all the other factors wouldn't help. </sentence><sentence id="296">Now, sure you needed luck. </sentence><sentence id="297">And you needed uh assistance of other people, but your personal qualities determined, and I am saying it not only on false papers, uh, people who survived in camps didn't survive by accident. </sentence><sentence id="298">Uh, every one, I believe, every survivor, uh in my view, and that is maybe is sort of an over--no I don't think it is, is really a hero. </sentence><sentence id="299">And survivors hate that kind of a term. </sentence><sentence id="300">They avoid it because they don't want to take responsibility for their survival, and it took my great many years in, in analysis to recognize that I survived uh thanks not only to the help of others, but thanks to my own activities, which makes me responsible for my survival. </sentence><sentence id="301">You once talked about being accused of being a survivor, an accusation that you're a survivor. </sentence><sentence id="302">Survivors have been greeted with a great deal of ambivalence from the very beginning, uh, and in particular, uh, by fellow Jews, who , because survivors, in the eyes of Jews, were suspect. </sentence><sentence id="303">How did you survive? </sentence><sentence id="304">That was the question. </sentence><sentence id="305">You know, what kind of evil deeds did you commit in order to survive. </sentence><sentence id="306">You were sort of contaminated uh, you know the Nazis, the only good Jew is a dead Jew, and in a way, after the war immediately I believe, that was also a view of others. </sentence><sentence id="307">The, the dead people, they were the victims, the survivors were somehow suspect. </sentence><sentence id="308">And you know, to this day, there are all kind of memorials for everybody, Warsaw ghetto fighters, they, you have a kibbutz honoring the fighters of Warsaw ghetto, but you, you have streets named after fighters of Warsaw ghetto, but who talks about survivors? </sentence><sentence id="309">You know, what kind of, what avenue or what monument has been, and yet survivors accomplished a great deal more than the fighters of Warsaw ghetto, you know. </sentence><sentence id="310">So they killed a few Germans. </sentence><sentence id="311">So what. </sentence><sentence id="312">That doesn't impress me at all. </sentence><sentence id="313">Iam much more impressed with a group of young men and women in Budapest who assisted people in surviving, who risked, the Jews who risked their lives to help other Jews survive. </sentence><sentence id="314">They are much bigger heroes to me than the figh--fighters of Warsaw ghetto. </sentence><sentence id="315">Okay, we have to reload. </sentence><sentence id="316">Beep. </sentence><sentence id="317">We ran out before you finished that last thought, so I just want you to do something that sort of answers the question who you feel are the real heroes who really risked their lives. </sentence><sentence id="318">People who helped. </sentence><sentence id="319">During this whole terrible period, there were Jews, in addition to others, who risked their lives to help other Jews. </sentence><sentence id="320">In my own situation in, in Budapest, for example, or in, in Krakow, but in Budapest particularly, there was a group of young men and women, who risked their lives day in and day out to assist other Jews, who worked on false papers, who smuggled money, and all they, This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="321">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="322"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection they did this all to have others survive, and I am alive thanks to them. </sentence><sentence id="323">They're not celebrated as heroes, uh, but the group in Warsaw Ghetto, who decided to commit a collective suicide and succeeded in the process of killing a few Germans, are, are celebrated, and, and I wonder why, why that is, why don't we celebrate survivors, why don't we help those, why don't we celebrate those who have assisted other Jews to survive. </sentence><sentence id="324">I think in part, at least that's my own answer to this question, is that we have sort of identified with this militaristic age, where it really matters uh not if you preserve life, but if you destroy the enemy. </sentence><sentence id="325">When I first went to Yad Vashem many years ago, and as I walked in there, which isn't true anymore, the first thing you saw was a bigger than life picture of some Jews with guns, with, you know, as if this was the big deal. </sentence><sentence id="326">That didn't matter. </sentence><sentence id="327">It didn't ever impress me that some Jew during the war years managed to get a gun. </sentence><sentence id="328">That didn't accomplish anything. </sentence><sentence id="329">So you got, you killed one German or two or three, so what! </sentence><sentence id="330">I'm much more impressed with the fact that someone had the strength, the courage to survive, the courage to endure, the courage to endure, that really is what matters. </sentence><sentence id="331">Do you think there are close calls that you had, that you can think of that we should talk about?Oh, I had great many close calls, and you know, one of the sort of funny part of it is, that in Europe, there was great deal of literature on Indian lore written by a German called Karl May, who never was in America, who never saw an Indian, who, in fact, wrote his books in prison. </sentence><sentence id="332">But we lived on those books as kids, and I knew them and read them, and let me tell you, reading those books helped me a number of times to survive. </sentence><sentence id="333">When we were crossing the border from um, uh, Poland into Slovakia, we suddenly, when it was pitch dark and we had uh guides, and suddenly there were lights, dogs, and shots, and we uh, I first ran, you know, I was with my mother's sister and this girl, Gina, and obviously I could run the fastest, I had, but then I realized my mother and sister would be caught, and I could hear from a distance that there were also dogs there, and you know, my, what I have read about Indian lore and all that, I shoved my mother, there was a river nearby, as she approached, and my sister and Gina had then jumped after them, and walked against the stream, forced them, my mother was terrified, and that really saved our lives, at that particular time, and then we did hide, and the guides who escaped, they were mountain people uh from Poland, they came and found us, you know. </sentence><sentence id="334">Now, these are strange things, and there were many other similar situations where, they're just in a way bizarre in nature. </sentence><sentence id="335">But...one relied upon uh one's resourcefulness, really, I have to come back to the same term. </sentence><sentence id="336">One could not survive without uh wanting to live no matter what and also being resourceful. </sentence><sentence id="337">You told a story of the Gestapo asking for volunteers for execution. </sentence><sentence id="338">Yes, I I was in----------, and they told us, it was a makeshift prison, a Gestapo prison, uh, and three of our group escaped, and they came in. </sentence><sentence id="339">In fact, I see it like before my eyes today, the the chief of Gestapo came in with his white gloves and stood there hitting with the white gloves on the bars asking, we were beaten before quite a bit, but we were lined up and standing, asking for volunteers for execution. </sentence><sentence id="340">And, uh, a friend of mine, who, who I, his name I remember to this day, many names I don't remember, was Sonik, he volunteered first. </sentence><sentence id="341">He was depressed, and he really didn't want to live. </sentence><sentence id="342">I volunteered second, but I assure you it wasn't because I wanted to die. </sentence><sentence id="343">It was because I believed that they would not execute those who volunteered. </sentence><sentence id="344">It was too simple. </sentence><sentence id="345">They wouldn't do the (clears throat) the normal things you uh, who volunteered for execution would after all be the one who was not an escape risk, and I was right. </sentence><sentence id="346">This is a

Jewish, and he handed me a letter, and it was a letter from uh from my father, who was in the uh, which was uh the airport. </sentence><sentence id="350">This was the name of the camp really, but it was called the airport. </sentence><sentence id="351">Jews worked on that airport, and my father said, "You have to help this young man. </sentence><sentence id="352">He has to survive," and uh, they were trying to get some papers for him, and he was going to have a contact. </sentence><sentence id="353">Anyway, I did hide him in my cell, under, in my room, I brought him food, and I did keep him for a few days. </sentence><sentence id="354">Uh, I can't tell you exactly how uh long, but not very long. </sentence><sentence id="355">And, uh, he did tell me that he escaped from Treblinka, and
