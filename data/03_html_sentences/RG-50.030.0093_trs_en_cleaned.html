<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="29">Q: Tell me about Teplice. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="31">A: Teplice was a very good city. </sentence><sentence id="32">I mean, I grew up there; went to elementary school, went to high school there. </sentence><sentence id="33">And what's amazing about it is, | never encountered anti...antisemitism. </sentence><sentence id="34">I mean, I never knew, even... Matter of fact, I never even knew I was Jewish. </sentence><sentence id="35">Because I didn't know Judaism is a connotation with a religion, or anything else. </sentence><sentence id="36">So I was Jew by religion, but it was not part of my personality. </sentence><sentence id="37">And I must have been, maybe, 11 or 12 years old and my best friend ... His name is--I shan't forget--his name was Egon. </sentence><sentence id="38">And as we playing in our backyard... Because I...my father build me cages for rabbits. </sentence><sentence id="39">And I had so many rabbits. </sentence><sentence id="40">So during this play-thing, or whatever it was, he says to me, "Beno, my father says this you are Jewish. </sentence><sentence id="41">Are you Jewish?" </sentence><sentence id="42">And I said to him, "I don't know." </sentence><sentence id="43">Because I never realized, as he asked my religious affiliation, or it was a part of a playing thing. </sentence><sentence id="44">And is the last time I saw Egon. </sentence><sentence id="45">And never saw Egon since; and he was a very good friend of mine. </sentence><sentence id="46">And I always asked my parents what is the reason, how come I didn't see Egon. </sentence><sentence id="47">They never told me why. </sentence><sentence id="48">And I lost Egon. </sentence><sentence id="49">And this was...and as a childhood was quite a good one until it was getting bad. </sentence><sentence id="50">And college, I couldn't go to anymore; so I went to Budapest. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="71">Q: Tell us about Budapest, and what you did there as a young man. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="73">A: At...at Budapest, this was at that time the capital. </sentence><sentence id="74">It was almost like Paris, you know. </sentence><sentence id="75">It was a very lively, very vivacious city. </sentence><sentence id="76">Not for me, because...uh...financially, I couldn't afford anything else. </sentence><sentence id="77">But it was fairly good to me. </sentence><sentence id="78">Even in poverty, it was fairly good enough. </sentence><sentence id="79">And through...I don't know...circumstances, I got a job in the movies. </sentence><sentence id="80">I played in extras. </sentence><sentence id="81">I met S.S. Cuddles. </sentence><sentence id="82">I think here in America, they called him S.S. Cuddles. </sentence><sentence id="83">Actually, his name is S.S. Sagal. </sentence><sentence id="84">I made two movies with him...with him; and a actress at that time which was very, very popular in Europe--[Barsa Nirosi (ph)]. </sentence><sentence id="85">By the way, the reason also I got the job is because I was at that time bilingual. </sentence><sentence id="86">So the movies, at that time, were made in Hungarian and in German. </sentence><sentence id="87">So I could speak both languages. </sentence><sentence id="88">So when we took one take, I didn't have to  change roles. </sentence><sentence id="89">I could stay in the same role for the German take and for the Hungarian take. </sentence><sentence id="90">And...and plus we played with Hans Virbis (ph). </sentence><sentence id="91">He's supposed to make a picture with Martha Eggar, except at that time she fell in love with Jan Kippur. </sentence><sentence id="92">And she came to America, and she left the Jan Kippur in America. </sentence><sentence id="93">And...and this was my youth, "til my parents came...also came to Hungary; and it was getting... because Czechoslovakia became very unpleasant at that time. </sentence><sentence id="94">And...uh... </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="119">Q: What was happening to your parents? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="121">A: Uh...My parents came and tried to settle in..in Hungary. </sentence><sentence id="122">They felt this maybe in Hungarian, because at that time Horthy was more fascistic. </sentence><sentence id="123">So they felt that maybe Hitler's gonna spare Hungary. </sentence><sentence id="124">And plus, my father had a older brother living in Hungary. </sentence><sentence id="125">And he couldn't get any...in that between Hungary and Czechoslovakia, it was not very pleasant circumstances. </sentence><sentence id="126">There were already talking about war rumbling. </sentence><sentence id="127">So...uh...it was very rough, and my father couldn't get the papers to, uh...couldn't get papers to become a citizen or...or allowed to be stayed...allowed to stay there. </sentence><sentence id="128">So, through some acquaintances, my mother knew Mr. Beck. </sentence><sentence id="129">I think...I think Beck was at that time Foreign Minister of Hungary. </sentence><sentence id="130">| And she went to his office, and she bribed him quite--I don't know, let's call it bribe--when she gave him a tremendous amount of money. </sentence><sentence id="131">At that time, this was a big money for us; because it's all what my parents almost had. </sentence><sentence id="132">And after this, she gets an invitation and my father gets an invitation to a dinner which is in honor of Mr. Beck. </sentence><sentence id="133">So they were very elated, because they thought this gonna be the chance that he'd finally...he'd gonna give a...the papers which they needed to stay in Hungary. </sentence><sentence id="134">So during the conversation... During this dinner, he knocked on the glass; and he says, "I have another question to ask. </sentence><sentence id="135">I want to ask Mr. Helmer how come he gave me this tremendous amount of money." </sentence><sentence id="136">So it's a good thing that my father said, "I'm giving it to the Hungarian Red Cross." </sentence><sentence id="137">And with this sentence, he lost all his money. </sentence><sentence id="138">Because Mr. Beck didn't take the money. </sentence><sentence id="139">The Hungarian Red Cross got the money. </sentence><sentence id="140">And my parents were deported. </sentence><sentence id="141">And it was my parents, my brother and my sister; and they were deported to Poland. </sentence><sentence id="142">Because they had a chance to go to Czechoslovakia. </sentence><sentence id="143">You had a chance to go to any border they choose; and they choose Poland. </sentence><sentence id="144">And shortly after this, I was deported also. </sentence><sentence id="145">Matter of fact, I shall never forget; I came home from a movie which I saw--Modern Times, with Charlie Chaplin. </sentence><sentence id="146">This was the movie I saw. </sentence><sentence id="147">And I came home; and they woke me up during the night and arrested me. </sentence><sentence id="148">And they deported me to Poland. </sentence><sentence id="149">And I wound up in the city of _6d_. </sentence><sentence id="150">Always almost exactly the Friday before the war. </sentence><sentence id="151">And before the war. </sentence><sentence id="152">So we stayed in somebody's apartment. </sentence><sentence id="153">I don't know who it was, where it was apartment. </sentence><sentence id="154">By that time, the German war started. </sentence><sentence id="155">I think it's October Ist, 1939." </sentence><sentence id="156">The occupation was immediate. </sentence><sentence id="157">We couldn't escape anyplace, anyways. </sentence><sentence id="158">And, uh...because of financial difficulties, at that time was nothing left. </sentence><sentence id="159">So...because a lot of people escaped. </sentence><sentence id="160">So we found a place in _6d_ on...in a attic. </sentence><sentence id="161">Matter of fact, it was...the attic was so low that I don't think we ever... </sentence></p></dialogue>
