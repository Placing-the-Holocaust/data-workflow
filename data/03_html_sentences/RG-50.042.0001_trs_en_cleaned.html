<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="71">A: Tell me about the woman who wanted your Polish ---------. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="73">Q: Uh, well, we um, we realized that things were uh, what, what was most astonishing thing is that uh, we heard roars of uh people, our neighbors, and friends and people I've known all my life, you know. </sentence><sentence id="74">My mother was born in the same home I was born, and you know, it's been in the family I don't know for how many generations, and, uh, uh people were shouting you know, "Heil Hitler! </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="77">Long live the Fuehrer," and, and, and, and people were waving flags with Swastikas and uh, there was a feeling of complete betrayal, sud-suddenly you were home and, and you were not home anymore. </sentence><sentence id="78">You know, I mean, uh it was Poland you know, and we, we love Poland it was uh, uh at least a young generation, you know because the older generation had grown up, up under Austria, but of course, we were born under Poland, and uh, this is something I couldn't understand and, and probably uh the most, the most vivid example of that was that my friend Trudy, who uh had a ve-a very bitter life and her mother had died, and she had a stepfather, her mother married a, a that man went through, there was very little, he was terribly cruel to her, and he was beating her, and she spent so much time with us, was a, a, you know, and I, I really felt oh so close to her, and I saw her going to our garden and picking white roses. </sentence><sentence id="79">My mother was particularly proud of them because they had bloomed out of season and, and she was handing it to a sold--to a German soldier, you know, and people were bringing, and, and, and I think that gesture always sticks in my mind as, as one of complete betrayal, and also I remember her handing the roses to the soldier who is reaching out to her, and at that moment, someone else was handing him a glass of Schnapps, or what, you know, it was some sort of whiskey, and he let the roses fall to, to, to, to the ground and people were trampling on my roses, and um, uh, I don't know it, it's sort of like it became a symbol for me, that very moment, it's arrested in my mind that uh, what, what was happening there, that everything was sort of upside down, and um...I don't know. </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="80">A: Tell me about the neighbor who wanted -----------. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="82">Q: Then there was a woman, you know people, how people try to be helpful, I, I don't mean to uh, uh to say that um, that it was a direct betrayal of us, at that particular point it was not, but of... </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="106">Q: Okay. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="108">A: The war started in September. </sentence><sentence id="109">By, by Christmas we had to move to the basement of our home. </sentence><sentence id="110">It was very cold and clammy. </sentence><sentence id="111">We, we had no, no running water, no electricity, and uh, things were really quite bad, but we were still in our own home. </sentence><sentence id="112">Uh, and spring was very difficult because I always loved my garden. </sentence><sentence id="113">I used to spend a lot of time there as a child, and the sign appeared there, that dogs and Jews were not permitted to enter. </sentence><sentence id="114">Um, when we had orders to move to uh, Shabby??a remote corner of our town, which became the ghetto, uh, I defied that order. </sentence><sentence id="115">I remember I, I said, "I don't care what they're going to do." </sentence><sentence id="116">I had to see my garden again. </sentence><sentence id="117">Was a beautiful, fragrant spring morning, was in April, and uh, I remember I jumped over the fence, and went to the garden, and pretended that uh, that I was just, I was picking violets, and I pretended just for a little bit, what it would be like if uh, if the war hadn't happened, if I would be going in, my mother would say L, I need to take my raincoat to school, and my brother would be hurrying off, my father would be going to his office, my mother would be setting the table for breakfast, and urging us to -----------, and uh, I remember it was sort of the most incredible thing that um, uh the reality which I had always taken for granted, now became uh the most remote fantasy. </sentence><sentence id="118">I then, I think it stayed with me you know, in a way, throughout all the years to, to return to that. </sentence><sentence id="119">Later, of course, it took on other forms of um, when I was in the camps, to imagining evening at home, but here I still was looking at my childhood home, home, my parents were inside, my brother had been taken away, um, maybe six weeks after the war started, he was taken away October 19th, and the war broke out the first of September, but I was with my parents at home, I could, I could see from the garden, the room which had been mine, the wallpaper, um, even though we lived in the basement, I was still there, and, and yet um, I somehow must have been at least subconsciously aware that maybe I'm never come back, so I'd never recognize it, you know, I, I lived throughout with this thing, I'm going to go home, always, but uh, when I look back now over, over the many years, uh, and I, I still can very vividly recall my feeling, it, uh, it was sort of a farewell to, to my life and to my childhood, and I was sixteen at that point. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="133">Q: In the ghetto, tell me about some of things you remember. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="135">A: Well, you know, as much as I dreaded going to the ghetto, um, actually in some ways, it was a little easier for me because my friends were there, you know, I was not as isolated as I had been at home, when we had curfew and I could see my friends only at a certain time, and it was dangerous to go out anyway, but still we were uh, I was closer to my friends, so um, that somewhat compensated for, for the treatment so, so you know in, in, in every little room another tragedy played. </sentence><sentence id="136">Um, and then we had to work, um, and uh, in a nearby community called Badovitz, they had the shops there, where they were sewing uniforms for, I guess for the army, and we were marched, my, my mother and I and all, all went. </sentence><sentence id="137">Of course, you know, in the ghetto there were almost no men, there were mostly women and children, older people. </sentence><sentence id="138">My father, uh, was one of the few because he had had that heart attack and he was permitted to stay but he had to work in the, also in the nearby little town to fortify the river, in a place called Suhar, and uh we were terribly worried every morning that might be daybreak, 4 or 5 0 clock that he'd left because he had a heart condition, and we were afraid what that hard labor will, will do to him, and uh, my mother and I and some of my friends who few blessedly are still alive, um had to go to, to Baravitz to work in, in that uh, shop sewing. </sentence><sentence id="139">We left in the morning and came back late at night and then the whole thing started again, and actually I uh, I, I think the discipline was, was pretty good, you know you are so tired, you worked so hard that uh you did not get too much time to reflect of, of what was happening. </sentence><sentence id="140">At least for me it was, I'm sure it was much more difficult for my mother. </sentence><sentence id="141">And, and then well, um, -----------------from 1939 uh till the worst day of my life, the 28th of June, 42. </sentence><sentence id="142">Um, that is when I saw my father for the last time, the following day my mother. </sentence><sentence id="143">We were told to assemble. </sentence><sentence id="144">Uh, the day before um, we were, I uh, I heard my parents, of course, you know we all lived in one room, and I heard my parents talk through that night, and I still cannot comprehend their incredible bravery. </sentence><sentence id="145">They spoke only of, of their lives together, of their love, their good times, their children, their parents, and with that they faced the morning. </sentence><sentence id="146">I don't know, it sort of became uh, perhaps my own defense, I always felt, you know and thinks got-------------and volunteers???that I had to emulate my parents. </sentence><sentence id="147">If they could do it, I can do it. </sentence><sentence id="148">And then I must, you know, never disappoint them, I knew that that if they return and, and I thought, those things are, these, I thought when they return, I will never will say, you know, I will, I will show them that I um, that I'll come back, I'll do everything to come back to them because I remember how, how horrible it was for them when my brother left. </sentence><sentence id="149">Blessedly they never knew that my brother did not return. </sentence><sentence id="150">But, you know, that was the daily conversation, when Arthur comes back home and this and that. </sentence><sentence id="151">And I felt that, you know, I owed it to them to, to stay alive, no matter what, and not give them the pain of that loss. </sentence><sentence id="152">And however, you know we had, of course I always had a great --------------, so I was not particularly religious, I had a great deal of respect for religion and books, and um, one of the things I wanted to do after I said goodbye to my father, I wanted to I, I knew what would happen in the ghetto, you see my father was taken away on Sunday the 28th of June, and um, I asked a friend of mine to go with me and collect uh prayer books, you know, I, I was afraid when they'll find it, they'll probably use it for toilet tissue or something like that. </sentence><sentence id="153">And we dragged, was a rainy day, and we dragged those books out to little cemetery which was adjacent to the ghetto, and an old uh cemetery, we took the books there, we, we couldn't really bury them, but we sort of stashed them on one of those where they were um, I, I guess were, were some cottons and things where apparently I, I don't remember that too well, but I know that this is how we first tried to bury some of them, and that sort of, you know, if it's a decency of, of, of a burial. </sentence><sentence id="154">I would rather night recall the night the last night which I spent with my mother which was a very bitter, and then in the morning, you know, very, very early in the morning, uh, came the final moment. </sentence><sentence id="155">Uh, when they tushed through the ghetto with their whips and what have you. </sentence><sentence id="156">My poor mother, you know, my brother left on a Monday, and he left it 3 years prior to that. </sentence><sentence id="157">And my mother fasted every Monday, sort of atoning, I don't know for what. </sentence><sentence id="158">Uh, probably begging God if she's going to fast that my brother will return, and that was also on a Monday, and I, I remember I begged her to have something to eat and she wouldn't, but she had also uh, saved from before the war, a bit of cocoa, and uh, and some jam, and she decided to make that cocoa for me that morning. </sentence><sentence id="159">I remember it, she was looking at that cocoa with great longing, we didn't have any throughout. </sentence><sentence id="160">But, it didn't taste particularly sweet on that morning. </sentence><sentence id="161">We had to march through our town, and um, my...I guess it's a sort of a similar journey than a journey to execution when I think of it now because, you know, you saw people looking out from behind curtains. </sentence><sentence id="162">Some waving sort of a mute farewell, uh, seeing uh somebody was painting a new sign on a shop. </sentence><sentence id="163">The movie was putting on a new feature on the marquee, and uh, and we were marching. </sentence><sentence id="164">Ah. </sentence><sentence id="165">Was an SS man there that turned, that was near the railroad tracks where the circus used to come, was sort of a an empty place, accommodating all kinds of things as a circus before, and now sort of a tragedy of ------------nature. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="206">Q: If you could pick up, maybe you should tell me who Marin was and... </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="208">A: Okay. </sentence><sentence id="209">I, I was with my mother, and a number of my friends, who were with their mothers, and um, we heard that Marin was there. </sentence><sentence id="210">Um, Marin was um, a man of um, uh, if the stories to be believe of uh, not anyone to, to be greatly admired. </sentence><sentence id="211">Um, a man apparently of a little character, what have you, he was called an opportunist, and uh, this opportunity was presented to him that he uh was, was working with uh, with the government there. </sentence><sentence id="212">The story also had that he uh he had a child, a little daughter whom apparently he adored, and that he would do anything in order to save that child, and um, the Nazis apparently gave him that opportunity that if he would be helpful to interpret or get people to come there, his child would be saved. </sentence><sentence id="213">That was the story, I don't know how, how much truth that was in it. </sentence><sentence id="214">But I saw him, he was a, a very small sort of sour-looking man and it was, it was raining but it was oppressively hot because it was the end of June, and he was wearing a sleek raincoat, and uh, and then of course there were the Germans in uniforms, the Nazis, the SS, he was standing to the side, we had to form a line, and an SS man stood there with um, with a little stick and um, I was holding hands with my mother, I came up to him, and he says, "How old?" </sentence><sentence id="215">I said, "18," and he sort of pushed me to one side and my mother to the other side. </sentence><sentence id="216">I, I wasn't aware what was happening at that particular point, but shortly thereafter, when I stood with my other friends who were also separated from their mothers, we realized that we were going to go to separate places. </sentence><sentence id="217">There was enclosure, an enclosure there, this barbed wire, to, to the right where our mothers were, and we were immediately taken to, to the left. </sentence><sentence id="218">Now again, I, I don't remember the time sequence at all. </sentence><sentence id="219">I just remember a tremendous panic and uh, and shortly thereafter some trucks arrived, uh, open trucks with, with sort of a gate behind it, and we were loading in the truck, and uh, I heard my mother's voice and I thought ask, "Where to?" </sentence><sentence id="220">and I shouted back, "I don't know." </sentence><sentence id="221">And, I guess I must have been aware that that I was taken away from my mother so I jumped off, and Marin came, and he was very slight, small man, | didn't expect such strength in him, and he picked me up bodily and he threw me on the truck and he says, "You are too young to die." </sentence><sentence id="222">And, uh, I guess, the trucks were set in motion, again, I tried, I don't remember the, the time sequence and uh, I just heard my mother's voice over the entire uh, over crying and everything, and it came like an echo and she was saying, you know, "Be strong," you know, "-------," in German. </sentence><sentence id="223">And then the trucks rolled out of there, and, ironically the, the sun came out sort of um, I still see it, the rooftops looked wet, illuminated by the sun, and the church bells were ringing, and that was the last view. </sentence><sentence id="224">We were taken to...were taken to a train, and of course, I was with my friends, and I think we, we all started talking and facing the reality what was probably happening, and I remember rejecting it completely, thinking it cannot be, you know. </sentence><sentence id="225">Uh, they're going to be all right, and frankly, that kept me going all those years. </sentence><sentence id="226">They have to be all right. </sentence><sentence id="227">We went to Sosnovitch, which was a transit camp. </sentence><sentence id="228">Uh, you see our part, it belonged to Austria before the first world war. </sentence><sentence id="229">This is why we were German-speaking, this was quite early, this was 1942 and 42, and um, and that transit camp, your names, your ages, and the places you hail from were registered. </sentence><sentence id="230">I came from Berlitz, which was a well-known textile center, they called it the Manchester of Central Europe, and the people would come from all over Germany who were in need of labor. </sentence><sentence id="231">The men were in the army, the women were given responsible positions, and they needed slave labor, however they needed people who could understand German and speak German. </sentence><sentence id="232">So, we were ina -

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="367">Q: Uh, there was spiritual resistance when you were in that camp, and she sort of must have looked the other way, can you tell me... </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="369">A: Oh sure. </sentence><sentence id="370">You know, I mean, look, she demanded certain things, I mean I don't want to give you the impression that you know she was too--we worked very hard, you know we were, we were taught to weave, and uh, the work was very difficult, and uh, you know, you had to be very swift and that because uh, the material which we were weaving, you know, was, was very poor. </sentence><sentence id="371">The threads would break, and everything was interpreted as a sabotage. </sentence><sentence id="372">If you didn't work it like, uh skilled uh weavers would have 2 looms, we had 4 looms to watch. </sentence><sentence id="373">I mean, it was hard uh, uh backbreaking labor, but uh, but we still had some food, I mean uh you know, you, you didn't, you, you would consider it dreadful under normal circumstances, but of what was to follow later, I, I think of that as a transition period you know from uh from home and from, from love and from normalcy to, to the horror which followed, I, I think that uh that she made it bearable, you know. </sentence><sentence id="374">She did not steal any of our food. </sentence><sentence id="375">We, we got the food uh you know. </sentence><sentence id="376">If somebody was ill, as I mentioned, I was at that particular time, she let you stay on the bunk, you know. </sentence><sentence id="377">She, she, she really tried. </sentence><sentence id="378">She was a human being, and uh, and I think it was terribly important to meet a human being under those, those circumstances. </sentence><sentence id="379">You know, to a lot of people, I believe that um a concentration camp seems like a snake pit where people step on each other for survival, they stole from each other. </sentence><sentence id="380">That wasn't the case at all. </sentence><sentence id="381">And again, I speak only about the camps in which I was. </sentence><sentence id="382">And um, and I can say that I have seen the finest qualities of humanity there. </sentence><sentence id="383">The sharing and the caring, and you know, if uh, whatever one had one shared with somebody else be it a crumb of bread, or if somebody had a birthday you know, and on Sunday we sometimes got margarine on our bread. </sentence><sentence id="384">We would scrape the margarine off on Sunday from several of the pieces to save it for the person who had the birthday, to honor birthday, put some margarine on the bread, and, and things like that. </sentence><sentence id="385">My closest friend, Ilsa of whom I speak so often once found a raspberry in the ----- ----, and she carried it in her pocket all day long, through a hot day, a raspberry, a total possession. </sentence><sentence id="386">And that night she reached out and through the barbed wire, and got a leaf and washed it, and she presented the ra-raspberry on a leaf. </sentence><sentence id="387">It was her total possession, and people did some wonderful things there, and those are the things that I want to remember. </sentence><sentence id="388">You know, and we had very little time, of course, you know, and most, most of the time we were very tired. </sentence><sentence id="389">Whatever free time we had, but that was used if somebody remembered of seeing a, a particular film or ballet or something, it was shared, and you know, and an acted out, and um, oh there, there was an enormous support system there, and um, it, it that really was the, the other side to survival, that on one hand we experienced extreme cruelty, and on the other hand, incredible love and friendship, and there was a balance there, and there was hope there, you know. </sentence><sentence id="390">And somehow you um, you know, you saw of, of them, the Nazis like um, you know, I, I would fantasize to, to look like a snake or this and that, I mean you didn't think of them as human, but you could identify the others as human being. </sentence><sentence id="391">| always thought of them as below my contempt, you know, and this is how you could somehow take it. </sentence><sentence id="392">Sometimes, of course, you fell under the spell of it, you know, when they would march you out and, and tell you that you'll be here all your life and this and that, and I always said, you know, you can fall under that, you know, you have to imagine how uh, how they will look dead and things like that, you know, and I was spinning fantasies, and, and that helped. </sentence><sentence id="393">Now again, you know, you, you have to be very young at that time or with a very vivid imagination, which fortunately I had so um, you know, I, I could sort of often lift myself out of that and imagine different things, and, and almost, almost anything could conjure this type of picture sometimes, you know the um, I remember you know working on the looms and we had overhead lights and the way um sometimes the light fell on the loom, I could remember that light coming through to my window in the morning when I was a child waking up, and then I could build a whole picture around that and black out everything that was around me. </sentence><sentence id="394">And I lived sort of in, in a world, you know, you could live on 2 levels, there's, there's no problem about that. </sentence><sentence id="395">And I guess even now I do live on two levels, you know, sometimes the other one comes up and makes it a little more difficult when uh, when that intrudes, but most of the time you can, you can keep it down.

and everything and um, I was planning a party after the war, and I had the dilemma for almost an entire day if I should have a blue velvet dress or a red velvet dress. </sentence><sentence id="530">Couldn't resolve it. </sentence><sentence id="531">I really liked the color blue much better as a color, but I knew that red looked better on me, so uh, well, you could occupy your mind and hang your thoughts on trivia of that nature. </sentence><sentence id="532">It became very important, and this is how you passed the hours and forgot the hunger and, and the cold. </sentence><sentence

think you didn't have much ofa chance. </sentence><sentence id="535">I felt I was lucky because I never faced reality. </sentence><sentence id="536">I still don't. </sentence><sentence id="537">Uh, but when we went, um, when we had to leave Boltonheim, which was very hard. </sentence><sentence id="538">We, we left for another camp because we did not have enough uh, raw material to, to do any weaving. </sentence><sentence id="539">Um, Boltonheim had a sort of a sister uh factory called, uh, there were several, one of Landeshut, and one was Medsdorf, and so and we were send to Medsdorf. </sentence><sentence id="540">Medsdorf was a horrible camp by comparison with Boltonheim. </sentence><sentence id="541">First of all we were housed in, in a bldg maybe on the 6th or 7th or 8th floor, way up and it was terribly hot there, it was middle of the summer. </sentence><sentence id="542">And of course the windows were nailed down, I mean, we were literally broiling there, and the people in charge there were in complete contrast to what we knew about Frau Kigler. </sentence><sentence id="543">There was a Lager Feuhrer in there, who was perhaps 18 or 19 years old, the most vulgar-looking thing. </sentence><sentence id="544">Uh, she was wearing rings on every finger, and then sometimes 2 or 3 rings on each finger, and she had short stubby red hands, and her enjoyment was to, she had a little cart, like children right around, and she would sit in that cart with a little whip, and we had to um pull her. </sentence><sentence id="545">That was her, her joy, I mean, the mentality of that person was, was not to be believed. </sentence><sentence id="546">And then there was another person there, who was in charge of us, and she had been um, a guard in one of the female um jails, and we sometimes had, and the work that we did, um, people who were, who committed some, some sort of misdemeanor or what have you, in jail, came to spend a day working with us. </sentence><sentence id="547">And that was our normal work. </sentence><sentence id="548">Um, we worked at different jobs there. </sentence><sentence id="549">Um, one of the jobs, which was uh dreadful. </sentence><sentence id="550">There were several that were bad. </sentence><sentence id="551">One was to um hand a bricks one to another, and we were to throw the brick and, and catch it quickly. </sentence><sentence id="552">If you didn't, it landed on your hands, and uh, it crushed your fingers. </sentence><sentence id="553">The other job was to go in a nearby swamp because they were growing linen there, and in the swamp, you had to put um, uh, the li--the not finished linen, the thing that had grown into the swamp to because then it opened, uh, the enclosure in which the threads, the lin--, the linen was--I don't know if I'm explaining it right--that was backbreaking labor. </sentence><sentence id="554">You had to stand in the swamp doing that, and that's was swarming with mosquitoes, and then other thing that we did is uh load into a silo, an enormous silo, I don't know how many stories high, um, a man with a crane was throwing down bundles, and we were standing on that, and you know the bundles uh, came crashing down, and you had to arrange them, and you could easily be swallowed up in that, first of all, you were swaying all the time, and uh, and then they came so fast that if you didn't catch it fast enough, it hit you and it pricked your skin, and then, then your skin was bleeding, and then you were in the swamp, and the mosquitoes were eating in it. </sentence><sentence id="555">It was a horrible time, and it was there in that silo where some of the women came from jails who had committed murder or God knows what, as punishment for a day, and they said they preferred solitary anytime than to work there. </sentence><sentence id="556">Um, it was there as a matter of fact where I uh, really felt I was going to give up. </sentence><sentence id="557">There was one overseer who uh was particularly cruel to me, and he had singled me out for uh for this type of punishment. </sentence><sentence id="558">So, during the day, I was working with flax or uh ----------the bundles. </sentence><sentence id="559">At night we had to shovel coal. </sentence><sentence id="560">And wagons, uh you know, came loaded with coal, we had to shovel it because tracks had to be cleared, and it was going on day and night. </sentence><sentence id="561">Once we saw the trains going by we didn't' know if there were trains with uh with German soldiers going back, and people said there were trains of people we sent to Auschwitz. </sentence><sentence id="562">And um, and I remember my resistance really weakening there, and I thought to myself once after the um, the cold car was empty and I was with that, standing on that, with that shovel in my hand, and I, I said it would be so easy now to jump. </sentence><sentence id="563">An oncoming train, and it would be over in, in a couple seconds, and become a part of that stillness like we have to face tomorrow. </sentence><sentence id="564">It's, it's going to be tomorrow. </sentence><sentence id="565">It's going to be flax in the morning and, and the bundles at night, and, and the swamp again, and the hunger, and that I, I, I just felt I had enough. </sentence><sentence id="566">And I, I resisted that, and then, another day came by and the next night it uh, and I remember too, you know, I had promised my father, there was one thing I was never going to, to do is, is to really give up. </sentence><sentence id="567">It was sort of a, but, but there I came very close to doing it, and I remember that one night, when I definitely saw that it was a beautiful moonlit night, and I said to myself, "It's time to do it." </sentence><sentence id="568">And I heard very faint oncoming of a train, very far away probably. </sentence><sentence id="569">And suddenly I felt a pain in my both sides of my, my neck, very sharp, and um, it was right in the beginning of the war when we not heard from my brother and my mother was sick, and we were told that we had to leave with 20 lbs of our belongings. </sentence><sentence id="570">Our home. </sentence><sentence id="571">And I remember standing there, and we heard of a family who committed suicide together, and I sort of half-wished that

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="798">A: Sort of getting a little...Well...three years in the camp became progressively worse as um, raw material was running out, and also as uh it seemed that the war was taking a different turn. </sentence><sentence id="799">We sort of knew that if Germany should be victorious, our doom is going to be sealed. </sentence><sentence id="800">But if, for what we prayed for that, that we would be liberated, we were afraid that when things start turning uh bad for them, they are going to let uh their, their venom and their frustrations out on us, so that was really a no win situation. </sentence><sentence id="801">It became pretty obvious in the winter of 1944 as it turned to 45, when um, uh there were fr-a frequent um we heard planes coming in and, and uh, uh production stopped, and things were, were getting bad, and then on the night of the 28th, rather the day of the 28th of January, 45, we did not go to work. </sentence><sentence id="802">Was a workday, and we did not go to work. </sentence><sentence id="803">We were told to stay in camp. </sentence><sentence id="804">And toward evening we heard an enormous commotion, and uh, a transport of 2000 girls came from Auschwitz, mostly Hungarian girls. </sentence><sentence id="805">They told us they had been marching, that um, Auschwitz, uh the Russian front had moved closer, Auschwitz was being liberated, and they were running away from the advancing Russian army. </sentence><sentence id="806">And uh, we, we were going to join that march the next morning. </sentence><sentence id="807">Was bitter cold. </sentence><sentence id="808">Was in January. </sentence><sentence id="809">And I was coughing terribly, I had a very bad cold. </sentence><sentence id="810">And my 3 dearest friends, Susie Kuhns, Lizzy Schteburn, Ilsa Klein Zeller and I, we hurried together the four of us, and they, they were very concerned about me, they said, "You know, if you can only pull through with that terrible cold and the terrible cough," like the pneumonia or what have you. </sentence><sentence id="811">And in the morning, very early, the doors opened, not to the type of freedom we had hoped, but it opened to an, an incredible picture. </sentence><sentence id="812">There was freshly fallen snow for as far as the eye could see. </sentence><sentence id="813">And an enormous sort of it was a plateau, and then it came up to, to a gentle hill, and it    was just, just covered with snow. </sentence><sentence id="814">It was grey, it was snowing, and uh we were told to uh assemble for a -----------, so of course, there was the four of us, and uh we held hands, and we took the first step, and I guess we all knew that this was going to be the first step to the end of the road. </sentence><sentence id="815">Either to liberation or to, to doom. </sentence><sentence id="816">And in front of us stretched this incredible line. </sentence><sentence id="817">Well, people looked you know with, with grey uh camp blankets over them, and they looked like winged death. </sentence><sentence id="818">That's all you could see. </sentence><sentence id="819">Way, way ahead, four thousand girls. </sentence><sentence id="820">And on the side were the SS men and the SS women, and they lifted their whips and they said, "Forward march." </sentence><sentence id="821">And we started to march. </sentence><sentence id="822">Started to march, it was the 29th of January. </sentence><sentence id="823">And we, we left a lot of girls back in the snow. </sentence><sentence id="824">And they were killed. </sentence><sentence id="825">That was something one can barely, can really not describe. </sentence><sentence id="826">My father had asked me when I last saw him in June the very last day, practically in the last moment, before he left, he said to me, "Where are your skiing boots?" </sentence><sentence id="827">I said, "Why?" </sentence><sentence id="828">And he said, "I want you to wear them today." </sentence><sentence id="829">I said, "Papa, skiing shoes in June?" </sentence><sentence id="830">He said, "I want you to wear them." </sentence><sentence id="831">One didn't argue with one's father. </sentence><sentence id="832">So I put on those boots and I wore them throughout my entire stay in the camps for 3 years, and in them I'd also hidden the pictures of my parents and my brother. </sentence><sentence id="833">I didn't know, and I don't know how my father could have known that those boots were really instrumental in saving my life on that march. </sentence><sentence id="834">I had ski shoes. </sentence><sentence id="835">Some girls had sandals. </sentence><sentence id="836">We slept outside. </sentence><sentence id="837">The frost, I saw girls breaking off their toes like twigs. </sentence><sentence id="838">And I had my ski boots. </sentence><sentence id="839">On the 29th of April, rather I should say on the 28th, Ilsa wasn't well at all. </sentence><sentence id="840">She was sort of hallucinating. </sentence><sentence id="841">She was saying things which, I didn't know what she meant. </sentence><sentence id="842">And uh, when we stopped for the night, if a lot of girls, they put ---------, the girls who had died, I dragged away from there, and I, and she didn't seem to know what was going on. </sentence><sentence id="843">But then she became totally lucid, and one of the most shocking things was that one of my other friends had somehow found two potatoes. </sentence><sentence id="844">And she gave them to me, she said, "It's for you and for Ilsa." </sentence><sentence id="845">I gave Ilsa the potato and she said she wasn't hungry. </sentence><sentence id="846">That's the most incredible statement, not to be hungry. </sentence><sentence id="847">And she said to me, "You eat it." </sentence><sentence id="848">And then she said, she said, "I'm angry at no one. </sentence><sentence id="849">I hope nobody is angry at me." </sentence><sentence id="850">And then she said, "If my parents and kitty, kitty, was her little sister," she said, "If they survive, don't tell them how I died." </sentence><sentence id="851">And she said to me, "You'll be alone." </sentence><sentence id="852">She said, "But you have always been lucky." </sentence><sentence id="853">And I begged her not to say it, but she did. </sentence><sentence id="854">And she said she wanted some water, and there was a little brook nearby, so I --------, and I wanted to, to get it, and an SS man came, and he shoved me, and I begged him to let me have water for her, and he kicked her head. </sentence><sentence id="855">So, it was raining and sort of, so I caught some water in my hands and gave it to her, and I held her, and we both fell asleep. </sentence><sentence id="856">I woke up, and she didn't. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1136">A: Well this was the very last phase of the war when we were on this death march, which started on the 29th of January in Greenberg, in Silesia. </sentence><sentence id="1137">We sort of, our, our destination actually was Oranenburg, Oranenburg was a murder camp near Berlin. </sentence><sentence id="1138">Oranenburg fell into the hands of the Russians, and we were zig-zagging through Germany, ending in Czechoslovakia in a tiny place called ------------, where the march came to a halt. </sentence><sentence id="1139">Um, Ilsa had died just a week before. </sentence><sentence id="1140">It was evening, and um, one of the SS women came by and she mentioned to one of my friends to take my boots off, which sort of signaled you know the last thing. </sentence><sentence id="1141">My friend, her name was Hanna Kudlidsky, Hanna Keller in those days, told me that, and she said, "Hide. </sentence><sentence id="1142">Don't let her see you." </sentence><sentence id="1143">And um, a truck came, and she said to me, "You know, you better get on that truck so she shouldn't see you." </sentence><sentence id="1144">And I said, "You know I'm, I'm in no hurry." </sentence><sentence id="1145">And I remember sitting there and, and really knowing that this was definitely the end. </sentence><sentence id="1146">Heard American planes overhead, there was shooting, and the the German army was running away, there were people on the roads with children with animals, tremendous chaos, and uh, I was sitting there and it, it was really a beautiful night, it was May, it suddenly got a little warmer, and uh, and I permitted myself the luxury of thinking of home, of my parents of my, my brother in a different sense. </sentence><sentence id="1147">I always thought of home, but um, but somehow this was different. </sentence><sentence id="1148">The truck didn't come back for us, and they came, and    there was this enormous factory, we were sort of in front of it, and they it was in the they locked the doors, and was told that they planted a time bomb to, to blow us up--won't fall into the hands of whoever were coming. </sentence><sentence id="1149">We didn't know if it would be the Russians or the Americans or what. </sentence><sentence id="1150">I uh, I must have been pretty sick during that night. </sentence><sentence id="1151">I um, uh, only isolated things which, which I remember, when I remember that we, we tried to break out of there, and we couldn't, the doors were really locked and, and chains were put around it and everything. </sentence><sentence id="1152">And uh, it started to rain. </sentence><sentence id="1153">Torrential rain, which obviously somehow um, the bomb and -------- did not connect. </sentence><sentence id="1154">And then we are told that they're coming back. </sentence><sentence id="1155">I remember crawling in into one of those long um chimney, a cylinder that was on the floor, and a few of us crawled in there, and there was some shooting, I remember a bullet went by, and then it was quiet again, and then the doors, must have been the following morning, the doors were opened, the Czech people called and said the war was over. </sentence><sentence id="1156">Uh, I, I didn't understand the reality of, of that at all. </sentence><sentence id="1157">My , uh, then there were some Americans that night before, but my two um impact of...of freedom and of it being over actually must have happened that following morning. </sentence><sentence id="1158">I do know that the SS had run away, and they had changed their uniforms into civilian clothes. </sentence><sentence id="1159">I did find um one of those great coats, from the army, and I wrapped, wrapped myself in it and, and tried to sleep on the floor. </sentence><sentence id="1160">I must have been quite feverish, I was already I think quite ill, and it was the following morning that it, I, as I said we met the Americans the night before, but I think, but all that some-somehow sinks into oblivion. </sentence><sentence id="1161">My, my very clear um, view of ,of freedom and liberation came that morning when I stood in this doorway of that abandoned factory. </sentence><sentence id="1162">And I saw a car coming around the hill. </sentence><sentence id="1163">And the reality of that came when I saw the white star on its hood and not the swastika. </sentence><sentence id="1164">There were two men in that car. </sentence><sentence id="1165">One jumped out, came running toward me and asked if there was anyone who spoke English or German. </sentence><sentence id="1166">I told him I spoke German. </sentence><sentence id="1167">I remember that aura of him, of that awe, of, of disbelief, in daylight to really see someone who fought for our freedom, for my ideals, and uh, he looked like, like God to me. </sentence><sentence id="1168">And I uh, I knew what I had to say, and I said to him, "We are Jewish, you know." </sentence><sentence id="1169">For a very long time, at least to me it seemed very long, he didn't answer me, and then his own voice betrayed his emotion, he was wearing dark glasses I couldn't see his eyes, he said, "So am I." And the impact of that to be liberated not only by an American, but by a fellow Jew, um, it, it, it just, so totally uh, I mean, um, I think this is when that that feeling of such an incredible joy which fills your, your whole, whole being. </sentence><sentence id="1170">It, it, it must have, just burst out, I, I, I remember I couldn't get a hold of myself then. </sentence><sentence id="1171">But then he said, asked a strange question. </sentence><sentence id="1172">He said, "May I see the other ladies?" </sentence><sentence id="1173">A form of address we hadn't heard for six years." </sentence><sentence id="1174">I told him that most of the girls were inside and were too ill to walk. </sentence><sentence id="1175">He said to me, "Won't you come with me." </sentence><sentence id="1176">I didn't know what he meant. </sentence><sentence id="1177">So he, he held the door open for me and let me proceed in. </sentence><sentence id="1178">And that was the moment of restoration of, of humanity of humaneness, dignity and freedom. </sentence><sentence id="1179">And this first young American of liberation day is now my husband. </sentence><sentence id="1180">He opened not only the door for me, but the door to my life and    my future. </sentence><sentence id="1181">I took him to see my friends, but I was very sad because that morning I went to look for Susie, because Liesl said to me, "Susie went out to get some water, and she has not returned." </sentence><sentence id="1182">So I went out to look for her, and I found her near the pond. </sentence><sentence id="1183">I thought she had fainted, and I touched her, and she was cold. </sentence><sentence id="1184">I wanted to tell her, "Susie," and I did tell her, I said, "Susie, we are liberated, we are free." </sentence><sentence id="1185">We had made a bet more than three years earlier on a train which took us to camp. </sentence><sentence id="1186">A bet for a quart of strawberries and cream to be payable after the war. </sentence><sentence id="1187">I said we will be liberated, and she said we would not. </sentence><sentence id="1188">I didn't tell Liesl. </sentence><sentence id="1189">I couldn't tell her. </sentence><sentence id="1190">Liesl was very sick. </sentence><sentence id="1191">We all were very sick, we were immediately taken to a field hospital in --------- before a school house. </sentence><sentence id="1192">We were very, very ill. </sentence><sentence id="1193">| weighed 68 pounds. </sentence><sentence id="1194">My hair was white, so I was going to be 21 the following day. </sentence><sentence id="1195">I was told that Liesl had trouble with her legs. </sentence><sentence id="1196">She had uh been injured, uh, she had been shot in the leg. </sentence><sentence id="1197">And I asked to see her, and was told that I was too sick to, to go there and couldn't walk. </sentence><sentence id="1198">I kept asking and asking, and I sort of collapsed for quite a while. </sentence><sentence id="1199">And finally I was told that she had died. </sentence><sentence id="1200">Of the four of us, I was alone. </sentence><sentence id="1201">I was the one that had the cold and they were all concerned about me that I would not make it, and I was the only one who, who survived. </sentence><sentence id="1202">The only one from my family, the only one of my dearest friends. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1298">Q: I want you to talk to me about the legacy, the goodness that you saw in ------------------------, and feel free to retell the raspberry story, or other examples that you've done before as though you hadn't told before. </sentence><sentence id="1299">Tell me when. </sentence><sentence id="1300">Now. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1304">A: Now? </sentence><sentence id="1305">Looking back now over almost half a century, it is half a century, um, I think one is struck by the nobility of the spirit which also lived in this darkness. </sentence><sentence id="1306">The act of kindness, the type of support, the selflessness and the love, which I think was the support system to be able to endure that. </sentence><sentence id="1307">A belief in something. </sentence><sentence id="1308">Not, uh the inhumanity of, of our um captors, but, but the humanity which existed in the victims. </sentence><sentence id="1309">And there was a great deal of that. </sentence><sentence id="1310">My friend Ilsa, who gave me that raspberry, she carried it in her pocket all day long on a hot incredible day, and derived joy of giving it tome. </sentence><sentence id="1311">Um, the one time when we uh stood roll call for, for a long time, and a piece of bread sailed over the barbed wire into our group and one of the girls caught it, and we all knew whence it came and who had it. </sentence><sentence id="1312">And we were all questioned, we were all beaten, no one gave the person away. </sentence><sentence id="1313">If someone which became much more difficult later when we were not with Mrs. Kigler any anymore, who had showed such humanity, but later on when really cruelty and bestiality was the reign, um, one helped the other. </sentence><sentence id="1314">You know, if somebody couldn't work or was sick, you know, we, we all tried to, to help the other person, to pull them through. </sentence><sentence id="1315">Um, and, and that was taken absolutely for granted. </sentence><sentence id="1316">Now I don't mean to say that that everyone there was, was angelic. </sentence><sentence id="1317">I mean uh, we were human, but by and large, and this is why, you know, when I wrote my first book, to me it was the most important thing to be able to put on that it is all based on truth, I used all names, all places, and I whatever I have written, I always use my maiden name as well as my married name. </sentence><sentence id="1318">I want anyone to challenge the truth of that statement. </sentence><sentence id="1319">Unfortunately so few stories you know survived. </sentence><sentence id="1320">Um, so little has been said about that, you know because the overwhelming thing there of course was uh, was so horrible, and, and when one tries to um, to explain the holocaust, it uh, it is a horror which um, which has the upper hand because such horror has, has never, uh, never been done to, to, to people with so, that somehow what seems to escape are the little acts of kindness, the everyday thing, which, which really spurred the spark of hope that one had to have in order just to go on. </sentence><sentence id="1321">And that was the, and I don't know of anyone who committed suicide. </sentence><sentence id="1322">The camp was surrounded by barbed wire, which was electrically charged. </sentence><sentence id="1323">Not one person that I know of ever went and touched it. </sentence><sentence id="1324">So we certainly had enough reason to, to do it quickly. </sentence><sentence id="1325">No one did. </sentence><sentence id="1326">Everyone wanted to live with, with every fiber of one's being, and I think that was a defiance. </sentence><sentence id="1327">They wanted us dead, but we are going to live for as long as we possibly can. </sentence><sentence id="1328">And we did, and this is why it is so sad, that when one sees pictures of concentration camp, one sees those big vacant eyes over the barbed wire, people who look more like animals than as human beings and no one seems to know what was going on uh in the minds and hearts of the people, that they were looking at something beautiful. </sentence><sentence id="1329">I remember one time, a, a bird flew into camp, and it perched itself on a bunk and started to sing. </sentence><sentence id="1330">No, no one ever had a more appreciative audience than that bird did, and how, how we watched its flight then to freedom over, over the barbed wire and ov-ov-over the camp, and one time in Greenberg, uh, where we also stood for hours roll call. </sentence><sentence id="1331">Uh, one spring, in the corner of this courtyard, the among the debris of the cement, a flower poked its head, and you could see hundreds of feet shuffling around it, nobody stepped on the flower. </sentence><sentence id="1332">It was something incredible to see uh that a flower heralded sort of a new spring of, of, of ----------of beauty. </sentence><sentence id="1333">Now, you know, one should not need uh stay in a concentration camp to appreciation of, of beauty, but, but it was an incredible moment to see that, that many things that one sees for granted. </sentence><sentence id="1334">Um, there were beautiful things there. </sentence><sentence id="1335">Unfortunately, and that is always the biggest pain, that so few lived to know the joy of freedom, and that is the most painful thing. </sentence><sentence id="1336">And sometimes the difficulty to, to enjoy all the things, to know how many were deprived of it. </sentence><sentence id="1337">That's, that's the hardest thing. </sentence><sentence id="1338">But I think if one can somehow give the legacy of the nobility to the inheritance of this new spring and new generation of children and grandchildren, who have grown up in freedom. </sentence><sentence id="1339">If they can understand it and, and value it, then, they have achieved a sort of immortality. </sentence><sentence id="1340">I think this is really why they have to understand something, because it is difficult. </sentence><sentence id="1341">You know, millions, numbers have no meaning. </sentence><sentence id="1342">It's the identification is one that counts, and if, if someone somehow today, and people who live in freedom can take the identity of just one who was deprived of it at all, and live their lives vicariously, and enjoy the things for which, which they have so hungered, I think that uh, that we will build a better world. </sentence><sentence id="1343">And I have hopes for the world in spite of everything. </sentence></p></dialogue>
