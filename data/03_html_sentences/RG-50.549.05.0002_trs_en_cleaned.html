<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="118">Q: Were they friends from school, or from? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="120">A: Well, at the beginning I had Gentile friends, but then when Hitler came to power, they    Sylvia Green 7 January 11, 1996 Page 7 got sparse, less and less friends. </sentence><sentence id="121">And it's really interesting you asking that, I still remember Fritz Oler, we were raised together and I loved Fritz as much as I liked my brother, loved my brother Bernard. </sentence><sentence id="122">And then when Hitler came to power, he disappeared. </sentence><sentence id="123">If we passed on the street, he wouldn't see me. </sentence><sentence id="124">If I passed on the street when it was dark, at that time we used to go out in the evening, at the beginning, later on we didn't go out too much in the evenings, he would look, stare at you like no recognition, but then he would take his hand and wave at you in the back, so he wouldn't been seen. </sentence><sentence id="125">So but that really hurt, because in a way I knew that the reason for it because I was a Jew, but it's very hard for children to accept. </sentence><sentence id="126">You, you take it personally. </sentence><sentence id="127">Because I would cry, I came home and I saw some of the girls I used to play with and they run away.

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="198">Q: What did you think when you were watching these, these speeches and Hitler? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="200">A: I don't know, I really don't, I just was fascinated by that whole thing, it was just like everybody was hypnotized. </sentence><sentence id="201">And his speeches weren't, he didn't say anything, he said three, four words, and then yell, everybody yelled, "Heil Hitler, Heil Hitler." </sentence><sentence id="202">I don't know, as a child, the one thing I remember, he's... always when he came to Karlsruhe, it was a pretty good sized town at that time, the size of Louisville, he would stay in the Hotel Germania, and every time I passed that hotel, I was going to stay there someday. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="715">A: Probably I did, I don't know, we got a meal in Kabelwerk, the interesting thing was that the first time, I always ate kosher and when I started working in Kabelwerk, they served us meals and it was the same meal the Gentile workers got, so that wasn't that bad because it had a lot of vegetables in there, I don't remember about meat now, maybe it did. </sentence><sentence id="716">And I wouldn't eat, I came home and I barely dragged and my dad said, ""What's the matter?" </sentence><sentence id="717">We were still in the ghetto at that time, "What's the matter?" </sentence><sentence id="718">I said, "Dad, I can't eat it, they serving C/rayf." </sentence><sentence id="719">So it must have had meat in there also. </sentence><sentence id="720">And he said, "You have to eat. </sentence><sentence id="721">You have to have strength to survive this. </sentence><sentence id="722">You have to eat." </sentence><sentence id="723">So the next day, I ate and I couldn't keep it down, I was throwing it all up, I came home and I dragged again. </sentence><sentence id="724">I told my dad, I said, "I can't keep it down." </sentence><sentence id="725">He said, "You have to eat. </sentence><sentence id="726">You have to force yourself." </sentence><sentence id="727">And    Sylvia Green 25 January 11, 1996 Page 25 the third day, I was glad to get it. </sentence><sentence id="728">So from that on I started eating trayf and was lucky enough to get it, you know, at that time. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="745">A: No, no. </sentence><sentence id="746">Just my aunt and I and I was promised that I, if I would work in Kabelwerk, that my aunt, my parents would be safe in the ghetto. </sentence><sentence id="747">But naturally, it was broken promises. </sentence><sentence id="748">So the liquidation of the ghetto was March the 13, 1943. </sentence><sentence id="749">And my father got killed in the hospital, Spital. </sentence><sentence id="750">What happened was, every so often in the ghetto, they were rounding up people to send them to concentration camps and he, they rounded him up on the street in the ghetto and he jumped out the window and he fell, he was going to run away and hide somewheres in the ghetto, and he fell, he broke his leg. </sentence><sentence id="751">So this was a makeshift hospital, and they had some Jewish doctors who practiced, I mean they were doctors before the war, and he was in traction and his leg was in traction, it was the last time I saw him. </sentence><sentence id="752">And he was shot in the hospital. </sentence><sentence id="753">Because my cousin saw him, he was in the clean-up crew, and he saw him laying there on the sidewalk and there were pictures of my mother and of me and my brother around him. </sentence><sentence id="754">But I didn't know until I saw "Schindler's List" that they gave them poison, the nurses gave them poison, I did not know that. </sentence><sentence id="755">And I was thankful. </sentence><sentence id="756">Did you see, they were grateful, the patients were grateful to get it. </sentence><sentence id="757">They were even smiling because you heard them downstairs already yelling and screaming, and by the time they came up, they start shooting and they didn't even notice that they were already dead. </sentence><sentence id="758">And I don't know what happened to my mother, I thought my mother might have ended up in one of the concentration camps,    Sylvia Green 26 January 11, 1996 Page 26 but she might have been shot in the ghetto because they were just shooting left and right. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="773">Q: Were you with her up until that day, up until the day of deportation? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="775">A: No, no, no. </sentence><sentence id="776">I was in the Kabelwerk at that time, I mean I was working in Kabelwerk, And after the liquidation of the ghetto, then they built barracks in Kabelwerk and we were there, we were not walking to Plaszow any more. </sentence><sentence id="777">We were concentrated where the factory was. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="781">Q: That was... </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="783">A: That was till about September, this was, I think May, March, "43 until I think, September "43, we were concentrated in the factory where we worked. </sentence><sentence id="784">And that wasn't that bad, the only upsetting thing I still remember is, they supposed to have somebody come from Switzerland, a Red Cross representative come from Switzerland and we had to clean the barracks and we all got a care package, which we had to open but not touch. </sentence><sentence id="785">So when the representative from Switzerland came, he looked around, the barracks were clean and we all talked to him on the side how bad it is, you know. </sentence><sentence id="786">And he was not very sympathetic, he said, "The barracks are clean. </sentence><sentence id="787">Look at the nice care package. </sentence><sentence id="788">What are you complaining?People are getting killed, there is a war going on, you got it good here." </sentence><sentence id="789">So we told him, we said, "We will have to return those, we can't even touch it. </sentence><sentence id="790">The order was to open it up, but not to touch it." </sentence><sentence id="791">And they took those care packages away, but it was so upsetting to us that he didn't believe us, the representative from the Red Cross. </sentence></p></dialogue>
