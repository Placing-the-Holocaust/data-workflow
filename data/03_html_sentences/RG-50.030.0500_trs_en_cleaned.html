<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="6734">A: Individually, and as a Jewish experience. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="6736">Q: So, the people that you met in Cincinnati didn't say what happened? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="6738">A: There was a group of people, of Jews, that came here at the same time, about the same time, with similar experiences. </sentence><sentence id="6739">And I was involved with that group. </sentence><sentence id="6740">One was the friend that, you know, asked me to come, you know, from se -- from New Orleans here. </sentence><sentence id="6741">Where it was by and large not a comfortable group, the same way as my relationship with my husband was not because he was not on my level, and we had very little in common in communicating and talking about things, and -- but that group was the same cut of people. </sentence><sentence id="6742">We were celebrating holidays together, we had parties like, you know, for holidays. </sentence><sentence id="6743">The advantage of being part of the group was one. </sentence><sentence id="6744">We knew about our experiences, and we didn't have to talk about it, where we from. </sentence><sentence id="6745">We all had the same experience, and i-it was just being together, and not to have -- to explain yourself, or listen to explanation. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="6754">Q: Mm-hm. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="6756">A: But then, at the same time that I was contemplating moving away from my husband, my relationship with that group also broke off. </sentence><sentence id="6757">And it was funny and not funny how it did. </sentence><sentence id="6758">You see, that group was strictly Polish Jews of tradition and Jewishness, and patriarchy, and the woman is a woman and I am the man. </sentence><sentence id="6759">You know, in Jewish law, a woman cannot divorce a husband. </sentence><sentence id="6760">The husband always can divorce the woman, to the degree that if there is not a rabbi, he can tell the woman, I divorce you, I divorce you, I divorce you, and that e-equals divorce, when you tell it to the rabbi. </sentence><sentence id="6761">But a woman cannot divorce a man. </sentence><sentence id="6762">I didn't un-understand that for a long time, but then, after I divorced my husband, that wo -- group turned against me, they stopped talking to me. </sentence><sentence id="6763">And I didn't understand why til I became c -- became clear to me that I did do the unspeakable, I divorced a man. </sentence><sentence id="6764">A woman divorced a man. </sentence><sentence id="6765">So I was not sorry about breaking off the relationship, but what made me very angry was realized why it happened. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="6776">Q: Mm-hm. </sentence><sentence id="6777">So is the -- the -- the next -- the next person with whom you actually talk about your experiences Lanzmann? </sentence><sentence id="6778">Because that's in the next couple of years, right? </sentence><sentence id="6779">Or is it -- </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="6780">A: Mm-hm. </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="6781">Q: And once you do that, once you give that interview, do you decide, okay, now I don't have to talk about it again? </sentence><sentence id="6782">Or not? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="6785">A: I don't know, but in the time since my divorce and all that, I was more free to talk with my friends, many of whom were Gentiles, women we got sort of all together with a group of women that we were sort of compatible, and they are all Ge-Gentiles. </sentence><sentence id="6786">And I was free to talk with them about it, or even with other -- other Jews. </sentence><sentence id="6787">But how it happened really, maybe the impetus was the interview with Lanzmann. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="6791">Q: Mm-hm. </sentence><sentence id="6792">Have you spoken to students, or is this all very private? </sentence><sentence id="6793">Or synagogue groups, or church groups, or -- </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="6794">A: No, no -- </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="6795">Q: No, no public -- </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="6796">A: -- Inever wanted to do it. </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="6797">Q: -- no. </sentence><sentence id="6798">You didn't want to do it. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="6801">A: No, no. </sentence><sentence id="6802">I did once in a school, you know, in a public school to a group, to a class, talked about it, and that was very unsatisfactory. </sentence><sentence id="6803">I didn't enjoy it, it was just not my -- </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="6804">Q: It wasn't your cup of tea. </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="6805">A: Ye -- right. </sentence><sentence id="6806">So I didn't. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="6809">Q: Do -- have people in the last 10 years, or m-maybe since the Lanzmann film, do they, when they meet you say -- ask you more questions? </sentence><sentence id="6810">They don't? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="6813">A: No. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="6815">Q: I guess I'm surprised at that. </sentence><sentence id="6816">In the last 10 years? </sentence><sentence id="6817">Not -- </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="6818">A: Be-Because they saw the -- the film? </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="6819">Q: Because they saw the film, or in the last 10 years, I mean, the Holocaust Museum in Washington opened, and then there was "Schindler's List" and there seems to be more discussion about survivors, so I thought perhaps there was more discussion with you as well? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="6821">No. </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="6822">A: No. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="6824">Q: But you s -- you said you -- when you were in the ghetto, that you felt you needed to bear witness, yes? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="6826">A: Mm-hm. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="6828">Q: So how were you going to do that? </sentence><sentence id="6829">I mean, how did you, in your own head, think about ho -- the Lanzmann was accidental, actually -- </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="6830">A: That's right. </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="6831">Q: -- if you hadn't gone up to him. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="6833">A: I didn't have it formulated either in the ghetto, or -- or in Auschwitz to bear witness. </sentence><sentence id="6834">But thought was, you have -- you have to live through, you have to survive, be able to talk about the pa -- because people won't believe if you don't talk about it. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="6837">Q: Right. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="6839">A: They won't believe those stories. </sentence><sentence id="6840">So somebody has to tell how it was. </sentence><sentence id="6841">And I didn't have any concrete things to talk or write about it. </sentence><sentence id="6842">But just to be alive, and show them you didn't -- you know, I was not killed, I was -- </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="6843">Q: Right. </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="6844">A: -- almost done away with, but I am alive. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="6852">A: It was sort of more abstract by -- that was one way. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="6854">Q: Right. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="6856">A: To survive to tell the story. </sentence><sentence id="6857">But very -- in a abstract way. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="6860">Q: So do you talk more with David now, or his seeing the Lanzmann interview ge -- it -- meant he didn't have to ask you so many questions because you said so much in that interview? </sentence></p></dialogue>
