<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="11">Q: And the Dutch, just before this interview when we were talking for a couple minutes, you mentioned that it was a small percentage of the Dutch who, who actually didn't betray Jews. </sentence><sentence id="12">Can you talk a little bit more about, | mean, obviously that's how you survived, right? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="15">A: Was because we were not betrayed. </sentence><sentence id="16">| need to stress, I, what, what my sense about Holland during the war was based on, based on history, basically, data and in retrospect, is that there was a small percentage perhaps five, five percent, if that many who actively tried to help Jews if, I'm not sure there were that many, who were, who risked their own lives. </sentence><sentence id="17">And they were truly the noble, the very noble people, because it's hard to ask people to do that for others. </sentence><sentence id="18">So, about five percent perhaps that, I'm not even sure it was, were that many, that actually, actively did something. </sentence><sentence id="19">My feeling is that 80 percent didn't care. </sentence><sentence id="20">I'm not saying that they would have betrayed but also that they didn't care. </sentence><sentence id="21">But we had a significant, | would say fifty to twenty percent who were traitors. </sentence><sentence id="22">A huge percentage that were part of the, they belonged to the NS Bay(ph) which is the National Socialist Party, actively, who actively worked with the, with the Nazis, with the Germans and betrayed Jews. </sentence><sentence id="23">Most Dutch Jews probably were betrayed by Dutch rather than those were in hiding.| think they, they said something like 35,000 were in hiding, 15,000 were betrayed. </sentence><sentence id="24"> ontactrefieannedjustanmiang er hither btemelortabnattfiexaliaton Anita Frank 4 [Date not labeled] Page 4 That's a significant number. </sentence><sentence id="25">Probably mostly by the Dutch. </sentence><sentence id="26">Dutch people who got a few dollars for it, a few guilders which the Dutch thing. </sentence><sentence id="27">They got guilders so each person had a, had a monetary value attached. </sentence><sentence id="28">And Holland only now is coming to terms with the fact that as a, as a people, they were not, they were not all that, | hate to say this, they were not all that different from the German people in that a lot of them just turned their heads. </sentence><sentence id="29">Most just turned their heads, let it happen. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="50">Q: What were her thoughts? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="52">A: Well, she was truly one of the extraordinary heroines, a remarkable woman who, because of her background, the Quaker background, she was British, one of the Cadbury(ph) families. </sentence><sentence id="53">She couldn't tolerate what was happening. </sentence><sentence id="54">From the very beginning, she couldn't tolerate this kind of injustice and absolutely, absolutely made it part of her, her life, her commitment to save as many as she could. </sentence><sentence id="55">And this was who she was. _ </sentence><sentence id="56">This was her, her mission in life and that's what | gather, was true for most of the rescuers. </sentence><sentence id="57">They saw something happening that was so intolerable to them that, that they could not live with themselves and let this, let this happen to others. </sentence><sentence id="58">And they, they, they basically did what they, they did what they did because they couldn't do anything else. </sentence><sentence id="59">Those are the rescuers. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="68">Q: How many people did she save, do you think? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="70">A: Oh, she, tens | would say because, | didn't realize there were other Jewish children in the house, course we didn't know that there were. </sentence><sentence id="71">But there were others, she hid  ontactrefieannedjustanmiang er hither btemelortabnattfiexaliaton Anita Frank 5 [Date not labeled] Page 5 other Jews and helped others to hide others and there was a whole system the she and her husband Case(ph) created. </sentence><sentence id="72">They, they. </sentence><sentence id="73">there was a group of Jewish children living close by that they took care of and tried to save. </sentence><sentence id="74">So they, throughout the war, went out of their way to, to save, to save Jewish children. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="104">A: Yeah. </sentence><sentence id="105">Oh yeah, they endangered themselves, the Bookas(ph) endangered, anybody who hid Jews endangered themselves. </sentence><sentence id="106">And the family, it was interesting cause | just spent, as | said, we were in Holland in April, just, just a few months ago and | spent quite a bit of time with the daughters, three of the daughters of the Booka family. </sentence><sentence id="107">And | asked them if they knew we were Jewish and you know what? </sentence><sentence id="108">They  ontactrefieannedjustanmiang er hither btemelortabnattfiexaliaton Anita Frank 6 [Date not labeled] Page 6 really didn't. </sentence><sentence id="109">They, it wasn't discussed, it was never discussed. </sentence><sentence id="110">They just knew that they, that they had to help hide people. </sentence><sentence id="111">But it was all, it was all hidden and it was just part of their, of their ethic that they would not cooperate and collaborate with the Nazis and they would do what they could to help those in need. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="120">Q: Do you think Betty and Case(ph) didn't tell them just, to not give them information that they might betray by mistake? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="122">A: Right. </sentence><sentence id="123">Nottoimplicate. </sentence><sentence id="124">Right. </sentence><sentence id="125">And it was Betty by the way, it was, in retrospect, it was Betty who insisted doing this, not Case(ph). </sentence><sentence id="126">| don't know, we're not even sure Case(ph) knew we were Jewish, because they took in other children. </sentence><sentence id="127">It was Betty who did it. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="134">Q: What kind of woman was she? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="136">A: Extraordinary, a gentle, little, beautiful, sweetest face in the world, kind, caring, concerned, loving, extraordinary woman who, who just, she couldn't do anything different. </sentence><sentence id="137">And we stayed in close touch with her after the war and she came to visit us and whenever we went back to Holland, of course, we visited her until she died. </sentence><sentence id="138">And, and the interesting thing about her is, she was so concerned about others that in some way, she neglected her own children. </sentence><sentence id="139">She had eight children, they had eight children themselves and, and that, you see that often in those who are truly committed to the well-being of others that, very often, there is some, you, you sort of assume your own children will manage. </sentence><sentence id="140">So | think, |, | think there's some bitterness there now, among her children. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="146">Q: You sense that when you talk to them? </sentence><sentence id="147"> ontactrefieannedjustanmiang er hither btemelortabnattfiexaliaton Anita Frank 7 [Date not labeled] Page 7 </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="148">A: Yeah. </sentence><sentence id="149">Yeah, they admired her, they loved her very much but | still have a real sense that they themselves did not probably, did not get what they needed because Betty was so concerned for, for others. </sentence><sentence id="150">You only have so much energy. </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="151">Q: Did you ever see her show emotion during the war over the situation? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="153">A: No. </sentence><sentence id="154">No, because basically we were told never to tell anybody and so, we didn't except those little lapses. </sentence><sentence id="155">And | didn't even know that she knew we were Jewish. </sentence><sentence id="156">| can remember, and that was, that was just the whole thing that | was so torn up about. </sentence><sentence id="157">| mean, we were told never to tell anybody, so as far as we were concerned, we were non-Jewish children living with these people and | had no idea who knew and who didn't know. </sentence><sentence id="158">So | couldn't tell anybody. </sentence><sentence id="159">So it was that, that horrendous fear of being discovered that stayed with me and the inability to talk to anybody about it, for two years. </sentence><sentence id="160">So all! </sentence><sentence id="161">knew was that we had to be there because we'd be killed but | did not know that Betty knew we were Jewish. </sentence><sentence id="162">It turned out she did but really, most others didn't, in the family. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="173">Q: Have you seen any of the other children who stayed in that house at that time? </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="207">Q: Can you elaborate on that please? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="209">A: It was my mother, my father admitted that he was in total despair at times and that when they were in hiding in Falkenburg, well in the first place, she saved my father's life by taking the, | talked about that on the tape, taking the Cross of Merit to the, that her father had earned in World War | to the German commander of our town. </sentence><sentence id="210">And who in effect excused my father from that transport where they took first, they first took the men to, totally debilitate the families. </sentence><sentence id="211">And so she did that and then my father  ontactrefieannedjustanmiang er hither btemelortabnattfiexaliaton Anita Frank 9 [Date not labeled] Page 9 said many times that during the war, when in effect the, the police would come and when in effect they were told to produce papers that they couldn't produce, and when in effect these threats were made of transporting us, of, of interrogating us on the train because they notified my parents this might happen, that my father said she, he would just be in despair and my mother just would support him and encourage him and say, "No, let's, lets go and see what we can do and let's contact Frompinksteron(ph) but be careful about it," and she just, she just, she just is the one who, who persevered. </sentence><sentence id="212">She's the one who said to Pete, this policeman, "Pete, you don't want to know these questions, don't ask us." </sentence><sentence id="213">| mean, she would come up, it's almost like her intuition allowed her to do the right things at the right time. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="219">Q: Because that was dangerous. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="221">A: Exceedingly dangerous. </sentence><sentence id="222">It would have been the end of it again. </sentence><sentence id="223">I, had he been with the Nazi, the NS Bay(ph), that would have been the end of the family. </sentence><sentence id="224">But she took risks, somehow almost intuitively knowing what was to, at the same time, she didn't want him to continue asking because she did not want him to know this information. </sentence><sentence id="225">So it was just amazing. </sentence></p></dialogue>

you asked, you asked why, how, how was Hitler possible and, and | just, as | said we had answers to that, we'd know better. </sentence><sentence id="1004">But! </sentence><sentence id="1005">mean |, when | put in context is, is we have had two years, two thousand years, perhaps that's a little bit, no, really two thousand of unmitigated anti-Semitism in, in, in Europe, perhaps 1500. </sentence><sentence id="1006">Bult, certainly, the Crusades, the, the Inquisition in Spain, | mean, blaming Jews for the plague. </sentence><sentence id="1007">| mean it, all you have to do is go through European history and if you look at the Bible, this increasing anti-Semitism, this, this hatred of Jews. </sentence><sentence id="1008">You see that developing in the Bible, it wasn't, that was not the original, the original disciples were not, they were Jews themselves. </sentence><sentence id="1009">But you see, as, as Rome became Christian, they of course had to, to blame Jesus" death, not on the, the, the, the Romans but they had to blame it on the Jews. </sentence><sentence id="1010">And you see this shift, this shift in the Bible itself to an increasingly more anti-Semitic perspective about Jews as Christ killers. </sentence><sentence id="1011">And that became the great montra(ph) in, in European Christianity. </sentence><sentence id="1012">Both Catholicism, Lutheranism is Jews the Christ killers, Jews the blood-suckers, the Jews the Damned, Jews are not gonna go to heaven, it's only the select Christians who somehow have got the one right answer who are gonna go, who are gonna go to heaven. </sentence><sentence id="1013">And so you have the dominant religion which of course Christianity is, in, in Europe. </sentence><sentence id="1014">You've got the dominant religion saying of another group of people that they're damned and they're gonna go to hell and they're, they suck the blood of Christian children. </sentence><sentence id="1015">It becomes, they become the, the Jews, the dirty Jews, the ones, the dangerous people and then of course with the, with the Christians curtailing the  ontactrefieannedjustanmiang er hither btemelortabnattfiexaliaton Anita Frank 33 [Date not labeled] Page 33 Jewish, the Jewish, the possibility for Jews, jobs, professions and so on, were in a, in effect, Jews can only be, they could lend money because it was dirty for Christians to lend money. </sentence><sentence id="1016">So they could do the dirty jobs. </sentence><sentence id="1017">And then Jews become successful there, they're being killed because they did. </sentence><sentence id="1018">They became the money lenders and you have Shakespeare and Merchant of Venice and Charlotan(ph), that perpetrating those horrors. </sentence><sentence id="1019">And, and so you've got a whole culture of anti-Semitism which was, you have it in France with the Dryfuss(ph) Affair, | mean you have it all through Europe. </sentence><sentence id="1020">In, in eastern Europe with the progroms, you have it all through Europe throughout with intermittent periods where in effect certain rulers(ph) who'd be tolerant of the Jews because they could use them. </sentence><sentence id="1021">So it wasn't unmitigated, | mean it wasn't totally consistent but it certainly was consistent over time with periods of, of, of some, of some allowance to, to let Jews live their lives and flourish. </sentence><sentence id="1022">And | must say that's where Holland has had us, on the whole, a, a better history, not perfect but certainly a better history of tolerance for Jews because they did allow the Sofottic(ph) Jews with the Inquisition to come to Holland and Holland has had a relatively, extraodinarily wonderful history of, of religious freedom. </sentence><sentence id="1023">And has allowed its Jews to live in relative peace. </sentence><sentence id="1024">But in Germany, Germany with all of its, its effort that becoming a nation-state which it didn't become until Bismarck with all of its in-fighting and then, and, and a population which is the same as in Holland, this, this, a population that has as its dogma the Christian belief that if you just, the Calvinistic belief if, if you just do everything right and you follow God's word and you do it, then good things are gonna come to you. </sentence><sentence id="1025">And that basically, you obey. </sentence><sentence id="1026">It's very  ontactrefieannedjustanmiang er hither btemelortabnattfiexaliaton Anita Frank 34 [Date not labeled] Page 34 important to do what you're told, not to question this sort of authoritarian, sort of ethic of, of, of children must listen to their parents, children must obey, children must not question. </sentence><sentence id="1027">Father knows best. </sentence><sentence id="1028">So you've got this, this sort of a cultural pattern of not questioning what goes on, a religious pattern of, if something bad happens to people, they deserve it. </sentence><sentence id="1029">And then a historical pattern of extreme anti-Semitism, then you've got this great combination that when things go bad, as of course Hitler came to power after this horrendous inflation, well, first the defeat for Germany in World War | which was a horrendous blow to their morale and then, this, this terrible inflation that impoverished millions of people. </sentence><sentence id="1030">What you do is you find a scapegoat. </sentence><sentence id="1031">And Hitler, Hitler was always a rabid anti-Semite. </sentence><sentence id="1032">But people become very vulnerable to, becoming comfortable to, yes, it's all the Jews" fault. </sentence><sentence id="1033">Blame somebody else, | mean we do it in this country all the time, is blaming somebody else. </sentence><sentence id="1034">Blame the immigrants. </sentence><sentence id="1035">Blame, blame the illegal aliens. </sentence><sentence id="1036">Blame everybody. </sentence><sentence id="1037">Even blame outside terrorists when we're breeding our own terrorists. </sentence><sentence id="1038">We have the militia who is so dangerous here. </sentence><sentence id="1039">So you blame, you start blaming others. </sentence><sentence id="1040">And then everybody else is doing it and it becomes really comfortable and then you obey orders and you don't question and you become self-satisfied and smug because things are getting better. </sentence><sentence id="1041">It's not, not difficult then to understand the Jews, the traditional scapegoat in Europe became an obvious scapegoat here. </sentence><sentence id="1042">And then with German propaganda, they did an unbelievable job of painting Jews as rats. </sentence><sentence id="1043">As vermin. </sentence><sentence id="1044">Destroying the fiber of the great Aryan nation. </sentence><sentence id="1045">And that propaganda is, is staggering, you see some of those propaganda films. </sentence><sentence id="1046">So you put all that together, it's  ontactrefieannedjustanmiang er hither btemelortabnattfiexaliaton Anita Frank 35 [Date not labeled] Page 35 not surprising. </sentence><sentence id="1047">It's not difficult to make people hate others. </sentence><sentence id="1048">And that's why for me, questioning, always questioning, never accepting what people tell you without really examining the validity of any of it and never allowing others to dictate your moral stands. </sentence><sentence id="1049">It's just so vital. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2086">Q: It also sounds good on the level that | interviewed a doctor for a story | was working on recently and he said, "People don't realize how prone physicians are to problems; drug problems, stress, enormous, enormous stress." </sentence><sentence id="2087">So it sounds like perhaps this gives them some tools to work on their problems too. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2090">A: Yes. </sentence><sentence id="2091">Verynice. </sentence><sentence id="2092">Yes. </sentence><sentence id="2093">Because we expect physicians to be super-human. </sentence><sentence id="2094">And they're just people, bright people on the whole, and caring people on the whole. </sentence><sentence id="2095">But that's all they are. </sentence><sentence id="2096">And one of the great tragedies is is that in the traditional approach, our physicians are taught, it becomes, because they tend to be obsessive- compulsive, they tend to be perfectionists, they tend to be hard-driven and so on. </sentence><sentence id="2097">What they want to do is they want to fix things. </sentence><sentence id="2098">And they're happy when they can fix something. </sentence><sentence id="2099">And when they can't fix something, they get very unhappy and very stressed and so what happens very often is that, particularly during the dying process when they can't do anymore for a patient, they abandon the patient. </sentence><sentence id="2100">Because they can't do anymore. </sentence><sentence id="2101">And so you see this avoidance behavior. </sentence><sentence id="2102">That's because  https://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection Anita Frank 64 [Date not labeled] Page 64 they're uncomfortable. </sentence><sentence id="2103">They can't, they can't fix, the other focus for me is is that there is very little fixing you guys can do. </sentence><sentence id="2104">If you're lucky you can cut out a, you can cure a bacterial illness with some antibiotics and you can cut out a cancer and you can do, you can do some other things that truly fix things. </sentence><sentence id="2105">But most of the time, it isn't as simple as that. </sentence><sentence id="2106">Most of the time you just have to learn to work with your patient to make it as, to make it better. </sentence><sentence id="2107">But that means you need to be in partnership with your patient. </sentence><sentence id="2108">And don't worry so much about fixing it. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3234">Q: Did you let him know how he was doing as he went along? </sentence><sentence id="3235">Did you say, when he spoke his first word did you say good, Loren(ph), you're a month ahead of schedule? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3238">A: No, but it was very clear to me from the very beginning that he clearly was a very bright child so | was a very proud obnoxious mother, I'm afraid. </sentence><sentence id="3239">He, and | encouraged that enormously, interesting. </sentence><sentence id="3240">That's certainly part of my heritage is that | didn't care if he was an athlete or not, at all. </sentence><sentence id="3241">| couldn't have cared less. </sentence><sentence id="3242">What | did care about was his intellectual development. </sentence><sentence id="3243">And if he had wanted to punish me all he would have had to do is flunk out of school. </sentence><sentence id="3244">Because forme, education has been the absolutely essential ingredient for taking control of life and, and so when he was developing into this incredibly delightful bright kid, End of Tape 3. </sentence><sentence id="3245"> ontactrefieannedjustanmiang er hither btemelortabnattfiexaliaton Anita Frank 93 [Date not labeled] Page 93 Tape 4 </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3269">Q: Okay. </sentence><sentence id="3270">Let's see. </sentence><sentence id="3271">| think that might be, oh, |, just | think this is it but 1, | wanted to just ask you to talk about something we talked about before we started the tape and that was your, what you like about America being a self-examining society of sorts. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="3275">Would you mind ending with that? </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3276">A: Yeah. </sentence><sentence id="3277">Well, | think that, that's really significant from my perspective and that is that one of the great blessings from my perspective about this country is, is that we've made a lot of mistakes. </sentence><sentence id="3278">You and | talked a little bit before we put the tape on, we talked a little bit about America's role during the war and the fact that the State Department had lots of anti-Semites in it and, and that this country knew, the government knew was happening to Jews and didn't do anything. </sentence><sentence id="3279">That | think Roosevelt tried, there, absolutely no support for it, that the Jewish Underground begged the British and Americans who bombed the rail lines and the concentration camps and that, there were no bombs available or some excuses were given why  ontactrefieannedjustanmiang er hither btemelortabnattfiexaliaton Anita Frank 94 [Date not labeled] Page 94 that couldn't be done. </sentence><sentence id="3280">And how many lives could have been saved if, if some relatively simple measures had been taken. </sentence><sentence id="3281">And that then of course then America invited all these Nazis, these Nazi scientists, Gunter(ph), what is it, Gunter von Braun(ph), that was the guy, to come to America and, and to work on the weapons programs here. </sentence><sentence id="3282">And we've hidden, | mean, we still, we're discovering Nazis left and right still. </sentence><sentence id="3283">It's pretty late now. </sentence><sentence id="3284">So | think this, and of course the, the horror of not letting the Jews and the, they, they, the ones who left Hamburg | think or Bramen(ph) on the, the ship, St. Louis and they were refused entry here and had to go back to an, to Germany or taken to the gas chamber. </sentence><sentence id="3285">So, this country has no, has not an unblemished record, far from it in many ways. </sentence><sentence id="3286">And that is | think, true in Europe. </sentence><sentence id="3287">|, |, | think there isn't, Denmark perhaps, Denmark really had a small number of Jews and they, the king as a leader, behaved nobly and its population followed. </sentence><sentence id="3288">They, as a country, get a lot of credit. </sentence><sentence id="3289">And, and |, | expect the, | accept the fact that we all make mistakes but what! </sentence><sentence id="3290">cannot accept is that we don't acknowledge our mistakes.| think one of the great blessings of this country is, is we, we allow, we encourage ourselves to examine our past and our policies and our history and we, there is a lot of self-criticism going on. </sentence><sentence id="3291">And there is a lot of, we have a lot of controversy and we have a lot of people who have courage to examine the past and to look at the past and to say this is where we went wrong or this is where we didn't behave appropriately. </sentence><sentence id="3292">And one of the things that has been so missing in Europe has been that honest self-examination. </sentence><sentence id="3293">And, and you even know it, you go to the museum in Paris, the war museum and the, the, the kind of sickening chauvinism of the French  ontactrefieannedjustanmiang er hither btemelortabnattfiexaliaton Anita Frank 95 [Date not labeled] Page 95 is just enough to, to appall anybody. </sentence><sentence id="3294">And that is a, if you look at their museum, it's as if Charles de Gaulle(ph) won the war. </sentence><sentence id="3295">There is absolutely nothing about French treachery. </sentence><sentence id="3296">There's nothing about French cooperation with the Nazis. </sentence><sentence id="3297">There's nothing about the police's happy cooperation, rounding of the Jews and betraying Jews, there is nothing of that in France. </sentence><sentence id="3298">Only now are they coming to terms with it. </sentence><sentence id="3299">In Holland also, Holland is better. </sentence><sentence id="3300">It's now beginning to examine its past but it's taken them so long. </sentence><sentence id="3301">For the longest time Holland had this, whenever | talked about Holland not having been so, such a glorious country during the war, people said surprised, "Oh, | thought they were so noble." </sentence><sentence id="3302">Cause Holland fostered that. </sentence><sentence id="3303">We the noble Dutch, we resisted the Nazis. </sentence><sentence id="3304">Well they didn't. </sentence><sentence id="3305">Some did. </sentence><sentence id="3306">Butno whole population can take credit for the enormous courage of a few and, and so, to me, one of the great poisonous, and, and | must admit | think that's where western Germany has, has done a relatively good job is they have a significant number of people who, who are aware of how vital it's been to examine their past. </sentence><sentence id="3307">But overall, it's taken them a long time, too. </sentence><sentence id="3308">And where in eastern Germany, this hasn't happened at all. </sentence><sentence id="3309">And where you see these, these fascist movements rising. </sentence><sentence id="3310">You see it in France, you see it in Germany. </sentence><sentence id="3311">It's, it's scary to me. </sentence><sentence id="3312">And so, from my perspective that's something that we never must stop doing. </sentence><sentence id="3313">We need to always reexamine our past. </sentence><sentence id="3314">We need to learn from history and we need to be critical of ourselves and we need to learn and | applaud this country that, that looks at itself and says, you know what, that stank. </sentence><sentence id="3315">That was no good. </sentence><sentence id="3316">Many of us, it takes a long while to change, but this is, this is a country that we had McCarthy, that fascist in the fifties, Joseph McCarthy. </sentence><sentence id="3317"> ontactrefieannedjustanmiang er hither btemelortabnattfiexaliaton Anita Frank 96 [Date not labeled] Page 96 Eventually, he was brought down. </sentence><sentence id="3318">Eventually, we had people of courage who, who brought him down even while this country was scared. </sentence><sentence id="3319">And we need to make sure that we never give rise to other fascists like him who will happily destroy whole people because of this irrational fear of, then it was Communism, infiltration of the Red Menace, and it's just, it's just dangerous. </sentence><sentence id="3320">And so allowing dissent and allowing disagreement and examining ourselves all the time, | think is what's gonna keep this country on a reasonably healthy path. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3373">Q: And at least acceptance that terrible persecution has occurred and recognizing that that was a mistake. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3375">A: Oh, oh you mean in its own history. </sentence><sentence id="3376">Oh sure, | mean slavery and the Japanese. </sentence><sentence id="3377">Yes, | mean terrible, terrible things have happened in this country. </sentence><sentence id="3378">Without question. </sentence><sentence id="3379">And, and but the critical, it wouldn't, that would be even worse if we didn't acknowledge our horrendous mistakes and try to make sure that those things don't happen again. </sentence><sentence id="3380">And that doesn't mean that we're not gonna continue to have misery and racism because I'm not that optimistic about people to be very honest. </sentence><sentence id="3381">I'm just not. </sentence><sentence id="3382">But | think that's where our government needs to take strong stands about people's individual rights and privileges and responsibilities. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3391">Q: Does it scare you at all when you see some of the recent terrorist bombings of say the Olympics and the airliner and so on that then civil liberties will be curbed to try to protect the population at large? </sentence><sentence id="3392">Are there any possible innocent victims? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3395">A: Yeah, that's such a interesting question. </sentence><sentence id="3396">To be honest, | see no infringement of my rights if there're gonna be tracers in these fertilizer things. </sentence><sentence id="3397">That, as far as I'm  ontactrefieannedjustanmiang er hither btemelortabnattfiexaliaton Anita Frank 97 [Date not labeled] Page 97 concerned, is only sensible. </sentence><sentence id="3398">And to put taps on phones of suspected terrorists, that doesn't, we can exaggerate those potential dangers. </sentence><sentence id="3399">And that's something that really bothers me. </sentence><sentence id="3400">You can look at everything and, and make a huge case out of it and say what if, if, if, yes and as a result you can immobilize people to do absolutely nothing. </sentence><sentence id="3401">And so | think we need to be at all times careful that we, that we preserve our liberties but there's also something like the common good. </sentence><sentence id="3402">And we must at all times weigh the common good against the protection of individual liberties. </sentence><sentence id="3403">And | don't think it's just a one-way street. </sentence><sentence id="3404">|, | have a firm commitment to the common good, also, and to my, in my opinion, and that's why with gun-control, | am so strongly for gun-control. </sentence><sentence id="3405">| just, just that, this society is so violent and you see it, you see these 12 year old killing each other and killing others. </sentence><sentence id="3406">It's just, it's insanity to, to scream about, from my perspective, about everybody's right to, to bear guns versus the, the community's rights to some, to a sense of safety. </sentence><sentence id="3407">So again, a balance never, | see that generally is the answer to most of life's problems is to find a balance that takes into account both the common and individual rights. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3421">Q: And that will be continued forever, all those discussions of balance. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3423">A: Yeah, yeah. </sentence></p></dialogue>
