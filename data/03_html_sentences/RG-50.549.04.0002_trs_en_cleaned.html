<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="70">Q: Do you remember -- not the book so much, but do you remember parts of stories that they told you when you were a youngster, when you go back -- not now, but -- but then, when you were maybe, I don't know, five or six or something? </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="118">A: I don't talk about my own thoughts on the Holocaust because I'm not sure there's so much room in that aspect, I think it's an atrocity. </sentence><sentence id="119">If I ever had a friend,    Interview with Dustin Dezube deg December 7, 2000 which I haven't, but if someone made light of it, then I would. </sentence><sentence id="120">I do talk about my grandparents because, as I mentioned earlier, they're just spectacular people. </sentence><sentence id="121">I used to brag to my best friend about how many languages they spoke, and how they -- they have a very rich past, rich life. </sentence><sentence id="122">They're very impressive and I admire them for that, and I've bragged countless of times. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="154">A: To be honest, I think that as they were my friends that I was telling these to, they were meant to be more entertaining. </sentence><sentence id="155">I was younger then. </sentence><sentence id="156">I don't think that it    Interview with Dustin Dezube deg December 7, 2000 would have been proper conversation material if I started going into the severity of the Holocaust. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="160">Q: Did it also feel sort of private because it was something that affected your grandparent's life very, very much? </sentence><sentence id="161">Do you feel like a little bit, protecting that part, or is that over interpreting? </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="172">Q: Do you -- have you sort of -- do you feel that your -- your mother's experience with those -- with that -- with her parents was -- was -- and hearing the stories was a little different than your own? </sentence><sentence id="173">Did you -- is there sort of a difference that you see? </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="192">Q: What does it mean for you to be Jewish? </sentence><sentence id="193">What -- </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="194">A: To be Jewish is, for me it's my identity and for me it's more a part of me than a religious aspect, it's more a way of life and a sense of pride in my identity, like I would say that I'm Jewish not because I believe in all the aspects of Judaism. </sentence><sentence id="195">I don't keep kashrut and I don't pray three times a day. </sentence><sentence id="196">And I'm not absolutely the   ontactrefiranneGaushariarg a hither atrmedortabeattfiexaliaton </sentence></p></dialogue>
