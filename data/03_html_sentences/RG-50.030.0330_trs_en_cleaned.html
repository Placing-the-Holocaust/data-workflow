<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="820">A: Also in Denmark. </sentence><sentence id="821">Less perhaps because there were fewer, but it has in the middle ages something to do with history that the Jews killed Jesus, and that is not true. </sentence><sentence id="822">They didn't kill him. </sentence><sentence id="823">When the Jews killed people they stoned them. </sentence><sentence id="824">When the Romans killed people they had different methods, but one was crucification. </sentence><sentence id="825">In that way you can see it was not the Jews, but the Romans who killed Jesus. </sentence><sentence id="826">Jesus, was after all, a Jew. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="912">Q: What was that long knives night? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="914">A: That was when people killed the people who helped the Germans, especially what we called , in English, informers. </sentence><sentence id="915">If we had not had this sentence many informers had been killed by the resistance people. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="918">Q: How many collaborators were sentenced to death? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="920">A: I think about 90 were sentenced to death and about half of them were executed because in the summer of "45 it was necessary if people should not do it themselves without judgment but already in the autumn of "45 it was not like that. </sentence><sentence id="921">As a matter of fact we were against death sentences and nobody was killed after that. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="924">Q: Why were you against that? </sentence><sentence id="925"> 8 </sentence></p></dialogue>
