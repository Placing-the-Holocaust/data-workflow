<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3">Q: Before we get into some of the specific battles, I wanted to ask you a few general questions about when you were with the partisans. </sentence><sentence id="4">It seemed like there were a lot of different groups. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="7">How coordinated were you all? </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="8">A: Talking about 1943, at that particular time, there was a total coordination. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="10">Q: You mean, when the Soviets came in? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="12">A: I mean, when we had contact with Moscow. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="14">Q: Prior to that? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="16">A: But prior to that, there were a lot of groups on their own. </sentence><sentence id="17">Be that they were fighting for the same cause, when I mean the same cause, I mean that there were Soviet partisans. </sentence><sentence id="18">Or at the same time, there were other type of partisans which I had before mentioned. </sentence><sentence id="19">We used to call them "the white." </sentence><sentence id="20">When we talk about Soviets, we always talk about red, so, therefore, the white Poles, for instance, those were Polish partisans who were against the Soviets, while they also were against the Nazis. </sentence><sentence id="21">And to top it all off, they also were against the Jews. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="28">Q: This is the AK? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="30">A: That was the AK, which is called Army Krajowa. </sentence><sentence id="31">In other words, the land army or nationalist army, which they were. </sentence><sentence id="32">And they really had, to the best of my knowledge, they were very much supported from London, England. </sentence><sentence id="33">That they were, because Chechovky (ph) was one of them, which it was the former marshal sort of in Poland. </sentence><sentence id="34">And there were people who were -- the Polish, who were saved from the outbreak of war who retreated to England. </sentence><sentence id="35">And from there they sort of carried on a certain amount of work. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="42">Q: You had contact with them? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="44">A: Well, we had contact with them, be that we, that we got some of their guys sort of by way of surrounding them and knowing what was going on. </sentence><sentence id="45">It was our job to know who the enemy was. </sentence><sentence id="46">And really who the enemy was, besides the Germans, was a big story to tell about it, because they had implants in all of these here ways in order for them to know what's going on. </sentence><sentence id="47">And every once in a while, as I aforementioned in my other chapters, was that we located some prisoners. </sentence><sentence id="48">We found prisoners who sort of came -- we knew there were many POWs who joined the ranks of the partisans that were specific spies, German spies, implants. </sentence><sentence id="49">And we learned how to discover the way they were signified by the Nazis. </sentence><sentence id="50">They would have a tatoo maybe underneath the arm just like the Gestapo would have. </sentence><sentence id="51">And some of them, which for hiding purposes, when we started to undress them, we found maps that they were carrying with them. </sentence><sentence id="52">And we knew that a guy who escapes a Prisoner of War Camp is not  equipped with a map, and he's not equipped with a compass or anything like that because that would have been foolish to think. </sentence><sentence id="53">So that suspicion -- and believe me, we made them talk. </sentence><sentence id="54">The command made them talk, and this is how we knew of the various groups. </sentence><sentence id="55">Before going too long, I would like to mention at this point here that my wife lost a brother to one of these here AK types you already identified them by their name, or I call them the National Polish Partisan Group. </sentence><sentence id="56">But he and another young kid -- they both were of the age of 14, 15, and their best job to be invisible at their work is because they were kids. </sentence><sentence id="57">And their job used to be more to go, as we call them, to the trains. </sentence><sentence id="58">They would look through main rails, and those kids, they were not so visible -- and plant a mine over there and then go off. </sentence><sentence id="59">And then there would be other explosions. </sentence><sentence id="60">They were caught by this, which it was on the other side of Niemen, as we called it. </sentence><sentence id="61">The other side of the river. </sentence><sentence id="62">And they were caught up, and needless to say, that they were immediately recognized to be Jews. </sentence><sentence id="63">And for that reason alone, they were killed and shot. </sentence><sentence id="64">Nothing else, you know. </sentence><sentence id="65">So first their being kids. </sentence><sentence id="66">Second, they were partisans, maybe the priority would have been Jews -- that they were Jewish, and that's what it was. </sentence><sentence id="67">So evidence like this, it was known to us. </sentence><sentence id="68">As I will enter a little bit later, telling you on one time that we were purposely sent like masqueraded in disguise of the Polish partisans because our command definitely wanted to implant partisans on the other side of the Niemen near Grodno and we were on a search missions, which I will tell it when I come to this part of talking about , yes. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="94">Q: What I'm trying to understand is that -- there were different groups that were Soviet partisans. </sentence><sentence id="95">Before everything was coordinated through Moscow, was there any order to this? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="98">Was there any coordination? </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="99">A: It was coordination that a command would meet sometimes together and talk about certain work and plans, if it was planned a coordinated attack. </sentence><sentence id="100">So this guy would be on flanked, and this partisan would use so many men, the other one. </sentence><sentence id="101">So to say that there was coordination, yes. </sentence><sentence id="102">But it wasn't the kind of coordination by command and so on. </sentence><sentence id="103">In other words, a staff was organized in 1943 before we made full contact with the paratroopers that were sent to us. </sentence><sentence id="104">Because at the same time, which I must tell you, in that same year a little bit later, drops from planes through the night became visible even in our area, while before it used to be just in the big forest. </sentence><sentence id="105">But they would drop to us supplies, and with these supplies came messages, and so on in the same way. </sentence><sentence id="106">The supplies were weapons mostly. </sentence><sentence id="107">Not so much that it was of foodstuff or anything like that, but that was -- and later on in "43, we had radio operators with us who were in constant contact with Moscow, as well as the other outposts of staff. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="117">Q: While we're on this, well, you might as well tell me how things changed in "43, because this seems to be where we're headed. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="119">A: Well, I touched base in earlier part, but here specifically, for instance, when we're talking about the attack, where we attacked the garrison in Ruda Slaska. </sentence><sentence id="120">This was already an organized from all, because the participation was flanked by all the partisans in maybe located in 30-mile distance -- 30 mile, I mean square mile -- throughout all the forest. </sentence><sentence id="121">But various groups were brought in, be that they were ambushed, be they were in the fighting,  and it was a real preplanned because for the first time, we were shown off at that time a Panzer truck and we were shown up at that particular time -- that Panzer truck drove in in the vicinity nearby. </sentence><sentence id="122">Not exactly. </sentence><sentence id="123">And the first shot was fired from a cannon, which it was something again hard to believe that we mustered that, but it was done because we heard originally before attack that they built up bunkers. </sentence><sentence id="124">Now, to specify who they are, which is found on the map, that would have been on the main road. </sentence><sentence id="125">The main road we're talking about was a dirt road going through the forest. </sentence><sentence id="126">It was not a real road to the extent of the woods road, what we mean. </sentence><sentence id="127">And it was leading between the between towards Gotha, Osweja, and from there you used to go to Lida. </sentence><sentence id="128">So, in other words, it was all dividing the forest with that road. </sentence><sentence id="129">And there settlements away from the road, not too far, where farmers used to have their farms. </sentence><sentence id="130">And mostly the soil over there was not too good for other than to grow potatoes on. </sentence><sentence id="131">So these farmers, their livelihood came in normal times that they used to work in the forest, be lumberjacks, or so on. </sentence><sentence id="132">In Ruda Slaska, there was also plains where they used to make turpentine and tar, which it was again a derivative from this here pine trees that were growing over there. </sentence><sentence id="133">So that was implied a good way for us to make that we could sort of the forest -- we were all limited for miles and miles away, without roads. </sentence><sentence id="134">That was the main important issue to talk about. </sentence><sentence id="135">There was only one leading road, and that road was in Ruda Slaska. </sentence><sentence id="136">And, as I said preceding this here chapter, while I was speaking of the attack that we had on the Russian and that there came back reinstalled a new now garrison in the Russian. </sentence><sentence id="137">At the same time, while we retreated, as I aforementioned, they put up that garrison in Ruda Slaska. </sentence><sentence id="138">Ruda Slaska garrison, while it was serving the area, was basic a service area for the Germans to control the forest. </sentence><sentence id="139">And, therefore, they chose over that to be Ukrainians, which they were former -- they were with General Lassov (ph), an army who turned around, and instead of fighting the Germans, joined the Germans. </sentence><sentence id="140">And the Germans made their darned best to utilize to their advantage General Lassov's (ph) army, so that garrison, while it had I am sure some Germans in it too, was basically Ukrainians. </sentence><sentence id="141">Where, again, the Ukrainian language versus the Soviet language is sort of similar to each other, so it was -- and we had in our midst a lot of Ukrainians, who were former Soviet fighters, rather soldiers who did not want to retreat or become POWs and remained in the forest. </sentence><sentence id="142">Because, as I said, that was a party out of the partisans. </sentence><sentence id="143">So, therefore, it was for the Germans a new kind of thing to bring in an enemy who it was harder for us to control, because they knew they were permitted Ukrainian. </sentence><sentence id="144">They didn't necessarily have to speak German while they learned already to speak German. </sentence><sentence id="145">So that became the biggest, sort of in a way, a trap to our existence because it was too close for comfort. </sentence><sentence id="146">They could, for instance, if they wanted to make an attack of artillery on the forest they could have at any given time, you know, attack with certain shells. </sentence><sentence id="147">And you don't know which way or where, but it would have definitely made a big problem to the farmers and to us. </sentence><sentence id="148">So that's when the command decided not to wait what is going to be later, but they by all costs, which I mean cost of lives, that we must attack and we must destroy that garrison. </sentence><sentence id="149">First of all, that no other garrison should be planted around, sort of in that -- and we organized. </sentence><sentence id="150">Again, it was already the staff, the General's staff, which was controlling and they brought in forces from all kinds and the innovation, like I said, from the artillery. </sentence><sentence id="151">And the Panzer trucks, sort of as to call it, was issued there. </sentence><sentence id="152">It was a hard battle for us for the first time to ensue because supplies of ammunition were hard for us. </sentence><sentence id="153">It was either to buy food or to buy horse, that they could supply to us. </sentence><sentence id="154">And no matter how much  ammunition we all carried with us, we never carried enough ammunition to ensue a battle three or four hours. </sentence><sentence id="155">And that's what the battle was, and we succeeded -- only because of that artillery fight, we succeeded to drive them out. </sentence><sentence id="156">Meaning, they retreated, so they came back at a time later and restarted again. </sentence><sentence id="157">But our satisfaction was that we showed the enemy, well, you have no safety ground over here. </sentence><sentence id="158">And from there on, the miserable life ensued until liberation. </sentence><sentence id="159">It was the last year, sort of, for us of the war, and we were talking about the year right now, let's say, between August of 1943 to about August 1944. </sentence><sentence id="160">But those forests a year later became liberated by the Red Army. </sentence><sentence id="161">So that was the hardest year to survive as a fighting or partisans at all in the forest. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="205">Q: But that, too, the fact that at this time everything was coordinating through Moscow. </sentence><sentence id="206">You were able to get more and better supplies, and that there was really system, I guess. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="209">A: Yes. </sentence><sentence id="210">And a command. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="213">Q: Yeah. </sentence><sentence id="214">How did that change the way you operated? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="217">A: Okay. </sentence><sentence id="218">Before a command of a group, as I said, firstly the names have changed. </sentence><sentence id="219">It was no longer Zychov's (ph) group or Bullock's (ph) group or Fredia Kommunarsk's group. </sentence><sentence id="220">All of sudden, there was names, for instance, at that particular time. </sentence><sentence id="221">We started to hear organizing of the kids. </sentence><sentence id="222">We started to hear Russian names of heroes. </sentence><sentence id="223">You know what I mean, to be named, you know what mean? </sentence><sentence id="224">And this is the way it had gone on to a total change that the Soviet ties to the all extent that even the name. </sentence><sentence id="225">The other innovation was that all of a sudden, it began to get the commissars. </sentence><sentence id="226">And the commissars, as you have probably heard over about it, they were political commanders. </sentence><sentence id="227">So while even at a time as we were, we still had to give our ears to these political commissars. </sentence><sentence id="228">To hear the stories of Communism and Socialism and what their aim is and all of that. </sentence><sentence id="229">So this was a big kind of innovation that it's sort of in a way unbelievable. </sentence><sentence id="230">How was it going to happen? </sentence><sentence id="231">Yes, it did. </sentence><sentence id="232">In other words, no matter what we were exposed to, we must have been exposed to politicizing the situation in the same way. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="233">The second -- the third change was -- I already said the name changed, the command post and so on. </sentence><sentence id="234">The third was that from now on, no commander was a commander that he made his own decisions. </sentence><sentence id="235">Any operation, even for instance, the territory was divided from where we draw our supplies and which type of farmers could we come to get supplies from. </sentence><sentence id="236">In other words, sort of not attack our own. </sentence><sentence id="237">So before it was we knew the area, the commander knew, for instance, in these here settlements don't go barter because we got too many of our own people. </sentence><sentence id="238">So we don't even go to ask them not to give food. </sentence><sentence id="239">We would come and take, let's say, cattle or whatever it is, and give them a receipt, so that when the Red Army came, you will be paid for it. </sentence><sentence id="240">We knew it's not -- you know what I mean, but that was the way it went on, sort of to make it official, other than it used to be saying we robbed the farmers for food. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="241">Well, too, I don't say you don't because certain times like when the situation was bad, we were blockaded, we couldn't help it; we had to carry things on on our own. </sentence><sentence id="242">But in the most of the cases, the territory was divided that this and this companies go for their needs here and there. </sentence><sentence id="243">And other companies use someplace else, and that's the way it was. </sentence><sentence id="244">When a battle needed to be organized, it was decided in the general staff. </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="245">Q: Was this an improvement or a problem? </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="246">A: As a Jew we feel it improved one thing, that we sort of felt we were not an open prey. </sentence><sentence id="247">That there's more authority; however, individually meeting up as used to call them the "Easterners" was touching. </sentence><sentence id="248">That's how we used to refer to them. </sentence><sentence id="249">Those who were the paratroopers who were thrown down. </sentence><sentence id="250">Jokes still went on. </sentence><sentence id="251">We saw a big change, the came to be used to show off the command of a lieutenant or captain, while before they used to make them on the collar, you know what I mean the way it was. </sentence><sentence id="252">So we saw a new, different insignias. </sentence><sentence id="253">Different changes. </sentence><sentence id="254">But above all, our fear for anti-Semitism, we felt -- because we had, for instance, in our midst talking about the political commissar, Captain Bavidoff (ph), and he was leading his group which it was strictly a political commissar with printing little newsletters and all of this. </sentence><sentence id="255">And he was Jewish himself, sort of, you know, it's sort of you felt you have somebody who you can depend on. </sentence><sentence id="256">So to put it together in capsule, anti-Semitism, perhaps, changed to be a little bit less because of that. </sentence><sentence id="257">However, it still was in there. </sentence><sentence id="258">It was a poison ivy that we couldn't get rid of it, and we couldn't get rid of it as far as identifying many instances. </sentence><sentence id="259">And maybe we were too much in pain to accuse easily anti-Semites, but it was not just easily. </sentence><sentence id="260">It was many, many subjects that either were bold enough to see that it was anti-Semitism. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="277">Q: But it got better? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="279">A: Yes. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="281">Q: So what happened next? </sentence><sentence id="282">I know we've these events to talk about, but... </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="285">A: Well, the Ruda-Slaska battle, as you see, I capsulized it very small because I don't want to take up. </sentence><sentence id="286">And the next battle will be Cozlo-Chechnya (ph). </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="289">Q: But let me just ask you a question. </sentence><sentence id="290">At some point later you joined the Red Army, but this was -- no, you didn't? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="293">A: What do you mean? </sentence><sentence id="294">I personally? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="297">Q: Uh-huh. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="299">A: No, I never joined the Red Army. </sentence><sentence id="300">No. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="303">Q: Okay. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="305">A: I was only along with them from the partisans, yes. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="307">Q: Okay. </sentence><sentence id="308">So what do you want to tell me about this next battle? </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="309">A: Okay. </sentence><sentence id="310">Just as Ruda Slaska was a very important thing for us to knock out, and we were freed for about a few months, that they were knocked out. </sentence><sentence id="311">So (a) it was satisfaction. </sentence><sentence id="312">On the other side, controlling the other main artery which it was a much better road -- going through it wasn't like a forest road -- was Cozlo-Chechnya (ph). </sentence><sentence id="313">The Germans managed that after so many miles apart they sort of build garrisons of controlling certain landmarks to be of their own, utilizing the local militia, the local people, which they were in the militia, and few Germans. </sentence><sentence id="314">You got to remember the importance of that particular time, the Germans said to make an elite force out of them. </sentence><sentence id="315">Well, their elite force was to killing the Jews in these here special groups, which they were doing in Byelorussia and Ukraine and killing them on the spot. </sentence><sentence id="316">So rounding up Jews to kill from the ghettos or otherwise, that was their elite force. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="325">They had everything one could wish for, and they always were told, "If you don't do that, you're going to be sent to the front lines." </sentence><sentence id="326">And the sending to the front lines to face the Russian front was a big punishment because, as history told us and we know already with Marshal Polis (ph) at that time, which would be the armies which the big rift did happen. </sentence><sentence id="327">And the Soviet's Army at that particular time was fighting really to the bitter end. </sentence><sentence id="328">There was no retreating and no giving up, so if it meant one-on-one fights after when it happened and the Germans retreated, it was that. </sentence><sentence id="329">So the Germans did not have that 10 days with Moscow that originally the way in "41, that was their slogan. </sentence><sentence id="330">Within 10 days they'll be in Moscow. </sentence><sentence id="331">They realized that by 1943 how fast only was how fast are they retreating, and they did not want to retreat faster than they were beat out. </sentence><sentence id="332">So the Germans used to keep that to their forces. </sentence><sentence id="333">Hey, if you're not going to behave well, you go to the front lines. </sentence><sentence id="334">To the Russian front lines. </sentence><sentence id="335">So a lot of the local people were given a choice. </sentence><sentence id="336">If you do not want to be drafted to go to the front lines, you have a choice to serve in the militia. </sentence><sentence id="337">So a lot of them who did want either escaped and joined the force. </sentence><sentence id="338">So we had another incoming force because of that. </sentence><sentence id="339">And those people became good fighters, because they were fighting for their own local causes. </sentence><sentence id="340">So they built there for, like I said, Ruda Slaska over here. </sentence><sentence id="341">Cozlo-Chechnya, which it was an ended field say between Slonium and on the way like we were going to Lida, so that was a big post that they built a big garrison. </sentence><sentence id="342">And that garrison was taking care of all of these area. </sentence><sentence id="343">This was a new trick again that our command devised. </sentence><sentence id="344">That while we wanted to attack Cozlo-Chechnya (ph), we didn't directly come to attack it there, but we went to attack another place. </sentence><sentence id="345">The other place was a big bridge. </sentence><sentence id="346">It was a wooden bridge over the Niemen River in Melnitsa was the name of that little town nearby. </sentence><sentence id="347">So we sent forces in setting up, you know, places setting up in hiding and I was -- the forces to jump out in case the German police come going there. </sentence><sentence id="348">So we set up ambushes on them, so we came, poured gasoline, naphtha, whatever we could get a hold of, including turpentine on that wooden bridge. </sentence><sentence id="349">And we started to set a fire. </sentence><sentence id="350">We knew that once that bridge is going to go a fire, and that would be dropped a tremendous communication on a main road like this here. </sentence><sentence id="351">That the Cozlo- Chechnya (ph) outpost over there would go, everybody would go out to come there to fight the partisans while putting out the fire at the same time. </sentence><sentence id="352">It worked. </sentence><sentence id="353">No sooner they started to run and that was about 30 miles away. </sentence><sentence id="354">No sooner all their vehicles and we saw them in from Lida posts. </sentence><sentence id="355">The way they're starting to run towards that bridge that we set a fire, we attacked them. </sentence><sentence id="356">And then easily with a few troops that were left in there, so it was no problem for us to take over. </sentence><sentence id="357">It was one Jew, we used to call him "The Bearded Moses." </sentence><sentence id="358">And he was a short man with a beard and he was the most heroic person known in that battle of Cozlo-Chechnya  (ph). </sentence><sentence id="359">He by that time had killed about 15 policemen, until the 16 policemen from the back saw it. </sentence><sentence id="360">You know what I mean, that what he is there. </sentence><sentence id="361">He ended him and with a single bullet killed sort of our -- The Bearded Moses. </sentence><sentence id="362">And he was well known in the area for his heroism and so on. </sentence><sentence id="363">So, as I started to say, we captured; we had a big battle and the Howitzer was the sounding of time that we sent out. </sentence><sentence id="364">Which again, it was a new type of cannon, and I was at the moment serving near the Howitzer as the second man. </sentence><sentence id="365">And between all the partisans which they were needed to be -- so two parts. </sentence><sentence id="366">It wasn't a matter that this group, that group, all partisans who were on the force were taking place on that battle. </sentence><sentence id="367">And within a few hours, no sooner they found out over there, we told their people coming out, they started to go back. </sentence><sentence id="368">As they started to go back, they were engaged in fire with us, because we attacked them. </sentence><sentence id="369">So it was not just the garrison itself. </sentence><sentence id="370">They suffered tremendous casualty and they suffered the prestige that once more the partisans were able to come and knock out the major post connecting and even threaten. </sentence><sentence id="371">The bridge was burned apart. </sentence><sentence id="372">It took them weeks to have it repaired, so basically our aim, what we wanted, is disrupt German communication and disrupt the going on that they had to bring more forces and use people. </sentence><sentence id="373">So, per se, what we showed the Soviet Union was answered in all ways the way we were doing it. </sentence><sentence id="374">However, this time it was no longer a local job, but was a command coming all the way -- who know, maybe it came even from Moscow. </sentence><sentence id="375">I am not equipped to tell you exactly. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="427">Q: A couple of questions for clarification. </sentence><sentence id="428">Can you guess at how many partisans would have been involved in this operation? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="431">A: I guesstimate that at least it was between 800 to 1,000 partisans. </sentence><sentence id="432">At least, because to cover just basically the area even in a thin kind of a way from all command posts. </sentence><sentence id="433">We're talking a perimeter of battle that at times lasted for about maybe 10, 15 miles. </sentence><sentence id="434">In other words, they were fighting in one area near the bridge. </sentence><sentence id="435">Then around Cozlo-Chechnya (ph), which it was a small, little town, but it was quite a garrison established over there. </sentence><sentence id="436">So again, we showed the biggest amount of power as it was previously ever displayed because on direction, we didn't use that much of a force. </sentence><sentence id="437">Ruda Slaska, we didn't use that much of a force. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="445">Q: So that means these 1,000 or whatever number partisans maybe were broken into companies of a hundred... </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="447">A: Correct, correct. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="449">Q: Okay. </sentence><sentence id="450">And there were men and women fighting? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="453">A: Were men and women, yes. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="455">Q: And... </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="457">A: It stands out to me, one -- Rachel was her name -- and she was with Fania (ph) Kommunarsk. </sentence><sentence id="458">I mentioned the name to him before. </sentence><sentence id="459">Rumor had it she was his girlfriend, and to look at that young lady dressed with a uniform on that horse, it was not so common to our  era, you know what I mean, to see a young lady in uniform and horseback riding and be participating in battle. </sentence><sentence id="460">So a lot of these here things became more obvious at this time, that the fighting by young ladies were justified, you know what I mean, and so on. </sentence><sentence id="461">And they were renowned about it, we knew it. </sentence><sentence id="462">We saw it. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="469">Q: Were the women treated differently than the men, than the partisans .. . </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="471">A: Well, they were always a female. </sentence><sentence id="472">That still went on, and in any army, you can understand. </sentence><sentence id="473">A female had her priorities. </sentence><sentence id="474">Of course, the commander when he wanted a girl, she was his girl. </sentence><sentence id="475">You know what I mean? </sentence><sentence id="476">So call it what you want to, but the feminine wish or ways, or whatever it is, was very much visible at a particular time. </sentence><sentence id="477">Even when she was riding on a horse. </sentence><sentence id="478">Even though that she was, you know, a good fighter and so on, it still was, on the other hand, that intuition of her feminine. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="487">Q: Were women given as much responsibility or different kinds of responsibilities? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="489">A: Well, to answer you did we have a commander woman, no. </sentence><sentence id="490">So, obviously, you can understand to judge from here that it was still a man's world and not a woman's world, or equal world. </sentence><sentence id="491">No. </sentence><sentence id="492">However, it was -- in the Russian Army to see women, it was no novelty. </sentence><sentence id="493">We already seen it from "39 when the Soviets came to us. </sentence><sentence id="494">So it was perhaps different than we saw it from the Polish Army from before, but women were in the Soviet Army as an equality marker. </sentence><sentence id="495">So that part talking from a Soviet point of view, if you want to say, it was no novelty. </sentence><sentence id="496">But in the partisans, yes, it was a novelty to see because if I was going to percentage-wise in any company, if they could have been one percent, it was already a big marker. </sentence><sentence id="497">You could find, for instance, in our company there maybe were seven or eight women, and, like I say, the most of them were in the kitchen. </sentence><sentence id="498">Which, you know, where is a woman's place? </sentence><sentence id="499">As sort of saying, it's in the kitchen. </sentence><sentence id="500">And they were utilized in the kitchen. </sentence><sentence id="501">Yes. </sentence><sentence id="502">Or ina, let's say, as nursing, for instance, in the hospital. </sentence><sentence id="503">So it was as the past was for placing the women in this kind of a ways. </sentence><sentence id="504">You know what I mean, yes. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="521">Q: But there were women who were on the front lines fighting? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="523">A: Yes. </sentence><sentence id="524">In the Soviet regular army. </sentence><sentence id="525">But with the partisans, depending on the occasion and where. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="529">Q: Well, there's one other thing that confuses me a little bit. </sentence><sentence id="530">When you talk about going into a garrison and you use the word, "police," are you talking about local recruits or Germans? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="533">A: Police, whenever we speak, we never referred to Germans. </sentence><sentence id="534">That was local. </sentence><sentence id="535">So being that they used to be called by the Russian name of militia or the German police were organized -- the head of the police was a German. </sentence><sentence id="536">Or there were a few much, which it was jobs for the Germans who maybe were either injured or deserved the rank. </sentence><sentence id="537">That they were not going to the front lines, so from the front lines, from the hospitals, they were given sort of something better. </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="538">Q: Change tape. </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="539">A: But with or without , it was contribution made by the local companies to supply people to join these paratroopers right now on that special mission. </sentence><sentence id="540">I was picked to be one basically because I spoke fluent Polish. </sentence><sentence id="541">Secondly, because I hailed from that area from Poland, and with me was another young man. </sentence><sentence id="542">He was a Nordic, blonde hair, and could be easily masqueraded as a non-Jew, which it happened as we shall tell later. </sentence><sentence id="543">That I was sort of in a way almost discovered that I am not what I am supposed to have been because I couldn't hide my face and makeup, we didn't use at the time. </sentence><sentence id="544">So the other boy's name which also was Jewish and he was from my platoon was Polotchik (ph), that's what his name was. </sentence><sentence id="545">And we had local area people join us. </sentence><sentence id="546">One guy who was a graduator of Polish officers" school, Surgay (ph), Surgay Balli (ph). </sentence><sentence id="547">That was his name, he was sort of Polish and white and Russian mixed in him, so either way you would call him Polish would be correct. </sentence><sentence id="548">Russian would be again correct. </sentence><sentence id="549">And, of course, he was fluent in his Polish, and here I'm going to make a point. </sentence><sentence id="550">They asked if anybody has pictures from the past to be a sort of identification to show when we meet up with this here AK underground or Polish underground, that's sort of to prove that we are authentic. </sentence><sentence id="551">So he had a picture in uniform as an officer cadet, and that was while graduating his officers" school. </sentence><sentence id="552">Which in other times, that would give him -- in London, and is a ticket to be arrested and sent to Siberia. </sentence><sentence id="553">And this time, it served the purpose very well, and he could show it off. </sentence><sentence id="554">So we were four of us from the locals, Surgay (ph) and another guy who was a Polish-speaking white Russian, and I and then it was Polotchik (ph).So the rest eight of them, including the commander of our group, were all easterners, as we call them or referred to them, or paratroopers that were dropped. </sentence><sentence id="555">And they are disguised to say that they joined the Polish Army in protest against the Communists and, therefore, they're willing to give their life to fight with the Polish for the cause, that they are anti- Communist. </sentence><sentence id="556">So it sort of was a supportive kind of thing, and every one of us was made up like the documents, so it was really produced like in legal kind of a manner and way. </sentence><sentence id="557">And once we crossed the Niemen, we started to go on the other side and we made our way up south, sort of that we knew in certain areas that there were more white Poles that were operating by night as partisans. </sentence><sentence id="558">By day, they were doing their regular work be as farmers, or whatever their work took. </sentence><sentence id="559">And from talking and inquiries, we found out to make the contact to somebody, and we all, therefore, did not go in. </sentence><sentence id="560">But it was just Surgay -- per se, it used to be Surgay and the commander or two would go in from the easterners, or rather the paratroopers. </sentence><sentence id="561">And I or would be in there because it's supportive evidence to carry on a good conversation in Polish. </sentence><sentence id="562">The Russian at the time would keep quiet because he did not speak Polish. </sentence><sentence id="563">So this is the way our contact was made and the groundwork was laid. </sentence><sentence id="564">They took it for all the scripture that we told them that we are coming from around Warsaw and we are trying to establish here a Polish partisan. </sentence><sentence id="565">In other words, that we will be able to help create because, you know, since there are surrogate partisans so we want to be on our side and do our work. </sentence><sentence id="566">And we used to be led from one pool to the other. </sentence><sentence id="567">Transportation was provided by us, horses -- it was horseback riding. </sentence><sentence id="568">And at times, it did entail about a whole night riding on a horseback, just having something covered on the horses. </sentence><sentence id="569">Did not have no saddles or anything like this here, so it was -- when you got off that horse, you walked  0 around like in a barrel. </sentence><sentence id="570">You couldn't stretch out, and that was part of it. </sentence><sentence id="571">In our weapons we had at that time we had some automatic and the majority was end-shooters, automatic pistols and so on. </sentence><sentence id="572">So we didn't show a lot of weapons we'd ask for, for whatever reason it was. </sentence><sentence id="573">And on one of these here occasions, it must have been maybe the third day and we used to were trained and told that whenever you entered a Polish house, you're going to have to cross heart, you have to kneel to say your prayers. </sentence><sentence id="574">You had show the whole rigmarole that it looks like authentic, and you cannot go away. </sentence><sentence id="575">And this is what it was, the Polish system and the Polish star, and all of us including myself as much as it hurt me to say some of those words. </sentence><sentence id="576">But for lifesaving idea, you do a lot of things that you ask forgiveness, you know, in your heart. </sentence><sentence id="577">But you do it in order to survive and I did it. </sentence><sentence id="578">Again, it was the food eating kind, it's they were serving pork and more pork. </sentence><sentence id="579">And to us, it was a novelty of having this food served because it was not like that. </sentence><sentence id="580">They went their normal way. </sentence><sentence id="581">And drinking, of course, rum. </sentence><sentence id="582">One of these nights we then first had to say our prayer. </sentence><sentence id="583">We sat behind the table, drinking had started with moonshine and Polish Vodka, you know, that some of it was shown to us. </sentence><sentence id="584">And the host which was sitting across like from me at a table, and he says in Polish, " Pu which it means, "You know what? </sentence><sentence id="585">To me, it looks like he's a Jew." </sentence><sentence id="586">I controlled my emotion not to turn colors and quick, Surgay , as I said Surgay, what you call it, picked up this conversation and says, "You know, it's funny you should say it," he says to him, "because he's a Georgian." </sentence><sentence id="587">And the makeup of the Georgian people, which Stalin was one of the Georgian, would be of the dark skin. </sentence><sentence id="588">And a lot of them could be taken, you would take for -- they liked the long sideburns which I did wear long sideburns sometimes. </sentence><sentence id="589">If 1 would have, it would have been an appropriate image to portray that that's what it was. </sentence><sentence id="590">But here was a fast-acting period that took place, and he took over and I did not want to get in involved with talking. </sentence><sentence id="591">Basically, trembling inside as to what it is, so it went away smooth and the evening was ended. </sentence><sentence id="592">However, when our evening had ended and Polotchik, my other guy, was on patrol, because every time we entered a house there two guys on the outside on patrol watching because no matter how safe they told us to feel, we never knew this surprise that it might ensue or might happen. </sentence><sentence id="593">So afterwards when we get together, I says look, this and this happened. </sentence><sentence id="594">And I believe you ought to know about it, and that's why I'm telling you. </sentence><sentence id="595">I don't tell you from this moment on, neither I will not enter a house at all. </sentence><sentence id="596">However, you must be with me for our own safety, because if we become a danger to our mission, what we're about to do, remember they'll kill us both. </sentence><sentence id="597">So there will be nobody to say that it was wrong. </sentence><sentence id="598">So accidents do happen, you know what I mean, and that could be that. </sentence><sentence id="599">So it was honestly an awakening and vice-versa because now on, it was guard each other. </sentence><sentence id="600">The reason I'm telling you that that this is how anti-Semitism was penetrating, as I mentioned a few times before, that in your own, no matter how safe you wanted to feel, you did not have that safety feeling that you do not have to watch. </sentence><sentence id="601">Because we know from experience of how many Jews were killed, which how do you describe it, that it was not an accident? </sentence><sentence id="602">You have to have the proof to prove it, and there was no one to question this. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="668">Q: But you were talking about with... </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="670">A: Polotchik. </sentence><sentence id="671"> 1 </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="674">Q: ... Polish. </sentence><sentence id="675">That's different than within your group. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="678">A: Yes, but I was talking to him one-on-one at this particular time, and he understood it and he joined with me. </sentence><sentence id="679">And from there on until the end of that mission ended, which we were traveling around and we were already nearing the area in the forest near Grodno. </sentence><sentence id="680">But the fact remains that while our command suspected that the Polish partisans and the National Polish partisans where a resistance became very understandable to us, and they are visible. </sentence><sentence id="681">And they had an easier way of operating because they did not have -- you know, the Germans did not know who, what and where. </sentence><sentence id="682">For as long as the population didn't tell about you, bring you up, you were operating safe. </sentence><sentence id="683">So they could be where they are, do what they want to, and manage to stay away, not to be -- maybe there are people Poland in the militia. </sentence><sentence id="684">It could be possible, I don't -- I don't doubt that a bit, but since I don't know the facts exactly, I don't wish to dwell on it too much. </sentence><sentence id="685">Until finally our mission ended, it was about 10 days. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="694">Q: Let's stop for a second. ( </sentence><sentence id="695">noise) </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="698">A: As easily I talk about it after that, that it ensued and happened at that time, I hope you get my understanding. </sentence><sentence id="699">That every minute of the day was a hard minute to pass because we were really watching ourselves against two enemies. </sentence><sentence id="700">You never know did the Polish really take us for granted or didn't they? </sentence><sentence id="701">And again, let's not forget the Germans. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="706">Q: It doesn't sound like it's getting quieter. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="708">A: The 10 days of agony really is not worthy enough a word to use as I said describing our ordeal what we had go through. </sentence><sentence id="709">Being dressed in a Polish uniform, acting something that we are not, and all that rigmarole going through with it, prayers. </sentence><sentence id="710">Not I nor the Gentiles in our group were praying type of people in those days at all. </sentence><sentence id="711">Especially being from the Soviet side. </sentence><sentence id="712">So all this here was -- I don't know to say what it was the worst part of it. </sentence><sentence id="713">But one thing which I did not say it, and I want to tell it. </sentence><sentence id="714">I disclosed the situation to the commander of our group. </sentence><sentence id="715">In another word way, I spoke to Polotchik. </sentence><sentence id="716">I says, "You know," I didn't want to use because of it, "I don't mind it to stay outside any time that we go into a house or anything like this here. </sentence><sentence id="717">In other words, to be on patrol." </sentence><sentence id="718">And that was a well-taken word because this is the worst you can ask for, to be on patrol. </sentence><sentence id="719">In case of trouble, you're the first one to die. </sentence><sentence id="720">So they didn't mind it, and especially these guys inside, it will be a drink and so on. </sentence><sentence id="721">And I did not mind it at all to forsake it. </sentence><sentence id="722">And our mission, as Polish partisans, was nearing and we politely took our uniforms off, burned them so there should be no recognition or anything like that whatsoever. </sentence><sentence id="723">And now, we ensued to find a new place, to find is there any partisans at all in the area. </sentence><sentence id="724">We ran up on a place in the forest, what they called it ; which it means "The Holy Mud" place which it was, it was almost. </sentence><sentence id="725">And while going through this forest and speaking to a Polish person from the area, he was the one speaking that telling us as a farmer that there are partisans in that area. </sentence><sentence id="726">And what we ran up against was a family camp, but they, as a matter of fact, explained us that regular partisans as many times as they started to act over here, but in a short time later, they sort of get lost, and they don't know the outcome. </sentence><sentence id="727">Be that they got killed, be that they moved to other forests, or whatever it is. </sentence><sentence id="728">But  2 seeing they were using that as a hiding place, they were very cautious and careful to have us come in over there. </sentence><sentence id="729">We needed a guide at that particular time to know the area, and we found two of the Jewish people over there who knew the area exactly well. </sentence><sentence id="730">And they did not mind to become our guides and be with us for the period that we were. </sentence><sentence id="731">Our mission was at that time, once we turned back in as Soviet partisans, to show the Germans that there are partisans over here. </sentence><sentence id="732">And how could we show it to the Germans or see what kind of reaction comes from them? </sentence><sentence id="733">We went downing a telephone in a few places that we had to cut on the posts, just cut the wires and so on. </sentence><sentence id="734">And at one time, we used a new system that we tried. </sentence><sentence id="735">We had already the plastic explosives where we would take and wrap it around so no longer did we have to use a saw to cut it down. </sentence><sentence id="736">But we would wrap around this here and put in a capsule, and from distance turn on -- from distance, turn it on and by one shot, the whole post, the telephone post, would blow up in the air. </sentence><sentence id="737">And devise to make it was disrupted, so to us, it was sort of like a fiasco, something we never experienced before in an action. </sentence><sentence id="738">And that's why it was progress that we have seen in a different way of doing those things. </sentence><sentence id="739">Because you could set it off very easily, in a few minutes. </sentence><sentence id="740">Just to wrap around, around the tree, you know, with a piece the explosive and blow up, in other words, a telephone like this here. </sentence><sentence id="741">So that was our mission at that time and we did accomplish. </sentence><sentence id="742">We also had a train to go by rails that we where to explode some rail, train about it to do. </sentence><sentence id="743">So that was the three things that we were involved in doing: Cutting down the telephone poles, disrupting communication, also burned down a bridge which it was a connecting small bridge in a side road and -- which it was leading to a city. </sentence><sentence id="744">And also, blow up some rail, which it was -- when I think about blowing up the rail, when I think about it, I still shudder. </sentence><sentence id="745">Because we came to that mission, and we really the night before did a lot of drinking. </sentence><sentence id="746">And while the drinking didn't bother me in most cases, at this time -- but all of a sudden, while they used at that particular time, they used to call it a shuntle. </sentence><sentence id="747">This was the rod to clean out your rifles with, and we had to put it in that fender ring so that would serve for the right train, and the train would go by as to be able to go ahead to touch it and make an explosion. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="788">Q: Let's stop here a second. </sentence><sentence id="789">Don't move. </sentence><sentence id="790">Do you remember where we were? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="794">A: Yes. </sentence><sentence id="795">As I started to tell you, with my long coat, we were wearing army coats, which they were long coats at that time. </sentence><sentence id="796">We really dressed back -- dressed back in army uniforms of the Russian Army, so this sort of did not have them with us, but we got them. </sentence><sentence id="797">And I'll tell you when. </sentence><sentence id="798">How they got them, I don't even know to tell you. </sentence><sentence id="799">But we got them and we were changed over as Russian soldiers. </sentence><sentence id="800">Not fully, but almost. </sentence><sentence id="801">And all of a sudden, I saw that I attached the piece of steel or rather wire, that it was in between that ring which that was the one to trigger it for an explosion. </sentence><sentence id="802">I saw it there, and I don't know -- I didn't know what to say. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="803">Should we run or whatever we should do, some kind of a motion, because -- and calmly we went away. </sentence><sentence id="804">Looks like all the other Jew, there were three of us over there. </sentence><sentence id="805">The other two had seen it at the same time, and we retreated and we went away. </sentence><sentence id="806">Now, we did it like we used to before in other places. </sentence><sentence id="807">We retreated about maybe a half a mile away into the forest, and we were waiting for a passing train. </sentence><sentence id="808">Whenever, we did not have a schedule, and the trains in those years did not run on schedule either. </sentence><sentence id="809">Because military trains had priority and the other priority, which I know it now and I did not know it then, was trains carrying Jews to the  3 camps. </sentence><sentence id="810">They were the priority number one almost like the army trains at that particular time. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="811">So -- and we heard a train in about an hour later, and we were just retreating waiting because we wanted to know the damage. </sentence><sentence id="812">On the other hand, we couldn't even find out where the damage was. </sentence><sentence id="813">So we heard an explosion, so we scored our three-way things that we had. </sentence><sentence id="814">We had a bridge blown up, we did that. </sentence><sentence id="815">We had the train which we had accomplished that. </sentence><sentence id="816">The damage what it was, we did not even wait, we retreated from there immediately upon the explosion towards the forest because we were not too well familiar with the area. </sentence><sentence id="817">But we had a map of the local area that we obtained, and military map which we knew whereabouts we have to aim because we did not accept to go ahead to ask people our ways around, because we couldn't trust anybody. </sentence><sentence id="818">So all in all, we found out that we knew about this group of people who were in hiding which was like a family camp. </sentence><sentence id="819">Special partisans, we didn't make contact with any of them. </sentence><sentence id="820">And we started through a different route now to go back to our bases on the other side of the Niemen. </sentence><sentence id="821">We decided at this time to go in our way without horseback riding as we were going this way, so we knew it's going to be a long haul to it. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="822">And it took us -- well, it took us 10 days to go to the mission, we didn't see it. </sentence><sentence id="823">It took us two weeks until we finally came to the Niemen River near our area, and we had to get somebody with a little boat and a gun that we met, a farmer. </sentence><sentence id="824">We had a little boat that he had, a canoe more or less, to get us across on the other side. </sentence><sentence id="825">Seeing that there were 12, it was impossible for all of us to go in. </sentence><sentence id="826">So we spread out like a few guy with machine guns around both sides in case of attack, and once we landed on the other side, we were doing -- the same group was doing for the others. </sentence><sentence id="827">To take cover until we were all on the other side. </sentence><sentence id="828">There we were on our own terms, we knew our ways around, and we finally came to our place where camp was set before. </sentence><sentence id="829">And our camp was still there because we were prepared that, who know, maybe we did not have no telephones or any communications to know what animals. </sentence><sentence id="830">But it so happened that everything was in place . </sentence><sentence id="831">And of course, our commander did his reporting and we were returning at this time back to our former group. </sentence><sentence id="832">A new group was formed and we were in it. </sentence><sentence id="833">This was the time really that I was named commandeer before commander -- platoon commander before that mission. </sentence><sentence id="834">But now I was assigned a platoon, and I was commanding that, and we were right now working, not with the former group of partisans. </sentence><sentence id="835">But we were working right now with the paratroopers. </sentence><sentence id="836">And a new mission had started to ensue which it was taking -- it took us a few months to get all the equipment together. </sentence><sentence id="837">Like rubber boats were thrown down to us. </sentence><sentence id="838">Not boats, but, you know, the ones that are blown in the air and you can go which the army was using. </sentence><sentence id="839">And we prepared a new mission to be established which it looked almost like a front line break-through. </sentence><sentence id="840">Do you have this on the tape? </sentence><sentence id="841">How far? </sentence></p><p><sentence id="842"> Videographer: We're at 24 minutes. </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="843">A: The new mission to be was a break-through. </sentence><sentence id="844">But right now, it was a unified command to that new mission. </sentence><sentence id="845">It was the command from General Castankovich (ph) that was leading it, but our general staff was also involved. </sentence><sentence id="846">And there was more than 1,200 partisans got together near the Niemen River, and at this time we were not looking or worried about who will disrupt us. </sentence><sentence id="847">For the first time as we used to do our missions at night, this mission was done in broad daylight. </sentence><sentence id="848">And as we came and we started on the Niemen to set up this here little  4 pontoon, sort of like. </sentence><sentence id="849">And our five guys to go through across, and it was set up right away alongside that perimeter at that time to be ready for attack. </sentence><sentence id="850">All we were wondering where the police or where are the Polish partisans we already knew were in that area. </sentence><sentence id="851">The amount of so much armor that we had and the amount of so many people all gathered at one time on both sides of the Niemen River as it happened, because we went through. </sentence><sentence id="852">It would have taken us too long to get through all of it in one spot, so in various perimeters, we used so many people to get across the other side of the Niemen. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="865">A: Okay. </sentence><sentence id="866">We were crossing at this particular time, I with my group at that time were crossing near the City Lida. </sentence><sentence id="867">And Lida is very -- I would say, kilometer-wise at that particular time, it must have been maybe 30 or 40 kilometers, no more, to Lida that the crossing was taking place. </sentence><sentence id="868">And as we came on the other side, we were given horses and wagons, which they were confiscated from farmers and we were going just like a regular army would go. </sentence><sentence id="869">Some of them, we would be walking, but when we were walking, we were not marching scattered out. </sentence><sentence id="870">We were walking in a four across, but it was not next to each other. </sentence><sentence id="871">We were walking so much between each other that if we had to drop, take a position military style, that we were able to do that. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="879">Q: Why was it decided to do this in broad daylight? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="881">A: They wanted to show a big force. </sentence><sentence id="882">While previous times they did not want to show -- you go a group of 12, a group of 20, the biggest missions in the partisans were achieved with small groups unless an attack on a garrison. </sentence><sentence id="883">So right now they wanted -- you know, people exaggerate. </sentence><sentence id="884">When they see 1,200, I'm sure that the word got around that it was probably a force of 2,000 to maybe 3,000. </sentence><sentence id="885">It's a usual way people repeat something like that, it looks bigger. </sentence><sentence id="886">And the command by all price, wanted at that particular time to show a big force. </sentence><sentence id="887">And we were going and we were not stopped or disrupted in any way while we were going at that time through forests. </sentence><sentence id="888">We didn't go through -- but the newest we had guys on horses to spot in settlements, to find out the reaction, what people are talking about it. </sentence><sentence id="889">And they were filling us in that the militia was fleeing small garrisons or small militia places, because to them it looked like a breakthrough from the front line, and it looks like they landed over here. </sentence><sentence id="890">In Bialystok, at that particular time -- Bialystok is a big city and it was maybe 120, 150 kilometers away. </sentence><sentence id="891">They were on ready massed two full divisions equipped to go to the front lines, and they took these few divisions and threw it at us. </sentence><sentence id="892">So we did not even have enough time to get situated in the area. </sentence><sentence id="893">Which it was on day three, all of a sudden, airplanes above and what the airplanes did, the bombs -- was gasoline bombs. </sentence><sentence id="894">So the forest became on fire. </sentence><sentence id="895">Something that it was never done before. ( </sentence><sentence id="896">A) The Germans never bombed the forest with airplanes; second, with this type of gasoline bombs. </sentence><sentence id="897">So these gasoline bombs made so much panic that we did not know -- it didn't matter whether on a compass or the map, which way you're going. </sentence><sentence id="898">Because you went to the right, you see more forests on fire. </sentence><sentence id="899">And with all of this here, by the time that day was over, we were an army demolished in a way. </sentence><sentence id="900">Not from killing, but in small groups. </sentence><sentence id="901">And any of the light armaments like we had the light artillery pieces  5 were all left and mined and a new retreat back started in a new fashion in small groups. </sentence><sentence id="902">End of tape #1  6 Tape #2 </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="925">Q: When did this take place? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="927">A: This I remember quite well because it was in December because coming back we know the ice on the Niemen River, there were floating pieces of ice. </sentence><sentence id="928">And I know the time because Christmastime is a visible part, that I remember because it was a big, important thing to remember. </sentence><sentence id="929">But a big disaster happened to us at that time. </sentence><sentence id="930">I do not want to omit a very important story personally that I ensued on that day before the total retreat had started. </sentence><sentence id="931">I was laid out with my platoon in front line. </sentence><sentence id="932">And when I say, "platoon," I'm talking about 20- something guys. </sentence><sentence id="933">And all we had was two live machine guns. </sentence><sentence id="934">The one on the tripod with a round base was one of them. </sentence><sentence id="935">And the other one was a similar one. </sentence><sentence id="936">In other words, we had 10 shooter rifles. </sentence><sentence id="937">All of a sudden, we heard the roar of tanks. </sentence><sentence id="938">So the roar of tanks, all of that had happened before the airplanes showed up on the scene. </sentence><sentence id="939">I jumped a little bit the gun before. </sentence><sentence id="940">When I heard the roar of tanks, I sent one of my guys to tell to the commander of his that it's noticeable, the tanks, and what have I got -- what kind of change of command, let's say, new position. </sentence><sentence id="941">Because I told him I don't even have in my platoon one entire armored gun to shoot them. </sentence><sentence id="942">So what with rifles, how am I going to shoot against them? </sentence><sentence id="943">And as they became closer, I decided to retreat on my own way without a command, and I went to the commander and told him, I says, "Look, there is infantry walking alongside the tanks, and there is at least visible from distance, I had someone climb up on a tree, and they saw at least six tanks. " </sentence><sentence id="944">Because how far can you see, you know what I mean without field glasses or so on. </sentence><sentence id="945">So I says, "I know you probably did not have a chance so I retreated." </sentence><sentence id="946">He says, "How dare you to retreat; we didn't tell you." </sentence><sentence id="947">I says, "Do you think we're going to be able fight against this force? </sentence><sentence id="948">With this, you don't have a chance." </sentence><sentence id="949">It didn't take another minute or two while we were talking, a guy running come in and says, "We are all ordered not to open fire, but we'll retreat. </sentence><sentence id="950">We'll retreat in a position like we came to the force away from where we were laid up alongside that road." </sentence><sentence id="951">And as soon nightfall came, my commander brought me into the high command to stand trail. </sentence><sentence id="952">I almost thought I am going to be shot. </sentence><sentence id="953">How dare was I to take and retreat my platoon on my own? </sentence><sentence id="954">My thing was since I had no ammunition, which it was a fact, to even attack a tank, why was I to disclose our position? </sentence><sentence id="955">We would wind up we would have suffered a lot of casualties. </sentence><sentence id="956">It looks like command saw my plea much better than my immediate commander from the company, and was case dismissed. </sentence><sentence id="957">But I was afraid that that was curtains for me at that particular time because I did it on my own. </sentence><sentence id="958">As it turned out to be later, I was allowed, of course, that I made a good decision by retreating my platoon to them. </sentence><sentence id="959">Seeing that the command would have come to me anyhow a few minutes later. </sentence><sentence id="960">So then after the airplanes showed on the scene, which it was closer to the afternoon already, and so far they did not start shooting directly. </sentence><sentence id="961">But all of a sudden, it burst out cannon shooting, which probably it was from the tanks approaching. </sentence><sentence id="962">Although we, by that time, were retreated from the area because that looked like the whole forest was going along the main road and the main road going, I mean, going through the forest. </sentence><sentence id="963">Not a regular road to outside. </sentence><sentence id="964">And the roads in the forest were dirt roads as we can best way express it. </sentence><sentence id="965">But their tanks, you see, could go through these roads. </sentence><sentence id="966">And wherever they stepped on trees, they stepped on trees. </sentence><sentence id="967">They made their own roads out. </sentence><sentence id="968">That night the command told us that we are not going to  7 ensue fighting. </sentence><sentence id="969">We are going to retreat back to our base. </sentence><sentence id="970">We do not want to go in groups of more than 10 because groups more than 10 will require too much exposure. </sentence><sentence id="971">And we were to march only by night, and if anyone is caught or whatever it is, it's -- you know what I mean, you're just running. </sentence><sentence id="972">Cannot tell them our mission or anything like that. </sentence><sentence id="973">However, we were all asked that each one of us carry at this time more ammunition. </sentence><sentence id="974">So each of them were loaded up with more ammunition on ourselves. </sentence><sentence id="975">We walked and we came there, all right? </sentence><sentence id="976">And only thing was in favor was that it wasn't snowing at that time. </sentence><sentence id="977">It was just cold, but it wasn't snowing. </sentence><sentence id="978">And food became a problem because as we went through the forest, we found blueberries or anything, we couldn't go ahead to have the luxury to stop at farmers until finally a few days later and closer to our areas, that's when we began to go eat. </sentence><sentence id="979">When we came near the Niemen, and our group to go across which it was -- I was 10 men or 12.1 believe it was about 12 men with me. </sentence><sentence id="980">And there was another group divided for not so many. </sentence><sentence id="981">Each that we were walking away from each other, but not too far a distance that we couldn't contact with each other. </sentence><sentence id="982">In case a fight ensues, that we could depend on the other one to help us. </sentence><sentence id="983">Either flank them or they would flank us. </sentence><sentence id="984">And when we came to the Niemen, we heard shots coming from all sides which later on, we discovered it was our own guys who were patrolling that area of the edge of the forest near the Niemen that they did not know what's going on. </sentence><sentence id="985">And they thought sort of maybe the Poles, the AK, are trying to come on this side. </sentence><sentence id="986">Because they didn't look like an army, and, therefore, they fired the shots. </sentence><sentence id="987">A few casualties were done, nothing is done to my platoon but some of the others. </sentence><sentence id="988">And the order was we grabbed horses at that time from farmers, and anybody who was carrying a machine gun was allowed to sit on a horse. </sentence><sentence id="989">Alongside the horse, some other guys were swimming along, because pieces of ice were floating on that river. </sentence><sentence id="990">And by the time I came over on the other side of the Niemen, I managed one thing to do, not to stop. </sentence><sentence id="991">It became so the whole uniform that I was dressed in, I became like a walking mountain of ice. </sentence><sentence id="992">But I was aware of myself, I kept sort of seeing that I'm alive and keep walking as well as I could until finally reached the first farmhouse. </sentence><sentence id="993">When I came into the first farmhouse, I found plenty more partisans who did probably like myself. </sentence><sentence id="994">The woman of the house availed herself tremendously, and in that area people used to have ovens which served them in their houses. </sentence><sentence id="995">That oven was cooking, for baking as well as for heat. </sentence><sentence id="996">And on top, there was a place even to climb up and to sleep there. </sentence><sentence id="997">And since I had to get undressed, she gave me a change of something and put my clothing to dry out. </sentence><sentence id="998">There was moonshine there to drink, so we had a good drink. </sentence><sentence id="999">And on top of that stove, I climbed on. </sentence><sentence id="1000">I fell asleep, needless to say, and by later on by morning -- that was the wooded area, so we didn't worry about because we knew it was clear because it was clear as far as Germans were concerned, the police. </sentence><sentence id="1001">And we started to make our way back to camp, where it was. </sentence><sentence id="1002">So that was from a happy occasion as we marched as soldiers and brave guys to make it believe that it was a breakthrough, all of a sudden, for Christmas it was our dire moment that we did not succeed. </sentence><sentence id="1003">However, command did not stop with their idea. </sentence><sentence id="1004">What they did at this time instead of sending a big group and an army like they did, we were moving in the same amount of people while we were retreating. </sentence><sentence id="1005">In small groups, no bigger companies than 20 people at one time were ordered where in a direction to meet in the forests around Grodno. </sentence><sentence id="1006">And within, I would say, maybe two weeks to three weeks, we had a brand new force organized in the forests over there. </sentence><sentence id="1007">The front line -- by that time, I'm talking about in January of 1944 -- the front lines began to become visible. </sentence><sentence id="1008">That the Byelorussian, that they  8 were almost at the beginning in January of "44, that the army were entering in certain spots in the Ukraine and in the forest. </sentence><sentence id="1009">And we did not realize that within six, seven months, the army will be here. </sentence><sentence id="1010">We thought all along that maybe once the army becomes near, we would sort of be discharged. </sentence><sentence id="1011">But that was not Russia's idea or the Soviets saying -- we were at that particular time pushed to go closer to Grodno. </sentence><sentence id="1012">They had already their assignment. </sentence><sentence id="1013">I remember vividly that the night before when I went to place a mine on the road -- at that particular time we used a lot mines. </sentence><sentence id="1014">We, you know, even used mines to put on the road because the retreating soldiers by the Soviet Army, we did not think that the Red Army is close by. </sentence><sentence id="1015">And I believe that that blowup of that mine, that it exploded on a truck that we found out the next day was already that the Red Army is reaching. </sentence><sentence id="1016">I jumped right now -- at least about eight, nine months. </sentence><sentence id="1017">In the area where my wife was and the area from originally I was with the partisans, they came out of the forests about July, early August. </sentence><sentence id="1018">I, as I said, still we were involved with all of this here things, did not get discharged out of that until sometime in September. </sentence><sentence id="1019">And a new mission was awaiting for me to get started because immediately it was for 10 days that we were -- that the army was fighting the battle. </sentence><sentence id="1020">On one side, the Soviets. </sentence><sentence id="1021">And the other side, the Germans. </sentence><sentence id="1022">A lot of Germans were left behind for purposes. </sentence><sentence id="1023">They had the high churches as usual in the north. </sentence><sentence id="1024">And on top of these churches, they found them -- they placed themselves with glasses and they were able to tell the other side where the artillery is located to how we are to load firing. </sentence><sentence id="1025">And their accuracy was beyond belief. </sentence><sentence id="1026">On the third round, they knocked the battery out. </sentence><sentence id="1027">To the right, to the left, the turbine was in the center and your battery is all to pieces like " </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1145">A: Go right ahead. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1147">Q: Well, this is six months later or whatever, the Red Army did come in. </sentence><sentence id="1148">In those days, can you -- if you think back, did six months seem like an eternity, or did it. . . </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1151">A: Six months, definitely an eternity. </sentence><sentence id="1152">There is no ifs about it. </sentence><sentence id="1153">Every day was long, but the closer  9 the front lines became reaching, the closer we used to see Soviet airplanes in the air flying through because we used to begin to see them now flying through our missions to bomb or so on. </sentence><sentence id="1154">It sort of put in a new hole in life. </sentence><sentence id="1155">It was still being possible to believe that really the front lines are coming closer to us and the Soviets are returning. </sentence><sentence id="1156">It was only like everybody had one prayer, that we would live to see that. </sentence><sentence id="1157">Because a new way had started in all this force over there. </sentence><sentence id="1158">While we were a way closer to Grodno, as I said, in small groups that we were asked to come to this end. </sentence><sentence id="1159">We must have had a force of about 800 partisans over there in various places. </sentence><sentence id="1160">The old territory from where we descended sort of from, right now began to fill up with retreating Germans. </sentence><sentence id="1161">And the partisans had suffered more casualties in this here last month of the war as they did in two and a half years prior to that. </sentence><sentence id="1162">Because first of all, the army was afraid to retreat by the regular open road, so they used the forest. </sentence><sentence id="1163">When they were going through the forest, there was no holy places for them as special by any army. </sentence><sentence id="1164">And they had their equipment, and, of course, the partisans could not help it. </sentence><sentence id="1165">If they ensued in a little fight, the Germans did not stop with a fight because to them regrouping and retreating was more important. </sentence><sentence id="1166">So maybe a fight would ensue, they would look the opening where they could do the best and get out. </sentence><sentence id="1167">So that gave the partisans sort of another way of running away. </sentence><sentence id="1168">But there was nowhere to hide and nowhere to run to escape. </sentence><sentence id="1169">And the biggest amount, my best friends that I was to through the years were killed in the last -- in these here ensuing battles of that time. </sentence><sentence id="1170">I came out -- as a matter of fact, not to jump it. </sentence><sentence id="1171">When the Red Army neared our places, one of the companies -- when the commander came, I was assigned at that time to be in the other staff. </sentence><sentence id="1172">And he came to telling the staff that the Red Army came and took away his men. </sentence><sentence id="1173">They need to refuse, where he in all kind of language stated to me, "Who is your commander? </sentence><sentence id="1174">Am I your commander? </sentence><sentence id="1175">Am I the staff, or the guy in the Red Army?What right did you have?" </sentence><sentence id="1176">And he used them -- all the language to them, "I don't care how you get your men back. </sentence><sentence id="1177">If they have to desert, let them desert. </sentence><sentence id="1178">I want you to go and get your men back." </sentence><sentence id="1179">To his dismay, he couldn't keep up -- find his men. </sentence><sentence id="1180">And this is a whole chaos at that time existed, and until we finally came out on the outside after the 10 days" battle that had ensued around the Niemen until the Russians break through. </sentence><sentence id="1181">And after the encirclement, like I said, you see, we were asked to come outside. </sentence><sentence id="1182">What the partisans at that particular time were asked to do was to keep going over on the streets and keep a vigil on the streets. </sentence><sentence id="1183">At that particular time we weren't -- did not have yet the order. </sentence><sentence id="1184">As soon we found Germans hiding or anything and they surrendered, we didn't obey by the law. </sentence><sentence id="1185">We would take them out in the field and kill them. </sentence><sentence id="1186">Of course, and take the ammunition away from them. </sentence><sentence id="1187">So no sooner, a few days all of that went on, there was an order issued that the partisans are no longer to kill the Germans who are surrendering, because it's against the law. </sentence><sentence id="1188">It was bring them -- and a camp was started with POWs. </sentence><sentence id="1189">It was sort of a defeating purpose to us, that command, but we had to obey the order. </sentence><sentence id="1190">And immediately the Soviets started to -- at that particular time, they were probably in the front levels maybe two, three days. </sentence><sentence id="1191">But they already had the administration mapped out to what offices each building would be located. </sentence><sentence id="1192">And before long, they started taking to service the local population. </sentence><sentence id="1193">The population was ordered that anybody between the ages of 21 to 55 is to register in an induction center to go back into service. </sentence><sentence id="1194">The local population, which I'm speaking of at that place in Grodno, were Polish. </sentence><sentence id="1195">That was not a part of Byelorussia, that was part of Poland. </sentence><sentence id="1196">And that's the last thing that was on their mind is to be going, riding out to be taken to go do soldiering for the Soviet Union. </sentence><sentence id="1197">The hate still was  0 imbedded in them, so it was embedded all the way, you couldn't help it. </sentence><sentence id="1198">So my new assignment was that I had to form a new platoon because a lot of them already went out in the open and got jobs as accountants or whatever it is in the civilian life, and they were discharged from this staff, which it was also in one of the buildings inside Grodno. </sentence><sentence id="1199">For my luck, I did it. </sentence><sentence id="1200">Firstly, I had a big dilemma with myself. </sentence><sentence id="1201">I could not face the outside. </sentence><sentence id="1202">To me, the outside was atrocious. </sentence><sentence id="1203">It was fearful. </sentence><sentence id="1204">And second of all, I was afraid once I go out, they're taking away my gun. </sentence><sentence id="1205">To me, the gun was my life; it was my protection. </sentence><sentence id="1206">It was everything I wanted, that's how I was. </sentence><sentence id="1207">So one of the guys would come to me that he was a .too. </sentence><sentence id="1208">He was an accountant by trade. </sentence><sentence id="1209">And he says, "Herr, what is the matter with you?" </sentence><sentence id="1210">It was hard for me to describe -- was his name. </sentence><sentence id="1211">He wrote a book in Yiddish. </sentence><sentence id="1212">To the best of knowledge, it was never translated. </sentence><sentence id="1213">He wrote about me. </sentence><sentence id="1214">The book in Yiddish title is "The Participation of the Jews in the Soviet Underground." </sentence><sentence id="1215">And he generalized that in telling. </sentence><sentence id="1216">He didn't stop on particular issues, but he generalized it to tell about the whole scope and all the various partisans that existed and to prove the Jews were participating in it. </sentence><sentence id="1217">So he came out, it makes sense, he was an accountant. </sentence><sentence id="1218">He says, "Herr, I understand you're going to come out, too. </sentence><sentence id="1219">Why don't you go and get a job?" </sentence><sentence id="1220">I went to my commander at that particular time after that, and he says to me, "Where do you think I'm going to send you? </sentence><sentence id="1221">I'm going to send you to the militia to go for a job? </sentence><sentence id="1222">You stay here. </sentence><sentence id="1223">I'll tell you when you're going to be discharged." </sentence><sentence id="1224">And I remained there. </sentence><sentence id="1225">The next day we had a call from a colonel, a local colonel, who needed soldiers. </sentence><sentence id="1226">He did not have enough of the regular army. </sentence><sentence id="1227">Whenever they didn't have enough soldiers, they turned to the partisans at this particular time to go ahead and supply. </sentence><sentence id="1228">So I got an order to send somebody for patrol to watch that colonel. </sentence><sentence id="1229">I literally sent them 10 men, and every man that I sent came back. </sentence><sentence id="1230">No, it was a general, excuse me. </sentence><sentence id="1231">That the general would not accept them as to be. </sentence><sentence id="1232">And all they had to do is patrol the house. </sentence><sentence id="1233">I became flabbergasted until I decided that I'm going to be the one and with the permission of my commander, he allowed me, that I'm going to go on duty and serve it. </sentence><sentence id="1234">I came in ina military form, saluted to him, told him my rank, what I am. </sentence><sentence id="1235">He was Jewish, a Semite. </sentence><sentence id="1236">And after, he says to me, "Sit down." </sentence><sentence id="1237">I sat down, and the biggest thing what had happened to me that I did not expect to hear a Soviet General to say shalom. </sentence><sentence id="1238">He said some Jewish. </sentence><sentence id="1239">He says, "Who did you send me? </sentence><sentence id="1240">What kind of soldiers?" </sentence><sentence id="1241">I said, "They're not soldiers. </sentence><sentence id="1242">They were partisans. </sentence><sentence id="1243">They were not trained soldiers. </sentence><sentence id="1244">They were not inducted in the army." </sentence><sentence id="1245">And they were -- so they came and told him when they came on duty, he gave them up-and-down look. " </sentence><sentence id="1246">Hey, come on. </sentence><sentence id="1247">I don't need no farmer here." </sentence><sentence id="1248">So he says, "You see, you came like a soldier. </sentence><sentence id="1249">You saluted, you told your rank. </sentence><sentence id="1250">I take you like a regular man in the army." </sentence><sentence id="1251">So I told him, "I'm the platoon commander. </sentence><sentence id="1252">My platoon is no longer because it was diversified to other things. </sentence><sentence id="1253">And since you rejected 10 men, I had no alternative, so with the permission of my commander, I came." " </sentence><sentence id="1254">Sit down, have a drink." </sentence><sentence id="1255">You know, Russian style. </sentence><sentence id="1256">You know, like tea in England. </sentence><sentence id="1257">That's how Russians were, that you have a drink that you show your hospitality and you show your closeness. </sentence><sentence id="1258">I was afraid even to ask him too many questions, but since he himself used that word, "shalom," I took it for granted that he's open and he says, "Don't worry about it. </sentence><sentence id="1259">I'll get somebody else for patrol. </sentence><sentence id="1260">You're my concern." </sentence><sentence id="1261">Because it's the first time that I met somebody who wanted to hear what happened. </sentence><sentence id="1262">He didn't let me stay on duty, he asked me to stay there with him. </sentence><sentence id="1263">And I stayed there for two days, and afterwards, I was called because I was to take my platoon and join the induction center  1 because we had to bring the inductees about 60, 70 miles away to another city which it's called Monastyrok. </sentence><sentence id="1264">Because the railroads were totally disrupted; the railroad did not go any further than Monastyrok. </sentence><sentence id="1265">And so we mustered and within a few days a nice few thousand, maybe over 5, 6,000 and we put them in rows. </sentence><sentence id="1266">We had to march to get them out from the induction center with bayonets. </sentence><sentence id="1267">And the women and children and everybody was like a demonstration. </sentence><sentence id="1268">They're crying over why their men are taken from them and so on. </sentence><sentence id="1269">And some of them tried to pay off. </sentence><sentence id="1270">I knew from the grapevine that one of my platoon guys, because he later came and asked me. </sentence><sentence id="1271">And I told him that "If you talk to me again about bribe, I'm going to have you arrested." </sentence><sentence id="1272">So I don't want to hear about and I don't know -- so he understood that I don't want to be involved, but I wouldn't to hear. </sentence><sentence id="1273">He was a Jewish boy from my platoon, and I sort of see and don't see, you know, and don't know. </sentence><sentence id="1274">But whatever he wanted to do, he went. </sentence><sentence id="1275">And a lot of them what they did, they would write on a piece of paper that you have this list. </sentence><sentence id="1276">That period was mostly that you show up in Grodno, they'll take him, but they wouldn't induct him again. </sentence><sentence id="1277">So what he did, in the meanwhile, they got someone that will give you watches; someone will give you gold pieces and so on. </sentence><sentence id="1278">I did not want to be a party to all of that, as I aforementioned. </sentence><sentence id="1279">We loaded them into trains, and we went as far the old border of the Soviet/Polish border. </sentence><sentence id="1280">Over there, the military KGB took over and I was given papers to go back. </sentence><sentence id="1281">I would say this would finalize this part of the chapter, and after that we're going have to talk about the liberation and what had happened in the field. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1415">Q: How much is left on this tape? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="1417"> Videographer: How much time we have. </sentence><sentence id="1418">25 minutes. </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1419">A: 25 minutes? </sentence><sentence id="1420">Okay. </sentence><sentence id="1421">For me again, a human life had started with papers from the Soviet government written in it that every place I show up with my platoon, no matter how many I have, the head of this location of settlement is to provide me with my men, food, and shelter and a place to sleep. </sentence><sentence id="1422">The trains at that particular time were all the military. </sentence><sentence id="1423">It was a high court to get you something, a passenger train. </sentence><sentence id="1424">So we didn't care, whatever we could get on on a train, for my whole platoon I remained with one Gentile boy. </sentence><sentence id="1425">Because I couldn't get hold him under any other circumstances, who was with me and I knew the farm place from where he came from that he had a mother and sister. </sentence><sentence id="1426">And many times in the partisan life before I joined the paratroopers, we would stop off to his house and everything like that. </sentence><sentence id="1427">So he was the only one, Nathan, the guy that I told you was his name who was the bad guy who was taking bribes, he, of course, realized the way I am. </sentence><sentence id="1428">So he wanted to lose me faster than I could go, I had to be lost. </sentence><sentence id="1429">So we went in different directions, and we finally ended up on a military train on the way to Baranovichi. </sentence><sentence id="1430">From Baranovichi, if we get, we're going to work our way down further to go to his farm or back to direction to see why we can wind up over there. </sentence><sentence id="1431">In the meanwhile while we are in that military train, I already in between time stopped off in Minsk because I knew already that I was curious for me to see what's Minsk. </sentence><sentence id="1432">And Minsk was already liberated months and months before. </sentence><sentence id="1433">And I found out through the partisans that our main staff that was located in Grodno no longer is in Grodno, but it's right now in Minsk located. </sentence><sentence id="1434">I went there to be registered and to get my validated things. </sentence><sentence id="1435">And I had to make another trip afterwards. </sentence><sentence id="1436">The first thing I got up there was two medals that they gave  2 me. </sentence><sentence id="1437">One medal is for being a partisan, and the other medal was that I received at the time for being a heroic partisan. </sentence><sentence id="1438">So all of sudden, when I was on this train with Walodia (ph) together, I had the two medals. </sentence><sentence id="1439">He didn't get no medals or anything like that. </sentence><sentence id="1440">He only got the partisan validation, it looked like a medal that everyone was given in Minsk. </sentence><sentence id="1441">So when we got on the train and that was a military train, within hours a guy comes over and I could recognize by his hat, that this color hats and so on belong to the NK VD, we used to call it at that time, which later turned to be KGB in due time later. </sentence><sentence id="1442">He got involved in conversation and he asked me for documents. </sentence><sentence id="1443">So I showed him the documents, firstly, these were given to me by the KGB when I was released from my platoon to go back. </sentence><sentence id="1444">And the other documents that I already had on me for the medals was that I was a partisan, and he found very interesting to ask me. </sentence><sentence id="1445">He says, "I want to stay with you. </sentence><sentence id="1446">You're going to fill me in and tell me what took place in the partisans." </sentence><sentence id="1447">Because to him was a total new story that he heard about it that Stalin used to rob and , but he never heard or known what activities and what had went on. </sentence><sentence id="1448">So "Where are you going?" </sentence><sentence id="1449">he asked me. </sentence><sentence id="1450">And I tried to say here, Walodia (ph) here has a mother because he was from the and a sister, and I at the same time want to go back to that direction to see maybe somebody survived that I know from the partisans to me. </sentence><sentence id="1451">And then I'm going to go to look for work. </sentence><sentence id="1452">He says, "You don't have to look for work. </sentence><sentence id="1453">I'm going to take you to work." </sentence><sentence id="1454">Then he told me that he's a lieutenant and probably going to get the rank of captain, and he's going to Baranovichi, which he will be inducting people for work in the KGB. </sentence><sentence id="1455">I realized that the KGB man will never say no more other things like that which at this particular time, I let him talk to me and I accepted it. </sentence><sentence id="1456">And we were friends on the train until we got to Baranovichi, the whole period, too. </sentence><sentence id="1457">And that's how another phase of my life had started. </sentence><sentence id="1458">So that lieutenant did not let his eyes off of me and my partner, and we finally descended in Baranovichi. </sentence><sentence id="1459">And he made sure that I come with him and register in the employment agency where he turned me into a captain in charge of that. </sentence><sentence id="1460">To Walodia, my friend, he says, "The militia is right nearby. </sentence><sentence id="1461">Let him go back there, and he gave him his name if any questions." </sentence><sentence id="1462">And he registered there for a job and he'll be there. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1507">Q: When you use -- I'm sorry to interrupt you, but when you use the term, "militia," you're always referring to the local soldiers? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1509">A: No, the local police. </sentence><sentence id="1510">In Russia in the Soviet Russia, there was no such thing as police. </sentence><sentence id="1511">It was always militia. </sentence><sentence id="1512">The militia was, you know what I mean, when we use saying the voluntary. </sentence><sentence id="1513">That was not voluntary, but that was a police force. </sentence><sentence id="1514">Take the police department in any city, and I refer militia; that's what I mean. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1521">Q: Okay, you're talking about the local police when you say militia? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1523">A: Correct. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1525">Q: Okay. </sentence><sentence id="1526">Just want to be correct. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1529">A: Yeah. </sentence><sentence id="1530">All right. </sentence><sentence id="1531">So Walodia registered there, and we made out with him that after registration we both want to take a two weeks" vacation, sort of to speak, so he can go to his  3 farm. </sentence><sentence id="1532">Because actually it was harvest time at that time, we're talking about September at the time. </sentence><sentence id="1533">The biggest harvest time in that area which his mother having a small farm, would have needed a hand. </sentence><sentence id="1534">There wasn't enough. </sentence><sentence id="1535">So it was a good reason that they didn't mind that. </sentence><sentence id="1536">And they let me go with him because I was going as sort of a farm hand to help him on his farm. </sentence><sentence id="1537">And at the same time, I just said I'll go. </sentence><sentence id="1538">So we got a date within two weeks to meet up back, I and the officer of the KGB. </sentence><sentence id="1539">And he and the office of the local police or militia, as they were called. </sentence><sentence id="1540">And while I went -- I already arrived now, they issued me new papers because in the Soviet Union you did not travel anyplace without having the justified papers. </sentence><sentence id="1541">And the justified papers weren't meaning a permit. </sentence><sentence id="1542">You see, at a time later on we had to get passports because you always had to have your ID with you. </sentence><sentence id="1543">But at the time, they gave me and Walodia papers that we can go to the area. </sentence><sentence id="1544">You had to specify where you're going, who you're going to see, what you're going do about it. </sentence><sentence id="1545">And papers in hand, we had already on the train free passage. </sentence><sentence id="1546">No nothing like this here to go back to his farm in his little -- which it was located not to far from Russia. </sentence><sentence id="1547">It was in a way sort of a happy journey for the first time for him. </sentence><sentence id="1548">The more I get freer and the more my eyes were seeing the free world, the more I became sort of shaken up. </sentence><sentence id="1549">I could not take freedom. </sentence><sentence id="1550">You did not have a psychiatrist at that time or a doctor to go to for help to help you overcome. </sentence><sentence id="1551">You just had to work it out. </sentence><sentence id="1552">When I came to his house, his mother gave him a changeover and she gave me a changeover. </sentence><sentence id="1553">I was treated like part of the family, which at that particular time was again a novelty item for a Jew. </sentence><sentence id="1554">A novelty item for survival from stuff like this here. </sentence><sentence id="1555">So we, of course, we had dinner and a few drinks, and afterwards, the two of us went out in the little -- it was a farm settlement, maybe I would say, maybe 60 to 80 families. </sentence><sentence id="1556">And they all had farms, small farms, around there, and there with a harmonica, you know what I mean, dancing and drinking, which it was all a celebration. </sentence><sentence id="1557">After all, they got a hero back, Walodia, which he grew up in this here. </sentence><sentence id="1558">And I, being the former commander of Walodia, which I used to come as a partisan with Walodia a lot of times, so I knew enough people in his settlement more than just his mother and so son. </sentence><sentence id="1559">We had another guy with us. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1591">Q: I don't know what this noise is. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1593">A: Some of these little things that I forgot myself to take and put it in a drawer and so on. </sentence><sentence id="1594">Yes, there was also a few more guys who were in our brigade serving as partisans from the same settlement. </sentence><sentence id="1595">And the other ones were inducted, while they would not be the paratroopers like we were. </sentence><sentence id="1596">Let's see, I was where? </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1597">A: You were talking about you were at the settlement and everyone was happy to see Walodia home and... </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1599">Q: Walodia, yeah. </sentence><sentence id="1600">So I said for this settlement they saw two heroes, Walodia and me. </sentence><sentence id="1601">And the greetings they gave me almost made a change in my heart and soul of thinking the way my future is to go. </sentence><sentence id="1602">I went down so low as to say to myself I'm going to farm with Walodia and I'm going to forget any longer that I'm a Jew or was a Jew. </sentence><sentence id="1603">Because the greeting, the way I was received for the days ensuing, and that always went on a week's time. </sentence><sentence id="1604">Each morning I would go ahead with Walodia on his land and it was harvest time, get involved with the  4 same thing he was doing. </sentence><sentence id="1605">At night we would go out together like Russian style to have some drinking. </sentence><sentence id="1606">And I figured, hey, what the heck, that's the life to live. </sentence><sentence id="1607">I'll go back to all that sorrow, I thought maybe that's an escape for me. </sentence><sentence id="1608">Then comes Friday, Walodia says to me, "Harold, aren't you going to go into Debrecen to see your Jews?" </sentence><sentence id="1609">And that struck me quick like a lightening went through my body, you know. </sentence><sentence id="1610">I says what am I thinking about going to become a non-Jew, and I immediately began to think you can run, but you cannot hide. </sentence><sentence id="1611">And his words to me about -- he didn't say, "Harold, how about going into town and to see our partisans," because the Jews that he was making reference to were not survivors, they were partisans but they were in other companies or groups likely. </sentence><sentence id="1612">But they were basically with us in the forest. </sentence><sentence id="1613">That issue for him saying Jews instead of partisans, it's like gave me a tremor in my body that no, that was not the way to think the way I was thinking those few days. </sentence><sentence id="1614">I'm going to probably become a Gentile and get married and forget about all that. </sentence><sentence id="1615">I said to him, "Oh, yes, Walodia. </sentence><sentence id="1616">I was thinking to tell you about it, but I did not have the nerve of disrupting all that work that you have on the farm. </sentence><sentence id="1617">But, please, whenever time will permit you, I would want to go in to visit." </sentence><sentence id="1618">And not using that word, "Jews," with out partisan friends, and not using it in singular, but using much rather plural. </sentence><sentence id="1619">However, I says, "Let us cross near the Jewish cemetery of Debrecen because I will ask sort of for you to make a stop there." </sentence><sentence id="1620">Because in that cemetery I had both my grandparents. </sentence><sentence id="1621">They still died before, no matter what the tribulations were as I was talking about, so they still were brought to burial there. </sentence><sentence id="1622">My father also was buried there. </sentence><sentence id="1623">So I sort of, like I say, was all of a sudden another person again. </sentence><sentence id="1624">And as we came to the cemetery, needless to say, that I could never see the headstones that were put because the headstones were desecrated by the local area during that year, which they were made to sidewalks and everything else. </sentence><sentence id="1625">So my trip was not fully in vain because at least I saw that not only were the local, the living destroyed and harassed, but even the dead did not have their peace to remain in peace in the places where they were placed there. </sentence><sentence id="1626">I did my share of crying, and all of a sudden, I was not a hero. </sentence><sentence id="1627">The killer, the partisan that I was, I became the Jew again. </sentence><sentence id="1628">Time was not running fast enough for me to come into Debrecen, so I could meet up with some of my former mates that I was together in the group or being in the other group. </sentence><sentence id="1629">And I found the girls that I remembered that had rode with us, so they sort of cling together. </sentence><sentence id="1630">Nobody returned back into their homes, but much rather in one's home, the girls were staying. </sentence><sentence id="1631">So they were in one home, the three girls were staying together. </sentence><sentence id="1632">One of the girls that I remembered when I was with , we sort of shared backs because sleeping at night and her husband was the bosky, which I mentioned who had run away at that time from our areas to Marianske, she was there. </sentence><sentence id="1633">And then I saw, I met two more, and, of course, they were very happy at, you know what I mean, that I did come. </sentence><sentence id="1634">Basically, there were more girls by comparison to say a lot, than the Jews. </sentence><sentence id="1635">And then I went to meet up with the Dalchovitz (ph) family, and at the time I already heard that three girls from Debrecen went to Baranovichi and they situated themselves with work over there. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="1673">They did not want to remain in a smaller town like Briesen was. </sentence><sentence id="1674">Be that it was some fear, that's why they cling. </sentence><sentence id="1675">The man would stay in one house even if it was their house, former house I mean, or someone else's. </sentence><sentence id="1676">But it wasn't like somebody moved in especially like the Dalchovitz. </sentence><sentence id="1677">At that particular time, there were three brothers. </sentence><sentence id="1678">So it's understanding that they were in their former home that they reclaimed. </sentence><sentence id="1679">But the girls, I found that three of those living ones were left and they could have, in other words, moved in back to theirs. </sentence><sentence id="1680">But they stayed  5 in the one house over there. </sentence><sentence id="1681">And we did not hear of any bad feelings about it for the returning partisans when they came to Debrecen. </sentence><sentence id="1682">A lot of them reclaimed their properties without even going through the legal process. </sentence><sentence id="1683">Be that the Gentiles were fearful of invoking the law on them will hurt their future, or they did it as a gesture of their own, I would not be able to at this time to place judgment to tell you one way or the other. </sentence><sentence id="1684">Because either way or both of things would have been accurate and assumption. </sentence><sentence id="1685">And I told them that I have undertaken a job in Baranovichi, and I will look up our girls over there, the three of them, since I know now that they are in Baranovichi, near. </sentence><sentence id="1686">So my stay over there was burning under my feet. </sentence><sentence id="1687">That whole epithet with Walodia bringing me back out of sort of, I don't want to use that word, that was a dream. </sentence><sentence id="1688">Because if it was a dream, I must have to call it a bad dream. </sentence><sentence id="1689">Or facing again the places of murder. </sentence><sentence id="1690">Seeing in the middle of the town that for that short little time the partisans were there, they built a fence around. </sentence><sentence id="1691">Painted up in white, and sort of put on an insignia to say that here are buried all those killed in the massacre of Debrecen. </sentence><sentence id="1692">You know, without knowing the amount or whatever it is and that sort of remained like a monument place that I believe I last heard of that it was a little bit improvement, more sign for that place. </sentence><sentence id="1693">Because as I stated it before in my recordings to say they were afraid to take them out to the big pits that the Russian making because of the fear of the partisans. </sentence><sentence id="1694">So we saw that the pits filled up with lime on the top, that we whatever we are could find Debrecen. </sentence><sentence id="1695">But the difference was now that I saw friends and I saw a sign telling who is buried underneath there. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1719">Q: You didn't have any family or... </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1721">A: Of course, my brothers, my sister, my uncles, my aunts. </sentence><sentence id="1722">I had quite a big family which I don't till this day were they killed and burned inside the ghetto or were they brought out and killed in these holes in the center of the town, which they were led from the bombings when the war had started. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1725">Q: No one left? </sentence></p></dialogue>

</sentence><sentence id="1817">So sure enough, the next day in the middle of the day I'm coming there in uniform. </sentence><sentence id="1818">I knock on the door, and I met him in there. </sentence><sentence id="1819">I says, "I was the guy last night. </sentence><sentence id="1820">Who was the one who said," "? </sentence><sentence id="1821">And he said he don't want to commit himself until -- which by coincidence of how it would be, that was a cousin. </sentence><sentence id="1822">A first cousin to my wife who was also a partisan at . </sentence><sentence id="1823">And he was trying to beat, because the war was coming over, who wanted to be inducted? </sentence><sentence id="1824">And after a while surviving a ghetto, surviving a partisan, and right now he had to go back to fight? </sentence><sentence id="1825">Besides the man was older, but he was still leading the criterion of age, and he could not have any other way of saving himself from not going. </sentence><sentence id="1826">So they were really hiding out sort of waiting all of the days until it will come to an end and the induction probably won't be here. </sentence><sentence id="1827">Which I had to tell him, we got to talk word for word he was with the , and word for word we got to talk about who I know and what, where and when. </sentence><sentence id="1828">And I tried to tell him, give him my wife's name. </sentence><sentence id="1829">He says, "You know, that's my first cousin." </sentence><sentence id="1830">So it was such a coincidence, we're thrown again in a funny kind of situation. </sentence><sentence id="1831">I tried to tell, I says, "I'm working the KGB. </sentence><sentence id="1832">I hope you understand. </sentence><sentence id="1833">We met now, but I cannot give my head for you guys" hiding. </sentence><sentence id="1834">At this moment, you better do what you want to do. </sentence><sentence id="1835">I don't want to find you again when I come here. </sentence><sentence id="1836">I really cannot protect you, so you got to do what you got to do." </sentence><sentence id="1837">Which they moved away back, you know what I mean, someplace else. </sentence><sentence id="1838">And, you know, it so happens neither one of them was inducted. </sentence><sentence id="1839">They got themselves secure jobs that they shouldn't be able to be inducted. </sentence><sentence id="1840">And that was another little story to tell what had happened over there. </sentence><sentence id="1841">The next thing what had happened to me over there that every time the captain would see me from the employment, he would turn around and say to me, "You know, you need to go back to school because on your post that you have, you can only -- must be at least a first lieutenant. </sentence><sentence id="1842">You have no rank. </sentence><sentence id="1843">We keep you here because we don't have any men, and besides you deserve it. </sentence><sentence id="1844">You were in the partisans," and so on. </sentence><sentence id="1845">So I says, "Where is that school at?" </sentence><sentence id="1846">And he would tell me the school that was in Russia. </sentence><sentence id="1847">In my mind I did not have the love for the Soviet system even then in my mind, and it was sort of a secretive part in me because you could not talk or disclose. </sentence><sentence id="1848">In other words, I didn't ask to go to work to the KGB. </sentence><sentence id="1849">I was sort of forced into it in a way. </sentence><sentence id="1850">And I started to tell him that at the moment I wish I could get just a little bit more time to get the past out of my system. </sentence><sentence id="1851">I mean, you know, the war is about -- not over yet, and I will take it under consideration. </sentence><sentence id="1852">Because over there they tell you to do, but it's got to come in a form that you ask for it. </sentence><sentence id="1853">That I will find in the proper time the papers to be sent to a special school of officers to be able to further my career. </sentence><sentence id="1854">At the same time to get an apartment was terrible. </sentence><sentence id="1855">Many nights I would sleep in the apartment because as much as the man responsible for finding housing and the housing man with a family they implanted somebody. </sentence><sentence id="1856">And they used to say find room for Harold or Joe, or whatever it is and that's what it was. </sentence><sentence id="1857">For families, it was almost impossible because a lot of the houses were burned, you know, and destroyed. </sentence><sentence id="1858">And here there was influx of so many more Soviets coming in because to take over the offices and make it under their control. </sentence><sentence id="1859">So it was -- I got in a very bad mood, and one day I come into the office. </sentence><sentence id="1860">And I say to my captain there, which he was the boss of the employment, I says, "I decided that I want to join the service." </sentence><sentence id="1861">He says, "Wait a minute, you little so-and-so. </sentence><sentence id="1862">Do you know where you're at? </sentence><sentence id="1863">Have you forgotten that you're working for the KGB? </sentence><sentence id="1864">In the KGB, you're not coming to tell me what you are going to do, what you  8 intend to do. </sentence><sentence id="1865">We are going to tell you what to do, when to do it." </sentence><sentence id="1866">He says, "I will tell you whether you can go and register as a volunteer to go to the army. </sentence><sentence id="1867">Besides, we are ona special statute. </sentence><sentence id="1868">You cannot be drafted without us from the KGB allowing you to serve. </sentence><sentence id="1869">And you cannot serve in the KGB of the military. </sentence><sentence id="1870">You haven't got the education and you haven't got the rank. </sentence><sentence id="1871">So, therefore, get it out of your head and don't you dare ever come to ask me things like that on your own." </sentence><sentence id="1872">It fell not on deaf ears, but very open ears. </sentence><sentence id="1873">I began to feel more scared than I felt secure before. </sentence><sentence id="1874">I had a problem at that particular time, as I said, with housing. </sentence><sentence id="1875">And with food, I did not have so much a problem because I was eating in the officers" restaurant, and at officers" restaurant the food was much better. </sentence><sentence id="1876">I had a guy, Captain Trusoff (ph), who was in charge of financial department, and he would give me extra coupons because we wore Russian cards at that time. </sentence><sentence id="1877">But in the restaurant for the officers, you could eat what you want and as much as you want, but had to have that card. </sentence><sentence id="1878">So whenever I wanted to have more than one meal I would go to Captain Trusoff (ph), and I was a young man and I was a hungry person at the time for years when I was coming back to myself. </sentence><sentence id="1879">So he would see to it that if I need something, Captain Trusoff (ph) would be at my side. </sentence><sentence id="1880">Before long behind that announcements that all the people who came from the formerly Poland and wish to return back can right now come and register at the Polish Soviet Commission and, you know, the hours and everything like that. </sentence><sentence id="1881">Naively, I think nothing of it. </sentence><sentence id="1882">I forget myself again and the words that he said about the KGB. </sentence><sentence id="1883">I go ahead and register myself the place that I was born. </sentence><sentence id="1884">They knew that I was born in the city, you know, that it was in Poland. </sentence><sentence id="1885">And I tell them when I register that I'm willing for a settlement to go back to Poland, not thinking for one moment that everything from that office is going to come immediately to the KGB and they will immediately know that I went again to do something without permission, especially not an assignment. </sentence><sentence id="1886">And that's this thing what had happened the following the day when I came to work -- do we have enough time? </sentence><sentence id="1887">When I came to work, my door was locked. </sentence><sentence id="1888">My boss locked the door. </sentence><sentence id="1889">The other secretary was not let in to come in, and he asked me to face him to sit down at his desk. </sentence><sentence id="1890">And he started a full investigation about Harold. </sentence><sentence id="1891">State your name. </sentence><sentence id="1892">State your address. </sentence><sentence id="1893">State your age. </sentence><sentence id="1894">Where were you born, and tell him all about myself like my history and the way I was in the partisans. </sentence><sentence id="1895">And I was a platoon commander, and all of this here. </sentence><sentence id="1896">And then he turns around, as if he wouldn't know, "Tell me, I see you're wearing two medals. </sentence><sentence id="1897">Would you explain me what these medals is?" </sentence><sentence id="1898">I say to him, "But I already told you before when I was hired here on the job what these medals are. </sentence><sentence id="1899">What do you want ask me?" </sentence><sentence id="1900">In the meanwhile, tantrum is setting in on me. </sentence><sentence id="1901">But he bangs his hand on the table, and he says, "I already told you many times when I ask a question, you are to answer now when J ask you, and not to tell me that you already. </sentence><sentence id="1902">When I ask you any question, you must answer it to me." </sentence><sentence id="1903">Okay. </sentence><sentence id="1904">So I tell him what these here two medals stand for. </sentence><sentence id="1905">I already -- as I said which I will tell in another part, the way I got married and what had happened, was wearing a ring that my father-in-law bought me at that time. </sentence><sentence id="1906">He says, "What is that ring which you're wearing? </sentence><sentence id="1907">Don't you know that that's a showing of bourgeois?" </sentence><sentence id="1908">In other words, in our system, people do not wear rings because I answered him that it's a ring that I got from my father-in-law as a gift from getting married. </sentence><sentence id="1909">Okay. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2261">A: No more from the time I came home. </sentence><sentence id="2262">Asking for the (inaudible). </sentence><sentence id="2263">All this interviewing got me shaken up to so much that I just -- my feet wouldn't walk. </sentence><sentence id="2264">I felt very weak, and I had to summon that they should send out a car to take me home for the big break, which they did. </sentence><sentence id="2265">And I went by car way home. </sentence><sentence id="2266">As soon I came into the apartment, I disclosed to my friends because I want you to know each room meant a family is living. </sentence><sentence id="2267">It wasn't an apartment when I mean to say that one person had two rooms or three rooms. </sentence><sentence id="2268">The whole house where I'm referring to had about four rooms, but four rooms meant four families were living there. </sentence><sentence id="2269">And those families, with the exception of one, were also who was survivors that they survived in the forest. </sentence><sentence id="2270">That one family was in the Soviet Union at that time before the war broke out, so they were saved from the agony of the ghetto and so on. </sentence><sentence id="2271">And they just came back from the Soviet Union, so to them it was a different story to know what had happened and to find out how much they missed the hangman in their own right. </sentence><sentence id="2272">So I came in there, told them the whole story what had ensued. </sentence><sentence id="2273">I immediately got words from the people advising take off your ring, take off your watch. </sentence><sentence id="2274">Because the atmosphere became that I probably will wind up under arrest, and who know what the outcome will be? </sentence><sentence id="2275">My biggest worry was how do I get the news to my wife, who was Shevchenko or at the time, which it was -- sure, by train it was not too far. </sentence><sentence id="2276">But telephones, we did not have. </sentence><sentence id="2277">The only way if I would want to get -- if | was to know somebody from the KGB and call him and come and tell them, which you know that was a dream that I could not even dream about. </sentence><sentence id="2278">But people used to come daily to Baranovichi from Chita, and I knew another family over there whose husband also the same age as my wife's and she was going to school in the same way. </sentence><sentence id="2279">He used to work for the KGB in the -- on the railroad KGB, and her parents were also from the same city, from Chita. </sentence><sentence id="2280">And, therefore, I decided that someone should go to her and through her maybe would be able to get words to my wife about what is going on. </sentence><sentence id="2281">Because I did not know will I be arrested, or what it will take place at the time. </sentence><sentence id="2282">So, anyways, I came home. </sentence><sentence id="2283">I couldn't eat or go to eat, and I couldn't go back to work since I started to take my temperature. </sentence><sentence id="2284">I felt that I have a temperature, and the temperature registered equal to our temperature reading about 101 over, you know. </sentence><sentence id="2285">I was shivering and everything like that. </sentence><sentence id="2286">My being back to work was supposed to be at 8 o'clock; 6:00 to 8:00 was the two hours. </sentence><sentence id="2287">It must have been about 20 past 8:00 that we heard the roar of a car. </sentence><sentence id="2288">And to hear the roar of a car was not a common thing because civilians did not drive around in cars. </sentence><sentence id="2289">So a car we could only hear from an official, and the official would either be KGB or the police, any of these here places. </sentence><sentence id="2290">I took a look who's going out with the car, and it was the Commandant, as we would call him. </sentence><sentence id="2291">The Commandant is the head person who was in charge of providing every necessary thing for all the working people in the KGB in that building. </sentence><sentence id="2292">And he also had a rank, it was his control so if you  3 needed housing, he was the one providing housing for you. </sentence><sentence id="2293">If you needed to go be transferred someplace, whatever, what arrangements would have been transportation and so, he would provide that, too. </sentence><sentence id="2294">And I say to him, "I cannot go back to work. </sentence><sentence id="2295">I have a temperature." </sentence><sentence id="2296">He says, "I got an order, and you know that an order is to be filled out, you have to come to come with me and I'm taking you. </sentence><sentence id="2297">Okay? </sentence><sentence id="2298">Don't let me use force," he says, "Harold." </sentence><sentence id="2299">I says, "No, no. </sentence><sentence id="2300">I didn't say that." </sentence><sentence id="2301">I went in, came into my office where he let me out. </sentence><sentence id="2302">No one is there, my boss is not there. </sentence><sentence id="2303">I have no one to talk with. </sentence><sentence id="2304">Now, I used that word 6:00 to 8:00 because we did not have prescribed hours that you work to 10:00 or until 12:00.Sometimes we would work till the wee hours, till 12 o'clock. </sentence><sentence id="2305">And at times, before I had my apartment -- my apartment I only got after I got married to my wife. </sentence><sentence id="2306">Otherwise, a lot of times, I would sleep in the office like this here on the table or on the floor, one of the two. </sentence><sentence id="2307">Because apartments was at a dire shortage in Baranovichi in those days. </sentence><sentence id="2308">So I see he's not there, and here I'm feeling shivering like malaria with a fever. </sentence><sentence id="2309">I picked up the telephone to talk directly to the general. </sentence><sentence id="2310">The general was the head of the whole regional KGB department, and he knew of me from before. </sentence><sentence id="2311">Because I used to be there sometimes that we used to have on a 24-hour guard, and I would be there. </sentence><sentence id="2312">And he would like for me to tell him stories of the partisans or he would tell me stories about the front lines. </sentence><sentence id="2313">He lost his left arm, and that's what he was rewarded. </sentence><sentence id="2314">In other words, that post that he was gotten. </sentence><sentence id="2315">And I call him up, and he says to me, "What can I do for you?" </sentence><sentence id="2316">I tell him. " </sentence><sentence id="2317">I was brought here to my office because of my boss" request. </sentence><sentence id="2318">I am sick with a fever, and he is not even there. </sentence><sentence id="2319">I don't know what he wants me for." </sentence><sentence id="2320">He says, "Your boss is sitting right next to me over here. </sentence><sentence id="2321">Why don't you speak to him directly?" </sentence><sentence id="2322">I says, "Thank you very much," you know. </sentence><sentence id="2323">He gave him the phone and I talked to him. </sentence><sentence id="2324">I says, "I really don't know why you brought me here. </sentence><sentence id="2325">I am sick. </sentence><sentence id="2326">That's why I asked before to have a car taking me home. </sentence><sentence id="2327">I have a fever." </sentence><sentence id="2328">As we're speaking, "I've got about 41 degrees which it's a high fever." </sentence><sentence id="2329">42 is the highest. </sentence><sentence id="2330">I says, "I cannot be on my feet; I'm shivering." </sentence><sentence id="2331">He says, "Okay. </sentence><sentence id="2332">Well, I'm going to order you a cab and you go back home." </sentence><sentence id="2333">This is the way I saw right there the way the KGB works. </sentence><sentence id="2334">You're sick or whatever it is, everybody is calm, composed, and you will not realize. </sentence><sentence id="2335">And no one came telling me what I was called for or what it was all about. </sentence><sentence id="2336">And I was taken back home. </sentence><sentence id="2337">As I was taken back home, I had a hard time to fall asleep that night. </sentence><sentence id="2338">I wanted -- I thought falling asleep would do me the best. </sentence><sentence id="2339">I just lie awake, and I don't know what I really did to myself. </sentence><sentence id="2340">Why did I think that stupidly to get involved with registering to go back to Poland and everything like that? </sentence><sentence id="2341">And I almost thought I put my life on the line, and my biggest worry how do I get words to Sonja, to my wife about what's going on? </sentence><sentence id="2342">Anyways, in the morning, I showed to work, and with the last whatever force I had I walked. </sentence><sentence id="2343">I didn't -- first of all, there was no phone that I could call in to have a car pick me up. </sentence><sentence id="2344">And to await the decency I knew that it would not happen, so I got up with an early start and showed up for work. </sentence><sentence id="2345">And as I came to work, I saw my boss and the rest of them. </sentence><sentence id="2346">No conversation ensued about anything like that. </sentence><sentence id="2347">I went over to him only and said, "Do you remember that you permitted me today at my lunch hour time to go to the office, the mixed commission of the Polish and Soviet, and resign?" </sentence><sentence id="2348">He says, "Yes, I remember. </sentence><sentence id="2349">What are you trying to ask me?" </sentence><sentence id="2350">I says, "I'm trying to confirm at this time since we're getting to our lunch hour. </sentence><sentence id="2351">I think I'd rather go before I eat. </sentence><sentence id="2352">Is it okay with you?" </sentence><sentence id="2353">He says, "You may leave right now." </sentence><sentence id="2354">And I left right into that office and resigned. </sentence><sentence id="2355">And the reason resigning, I was asked what it is, I wrote in, "I realized that I have made a mistake. </sentence><sentence id="2356"> 4 That really I have no reason to go back to Poland. </sentence><sentence id="2357">I feel good to where I am, and I'm happy to remain here." </sentence><sentence id="2358">I came into the restaurant and I met some of the officers again that I met the day before, and I was trying to tell them the good news about that I resigned. " </sentence><sentence id="2359">Oh, we knew that you're the right kind of guy and you know the right thing what to do." </sentence><sentence id="2360">And everybody sort of instead of shying away from me like they did the big day, the previous day. </sentence><sentence id="2361">Now, all of sudden, they came a little closer. " </sentence><sentence id="2362">We are very happy what you did, and you'll be very happy with had happened." </sentence><sentence id="2363">But in my heart I figured I cannot resign really from that. </sentence><sentence id="2364">And I had to plan a new way and justify in my mind what to do about escaping the Soviet Union at all. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2470">Q: Okay. </sentence><sentence id="2471">Now, pardon me for asking this, but when you say, "resign," you're using it a little differently than I would, I think. </sentence><sentence id="2472">When you said you went in to resign, what does that mean? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2476">A: You write a paper resignation, like you resign of a job. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2478">Q: You're resigning from the KGB? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2480">A: No. </sentence><sentence id="2481">Resigning from wanting to go to Poland. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2484">Q: Okay. </sentence><sentence id="2485">That's what I needed to get clear. </sentence><sentence id="2486">It's a little different. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2490">A: That means | wrote a resignation. </sentence><sentence id="2491">First, I applied that I wanted permission to go Poland. </sentence><sentence id="2492">Now, I did the reverse. </sentence><sentence id="2493">There was another form that I filled out that I no longer wished to go to Poland. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2498">Q: So you basically revoked your former . . . </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2500">A: I revoked -- if that word, "revoked" makes you better feeling about it, that's fine. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2502">Q: It just makes -- I just wanted to be clear. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2504">A: Okay. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2506">Q: Let me ask you one other thing while we're stopped here. </sentence><sentence id="2507">You used the term, "KGB." </sentence><sentence id="2508">You began by using the term, "NK VD." </sentence><sentence id="2509">Are these the same organization you're talking about? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2514">A: NKVD was used through the years. </sentence><sentence id="2515">However, as of late maybe for the last -- before the Soviet was broken up, but maybe even under the resistance way back about 20 years, this department, which it was the security department of the Soviet Union, was changed. </sentence><sentence id="2516">And the acronym of the words were no longer NK VD, but they remain KGB; also, the acronym of the office of security for the Soviet Union. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2520">Q: So you used...  5 </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2522">A: So I used that merely that the reader, whichever way he knows or he heard, that's either it's NKVD or KGB, it's one of the same offices that it was changed. </sentence><sentence id="2523">As of today when we refer to Soviet, they still refer to KGB because of the later. . . </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2526">Q: Thank you. </sentence><sentence id="2527">One other thing I think we need to go back to before you leave the Soviet Union. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="2530">You're mentioning a wife. </sentence><sentence id="2531">Now, nowhere do I know how you met someone or where you got married or when. </sentence><sentence id="2532">So can we backtrack and you tell me how that wound up? </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2533">A: Yes. </sentence><sentence id="2534">I'll backtrack this part till I come to tell you the rest of this story because I decided that that decision must be done with me and my wife and her father. </sentence><sentence id="2535">Because no longer could I in my life think of myself, I had a partner to worry and help me decide my future. </sentence><sentence id="2536">I met my wife after I became platoon commander. </sentence><sentence id="2537">I became platoon commander sometimes in early "43. </sentence><sentence id="2538">Afterwards I was taken away from my brigade, former brigade as I was, and was adopted to the new brigade that it was formed by Geno Tsinko (ph) which they were known either as the easterners or the paratrooper division and so on. </sentence><sentence id="2539">In my platoon that I was given the charge of was one young man who hails from the same city as my wife came from who also was coming from the same hiding hut, let's refer to it as a hut, because it was built in a part of the ground and above the ground. </sentence><sentence id="2540">And in that hut were living quite a few families in the family camp, as I mentioned before. </sentence><sentence id="2541">But the family camp was not close to us; it was close to the other people from her home town, or as we would call them in fighting groups of the trap. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2552">Q: Her home town was? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2554">A: Zential (ph), . </sentence><sentence id="2555">in Yiddish, the way they called it. </sentence><sentence id="2556">They had a special name. </sentence><sentence id="2557">So we had heard that young man live before and he decided to join the fighting part and he was put into my platoon. </sentence><sentence id="2558">Through him while we would have to come on certain assignment things that were taking place, I needed a guide because that area was not as well familiar to me in the new place where we were at that time operating. </sentence><sentence id="2559">So these guides, we had the guides who were in that hiding house that he knew, I think, every tree, where it's located in the forest. </sentence><sentence id="2560">Because he used to deal with live cattle buying, you know what I mean, before. </sentence><sentence id="2561">So he would often be with the farmers involved, and that man used to be an uncle to that guy, Lade (ph) was his name, who was in my platoon. </sentence><sentence id="2562">So he would take me there at times when we would go because he wanted to visit with them. </sentence><sentence id="2563">In the meanwhile on one of those occasions, I spotted my present wife who was there. </sentence><sentence id="2564">There were more girls besides her, and this is what the start that the romance had started. </sentence><sentence id="2565">Of course, she had two guards with her, her brother, who survived; and her father, may he rest in peace now. </sentence><sentence id="2566">But he survived and came with us to the United States just as well. </sentence><sentence id="2567">So she was well cared for by them, and I only was able to talk, you know, with that little talk. </sentence><sentence id="2568">And at night, when we would go to sleep, they would make sure that I don't touch my present wife because father and brother were right in place in the right places. </sentence><sentence id="2569">So it used to be that I, from talking, that I began to sort of get a liking for her, but I was not in the era a lover, per se. </sentence><sentence id="2570">I had previous, which I didn't mention, I had a girl that I again was asked to be in love with her. </sentence><sentence id="2571">And -- but we had to disrupt it under the circumstances because they wanted to live in the family camp, and I said  6 I didn't come to the forest for any other reason but to fight. </sentence><sentence id="2572">And I, therefore, did not want to hear about family camp at all. </sentence><sentence id="2573">And while from occasion to occasion, I used to meet up with her to help her out. </sentence><sentence id="2574">But again I disrupt it because she wanted to get serious, and I was not a person at the time for seriousness as to get involved even for dating steady. </sentence><sentence id="2575">I was very much -- was very much afraid in case, you know, from one thing leads to another, and who know? </sentence><sentence id="2576">You make the girl pregnant, and then you get killed. </sentence><sentence id="2577">Why bring in another person irresponsibly? </sentence><sentence id="2578">The way I was feeling at the time. </sentence><sentence id="2579">And in all to tell you is babies were born. </sentence><sentence id="2580">Abortions were performed. </sentence><sentence id="2581">There was all kinds of things that it goes on in regular life, went on also in the forest. </sentence><sentence id="2582">Under different circumstances, of course, not the way it here goes on, but it still went on and it's a fact to state. </sentence><sentence id="2583">Afterwards when we got liberated, when I came back from my march for the two weeks that I went with Walodia, my wife held a grudge -- my present wife held a grudge at me for a while over why I didn't stop at her home town. </sentence><sentence id="2584">But I rather decided to go with Walodia to his home and to go to Chita. </sentence><sentence id="2585">And be for what it's worth it while I was working in the KGB, one day while going from work -- to work early in the morning, I think from distance I saw somebody look like her. </sentence><sentence id="2586">And the other girl which was a girlfriend who lived in that same apartment which I later wound up living. </sentence><sentence id="2587">And before long, I closed the door and exited out and I make sure to my eyes that I had seen her. </sentence><sentence id="2588">I met with her and talked with her, and the girl told me now where she lives, and I promised her that I will be in touch. </sentence><sentence id="2589">And our romance began to sort of start. </sentence><sentence id="2590">To tell you how it was with me in those days, I did not write letters. </sentence><sentence id="2591">I wrote poems rather, and this was my expressing a love to her and so on. </sentence><sentence id="2592">By the way, if I didn't mention, I have six or seven published poems, which I have the books, and the majority of them are dedicated to the Holocaust and some of them -- in one of them in the poems, like I said, I used that same words, I didn't come to the forest to fight -- I mean, to just hide, but I came to the forest to fight. </sentence><sentence id="2593">And that's what's making my rhyming words. </sentence><sentence id="2594">If you'll be interested some day, I'll let you read them, but it's been work that I did. </sentence><sentence id="2595">And that's how we used to do, and from time to time she would come to visit to my home town. </sentence><sentence id="2596">She had where to stay, but with me, I did not get the time off to be able to do it. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2640">Q: How far was Baranovichi from Chita? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2642">A: I would say in the kilometers way of saying, at least I would say about a hundred kilometers. </sentence><sentence id="2643">Because first of all, from her to the railroad station, we had to walk about 16 kilometers. </sentence><sentence id="2644">It wasn't such an easy task, and believe it or not in those years, winter or not, we would walk from the train station to her house and, of course, I used to walk and keep my pistol open. </sentence><sentence id="2645">I mean, just in case. </sentence><sentence id="2646">But that was again what I said, the training from the forest and gun on the side sort of made me satisfied that I worked for the KGB. </sentence><sentence id="2647">Because I couldn't part with that pistol at that particular time. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2654">Q: When did you get married? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2656">A: We got married January 5, 1945. </sentence><sentence id="2657">After -- now, before I got married, I tried to ask -- because you had to fill out forms and write for permission to get married. </sentence><sentence id="2658">And since she was in her home town, she couldn't come to me. </sentence><sentence id="2659">Since she was working in a place, a publishing place  7 for the local paper, so she was typesetter, and she couldn't get permission because there was no one to replace her. </sentence><sentence id="2660">I couldn't get permission because I was filling three, four jobs all the time. </sentence><sentence id="2661">So it was sort of we couldn't get to each other, so I was denied the third time after writing to get off. </sentence><sentence id="2662">After the third time denial, I did not ask anymore. </sentence><sentence id="2663">On a clear Monday -- but it was not so clear -- it was a stormy snow at that time in Baranovichi, I decided to call her friend -- not the girlfriend that I aforementioned before, but the family, Briner (ph) was her name, to call on her because she was sort of trying to talk me into getting married sooner and that the better part of my life would have been improved and so on. </sentence><sentence id="2664">And we made a friendship sort of through that time through her friend who was living in the city. </sentence><sentence id="2665">So I frequently used to come visiting with them so I could hear regards from Sonja and so on. </sentence><sentence id="2666">So I went over there to her, and I told her, I says, "Look, we are going tonight." " </sentence><sentence id="2667">What do you mean, Harold? </sentence><sentence id="2668">Did they give you permission?" </sentence><sentence id="2669">I says, "I have no permit. </sentence><sentence id="2670">We are going to the railroad station. </sentence><sentence id="2671">We are going tonight to Chita or Gettingen (ph), so I did. </sentence><sentence id="2672">Snow or no snow, we came there. </sentence><sentence id="2673">We walked that walk all the way to the house, and when I came into the house, Sonja was by herself and she was shocked. </sentence><sentence id="2674">Why didn't I tell her before? </sentence><sentence id="2675">Her father would have been able to prepare. </sentence><sentence id="2676">I says, "Tell you what? </sentence><sentence id="2677">I couldn't tell you. </sentence><sentence id="2678">But if I write to you a letter that I'm trying to go ahead and take off without a permit, you should understand better than that. </sentence><sentence id="2679">I came, it's tonight." </sentence><sentence id="2680">So the first thing she went running to find her father. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="2681">Her father then was playing cards in another house, and he came in. </sentence><sentence id="2682">And, of course, it was a problem. </sentence><sentence id="2683">He wouldn't permit me to go sleep with her, obviously, to say. </sentence><sentence id="2684">So we decided tomorrow, the following day, Tuesday, that we are going to go into -- it was called Zachs (ph). </sentence><sentence id="2685">Zachs was the marriage license department officially in the Soviet Union, so we went to make that official. </sentence><sentence id="2686">No sooner we got registered there and everything like that, I got a note to the house. </sentence><sentence id="2687">Because the guys that were former partisans were working in the KGB here and with the police also the same way. </sentence><sentence id="2688">So they came quickly to the house to tell me that they are not going to arrest me, but I have a warranty for my arrest and now that I came to the officialdom -- everything was tied into the KGB. </sentence><sentence id="2689">If you got married, the KGB got some of the knowledge about it, too, because that's how they controlled the population. </sentence><sentence id="2690">I being aware or not aware, I did it and I didn't care. </sentence><sentence id="2691">I was the rebel at the time that I didn't care what's going tomorrow or the next hour. </sentence><sentence id="2692">So they said to me, "Harold, when do you decide to go back?" </sentence><sentence id="2693">I says, "I plan on going back Thursday, no later." </sentence><sentence id="2694">They say, "Okay, we'll cover you till Thursday, but Thursday you better get your fanny out of here because otherwise we got to arrest you." </sentence><sentence id="2695">Of course, it looks like the KGB was notified officially after that where I am and that I'm on my way back and I'll be there. </sentence><sentence id="2696">And my father-in-law, may he rest in peace, gave me Vodka to take home because he used to do black market dealing. </sentence><sentence id="2697">He used to make the uppers for boots, and boots in those days was like a jeweler, you know. </sentence><sentence id="2698">Everybody liked to have a pair of boots, and that gave him enough from the farmers who from making boots, that will would bring him all kinds of food in the house so it was no shortage. </sentence><sentence id="2699">And before long he used to go into black marketeer to get the other materials, leather and so on. </sentence><sentence id="2700">He would go to Vilna or other places for the raw materials. </sentence><sentence id="2701">So she got him, and we already were married officially sort of the next morning because it was, and for that night we planned on a Tuesday night to plan to have an official Jewish ceremony. </sentence><sentence id="2702">So we got a hold the acting sort of rabbi, who was also a man who was in the partisans, but he was a blacksmith. </sentence><sentence id="2703">And through history we know there were blacksmith rabbis in the times of the sages, so it was a  8 . </sentence><sentence id="2704">However, it came to write exuba (ph), meaning the marital contract, he tells me he does not know how. </sentence><sentence id="2705">I says, "I do know how, but, you know, I was a student of that. </sentence><sentence id="2706">But it's illegitimate, you cannot write your own contract. </sentence><sentence id="2707">It must be fulfilled by somebody else." </sentence><sentence id="2708">So we decided just in his presence and the presence of witnesses to give hands and it became sort of a married officialdom with all the other things, but without getting that official document, exuba (ph). </sentence><sentence id="2709">But officially we went through the whole -- and the guys were there, the former partisans, we had a house party to celebrate our wedding. </sentence><sentence id="2710">But it was officially as it could be. </sentence><sentence id="2711">Legally and officially, although not for the Jewish. </sentence><sentence id="2712">So that's when we got married, and I came back. </sentence><sentence id="2713">For greetings when I came in, I was arrested. </sentence><sentence id="2714">I was asked to surrender my gun immediately. </sentence><sentence id="2715">The Commandant took me under arrest and charged me with desertion. </sentence><sentence id="2716">The thing, he put me into the jailhouse. </sentence><sentence id="2717">A few hours later, after two hours, no one other than the general himself is coming down. </sentence><sentence id="2718">And he says to him to the Commandant, "Why did you arrest him?" </sentence><sentence id="2719">So he said he did, he had the order for desertion, so he turned around to me. " </sentence><sentence id="2720">Would you please tell me what has transpired?" </sentence><sentence id="2721">I tell him, I says, "Three times I made applications filed through my boss that he knows for giving me permission to go and get married." </sentence><sentence id="2722">I says, "I thought getting married is constitutional. </sentence><sentence id="2723">However, I needed to do it in writing. </sentence><sentence id="2724">I did, I lived up to it and three times I was turned down. </sentence><sentence id="2725">So I got tired." </sentence><sentence id="2726">He says, "I got to put boss in jail." </sentence><sentence id="2727">He says, "Get him out." </sentence><sentence id="2728">He says, "Not you." </sentence><sentence id="2729">I thanked him, and afterwards I said to the Commandant, "You see, I brought you salami and Vodka," and we turned it into sort of a festive mood. </sentence><sentence id="2730">And I went back to my office to continue my work, and no charges whatever. </sentence><sentence id="2731">But at the same time I was fearful, so I left words with my father- in-law and discussed the issue of escape with him. </sentence><sentence id="2732">And I said to him, "Let's wait over a week or two. </sentence><sentence id="2733">And please go ahead under this and this name." </sentence><sentence id="2734">As I said at the outset of my recording that my birth name was Zuckerman. </sentence><sentence id="2735">I changed Zuckerman to Zissman; that's when the changing took place. </sentence><sentence id="2736">I registered because as Zissman, there was no one they can trace it to. </sentence><sentence id="2737">So I didn't care how long it will take them to find out who that Zissman is. </sentence><sentence id="2738">Rather that is the KGB problem, but I told them they send in my brother-in-law -- my present brother-in- law, he went in sort of to be the person and they knew him. </sentence><sentence id="2739">You know, in small towns they knew each other, and my new name became -- as far as the Polish government was concerned, was Zissman and it was all changed. </sentence><sentence id="2740">And I was awaiting when the papers will be ready for them to let me know and I'll make the escape. </sentence><sentence id="2741">However, deep in me -- and I was called now to go ahead for duty at the office of the general. </sentence><sentence id="2742">I was afraid that somebody's not playing and I said to my boss, I said, "Why are you sending me after all I committed?" </sentence><sentence id="2743">He says, "You were told already too many times. </sentence><sentence id="2744">When something's wrong, we'll tell you. </sentence><sentence id="2745">You have no reason for me to tell you. </sentence><sentence id="2746">You asked to go for duty; you going to go up for the duty, and that's all. </sentence><sentence id="2747">And ask yourself, I don't ask you to go out to get a new </sentence></p><p><sentence id="2748"> and mines." </sentence><sentence id="2749">I did go and the next day after jury duty I was called to do my regular work which since I was planning my going to Minsk which it was part of the once a month that I would go for supplies, the uniform or the other one. </sentence><sentence id="2750">And that used to be a week's going away. </sentence><sentence id="2751">I would take a train to go to Minsk, and once I used to be saddled with more of my needs than I had to supply and the supplies were there in order, I used to call for a truck and they would send up a truck for me to come in. </sentence><sentence id="2752">From Minsk to Baranovichi, it used to be more than a day's driving because firstly, the road and the transportation type of trucks, the way it was. </sentence><sentence id="2753">I, therefore, instead of going on the train to Minsk turned around and went to  9 Chita, to my wife's home town, and finding out that my father-in-law got the papers already for me. </sentence><sentence id="2754">If not, I got to know a time now because I'm afraid that it's burning under my feet to remain without doing anything about it. </sentence><sentence id="2755">I did not trust the Soviet Union and the KGB that they are not ultimately going to arrest me, okay? </sentence></p><p><sentence id="2756"> End of Tape #3  0 Tape #4 </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2757">A: I finished all of that, I think. </sentence><sentence id="2758">Yeah. </sentence><sentence id="2759">I was right now .. . </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2763">Q: Well, your last words, you were in Chita and you were saying something to the effect that you knew you had to leave the Soviet Union. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2765">A: Although like I said, I repented in the way they wanted me to do. </sentence><sentence id="2766">But my own mind did not leave rest with me to make this here my permanent home. </sentence><sentence id="2767">I still figured -- and I talked it over with my wife before leaving Chita and her father that as soon they can have the proper papers, which I said I had them do under an assumed name, ready for me that I will come and get the papers or else he can bring them to me to Baranovichi with the papers and we are going to do. </sentence><sentence id="2768">I had to get the goodwill of my wife and her father to go along with the program which that was part and I was going to get married, that I made up at first to say. </sentence><sentence id="2769">If we cannot escape from here, there is no use in me getting involved and getting married. </sentence><sentence id="2770">However, if that's what you want to do, that's fine with me. </sentence><sentence id="2771">I'm willing one way or the other, so which I'm trying to say even though I said one thing, I still -- my mind was set out to do something else. </sentence><sentence id="2772">I used this time period for detour to go to Chita just to find out how far the papers were going. </sentence><sentence id="2773">To my amazement when I came there, I found out that it was a Polish holiday and the commission was closed; therefore, by no means could they get the papers ready that particular day. </sentence><sentence id="2774">Since I had to go to Minsk which it was my regular route time of the month to pick up supplies, I hurried with -- my father-in-law gave me to take along some Vodka and some butter and other things because you had to bribe the officials to get work done, even in the KGB. </sentence><sentence id="2775">So when you wanted to have work done fast, as it happened that I was detained for one day being over there, so I decided at this time not to lose any more time. </sentence><sentence id="2776">And I came back to the train station and I couldn't get a civilian train, but it was a military train, showing them documents that I was working for the KGB, and I had to go to Minsk. </sentence><sentence id="2777">The commander permitted me to go with their train, which that helped to make up time because their train was a direct train that it was going all the way to Minsk. </sentence><sentence id="2778">So I made up quite a bit of time, as he promised, to have gotten a passenger train regularly going to Minsk. </sentence><sentence id="2779">When I came to Minsk, I had my guy, which I usually used to call first. </sentence><sentence id="2780">He was a Jewish boy named Rueben, which he was born in Minsk and lived in Minsk. </sentence><sentence id="2781">And he was working also for the KGB. </sentence><sentence id="2782">So I called him to tell him that I'm in town. </sentence><sentence id="2783">He said, "Harold, weren't you supposed to be here yesterday?" </sentence><sentence id="2784">I says, "Why do you say that?" </sentence><sentence id="2785">He says, "Please clear it up to me." </sentence><sentence id="2786">He says, "Major Spock (ph)," which that was his name, "was here yesterday in the office looking for you." </sentence><sentence id="2787">I says, "I did not know that Spock was supposed to be here." </sentence><sentence id="2788">Which I did not want to disclose to him, so it immediately gave me food for thought that they are not trusting me. </sentence><sentence id="2789">And they sent Spock to set up to check for me to see did I really go to Minsk or perhaps I went elsewhere. </sentence><sentence id="2790">So my suspicion was correct. </sentence><sentence id="2791">I came, therefore, and I told them, "Tell the boys I got good stuff for them. </sentence><sentence id="2792">I got Vodka, I got butter and other things. </sentence><sentence id="2793">Here is my order." </sentence><sentence id="2794">And by all means I must have that order ready because at that particular time that was already Tuesday, I said Wednesday, I'm going to call a truck, so I must have it ready by Wednesday so when my truck comes -- so Thursday for traveling and that's it. </sentence><sentence id="2795">Which I, instead of going to the office now, called my office in Baranovichi,  1 talking to my captain, the boss, and telling him that everything is going along all right. </sentence><sentence id="2796">And it looks like by all means he should be able to send out a truck tomorrow, because I'll have everything under control. </sentence><sentence id="2797">I said, "By the way" -- I didn't. </sentence><sentence id="2798">I says, "I understand that Spock was looking here for me. </sentence><sentence id="2799">Is there any reason what?" " </sentence><sentence id="2800">I did not know," he pretends, "that Spock was there, so I could understand that he tried still again to prey on me." </sentence><sentence id="2801">I says, "No, no, no, no. </sentence><sentence id="2802">Spock was not looking for you. </sentence><sentence id="2803">And if he did, I don't know why. </sentence><sentence id="2804">I don't know where Spock is at all." </sentence><sentence id="2805">And I went about my business and by all means possible Thursday I was back in town with everything. </sentence><sentence id="2806">And my boss says to me, very graciously he says, "You see, and you want to leave us? </sentence><sentence id="2807">Nobody can do things that good as you do. </sentence><sentence id="2808">Everything is organized, and you're back." </sentence><sentence id="2809">He gave me a lot of praise and fine. </sentence><sentence id="2810">I says, "I'm going to have a surprise. </sentence><sentence id="2811">My wife is here in town, and I want to bring her to you tomorrow to see." </sentence><sentence id="2812">Because my plans were to proceed already. </sentence><sentence id="2813">My father-in-law, my brother-in-law and my wife were already in the apartment because, as I said, I told them whenever the papers will be ready, ask no questions. </sentence><sentence id="2814">You come here. </sentence><sentence id="2815">I cannot let time lost -- get lost over here because I got a jump up and proceed. </sentence><sentence id="2816">And now that I came back and I told my father-in-law the story, so they saw it was on the right track. </sentence><sentence id="2817">So again to show you in a way you can say naive; on the other one you can see how brainwashed people are. </sentence><sentence id="2818">As I said before, that I was trying to get my wife to move to Baranovichi, and she couldn't leave her job. </sentence><sentence id="2819">I wanted permission for me to move to Chita, and I couldn't get it. </sentence><sentence id="2820">So when I came, I introduced her. </sentence><sentence id="2821">My father-in-law and brother-in-law, no. </sentence><sentence id="2822">I introduced her to him. </sentence><sentence id="2823">I said, "This is my wife. </sentence><sentence id="2824">Meet her." </sentence><sentence id="2825">He says, "You see, I told someday she'll be here." </sentence><sentence id="2826">I says, "Of course, you helped a lot." </sentence><sentence id="2827">I got enough to go along for the life story that he had a lot of help to it. </sentence><sentence id="2828">And my plan was as soon as they say goodbye, we are going to -- as soon as they see him, they're going to say goodbye to her father and brother. </sentence><sentence id="2829">And we are going to get to the station. </sentence><sentence id="2830">We were not -- the office was not too far from the main station to go on train. </sentence><sentence id="2831">I had to obtain tickets, which my father-in-law went to get them. </sentence><sentence id="2832">I did not even want to be seen in anything like that. </sentence><sentence id="2833">So my brother-in-law and father-in-law did. </sentence><sentence id="2834">And I came back to the apartment, took off my uniform, let my belt with the gun, you know, and the whole thing come there. </sentence><sentence id="2835">And I said to my brother-in-law, I says, "Please, tomorrow morning take it in. </sentence><sentence id="2836">They'll ask you questions, you know, from not -- you came and you saw that I'm not there and I left the belting on, you did not know who is that in the house." </sentence><sentence id="2837">Which he did and day afterwards came back to look in the apartment. </sentence><sentence id="2838">Maybe they can find something about it, and he says he doesn't know. </sentence><sentence id="2839">As it was told to me later another guy from the who also served in the KGB, on the military KGB, he and that other guy which I aforementioned before who was with my wife's friend, married to my wife's friend, the two of them were sent all the way to Bialystok to look for me. </sentence><sentence id="2840">I went on the train that evening and by morning I was in Bialystok. </sentence><sentence id="2841">Bialystok was Poland, and that was not capital as Russia, but that was the big city. </sentence><sentence id="2842">From where I grew up or from where I was born, it was 150 miles either way to go to either of the cities. </sentence><sentence id="2843">Coincidentally, when I came there and I got into a house -- there wasn't hotels to go into then -- we used to go to gatherings where Jews are and it was on the move over there of all Europe. </sentence><sentence id="2844">People were moving, coming back and going someplace, and other ones just for speculative purposes. </sentence><sentence id="2845">The trains were loaded; people were on the top of the trains. </sentence><sentence id="2846">Wherever they could room to get on a train people were there. </sentence><sentence id="2847"> 2 </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2931">Q: When was this? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2933">A: Now, we are talking about early May, not early the Ist or the 2nd, but it was in May of 19 -- it had to be about -- to finish what I'm going to say -- had to be about May the 11th or 10th. </sentence><sentence id="2934">Something like here, of 1945. </sentence><sentence id="2935">So we came there and take a look in the house. </sentence><sentence id="2936">I found from my home town a guy who went to school with. </sentence><sentence id="2937">We used to rent an apartment when we first moved to that city, that was our first apartment that we rent from his family to live in. </sentence><sentence id="2938">And he tells me the good news as I had to tell him. </sentence><sentence id="2939">Nobody was left. </sentence><sentence id="2940">He was in hiding. </sentence><sentence id="2941">And I say to him I would like to go to Sri Lanka to visit it. </sentence><sentence id="2942">He says please don't do that because one of the guys which he told me, which was also a guy of our age, who lived through in hiding, the first day he came back towards Sri Lanka, he was shot dead and killed. </sentence><sentence id="2943">Well, they didn't -- seeing us come back meant one thing, which I gave you to read about, the article. </sentence><sentence id="2944">It meant one thing, returning the apartments or returning the homes or the buildings to the Jews. </sentence><sentence id="2945">It was confiscated by their volition from the Germans and the Polish government, which it was established right after the war came to an end in that part which the Soviets liberated, they did not look into it about the Poles should return with a public property, of their own property, which it was unofficially taken by them. </sentence><sentence id="2946">So they didn't want to give it up, so it was easier to kill the Jews who claimed that instead of giving up theirs. </sentence><sentence id="2947">I understand as of late the tule changed a little because they tried at one time to -- a lot of them claimed the properties years afterwards when they came Poland. </sentence><sentence id="2948">And the Polish government made a trick about it. </sentence><sentence id="2949">Yeah, you didn't pay the taxes in so many years. </sentence><sentence id="2950">So now, how much the tax would be to pay was more than the value of the house would be on the market. </sentence><sentence id="2951">So that was another way, that way they did not have to return properties to Jews. </sentence><sentence id="2952">I understand as of late right now, they changed that any public property -- like, for instance, a synagogue, a Jewish school, or the cemeteries or any lots of that nature that had belonged to the community as one, if they had claims to prove through legal means, they would return it back to the community. </sentence><sentence id="2953">But they didn't have to return it back to any personal owner. </sentence><sentence id="2954">But that's what they tried to do. </sentence><sentence id="2955">Maybe it was another Yeshua imitation that you should back to Poland, so I listened to him, and didn't dare to go to the -- not to my birth town or to the home town that I lived from where I was chased out in 1939. </sentence><sentence id="2956">And we decided -- I met somebody else who I knew in Baranovichi already from my home town, and he came asked me would I go with him for black marketing assignment. </sentence><sentence id="2957">They used to go into Czechoslovakia. </sentence><sentence id="2958">They used to go into Germany, bring certain things from there and get farm goods where they could be more available on this end and that's how it went on. </sentence><sentence id="2959">And people were doing this here black marketeering quite freely at the time. </sentence><sentence id="2960">There was no interference by any of the governments at that particular time because the public was in need of means. </sentence><sentence id="2961">And the governments were not ready and able to help them restore. </sentence><sentence id="2962">So they were happy that no on is making demands on them. </sentence><sentence id="2963">Well, my wife heard that, she says, "No, you're not going." </sentence><sentence id="2964">And I, you know, I did not want to separate myself, although the means would have helped us, you know. </sentence><sentence id="2965">Another thing happened to me, my father-in-law brought me -- he gave me along to take along when I was escaping, to take a box of yeast. </sentence><sentence id="2966">Yeast, they used to make moonshine and everything like that. </sentence><sentence id="2967">And yeast was coming in a can at that particular time, was easily accessible, and was the means of getting money. </sentence><sentence id="2968">When I came to the house where I met my friend, I had over there light flints and this here and it was stolen the first day. </sentence><sentence id="2969">So I had a bad taste about being in -- so I said to  3 my wife, "We cannot go here. </sentence><sentence id="2970">We cannot go there." </sentence><sentence id="2971">We heard that Lodz is building up a Jewish community, and we heard a lot of people that we knew from were going to Ledz. </sentence><sentence id="2972">So these days, it was very easy to decide, you get your stuff which you have, cover, or whatever it is that he was carrying around in knapsack like, and you go to Lodz. </sentence><sentence id="2973">We came to Lodz, we found a lot of the former partisans which were there from same force as we were. </sentence><sentence id="2974">And we found a lot more people from various cities. </sentence><sentence id="2975">It was quite a big returning place, Jews from the camps and so on. </sentence><sentence id="2976">That Jews survived in camps, I did not know until in Baranovichi when I worked for the KGB. </sentence><sentence id="2977">That one day we were told that a train is passing by town on the way to Vilna and in it there were inmates from camps that survived the concentration camps. </sentence><sentence id="2978">Only then, which it means in "45 of May, maybe about April or so, did I for the first time I went purposely to the station to see how these people looked. </sentence><sentence id="2979">And that's the first time I saw the uniform with the stripes and I saw the faces of people who survived. </sentence><sentence id="2980">Because to our own meaning we thought the Jews were murdered out the same as it happened in our areas. </sentence><sentence id="2981">That there were massacres, and they killed them out. </sentence><sentence id="2982">We had no idea of knowledge that there were such things as concentration camps. </sentence><sentence id="2983">So it was the first time that I saw that in about April in Baranovichi, and then here coming to Bialystok and Ledz, I found out the other parts of survivors in inmates in concentration camps. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3035">Q: I'm curious what your reaction was to them, the people you met who had come from the camps, what you saw ... </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3037">A: It was as much as if I was to be thrown into a different world altogether on a different part of the world. </sentence><sentence id="3038">It was the most unbelievable thing for me and many more about me who came out of the forests or for hiding to see people surviving especially after I found out what the concentration camps were all about. </sentence><sentence id="3039">You, for instance, until you read it, you didn't know about it either, but to us survivors, it was a new phenomenon. </sentence><sentence id="3040">A new strange thing to find out. </sentence><sentence id="3041">And it was some in all -- although I spoke to those people, it sounded a very disbelievable type of story, but that's what it was. </sentence><sentence id="3042">And we did not even know how to treat it. </sentence><sentence id="3043">You did not know. </sentence><sentence id="3044">Do you feel better about it with these people that you met? </sentence><sentence id="3045">Do you have any conversation? </sentence><sentence id="3046">Because to go on and have conversation, we had nothing in common because that was not the way things happened at all. </sentence><sentence id="3047">To go on our conversation that we did was again, strange people, what are you telling me about it? </sentence><sentence id="3048">We have suffered; we were in camps, and you were killing and murdering and doing this here, like this here fighting the Germans. </sentence><sentence id="3049">It was a strange story for them to believe, and it was as strange to us to believe their plight and their story. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3229">A: Originally, excuse me. </sentence><sentence id="3230">I must clarify that. </sentence><sentence id="3231">Originally, we were supposed to go to Romania. </sentence><sentence id="3232">At the last moment was changed to go to Budapest and get further notice. </sentence><sentence id="3233">We came into that train and it was a packed train. </sentence><sentence id="3234">There were nuns and Polish people of all sorts and who knows, maybe Czechs and everybody was traveling at that particular time. </sentence><sentence id="3235">On the roof, the men of us went up on the roof, to make sure there was a place for the women. </sentence><sentence id="3236">So the women were left sitting inside. </sentence><sentence id="3237">The men were either on the platform or else they went up on the roof. </sentence><sentence id="3238">On the roof there five of us, all former partisans. </sentence><sentence id="3239">We supposedly don't understand Russian because otherwise would have been a bad deal. </sentence><sentence id="3240">And these Russians were drunk and they are starting to talk amongst themselves that they are going to go downstairs to rape the women. </sentence><sentence id="3241">And then to go ahead to steal, they would take baggages and everything like that. </sentence><sentence id="3242">It's hard for  6 a person who hasn't lived through that era. </sentence><sentence id="3243">Now, we had a quick decision to make. </sentence><sentence id="3244">What do we do? </sentence><sentence id="3245">How do I know that my woman is not going to get involved, or his woman, the other one or anything like that? </sentence><sentence id="3246">We made a quick decision. </sentence><sentence id="3247">We cannot let these two Russians go down. </sentence><sentence id="3248">Since we were five of us there, we sort of split it, two, two, and one and then cover. </sentence><sentence id="3249">To cover, they were three -- yeah, they were three, not two. </sentence><sentence id="3250">And we figure when we come to a bridge while the train is traveling, we push that one guy to the right side, the other two to the left side, and the one comes back to help. </sentence><sentence id="3251">And since they were drunk, we know we would have no problem. </sentence><sentence id="3252">But it was again taking a risky chance, what we're trying to do. </sentence><sentence id="3253">And sure enough, as we came to a bridge within a couple of minutes we got rid of these drunks. </sentence><sentence id="3254">And now, we are driving, we couldn't wait till we get to Budapest because actually we are now we are fugitives. </sentence><sentence id="3255">We pushed -- who knows whether they got killed or didn't get killed, but we couldn't allow ourselves to remain. </sentence><sentence id="3256">Just maybe they will not, maybe they're just talking. </sentence><sentence id="3257">You know, it's too serious a thing, and knowing that we are on a mission with all of these here things that we cannot tell the whole thing, what it's all about. </sentence><sentence id="3258">And we came to Budapest. </sentence><sentence id="3259">As soon we came, we were told to be to the Community Israeli there, which it means the Jewish Community. </sentence><sentence id="3260">It was staged the first march of people to march to the consulate at that time and protest demanding the United Nations to grant Israel as a state, and we were the first people of that time to do it. </sentence><sentence id="3261">And remember, it was under the control of the Soviets while the Soviets were not as evident to see. </sentence><sentence id="3262">That's what it was -- the part not in Poland, not in Czechoslovakia, not in Hungary at that time were the Soviets as evident as when you went on the street. </sentence><sentence id="3263">You know you saw a soldier here and there and the other, and whoever were their own people we did not know for the rest. </sentence><sentence id="3264">And after that march, we were brought into the house, and over there they had them like bunk beds made up, and that was our place. </sentence><sentence id="3265">They had a kitchen so it was sort of like a community type life setup, and that was done in the former school, the Hebrew school, near the temple. </sentence><sentence id="3266">That's where they located us. </sentence><sentence id="3267">Of all things being together, the same rabbi who gave us the marriage at that particular time, he was one in that group, too, with us. </sentence><sentence id="3268">So they were sleeping underneath, and they were sleeping on the top. </sentence><sentence id="3269">As things would have it, come by night when we were all sleep, something broke. </sentence><sentence id="3270">I injured almost from that piece of wood that almost fell. </sentence><sentence id="3271">It's only a sideline which it happened. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3315">Q: Okay. </sentence><sentence id="3316">Let's change tapes right now. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3319">A: ... some of this here that was going, so I said within a few days, we got our briefings and we had to make new documents now. </sentence><sentence id="3320">Now, we are traveling to Austria with another pretext, and all of a sudden we were turned out to be right now Greek Jews that we are going to, you know, I mean, to look. </sentence><sentence id="3321">Because we never wanted to tell the destination where we are going. </sentence><sentence id="3322">It was they never questioned why do you go round about ways. </sentence><sentence id="3323">Maybe you should have gone some other ways, they didn't ask the questions. </sentence><sentence id="3324">And it all was done by the Red Cross and the Red Cross was just going along with our wishes, you know, at that particular time. </sentence><sentence id="3325">So we had new documents now made. </sentence><sentence id="3326">Everything is sealed, and they gave us to take along with us salami. </sentence><sentence id="3327">Everybody had to take so much salami and other things because we were told that the food in Austria at the time was very critical, and especially there wasn't probably enough hunts for them to go out and get it. </sentence><sentence id="3328">So while the means were in Austria, Austria was -  7 - I mean, in Budapest, in Hungary, the means of foodstuff and everything like that was easier. </sentence><sentence id="3329">So all of us had to give so much, we had to turn it in to the kitchen when we come to Grozny. </sentence><sentence id="3330">We were ordered that only in groups of three, no more than three people, we should pretend when we get off the train that we are people from the area. </sentence><sentence id="3331">Not to draw any attention as stuff like this. </sentence><sentence id="3332">People come off the train and they walked to their destination, we were given an outline of how to follow the strausses, that was the streets, until we reached their hotel. </sentence><sentence id="3333">We all knew that the hotel was in the center, there was another nearby, so there was no mistakes. </sentence><sentence id="3334">And above all, which I didn't mention before, while traveling like this here sort of as illegals, we used to get linguistic speaking. </sentence><sentence id="3335">For instance, when we left Poland to Czechoslovakia, and from Czechoslovakia to -- we were forbidden to speak any Russian at all. </sentence><sentence id="3336">We converse in Hebrew. </sentence><sentence id="3337">We could converse in Yiddish; in Polish, it's fine. </sentence><sentence id="3338">But Russian, for one thing, no. </sentence><sentence id="3339">Because we were supposedly going as inmates from concentration camps, and we had no reason to know Russian. </sentence><sentence id="3340">Then we were, for instance, going now from Budapest to Grozny, you converse in Hebrew. </sentence><sentence id="3341">He who doesn't speak Hebrew, speaks nothing, you know what I'm saying? </sentence><sentence id="3342">Because we were as a different element it goes on, and all of that was briefed to like I say I was a headman of 10. </sentence><sentence id="3343">So, in other words, you know what I mean, I was the leader of these 10 guys, and we all knew who the leader is, the main leader if any questions were. </sentence></p></dialogue>

" </sentence><sentence id="3884">Chicago? </sentence><sentence id="3885">Oh, I come from Chicago." </sentence><sentence id="3886">And I tell him the address. </sentence><sentence id="3887">I remembered that address by heart, because that was the way in Europe it was to continue into knowledge. </sentence><sentence id="3888">I used to -- my mother used to make write a few sentences to my aunt, and, therefore -- and write the address. </sentence><sentence id="3889">So this was the aunt, she was a favorite of mine as a child. </sentence><sentence id="3890">And therefore for writing for so many times, I remembered 4455 North Drake Avenue, Chicago by heart. </sentence><sentence id="3891">Did not have a zip code in those years, but the rest of it, I knew. </sentence><sentence id="3892">So I said to his soldier, I says, "Please, I bet you I drove my aunt nuts by now because somebody would go to Moscow, I would tell them here's the address. </sentence><sentence id="3893">Drop in the mail and say it, "Your sister's oldest son, Harold, is alive." </sentence><sentence id="3894">Somebody here would go to Carmos (ph), whatever it is. </sentence><sentence id="3895">So she got all this here over here, and she almost went out of her cotton-picking mind. </sentence><sentence id="3896">What am I doing?

</sentence><sentence id="3930">It was a remote thing we did not know. </sentence><sentence id="3931">So then she had to make the third time the papers when my daughter was born and she was born in Florence. </sentence><sentence id="3932">So all in all, from Modena, I sought to join a seminar now for leadership seminar, which it was created at that time. </sentence><sentence id="3933">And we had speakers from us one very outstanding Professor Garfinkel, which he became my idol for a while. </sentence><sentence id="3934">And at that particular time, we were with mixed emotions. </sentence><sentence id="3935">How do we train in the kibbutz these illegals when they come there?

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="4015">A: Correct. </sentence><sentence id="4016">The . </sentence><sentence id="4017">In other words, both sides wanted to hunt new blood. </sentence><sentence id="4018">You know, they were actually hunting for new memberships and affiliations. </sentence><sentence id="4019">I'll never forget one of the speeches, it was so many years later by Professor Garfinkel. </sentence><sentence id="4020">And I tried to ask a lot of people that question when it was posed, and nobody could answer it. </sentence><sentence id="4021">What does terror mean? </sentence><sentence id="4022">And a lot of people lose themselves to answer the question. </sentence><sentence id="4023">His idealism as a professor speaking to us, which he used, terror is an expression by a strong -- like he brought out Germany, like he brought out the Soviet Union -- who has nothing to lose and he can get involved in terror. </sentence><sentence id="4024">Terror is also a means by someone who cannot lost anymore either because he has nowhere to go, so it's as a last resort. </sentence><sentence id="4025">So he tried to say in his speech, Professor Garfinkel at that time, that Israel at this time is not in a way that she has a lot to lose. </sentence><sentence id="4026">So, therefore, by going to go ahead and extend terror at that particular time, we may lose what we achieved. </sentence><sentence id="4027">So, therefore, we should go ahead and train our people who go to Israel that they should join the left, , the Labor Party, which they were anti-terrorists instead of joining the right, which it was the Jabotinsky people who were pro-terror, that was their way of driving the British out and free the land. </sentence><sentence id="4028">As we all know the outcome in 1948 after big maneuvers and  6 everything like that, Israel was granted statehood. </sentence><sentence id="4029">Well, all through this time we had a big problem as of to prepare the newcomers to Israel that they should be aware of what's going on at least on both ends and let them make an intelligence like that. </sentence><sentence id="4030">So every time while I gained at that time leadership to become a leader for my kibbutz, and that kibbutz was not to far from Modena. </sentence><sentence id="4031">I successfully sent away from there a few groups, that they were trained and the training meant in a way almost brainwashing. </sentence><sentence id="4032">Tell them what's going on while teaching him certain trades, and being the kibbutz was always meant to do something and in a grand way. </sentence><sentence id="4033">And since we made a kibbutz to be near farms, so it was good for us that we were away from the city. </sentence><sentence id="4034">We could do more things that we wanted to do while the city, the government would not allow us for these here things. </sentence><sentence id="4035">And this is the way a network was set up of people to be sent illegally to bypass the British, because the British white paper came out at that time which forbade for the Jews even as the DPs to come legally to Israel. </sentence><sentence id="4036">So that's what had stopped a lot of escaping before the war broke out, and that's what had stopped afterwards. </sentence><sentence id="4037">But by hook or by crook, illegals were available. </sentence><sentence id="4038">These same people who faced the war and faced all its tribulation were ready to go back to Israel under all circumstances possible, and a lot of them did give their life right there in the first battles that ensued before Israel became a state. </sentence><sentence id="4039">Others survived and they remained Israeli citizens and provided a good home for themselves and for their offsprings. </sentence><sentence id="4040">But the fact remains that these people that after going through all the agony of war, being in the camps, us, the partisans from the forest, did not stop to say enough is enough. </sentence><sentence id="4041">But they still were willing to give their given years what they had with them to go to fight for a cause. </sentence><sentence id="4042">So again, we became new soldiers to go out and fight for Israel at this time, and no longer for our personal things ourselves and that was all about. </sentence><sentence id="4043">I did successfully have a few kibbutz and any time I ask my superiors when is my turn to go, "No, we still need you. </sentence><sentence id="4044">We still need you." </sentence><sentence id="4045">They kept on knocking it down. " </sentence><sentence id="4046">You get legal passage to Israel and you'll get it." </sentence><sentence id="4047">One day I come and I have the new good news to break to them. </sentence><sentence id="4048">I used to come to Rome or Milano, and we were near Milano, Milano was our point. </sentence><sentence id="4049">And I tried to tell them, "I have good news and bad news. </sentence><sentence id="4050">I said the good news is that I'm going to become a father. </sentence><sentence id="4051">The bad news is I'm on the road, how can I go ahead to do this here?" </sentence><sentence id="4052">And I did one thing which I want to admit to myself at that time again, a personal thing. </sentence><sentence id="4053">When I found out that my wife is pregnant, I took time off. </sentence><sentence id="4054">We knew that in Italy, there was some of the doctors from our forest that were with us. </sentence><sentence id="4055">And there were two doctors over there, Rockover (ph) and Mastniq (ph) which that's how he was he called. </sentence><sentence id="4056">They both were surgeons, they saved a lot of lives during the war. </sentence><sentence id="4057">And that was in Venice or Venezia, the way it's called in Italian. </sentence><sentence id="4058">They were living in a hotel. </sentence><sentence id="4059">I took my wife and made a trip to Venice, ready to do an abortion. </sentence><sentence id="4060">I'm glad she's not present, she doesn't like for me to talk about it. </sentence><sentence id="4061">And we knew that it was done, just like in the forest. </sentence><sentence id="4062">Dr.Mastnigq, as a matter of fact, died here a couple of years ago in Florida. </sentence><sentence id="4063">He says, "Yes, we are doing it, Harold, but we won't do it to you." </sentence><sentence id="4064">I says, "Why? </sentence><sentence id="4065">Please, I cannot afford to have a child right now." </sentence><sentence id="4066">He says, "First, yet you cannot afford for your wife to have an abortion." </sentence><sentence id="4067">I says, "Why?" </sentence><sentence id="4068">He says, "Look, there's a chance if we abort the first time that she may not be able to bear children. </sentence><sentence id="4069">You will not be happy not to have a family." </sentence><sentence id="4070">And I stopped begging him, I understood it. </sentence><sentence id="4071">And we both went home brokenhearted which later on in years in New York when I used to come to visit my father-in-law in the summer months with the grandchildren, and one day I go to my father-in-law, he says, "I'm going to say hello to Dr.  7 Mesnick (ph)." </sentence><sentence id="4072">I come into there and I show him my daughter. </sentence><sentence id="4073">He said to me, "Is that what you tried to destroy?" </sentence><sentence id="4074">I begged him not to talk about it because I did not want my daughter even to know. </sentence><sentence id="4075">She was too young even to be talked about a subject like this here at the time. </sentence><sentence id="4076">But it was sort of how much all the agony I could get, I even got it from this part, too, in the right way, and it was -- I was a joyful person after that. </sentence><sentence id="4077">Seeing that there is life and we got the rebuilding to do. </sentence><sentence id="4078">The only thing we had to stop at second child. </sentence><sentence id="4079">My son was born in Chicago; it was due to both children my wife had to have two Cesarean sections. </sentence><sentence id="4080">And the birth of daughter in Florence, Italy was a hard story to tell him. </sentence><sentence id="4081">So he gave me the same doctor, Manonovich (ph) was his name, he was also a refugee who survived from Greece, the camps. </sentence><sentence id="4082">And he gave me a letter when I told him we are going to America, and he says, "Please, don't have her suffer. </sentence><sentence id="4083">When you come to America, give that letter to a doctor. </sentence><sentence id="4084">So if your wife gets pregnant again, let her not go through with her pain." </sentence><sentence id="4085">And little did I realize that the same Cesarean section with my wife, by 5 o'clock in the afternoon, she got up, put her lipstick on, and it was, again -- in Italy, she was in a Catholic hospital, the maternita. </sentence><sentence id="4086">She was in the hospital for a whole month. </sentence><sentence id="4087">And talking the way people were nice to us, especially the Italians, they immediately understood that I was Jewish. </sentence><sentence id="4088">Most likely, I'm kosher; they did not serve any kosher food. </sentence><sentence id="4089">They couldn't bring it in. </sentence><sentence id="4090">Because I gave them the chocolates that I used to, Nestle's and Hershey that my relatives used to send me and the cigarettes, they permitted me, first of all, to have a bed in the hospital so I could be with my wife all the time. </sentence><sentence id="4091">I could bring in food from the outside like chicken, and they permitted me to set up there that I could cook for her soup and a piece of chicken. </sentence><sentence id="4092">So she had her means. </sentence><sentence id="4093">So it's undescribable to see it, it was a Catholic church, but Italians were very gracious to the displaced persons who came there after the war. </sentence><sentence id="4094">And I thought I want to bring that out whenever I have an opportunity to tell about it and I just did. </sentence><sentence id="4095">So when I came telling them that, they said, "Well, wait. </sentence><sentence id="4096">You can still be working." </sentence><sentence id="4097">A few months later, my wife at that time must have gone into the eight months or so. </sentence><sentence id="4098">They say to me, "Now, with your group, you're going to be taken." </sentence><sentence id="4099">I says, "I with my group? </sentence><sentence id="4100">No, I'm not risking two lives. </sentence><sentence id="4101">My group could be sent," and I says, "I want to be -- from now on, I'm going to go to Florence." </sentence><sentence id="4102">Florence, Italy was kept through the United Nations and all the other organizations as a place for the sick and the pregnant. </sentence><sentence id="4103">In there we had the facilities and the Jewish community in Florence was very supportive about it to oversee as to find us villas and so on. </sentence><sentence id="4104">And they would give us a lot of voluntary help to go on, so that we had a clinic there where a doctor were on the premises all the time. </sentence><sentence id="4105">And the pregnant women, as understandable, were an important issue at the time. </sentence><sentence id="4106">We saw so much destruction and we wanted to see a fulfillment of replenishment. </sentence><sentence id="4107">So we were under good car, so if anybody was pregnant and they wanted to be in Florence, it was an open city, like send them there. </sentence><sentence id="4108">Then we turned back into the United Nations, to Anwar, they used to get each month so much money, which individually we couldn't live on it. </sentence><sentence id="4109">But while we were living like in a kibbutz, we could provide it. </sentence><sentence id="4110">I went back to a kibbutz, but this kibbutz were really of people who were not going to Israel, but they were waiting for passage to any other country that would accept them. </sentence><sentence id="4111">And the majority did register to go, like I at that particular time registered to go the United States. </sentence><sentence id="4112">And we used to take, all of us, put in the money to sort of like a family, you know, together. </sentence><sentence id="4113">Everybody would get certain things we would sell because we could not adhere ourselves to the Italian foods. </sentence><sentence id="4114">Spaghetti was a new issue to us. </sentence><sentence id="4115">Polish people don't eat spaghetti; they eat  8 other foods, but not spaghetti. </sentence><sentence id="4116">The only thing in pasta we knew was, you know, to make other things, but not spaghetti. </sentence><sentence id="4117">So it was a new diet and it was new things. </sentence><sentence id="4118">So we used to have everybody served in the kitchen, woman or man took their turn. </sentence><sentence id="4119">And which we used to have a collective kitchen, and we would sit down in the dining room. </sentence><sentence id="4120">And we were culturally -- which I have pictures to prove that whatever we wore. </sentence><sentence id="4121">We did not just seen to come there and just have our meal, and we were creative in the same way. </sentence><sentence id="4122">And I awaited passage until I left. </sentence><sentence id="4123">Let's see, in 1948 in February, I got passage, and that's when I came to New York. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="4243">A: Correct. </sentence><sentence id="4244">It was a collective living type. </sentence><sentence id="4245">And we referred to them -- you know, which I have the pictures. </sentence><sentence id="4246">I will show them to you, which we called it a kibbutz. </sentence><sentence id="4247">Kibbutz Alvet, which we called it, which it was a part of the labor movement in Israel and it was culturally when on. </sentence><sentence id="4248">But we worked it in means of a kibbutz that way, that we would share the responsibility together. </sentence><sentence id="4249">We would all work together for all things that needed to be done. </sentence><sentence id="4250">So it needed to be done cleaning, our own people did the cleaning and cooking. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="4261">A: Okay. </sentence><sentence id="4262">We had found over there room enough in the villa that we were living to make like a synagogue inside of it. </sentence><sentence id="4263">And believe it not, one year for the High Holidays when I was the one who was doing the pray conducting, the prayers as a cantor. </sentence><sentence id="4264">And right up to the holidays when I got the visa, everybody was joking, saying, "You see, you prayed well. </sentence><sentence id="4265">It immediately worked." </sentence><sentence id="4266">So... </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="4273">Q: Did that feel good about it, to be able to be a Jew again? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="4275">A: It felt more than good, because like I say understanding that , which means I believe and being Jewish, this was the biggest expression by the survivors to give. </sentence><sentence id="4276">Much more than any Jew any part in the world who did not through Hitler. </sentence><sentence id="4277">Because we were the ones that when we came back and say we believe, that we don't come back with sort of blaming God for what had happened. </sentence><sentence id="4278">But the majority was when we come the conclusion that we always ask so where was man? </sentence><sentence id="4279">Why look for the invisible? </sentence><sentence id="4280">Why look to the thing that we don't know who and where? </sentence><sentence id="4281">But we do know where man is. </sentence><sentence id="4282">We do know that man did not care including the United States did not give a helping hand to stop. </sentence><sentence id="4283">They did not open their doors for immigration. </sentence><sentence id="4284">We know the facts that even the St. Clures (ph) when they docked which it was a movie made, "The Voyage of the Damned." </sentence><sentence id="4285">And a few among the people could not be saved even to let into the United States. </sentence><sentence id="4286">So you can understand that any one of us who wanted to return back to Jewish life, who wanted to start praying again did a  9 big issue with himself that we justified ourselves and we turned our anger, not to God, but our angered returned to man. </sentence><sentence id="4287">And any time whenever I wrote something about it or I spoke, I still ask the same question. </sentence><sentence id="4288">So where was man in those days? </sentence><sentence id="4289">And I still feel justified with my question. </sentence><sentence id="4290">Not to ask where God was or where God is or what did God do, I would not want to find out that there is a God who really tried to have us punished because of something we did wrong. </sentence><sentence id="4291">Because I believe that God is referred to me as a father. </sentence><sentence id="4292">God is referred to me as a person who loves me as a father, and, therefore, this type of god cannot go ahead to ask that I should be killed, murdered, maimed, all of these here things for disobedience. </sentence><sentence id="4293">A father does not ask for that. </sentence><sentence id="4294">A father does not even want to surrender his child for something little bit he did to community. </sentence><sentence id="4295">So when you say the return back to believe was easy perhaps at once, but you felt something is missing in our life that we survived. </sentence><sentence id="4296">And I believe religion was one of the basic things that we sought and we found ourselves in. </sentence><sentence id="4297">I have a lot about any results saying in many instances, but I don't want to -- this is not the place. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="4339">A: I wanted to make a point, and I'll read already it one more time. </sentence><sentence id="4340">I said God is invisible to us. </sentence><sentence id="4341">We don't know where he is or what he is, but it's part of our belief. </sentence><sentence id="4342">That is, the , [ believe. </sentence><sentence id="4343">What I believe in something really that other than created by man afterwards that we don't have a way of following the Moses or the things like that. </sentence><sentence id="4344">But the Holocaust, per se, I do no want to make that a God issue, that God punished the Jews, that's why it happened or any other ways. </sentence><sentence id="4345">I rather would turn to the things that is visible to us. </sentence><sentence id="4346">Man is visible to us. </sentence><sentence id="4347">We know, the mere fact that Germany, being the most cultural place of Europe at the time it happened could produce such an evil man as Adolph Hitler. </sentence><sentence id="4348">And there wasn't enough, after all the tries that they tried to get rid of him, to rise up against him and destroy him. </sentence><sentence id="4349">After what he did to Germany besides what he do in the process to so many millions of non-Jews as well as the six million Jews who he was having a war against the  0 Jews. </sentence><sentence id="4350">So that's my interpretation. </sentence><sentence id="4351">I cannot see the Holocaust in any other way or form as the war against the Jews because at any time, the preparation legally he got them through Nuremberg to make everything legal what he did afterwards. </sentence><sentence id="4352">Which I mean at this time, the humanization program, the right of taking away from all of them that they're not even humans; they're subhumans. </sentence><sentence id="4353">And, therefore, he prepared it so that the people should not feel that they're doing an injustice, but the people are getting rid of a menace or something, it's not so. </sentence><sentence id="4354">So when man let one person, one person's religion, if you -- I want to call it a religion, because he believed in it, in Nazism -- go as far as it was worded to let destroy people and destroy their offspring and so on. </sentence><sentence id="4355">How can I turn to ask for -- to look for the invisible or the person that I cannot speak personally or ask him questions? </sentence><sentence id="4356">This is why my conviction past World War IL past the Holocaust, remains that believing in the invisible, believing in the Jewish theology, believing in all the creation, that this did is something worth analyzing again, and it's something worth living. </sentence><sentence id="4357">And I remain Jewish, that's a fact. </sentence><sentence id="4358">I almost tried to get away with it as I told in my chapter. </sentence><sentence id="4359">And I'm happy till this day with the conviction I made not to work against the tide, but to go with the tide. </sentence><sentence id="4360">And I feel very comfortably today that I do not ask the Almighty what he did. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="4385">Q: During the war years, was religion at all important to you? </sentence><sentence id="4386">Was it a source of strength? </sentence><sentence id="4387">Did you resent it? </sentence><sentence id="4388">Did you think about it? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="4393">A: Perhaps it's hard for you to memorize what we did earlier, but I did tell you in the most horrendous days of my life being in the ghetto, that I was exposed and be with a brother to my father and he was a rabbi. </sentence><sentence id="4394">And I have told you the way he was speaking to me, that we must go on and doing it because in the 14th century with the , God had so much faith in the Jewish people that he could put them to an exposure like he did, and he had the faith in them that they will not convert for the sake of remaining living people. </sentence><sentence id="4395">But much rather they were strong enough to say no. </sentence><sentence id="4396">Do you want to be Jewish? </sentence><sentence id="4397">And they remained Jewish. </sentence><sentence id="4398">And, you see, the fleeing rabbis felt so distasteful with the trying to enforce on them that they threw on, as we call it, a herem. </sentence><sentence id="4399">A herem means forbidden. </sentence><sentence id="4400">That it was forbidden for Jews to return back to Spain, even after the change of government and rather because it was off limits sort of to speak as in modern language we would say for Jewish to continue alive over there. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="4441">A: Okay, all right. </sentence><sentence id="4442">Being the fact that I was in a Soviet underground, for me to think religiously could have been a bad way about it because religion was a no-no in the Soviet system. </sentence><sentence id="4443">So even in the forest, we had the politicians come back to us when the paratroopers showed up and the whole idea of brainwashing restarted again. </sentence><sentence id="4444">So for me to think at that time religiously would have been the biggest crime I could have done after to myself, speaking in the first undertone. </sentence><sentence id="4445">Now, in my inner sanctum, did I think of religion? </sentence><sentence id="4446">I used to look at the stars at night. </sentence><sentence id="4447">Being around and doing something and seeing the moon shining, and I would sometimes say, "God, can't you do something for me?" </sentence><sentence id="4448">So to answer whether I totally dissipated or got away from that, no. </sentence><sentence id="4449">That little spark was in me. </sentence><sentence id="4450">And I remember when I went out of that ghetto going to the forest, a prayer went up to me. </sentence><sentence id="4451">No more like when Jacob ran away from his brother, Esau. </sentence><sentence id="4452">And he sort of tried to make a contract with God. </sentence><sentence id="4453">Say, "If you save me, I will be your servant for all the duration of my life." </sentence><sentence id="4454">That night, with moon and the stars my witnesses, that's what my prayer was. </sentence><sentence id="4455">And maybe he listened. </sentence><sentence id="4456">But I did survive, but I didn't survive to fail him; I survived to go on, and I will go on like that. </sentence><sentence id="4457">I feel comfortable to bring Jewishness and religion into my house and through my family I have been a member of a synagogue all through the years being in America, even at times it was hard financially to do so. </sentence><sentence id="4458">So on that question I must say I feel good about it, without asking the questions. </sentence><sentence id="4459">To me, it feels the same thing as if a young person gets killed. </sentence><sentence id="4460">It's a pain, but you don't keep on brooding on it for all your life. </sentence><sentence id="4461">When you're reminded, you feel the pain again. </sentence><sentence id="4462">But you try to go with your life without brooding on it all the time. </sentence><sentence id="4463">That's the best answer I can give when it comes to the religious during the war and especially after the war. </sentence><sentence id="4464">I'm happy that there are still Jews in this world who want to go on and live as Jews. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="4495">A: In my life as a youngster on through coming to the United States, I stumbled every time on a tyrant. </sentence><sentence id="4496">Be the tyrannical part of Hitler, be the tyrannical part that I've seen before Hitler invaded Poland that I've seen from the Nationalist Party, be it the time when I used to go to school and rocks was thrown at me by children who lived in the neighborhood. </sentence><sentence id="4497">Not because I did anything to them, but it was always that one answer, you are a Jew. </sentence><sentence id="4498">And it sort of became a theology, being a Jew means you got to pay in any kind of way. </sentence><sentence id="4499">So even rocks thrown at you means part of you because it's not thrown at you because you are Harold; it's  2 thrown because the Jewish -- you are a Jew. </sentence><sentence id="4500">So I cannot help it but go on in the way I'm doing. </sentence><sentence id="4501">It looks like it's over. </sentence><sentence id="4502">You're ready? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="4511">Q: You were talking about how you were always castigated for being a Jew, torn between tyrants. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="4513">A: This is one part I tried to bring out. </sentence><sentence id="4514">I, for instance, always had to challenge a tyrant. </sentence><sentence id="4515">To me, the tyrant was when I remember one day during the war when I was with my grandfather from my mother's side. </sentence><sentence id="4516">And it was a debate at that time whether I shouldn't be let go to Vilna, so in Vilna I could meet up with the American Counsel, I can perhaps go to the United States. </sentence><sentence id="4517">At that particular time, my father would not permit me to go on my own, so he says, "See if your grandfather, after all, he's got all his children there, if your grandfather will take you to go with him, then you can go. </sentence><sentence id="4518">Otherwise, I will not permit it." </sentence><sentence id="4519">And that was the decision making that we had to take out a passport because the law came out whoever wants to stay here in the Soviet Union must obtain a passport. </sentence><sentence id="4520">That's the rule of the land. </sentence><sentence id="4521">Those people who do not wish to take out passport can return back to Germany which it was sort of a critical kind of way. </sentence><sentence id="4522">And there was some who did not wish to remain under Communist regime, and they went and signed up to go back to Germany -- to the occupied Poland under Germany. </sentence><sentence id="4523">And the fortunate thing that had happened at a later time was an unfortunate thing it happened then. </sentence><sentence id="4524">The KGB rounded them up by night on trucks and loaded them into trains, and to Siberia they went. </sentence><sentence id="4525">Those people survived the whole war. </sentence><sentence id="4526">Some of them were drafted to the army, they were of age. </sentence><sentence id="4527">Otherwise, they could join later on into the Polish Army that Stalin created into. </sentence><sentence id="4528">And so a bad thing of yesterday became a good thing for tomorrow, but at the time there was a tyrannical thought and a tyrannical thing that I grew up with. </sentence><sentence id="4529">And when I and my grandfather together went in to have a passport, the captain and the police started yelling it "How come" -- he didn't ask a question why you didn't come any earlier and stuff like that. </sentence><sentence id="4530">But in a blistering voice he sort of dared to speak so loud to my grandfather, which my grandfather still had the beard. </sentence><sentence id="4531">He always had the beard long enough to remind me of Casimir, The Great, one of the Polish kings that were in existence. </sentence><sentence id="4532">And I always used to refer to him, in jokingly speaking, which he wouldn't tolerate that, of course. </sentence><sentence id="4533">So again, even a little item like that over why we were late and I come and making the passport. </sentence><sentence id="4534">I couldn't tell him I wanted to escape to go to Vilna maybe wind up in America, that would be the wrong thing. </sentence><sentence id="4535">So I saw sort of tyranny in the workings. </sentence><sentence id="4536">Afterwards when I decided to be a good boy through school and I volunteered to go to do certain jobs, and I started believing that working make a person better and everything like that, I volunteered to go to work on the factory level. </sentence><sentence id="4537">It was near Bialystok where they were building housings for the military at that particular time. </sentence><sentence id="4538">I was a frail, in a way of speech, young guy who never did do hard labor work. </sentence><sentence id="4539">The hardest thing in labor I did was sawing, chopping wood or sawing that thing for the purpose. </sentence><sentence id="4540">Being a Zionist, it used to be a summer type of chore that you wanted to go help them. </sentence><sentence id="4541">The money that we were paid we used to put it sort of cooperatively, be able to go to a summer camp where we was practicing Zionist scouting and so on and so forth. </sentence><sentence id="4542">But I wasn't used to carry a wheelbarrow like, you know, that you had to be the husky kind of guy. </sentence><sentence id="4543">And I lasted two weeks, and while being there again, I found tyrannical ways. </sentence><sentence id="4544">All of a sudden when all the preaching to me was equality and Socialism, there I found out for the first time  3 of my young life that they had rates of pay. </sentence><sentence id="4545">One guy for the same work was rated one kind of a pay. </sentence><sentence id="4546">One kind -- the other guy was rated maybe less or more. </sentence><sentence id="4547">Now, that was not Socialism, that was not Communism; that was Capitalism. </sentence><sentence id="4548">I was smart enough to understand it from my school years when those subjects were taught in school about what Capitalism is and what Socialism is. </sentence><sentence id="4549">So again, in my own young mind then and even up till today, it was sort of a tyrannical kind of a way, okay? </sentence><sentence id="4550">And each time later with Nazis entering in the same way and going through the selections, right and left, and being beaten up, and being taken to Slonim to jail, and then winding up in a work labor camp until the partisans freed us. </sentence><sentence id="4551">All I saw was tyranny, and then I finally am the free man and I'm in the forest. </sentence><sentence id="4552">I'm already -- every time I turn around, I still see anti-Semitism. </sentence><sentence id="4553">I still see all kinds, that people are sort of valueless instead of being valuable. </sentence><sentence id="4554">You know how hard we thing about today when we hear an accident one person dead, a child died, or be from an airplane or anything like that, it makes font page headlines and everything like that. </sentence><sentence id="4555">Look how life meant through that era of years, be on the Soviet side, be on the Nazi side, life was meaningless. </sentence><sentence id="4556">For a guy to kill somebody even in the forest, he did not have to wait for a court martial as it was later years organized when the paratroopers, and all of a sudden life became -- be a little bit more with a meaning. </sentence><sentence id="4557">They couldn't go ahead, just pick the pistol and kill somebody. </sentence><sentence id="4558">They had to stand trial. </sentence><sentence id="4559">Even the police and Germans that we captured as POWs, they were not just taken out and shot. </sentence><sentence id="4560">There was a trial. </sentence><sentence id="4561">It was conducted in front of -- at least to make it look like a trial. </sentence><sentence id="4562">So again, tyranny is in work, so no matter how I put myself together in the picture when I started to write about it, I though the best title for it would be "Torn Between Tyrants." </sentence><sentence id="4563">I remember one time, it entered my mind -- and as a matter of fact, I even wrote a poem naming it like this here -- "Memories That Linger On." </sentence><sentence id="4564">But I did not find that to be strong enough to describe my living at a time and all I went through to be just memories that linger on. </sentence><sentence id="4565">Everybody has memories lingered on. </sentence><sentence id="4566">But "Torn Between Tyrants" stood up to me because really that's what I was telling in my story, and I am telling it today the same way. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="4621">Q: Do you think that that's still the way of life? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="4623">A: It justifies me of the past; however, I divorced myself of the tyrannical seeing and feeling unless I talk about the Ku Klux Klan, and I find that even in a free society as we live in the United States, that in order for us to be free, we must tolerate even the people who are not worthy to be tolerated, but that is really our freedom. </sentence><sentence id="4624">Therefore, therefore, I am not faced with a tyrannical way unless I think, just think of the story with Skokie when the Nazis wanted to come and march. </sentence><sentence id="4625">In part, listening and seeing that people have still this kind of gut feeling in them to do to prove that Hitler was right is tyranny to me. </sentence><sentence id="4626">Because again as I say, where is man to understand man? </sentence><sentence id="4627">If I'm right, I'm right; and if I'm wrong, at least point me out where I'm wrong. </sentence><sentence id="4628">You cannot always live by the lying propaganda about it. </sentence><sentence id="4629">So "Torn Between Tyrants" is not any longer a part of my life, but it was definitely a part of me and part of my life between the late "30s until liberation came and then after until maybe until I felt differently when I came to the United States. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="4637">Q: Let's talk about the partisans. </sentence><sentence id="4638">For Jewish people who went to fight with the partisans, was there a different commitment and a different situation than for the Soviet partisans? </sentence><sentence id="4639">Different  4 responsibilities, different . . . </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="4643">A: Let me bring in a little story over here. </sentence><sentence id="4644">We know for a fact that on many occasions that it happened. </sentence><sentence id="4645">That Hitler tried to use the partisans in focus among Jews, so what they did on a few occasions send Jews to go. </sentence><sentence id="4646">And they wired them, like I said -- not wire them as we understand it of today. </sentence><sentence id="4647">With certain criteria, they supplied them where to go and they'll take you in. </sentence><sentence id="4648">And your job will be to remember some of the things and come back, as their location, what are they involved, how much ammunition do they have, and so on. </sentence><sentence id="4649">And I cannot attest to this moment that it was anti-Semitism because I was not there listening to the trial or anything like that. </sentence><sentence id="4650">But the fact stands out that there were on a few occasions the Jews met their death, they didn't believe that they did in order to save their lives and were willing to give the cooperation of the Germans. </sentence><sentence id="4651">And they probably did it with the hope that they will be understood, so their argument was then why didn't they come clean originally to say, "Look, I've been sent here by the Germans. </sentence><sentence id="4652">I am to do this and that and the other. </sentence><sentence id="4653">However, that was my best way of escaping or coming." </sentence><sentence id="4654">So argumentive, who knows? </sentence><sentence id="4655">Maybe the person listening to their testimony at the time was not seeing the world this, he only saw to lull Jew is no crime. </sentence><sentence id="4656">So yes, it did happen in many kind of ways. </sentence><sentence id="4657">And Jews, even when I escaped and I came to the forest, it was not as easily as a guy from the local areas who did not want to go to Germany for labor or who did not want to be inducted in the German Army which they made all of those openings for them. </sentence><sentence id="4658">Although they had them in separate corps, you know what I mean, serving. </sentence><sentence id="4659">When they came and they escaped and they told their reason, it was on his home turf, remember. </sentence><sentence id="4660">He probably was not from many miles away, he was from the area. </sentence><sentence id="4661">And it was very easy, it wasn't a question will they accept him; it was a question only where is he going to be placed? </sentence><sentence id="4662">Is he going to be placed in our battalion or in another battalion, whatever it is? </sentence><sentence id="4663">But he had an easy home, much easier than fleeing. </sentence><sentence id="4664">Now, the only time I could say that it wasn't a problem was after the massacre in Germany, in Chita. </sentence><sentence id="4665">After the massacre, for instance -- or before that massacre in Bentschen. </sentence><sentence id="4666">When the Jews came, it was another story. </sentence><sentence id="4667">There was, however, a fact that from Chita, one -- the most intelligent at the time would have been in our midst, who rose to be an attorney. </sentence><sentence id="4668">And he was party, which again to say that's what Hitler tried to do, to annihilate the first thing, then come against you. </sentence><sentence id="4669">If he once he has the brains out, everything will be easy for him to achieve his goal of the final solution. </sentence><sentence id="4670">So he, a man came and organized a group, and he came to the forest. </sentence><sentence id="4671">He's been shot, he did not live in the forest more than days before being killed. </sentence><sentence id="4672">And again, what would you say? </sentence><sentence id="4673">Was that an act of anti-Semitism? </sentence><sentence id="4674">Was it an act of jealousy because he was intelligent? </sentence><sentence id="4675">Take it for what it's worth it. </sentence><sentence id="4676">I am not familiar for the time serving in that area as a partisan, that a Gentile person was treated the same way as that Voretsky (ph) was, you know, from Chita. </sentence><sentence id="4677">That we know a fact, and tell you one more thing. </sentence><sentence id="4678">We had a guy by the name of Bo Levine (ph); that was his name. </sentence><sentence id="4679">The man had the highest medal, he was responsible for downing more trains in our midst at that time than anybody else. </sentence><sentence id="4680">Sure, everybody knew Bo Levine, a blonde guy. </sentence><sentence id="4681">There was not much to see that he was, you know, six-foot tall, a husky kind of guy. </sentence><sentence id="4682">He was of an average height, you know, five- nine, five-ten, stuff like this here. </sentence><sentence id="4683">But that man had only one thing in his mind, what the tyrannical ways taught him to do. </sentence><sentence id="4684">Is to go and seek vengeance. </sentence><sentence id="4685">There were cases where we, all of us were involved in vengeance-seeking, because there were anti-partisans or anti-  5 Soviets, but then in some cases, some went to take vengeance to those that we knew who came into the ghetto and robbed from Jews or anything like this here. </sentence><sentence id="4686">Yes, we went to seek vengeance, too. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="4731">Q: So you're saying that for a Jew to go to the forest and be a partisan was a difficult risk? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="4733">A: Absolutely. </sentence><sentence id="4734">Absolutely. </sentence><sentence id="4735">He was another story, and I am talking now when you use that word, "partisans," I'm talking about if he came and fall into the partisans, that there were Soviet partisans. </sentence><sentence id="4736">If he came into the National Polish Partisans or in the Ukraine part we called them Bondarises (ph). </sentence><sentence id="4737">These here people were just doing the same job that the Nazis did outside, and they were poisoned by the same thing. </sentence><sentence id="4738">They were anti-Soviet and they were anti- German just the same, and Jew what they to. </sentence><sentence id="4739">So be that it was the era of the time that the poison of anti-Semitism got so many or be for or any reason to describe, a Jew was not treated to join in the partisans as easily as a non-Jew. </sentence><sentence id="4740">So this, for the records, I want to testify and make clear, that that was the case. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="4749">Q: You started to talk about the fact that you had to kill people. </sentence><sentence id="4750">You had to avenge those who had done you or your family wrong. </sentence><sentence id="4751">And yet, I see here a very, very sensitive man, and I'm wondering what gave you the strength and the toughness to do what you did. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="4755">A: I describe in many of the writings that I did before that humanity had to turn to savagery in order to survive. </sentence><sentence id="4756">Not because that's what their wish. </sentence><sentence id="4757">Even in my poems I say the same things about it. </sentence><sentence id="4758">It's very hard to describe the person you become. </sentence><sentence id="4759">To give you an analogy how we train to escape in case of a fire from a tall building, and the facts speak that no matter how much training we do when the real fire happens, people still get confused and they do things differently than they anticipated. </sentence><sentence id="4760">And the bottom line and the final analysis is that the curing was not because of training. </sentence><sentence id="4761">It perhaps helped but it wasn't that. </sentence><sentence id="4762">The same thing, situations of that nature as in my way when you had to think only positive in order to survive, because negativism would only be a matter of how soon will you be dead. </sentence><sentence id="4763">Murder, beating, or whatever it is, but how soon will you be dead? </sentence><sentence id="4764">So you could not project or map yourself out a program that this is justifiable or this is not justifiable. </sentence><sentence id="4765">And at the times, I don't know if in a bad situation what I would turn. </sentence><sentence id="4766">When I had testified in Skokie before the Nazis had to march, and I was at city hall at that particular time in Skokie, they asked me a similar question. " </sentence><sentence id="4767">Mr. Zissman, what would you do if Collins and his gang come to march on Skokie?" </sentence><sentence id="4768">I says, "I cannot give you a real answer. </sentence><sentence id="4769">Am I going to grab a stone, and hit -- throw at him? </sentence><sentence id="4770">Am I going to maybe to take a bottle, take it with me and throw a whole bottle at him? </sentence><sentence id="4771">I don't know the outburst that it could project, this is why I'm pleading with you do not let these people march because they will only create certain evil out of people who do not intend in a normal way to do that. </sentence><sentence id="4772">And this is my best way to analogize or use that metaphor to you about it, how could human beings do certain things? </sentence><sentence id="4773">I know from facts because of police when we captured them and they told us. </sentence><sentence id="4774">Before a massacre or anything like that happened, the Germans, they did not want them to be sober because people under the influence act totally different -- act totally different as they do when they don't have that alcohol. </sentence><sentence id="4775">So this is -- again, I'm only using that as a metaphor. </sentence><sentence id="4776">People change at times of  6 horror or stuff like this. </sentence><sentence id="4777">I was changed, too. </sentence><sentence id="4778">And I want to be making this testimony right now. </sentence><sentence id="4779">Yes? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="4805">Q: So to some extent, you become your enemy? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="4807">A: Your enemy or survival. </sentence><sentence id="4808">Or survival. </sentence><sentence id="4809">I cannot use my own enemy, I can use the word that you do various things to survive, and I would justify that because you have to. </sentence><sentence id="4810">End of Tape #5  7 Tape #6 </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="4815">Q: When you were fighting . . . </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="4817">A: Yeah? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="4819">Q: ... what do you think was your greatest difficulty? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="4821">A: Basically, at first when I was fighting the greatest difficulty was to get involved in killing because I still to this day do not want to use that method as what we were doing as killing. </sentence><sentence id="4822">It was defending. </sentence><sentence id="4823">It was self-defense. </sentence><sentence id="4824">Even the Bible tells us that if someone that if someone rises to kill you, you rightfully have the right to stand up and kill him. </sentence><sentence id="4825">So I must make that clear that our way was not that we were coming from a culture to say that that's the only way to do. </sentence><sentence id="4826">Our way was everything must be done in order to not let the enemy win. </sentence><sentence id="4827">Oddly the enemy was instilled in us and in me precisely about it, and I wrote it one time talking and interviewing somebody from the camps. </sentence><sentence id="4828">And I asked the same question, did the barbed wire electrified being everywhere in the camps, how come so few threw themselves? </sentence><sentence id="4829">I said I know and I heard of cases where people threw themselves on the wires in order to get it over with from all the sufferings. </sentence><sentence id="4830">But that wouldn't that be common sense to say in a case like that where you gave up life and you know you have no escape. </sentence><sentence id="4831">So why let the person get the best out of you? </sentence><sentence id="4832">Go ahead and get it over with. </sentence><sentence id="4833">But the fact remains that life is very dear. </sentence><sentence id="4834">That is the reason we stop sometimes to eulogize one little child who didn't show anything in life, and we eulogize one little murder that it happened and we take it at the same thing. </sentence><sentence id="4835">And this always must remain a separation between murder and self-defense. </sentence><sentence id="4836">We cannot take it as for granted that a person uses a gun to kill to name him a killer. </sentence><sentence id="4837">He sometimes uses a gun to kill to stay alive, to defend himself of the other one who is trying to kill him. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="4855">Q: Do you have any thoughts on why more people didn't fight? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="4857">A: Yes. </sentence><sentence id="4858">When I first came to the forest and for a while I was very bitter that I did not have a lot more followers like myself. </sentence><sentence id="4859">And the fact remains of the group that I had organized in the ghetto in Briesen, not a single one after all the talk with it, not one who was on my group or in my group at that time, which it fell through, survived. </sentence><sentence id="4860">Not one. </sentence><sentence id="4861">The best fact again is with my uncle, that he came out of hiding, crying and hugging and telling me why didn't you listen to your Harold? </sentence><sentence id="4862">And this is a known fact of life that people at times do not want to listen to righteous person, but then they come eulogizing why didn't we listen? </sentence><sentence id="4863">And that was the same bitterness that I had in me for quite a while that I didn't, even though seeing the hardship and the facts that the bottom line was that I was accepted. </sentence><sentence id="4864">Even if it took me three weeks to get there, the bottom line was that the four of us, when we came we only found one Jew who I used to feel hurt about calling him a Jew. </sentence><sentence id="4865">The man was assimilated, he had birth already, his parents were no longer Jewish and he was not understanding a single word, although the guy who came with me couldn't speak Yiddish either. </sentence><sentence id="4866">He learned Yiddish later during the period of time because  8 he was also sort of an assimilated Jew. </sentence><sentence id="4867">And I often used to, with the other ones, say, "I'll tell you, when I am here, at least I have a reason. </sentence><sentence id="4868">I am Jewish. </sentence><sentence id="4869">I don't want to offend you." </sentence><sentence id="4870">Because I used to talk to him, I says, "Tell me, what did you know about Jews?" </sentence><sentence id="4871">He says, "Nothing. </sentence><sentence id="4872">To me, a Jew did not stop for one moment to think." </sentence><sentence id="4873">I did not have a guilty feeling that I am not practicing Judaism, you know, so I says, "This is where my hurt feels when I see your hurt, I feel I'm hurting for something. </sentence><sentence id="4874">And here I see you're hurting for nothing, so I'm probably putting your case above mine, so please never be mad for my questions I'm asking you." </sentence><sentence id="4875">And I still proceed to say more should have sacrificed their lives by escaping instead of just justifying the means that there was no way out. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="4899">A: In my mind, if I remember when my son reach the age and he was in college and all of us Americans at the time had the feeling of Vietnam. </sentence><sentence id="4900">In our hearts we were almost complete minded. </sentence><sentence id="4901">My wife used to put me to that question, what would do if Michael is called? </sentence><sentence id="4902">It was a bad answer, but I did it. </sentence><sentence id="4903">I say, if called to fight, I would let him go and fight. </sentence><sentence id="4904">As a mother, my wife thought in those years the same as some of them could try with their sons to run to Canada. </sentence><sentence id="4905">Maybe perhaps if I was a married man when that happened influenced by someone I loved, or maybe be a father of a child or so, maybe it wouldn't be so easy for me for settle with fighting ideas. </sentence><sentence id="4906">So in a way I feel that the picture changes when you become a father. </sentence><sentence id="4907">The picture changes when you think of your son. </sentence><sentence id="4908">I remember the first time when I was in Israel and I used to look and all the questions that were on my mind before of Jews, that they are not fighting and this and that and the other. </sentence><sentence id="4909">And I looked in our family, here my first cousin -- he's married to a young lady that she's a military person. </sentence><sentence id="4910">She's by now probably a colonel in the army. </sentence><sentence id="4911">He works for a defense factory. </sentence><sentence id="4912">I took a look at my wife's family, where a father son, both of them, he survived as a matter of fact by being in Russia at the time. </sentence><sentence id="4913">But coming back when I tried to tell him let's stay together, why do you want to go to Israel? </sentence><sentence id="4914">I also wanted to go to Israel, but I didn't. </sentence><sentence id="4915">And he did not want to listen to me, to one word. </sentence><sentence id="4916">And he went to Israel, and it's true, the family got splintered, you know what I mean, and split up like this here. </sentence><sentence id="4917">But I know, and I was very curious to find out at the time -- as we know here, they both were fighting under Rabin at the time when they were there. </sentence><sentence id="4918">And I asked him, "How did you feel about it?" </sentence><sentence id="4919">He says if I had to go tomorrow, they call me and they call my son at the same time, I say we are going. </sentence><sentence id="4920">There is not such as well, you know mean, I have all of this here. </sentence><sentence id="4921">Basically, my own thoughts had I been in Israel, either I would have been dead by now. </sentence><sentence id="4922">But I would have definitely been in the armed services. </sentence><sentence id="4923">At the time in the "40s when I was supposed to go illegally at that time, I couldn't see myself becoming, you know what I mean, continuing my education. </sentence><sentence id="4924">Maybe the time will change, but primarily I know I would have been in field. </sentence><sentence id="4925">I would have been -- be that it was the Haganah or the at that time or later when it became a regular army, I know. </sentence><sentence id="4926">That's what my mind changed because of that, sort of that fighting was not any longer a trade of some and not for others. </sentence><sentence id="4927">But I saw fighting must be a trade of everybody, you must be prepared  9 to fight and not prepared just to dwell over books and signs and so on. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="4958">Q: You're talking about the spiritual fight as well as physical fight? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="4960">A: Correct. </sentence><sentence id="4961">Correct. </sentence><sentence id="4962">I think it belongs with each other. </sentence><sentence id="4963">Maybe in some other nationalities which I could not have the feeling. </sentence><sentence id="4964">I wasn't somebody else, I was me. </sentence><sentence id="4965">Maybe it's a different situation. </sentence><sentence id="4966">Maybe they in some nationalities look at fighting that it's a part of patriotism and the guy who didn't fight is not a patriot. </sentence><sentence id="4967">I believe it's wrong because not everybody can be a fighter, no longer that everybody can be a doctor. </sentence><sentence id="4968">Not everybody can be a scientist. </sentence><sentence id="4969">Not everybody can be anything else. </sentence><sentence id="4970">I say for a person to resort to be able to go to fight, I believe it's something in the person himself. </sentence><sentence id="4971">I cannot see that he's just going and lagging because these guys, they are the first one to raise that white flag once they are in the armies. </sentence><sentence id="4972">And I could not be thinking that way, but in the Jewish way -- let me speak to what I am and what I know. </sentence><sentence id="4973">I believe we must retrain our offsprings. </sentence><sentence id="4974">It cannot be said that a Jewish boy cannot go to learn how to shoot a gun or to go to a course where guns are being taught how to shoot and where, or the same story of being hunting. </sentence><sentence id="4975">We always used to have a criteria and a joke that when a Jew became a Gentile after he does everything else he could do with the Gentile in church and everything else. </sentence><sentence id="4976">But the story goes after he had to join him when he went hunting, he says that I cannot do. </sentence><sentence id="4977">Why do I have to go kill that animal? </sentence><sentence id="4978">And as we know, that's a popular thing, and we know for the record if we were start looking around, that few Jews are hunters. </sentence><sentence id="4979">But you say Gentile, it's sort of an inborn thing with them that hunting season, they got to go, they got to see that blood and kill that little animal, you know what I mean, or so on or the other. </sentence><sentence id="4980">Regardless what it is, but that's a whole admission to go duck hunting or to go deer hunting and so on. </sentence><sentence id="4981">I believe we must learn from history. </sentence><sentence id="4982">We are an old, old nation of survival, but perhaps it's time for us to look into it from a different perspective. </sentence><sentence id="4983">That to survive as we see the religious person with the beard in Israel and with the tefillin on his head, he stays and prays the gun on his arm. </sentence><sentence id="4984">We must tolerate it, not look down on it because that, I believe, is the only way of survival. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="5010">Q: To stay vigilant? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="5012">A: To stay vigilant and not be different this case than the other nations around. </sentence><sentence id="5013">You cannot go by the story of what at that time Esau and Jacob were blessed by their father where he told to Esau, "You shall live on your sword." </sentence><sentence id="5014">While he told Jacob to be -- it's good, meaningful things and I believe it doesn't hurt to do both. </sentence><sentence id="5015">You can still become a rabbi, you can still become a student of theology. </sentence><sentence id="5016">You can become a student what you want. </sentence><sentence id="5017">But don't look down that it comes a time that you have to resort to be drafted in the service and you have to go to defend your country. </sentence><sentence id="5018">I believe that's the way it should be. </sentence><sentence id="5019">We know past doing the Czar, during the other one, that the Jews were no good for anything but they drafted them in the service anyway. </sentence><sentence id="5020">They were good for meat for the cannon, for cannon meat, you know, and so on. </sentence><sentence id="5021">And there were, therefore, a lot Jews who did not want to go serve because they couldn't have the kosher foods, you know what I mean, served to them and so on. </sentence><sentence id="5022">And they would desert a lot of times because it was  0 against their belief religiously. </sentence><sentence id="5023">And in other words, why should I go fight for somebody that when I get through fighting -- the analogy would go again with the black people of the United States. </sentence><sentence id="5024">That when they had to go fighting, they couldn't be together with the white man who was fighting the same enemy. </sentence><sentence id="5025">So there are certain changes must come true in life as it goes on, and the changes is with understanding. </sentence><sentence id="5026">So to answer you, I am still a fighter, yes. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="5042">Q: Is there anything else you want to add? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="5044">A: Well, this part, I believe, you can talk and bring out more Biblical stories or more of the other one stories. </sentence><sentence id="5045">I used to say that if we were to hail after the kingdom of the day of David, King Solomon, we would have been another people. </sentence><sentence id="5046">However, we must understand that all of that happened when we were a country on own land, and in order to be a country, we had to have a military. </sentence><sentence id="5047">We had to have an army. </sentence><sentence id="5048">But when we were driven out or taken off our land, so we saw the holiday of poor what it tells us. </sentence><sentence id="5049">The story with Mordecai, the story with Esther. </sentence><sentence id="5050">Speaking about it, a lot of people see something missing in the while story, that it goes on, and at times they are very despondent. </sentence><sentence id="5051">Because look what Mordecai did, he told is niece to go ahead and get married to a non-Jew, which it remains questionable to a student who starts learning. </sentence><sentence id="5052">That student has to be so much accommodating to justify that. </sentence><sentence id="5053">For the sake of survival, you do everything. </sentence><sentence id="5054">I, for instance, justify what Mordecai did. </sentence><sentence id="5055">If that were the man that Esther had to go and engage herself to become that queen, that through way she could help her people if it meant her to go in on that thing and become at that moment to get married to a non-Jew and the outcome was that she remains the hero. </sentence><sentence id="5056">We don't call it the scroll of Mordecai; we call it the scroll of Esther. </sentence><sentence id="5057">So the whole story of Esther became. </sentence><sentence id="5058">So we can take it and see the difference. </sentence><sentence id="5059">If that would have happened in Israel perhaps like the high priest when it comes when it come with the story of Hanukkah. </sentence><sentence id="5060">He showed, he and his sons were the first ones to rise and kill these people who wanted to switch him over to the Greek mythology at that particular time and become of a different belief and the pig and everything like this here. </sentence><sentence id="5061">But he was a leader, and he rose, so maybe if something like that would have happened by one of the conquerors in Israel, we would have had another story to tell again of heroism when it happened. </sentence><sentence id="5062">But since it happened outside the realm and the country of Israel, there was only one way to do, is politically. </sentence><sentence id="5063">And that's what Mordecai did, he did a political thing in order to save the Jews at that time of Persia. </sentence><sentence id="5064">But it's confusing when you start reading at times and remain Jewish like the question is asked. </sentence><sentence id="5065">You can go on on so many various historical facts. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="5088">Q: Okay, but I don't -- yeah, but... </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="5090">A: But it's only going to come to the same conclusion, so if you want to dwell, you'll find it. </sentence><sentence id="5091">More and more to what I just am saying or said. </sentence><sentence id="5092">And I want to conclude in it in saying in order to survive as a nation for the years and years and centuries to come, we see the change and the change was started from Israel. </sentence><sentence id="5093">We see the capabilities, no one in the world with modern weaponry had ever created a thing like Entebbe where the whole  1 world was rocked, of how they did stand up and do it. </sentence><sentence id="5094">So that's what I am saying, you must stand up, but you must also train. </sentence><sentence id="5095">I'm all for the way it is in Israel, but I'm only against that one thing. </sentence><sentence id="5096">That they still give a person who is religious, they give him, in other words, a way that he can because of that avoid being drafted in the army. </sentence><sentence id="5097">I believe that cannot be done. </sentence><sentence id="5098">If that a person is a conscientious objector for killing, let him work in a hospital. </sentence><sentence id="5099">Let him work someplace where he can create his holy mission, save lives. </sentence><sentence id="5100">Don't have to go up, that's still a soldier. </sentence><sentence id="5101">A soldier who saved the other injured one is still a soldier. </sentence><sentence id="5102">He can still continue with his rabbinical or theological ways of prayer and everything like that. </sentence><sentence id="5103">But that must be done, we cannot exclude somebody because he is of religious belief that he should not serve in an army. </sentence><sentence id="5104">I don't believe in this theory at all, and I hope someday this will be changed. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="5120">Q: What you're saying is we need a commitment to community? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="5122">A: Absolutely. </sentence><sentence id="5123">It's community and country, belongs to everybody. </sentence><sentence id="5124">It cannot be delegated to just some, and the rest of it just to stand and applaud. </sentence><sentence id="5125">It's everybody's job and it's everybody's duty. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="5130">Q: Go ahead and stop tape. </sentence><sentence id="5131">What are we up to now? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="5134">A: Okay. </sentence><sentence id="5135">We're looking at an event that took place where two brothers with the beards are witnessing a marriage to we see the son of the bride and groom. </sentence><sentence id="5136">On the top line, you see me with a cap on. </sentence><sentence id="5137">Next to me is my mother. </sentence><sentence id="5138">Next to my mother is my father. </sentence><sentence id="5139">Below him, the bearded guy is his father. </sentence><sentence id="5140">And at the bottom row where we see children, so you see to my right that's my brother next to me. </sentence><sentence id="5141">Next to him with that little bib on him, that's my youngest brother. </sentence><sentence id="5142">Now, next to him is a cousin of mine which he belongs to this part of the family. </sentence><sentence id="5143">Then the last one to the left if my sister. </sentence><sentence id="5144">So there you have the family of all four of us taken on this picture shown at a wedding ceremony that it took place before the war. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="5156">Q: Do you remember what year this was and what town? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="5158">A: It was in the town of Ostrava. </sentence><sentence id="5159">I would approximately say that that had to be in the year no later than 1936, about 1936, you know, at the time. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="5162">Q: How many people from that picture survived the war? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="5164">A: None of them. </sentence><sentence id="5165">I'm the only one who survived of all of these here people. </sentence><sentence id="5166">Here you see a picture when there were visitors in our family and that young lady who's not seen in this picture was a photographer. </sentence><sentence id="5167">They came from a city called near Warsaw. </sentence><sentence id="5168">And it was our house, the background as you see, where my mother and all the four children are there. </sentence><sentence id="5169">My father, of course, is away on business, so he couldn't be in that picture. </sentence><sentence id="5170">So as you see, I and my brother are wearing the school uniforms because I attended a parochial type school where a uniform was a part of the attire that we had to wear. </sentence><sentence id="5171">So you see on  2 the top, 1am. </sentence><sentence id="5172">Below me is my brother with a school uniform. </sentence><sentence id="5173">Next to me is my youngest brother. </sentence><sentence id="5174">Then is my mother, and there is my sister, who actually she was the third in the family. </sentence><sentence id="5175">So this is what this picture is all about. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="5188">Q: Okay. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="5190">A: And, unfortunately, you see I'm smoking a cigarette, which looks like -- got me smoking in later years very young, but I'm very happy that I gave up smoking, at least almost 10 years. </sentence><sentence id="5191">So I'm on a tricycle in my city of , at the age of about three at that particular time. </sentence><sentence id="5192">By the way, all these pictures that we are going to be seeing, I didn't bring them with me, but I got them in the United States from the family -- from the relatives that they had it here. </sentence><sentence id="5193">And that was sort of gift to me about it. </sentence><sentence id="5194">This picture was a reproductive picture that I did do in Italy after I received the picture from the USA from my aunt with a big picture of the wedding at first. </sentence><sentence id="5195">That they reproduced it for me in Italy. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="5202">Q: Who is that? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="5204">A: That's my father and my mother. </sentence><sentence id="5205">The original pictures, I already said, was the first thing that we shot. </sentence><sentence id="5206">From that picture, I reproduced all of that. </sentence><sentence id="5207">And here is showing my mom and dad. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="5212">Q: What year? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="5214">A: I, again, would say like it was before. </sentence><sentence id="5215">That it had to be about 1936. " </sentence><sentence id="5216">35 or "36. </sentence><sentence id="5217">This picture was -- oh, not yet? </sentence><sentence id="5218">I'll wait. </sentence><sentence id="5219">This picture was done in 1945 when we first came to Italy. </sentence><sentence id="5220">As you see, I'm wearing the jacket like the Eisenhower army jacket that I was dressed in. </sentence><sentence id="5221">And at least it proves to me when I look at it today that I was young at once, even after all the hostilities that I went through and when I came to Italy. </sentence><sentence id="5222">Next to me is my wife. </sentence><sentence id="5223">And I believe our faces, if you want to be a good judge, will say that a lot of grief is looking from these faces from the past, which it was still haunting on us. </sentence><sentence id="5224">And that's the reason you see the seriousness and the grim look on the picture by both of us. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="5236">Q: One more. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="5238">A: This picture here was taken at approximately in June of 1945, where in my story I told us that we had in the military academy of Modena where we were stationed, it was about 7,000 refugees which 5,000 of them were ex-inmates from Mauthausen, who were brought in in one day on trucks. </sentence><sentence id="5239">And over there in this camp there was mixture of kids who came out of camps, who probably were taken to the camps when they were real young. </sentence><sentence id="5240">And at this time, they were 17 and 16. </sentence><sentence id="5241">And it was a tragedy, within a few days these kids went out on the streets of Italy and some of them got infected with VD diseases. </sentence><sentence id="5242">And, therefore, while I was working on the administration of the camp, our first plea was to all the people who came for us, which it was the Israeli Army stationed with the British together. </sentence><sentence id="5243">It was also the U.S. Army soldiers which they were nearby. </sentence><sentence id="5244">I don't  3 remember the army or which number they were in, but they were with us. </sentence><sentence id="5245">So our plea to them was please get these kids out and let them be situated in a separate camp. </sentence><sentence id="5246">So here we see in this picture a truck, and we see the image, we see some Israeli soldiers, rather near me where I'm standing -- I'm standing at the side here, and next to me the guy, Vina (ph), who's dressed in a sports coat and tie, and then. . . </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="5256">Q: You're in the white shirt? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="5258">A: Yeah. </sentence><sentence id="5259">I'm in the white shirt. </sentence><sentence id="5260">Then there is a soldier, an Israeli soldier next. </sentence><sentence id="5261">So in basic theory or story, what it is all about, that this was the truck on which one the youngsters are loaded on. </sentence><sentence id="5262">And there were about a few trucks, maybe a column of 10 or 12 pulling out of the camps, taking those youngsters in to a children's camp where there were only children supervised by trained teachers until they were taken to Israel at a little later time. </sentence><sentence id="5263">So here you can see for yourself the first survivors of the Holocaust, be from inmates of camps, be from partisans. </sentence><sentence id="5264">Like all these young guys that you see around me are former partisans in the forest near the forest where I was coming from in the same way. </sentence><sentence id="5265">Tell me what I'll say. </sentence><sentence id="5266">Please forgive me for the former frame, that it was I said on the left side. </sentence><sentence id="5267">I'm here on the right side of the picture dressed in the shorts, and my arms clutched. </sentence><sentence id="5268">Next to me is a partisan. </sentence><sentence id="5269">Next to him is a partisan. </sentence><sentence id="5270">And next to this guy is an Israeli soldier who served with the British Fifth Army, who was the head of the group who came to take the kids out of camp to bring them to their own camp. </sentence><sentence id="5271">The next one is Vina (ph) is his name. </sentence><sentence id="5272">He was also a partisan, but he was not in our forest. </sentence><sentence id="5273">He was in the Forest, which it was near Vilna. </sentence><sentence id="5274">So on this picture you will find people who were partisan fighters, former inmate of concentration camps in the back row. </sentence><sentence id="5275">And from distance, we see the truck where on this truck, the children who will be taken to their own camp. </sentence></p></dialogue>
