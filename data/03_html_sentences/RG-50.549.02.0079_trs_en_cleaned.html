</sentence><sentence id="154">So my aunt, who now lives in Israel, the one who just recently did this interview with us. </sentence><sentence id="155">She remembers every single detail and tells it over and over and over again. </sentence><sentence id="156">She sort of lived through that with me. </sentence><sentence id="157">And this was -- this was one sort of aspect also of the wedding, is that she -- she was very lonely in -- in Switzerland. </sentence><sentence id="158">She was married to my uncle, my brother's -- my brother's ha -- I'm sorry, my hu -- my father's brother. </sentence><sentence id="159">That was Yoshi and she's Monda. </sentence><sentence id="160">Monda and Yoshi survived Bergen-Belsen and ended up in Switzerland and had two children there. </sentence><sentence id="161">They lived from the beginning from hand to mouth, in fact they were in those camps, the relocation camps. </sentence><sentence id="162">And Monda got incredibly -- I don't know, I think I should say traumatized by the experience more-so than any of my other relatives. </sentence><sentence id="163">And her whole family except for her sister was killed in -- in -- during the war, and she found herself now in this new country without a language, without any means and -- and having these children, and she became -- basically she -- she -- she spent all her time cleaning and cooking and just taking care and cleaning to the extent of being really beyond no-normal cleaning. </sentence><sentence id="164">I mean, to sacrificing any kind of -- much social contact. </sentence><sentence id="165">And they lived in this very closed Orthodox Jewish community, where she didn't have true, true, good friends. </sentence><sentence id="166">And she tells me the story that even my arrival was a sort of like they -- you know, they were wondering, you know, how is this going to be, they didn't have much money. </sentence><sentence id="167">And how was this

they have to support another person. </sentence><sentence id="169">And I was going to the university and I needed a bit of money for -- for tuition and for travel, because I -- they were in Montre and I had to travel to University of Lausanne by train. </sentence><sentence id="170">And they were able to get a little scholarship for me from the Jewish community. </sentence><sentence id="171">But it was a very close community. </sentence><sentence id="172">And what she found, and I'm telling you what she says to me, what she found that -- that I became her best friend. </sentence><sentence id="173">Because at that point I was 19 and she was 30 some -- could figure out how old she was, but I can't remember it now. </sentence><sentence id="174">Anyway -- and when she found out that I had met my husband -- I mean my future husband on the train and when the letters arrived, she went through that courtship with me, and almost sort of vicariously lived through that. </sentence><sentence id="175">And so when the day came of the -- of the wa -- I mean, she remembers in detail what I said to her about, you know, when he proposed and -- and you know, where she was sitting. </sentence><sentence id="176">She was sitting in the -- she was working in the bathroom, cleaning something and I came and -- and told her and just exactly what I told her, you know, and so it was like a big thing for her, bigger than it was for me. </sentence><sentence id="177">I was like, yeah, I'm getting married. </sentence><sentence id="178">Sort of a crazy 19 year old, 20 year old --

id="181">So that I think, you know, she remembers in detail about -- and tells me all over again about, you know, my going to -- to get Dan at the -- at the train station, you know, wearing a -- a two piece blue dress with, you know, that was -- that was perfectly ironed and my nails were perfectly done, etcetera, etcetera. </sentence><sentence id="182">And   http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0079 deg it's funny because -- and of course, I think I told on the other tape that one of the -- anyhow, I don't know, that -- that one of the nice things that my uncle had done for me is that before Dan came and I met him again, my uncle said, you know, the wedding is all arranged for, which was fine with me, I hadn't do -- done very much about that. </sentence><sentence id="183">And -- but you have not -- you know, you think you want to get married, but if something doesn't go right, you have two
