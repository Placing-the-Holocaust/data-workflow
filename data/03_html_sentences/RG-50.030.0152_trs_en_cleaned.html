business. </sentence><sentence id="416">Jews were not allowed to have any jewelries, Jews were not allowed...all the restrictions started to come of us, and then the young people were supposed to go to work, and you could have buy out yourself of not working and pay somebody else to go to work, but the Jewish community had to deliver every day working battalions to the Germans. </sentence><sentence id="417">And life became, you know...uh...we had to adjust ourselves to the reality. </sentence><sentence id="418">That went down until probably February or March. </sentence><sentence id="419">I happened to meet a friend on the street which was one of the leaders of the youth movement where I belong. </sentence><sentence id="420">Uh...He was Mr. Borenstein. </sentence><sentence id="421">He was an accountant, a very intelligent fellow. </sentence><sentence id="422">And he was very pleased to...to meet me and he asked me of my address. </sentence><sentence id="423">And...uh...I did not know why he is asking and he said...uh...can I contact you at this address? </sentence><sentence id="424">And I said, "Yes." </sentence><sentence id="425">About 2 weeks later he came to see me in my house...uh...and he asked me if I would like to join the underground movement, which I did, and I became a member of the underground in the early 40s. </sentence><sentence id="426">We were divided in the underground that I only knew five people of my group. </sentence><sentence id="427">Uh...One of the five...uh...all of them were very good people...was the daughter of Mr. Dawidowicz, which was later on the...the husband of Lucy Dawidowicz. </sentence><sentence id="428">Her name was Topshire (Topcie), and she died...uh...she was not died. </sentence><sentence id="429">She...she was wounded in the uprising of the Warsaw ghetto later. </sentence><sentence id="430">Because she was not physically to be removed she remained in the ghetto after the uprising when the group left through the...the last group left through the sewers. </sentence><sentence id="431">But this is a story later. </sentence><sentence id="432">But she was one of the five which belonged, and then we organized other youth...uh...events. </sentence><sentence id="433">We...] became in contact...I started...was chosen as the leader of the five and...uh...so I had the occasion to meet another five. </sentence><sentence id="434">But really I did not know too many people. </sentence><sentence id="435">I was very, you know...we met regularly every week, but mainly our activities, strange enough, was involved around culture. </sentence><sentence id="436">We did not...our activities was to prepare culture events, to run an illegal library. </sentence><sentence id="437">That was...uh...most of our activities were and to listen to the news. </sentence><sentence id="438">We...that was the work for maybe for a year or two, just...uh...the    underground was a cultural organization. </sentence><sentence id="439">I was responsible of making sure to maintain the library to...and to make sure to deliver the books. </sentence><sentence id="440">People were reading books. </sentence><sentence id="441">People were anxious to...to exchange the books in those days where already the curfew and...uh...there were the house committees created. </sentence><sentence id="442">When I look back today about the time when these restrictions came but the ghetto was created, I think every house in the ghetto became a community because at 7 o'clock we had to remain in the houses and I was...uh...in that house where I was living, probably at 31, as a young man and when a community was created, I became the secretary of the community...of my house. </sentence><sentence id="443">And that were again community life and...uh...since there were no schools...all schools were illegal...I organized a school in mine building, and I became the teacher of that school. </sentence><sentence id="444">I was...I had never had a preparation of being a teacher, but teaching was mostly...uh....singing together with the children, keeping them together and the children came very, very eagerly to school because part of their work was a soup. </sentence><sentence id="445">And everybody of the children was waiting when will we get that soup. </sentence><sentence id="446">So a child was...the children were so hungry so that coming to school is because they knew that during the school hours they will get a soup. </sentence><sentence id="447">And that was the most important thing why they came to school. </sentence><sentence id="448">Then I was...uh...by coincident, I was given a job when the ghetto was created already, to work in a battalion on the Aryan side. </sentence><sentence id="449">That probably...uh...was a very important moment. </sentence><sentence id="450">I did not know after months I for the first time came out...out of the ghetto to work in such a battalion. </sentence><sentence id="451">The work of that battalion was...uh...to... to...all the buildings which were burned out, standing like ...like skeletons...uh....to demolish them, but not demolish them by demolish because the bricks were very important. </sentence><sentence id="452">So we had to take...go on the top of a burned-out building and little by little take off every brick and clean it because later on these bricks were used for building other house...building, not for the...they were shipped out from the...after we cleaned them, they were shipped out. </sentence><sentence id="453">These were not for rebuilding Warsaw. </sentence><sentence id="454">It was for...for wherever the Germans need it. </sentence><sentence id="455">And I was in such a battalion working, and somehow I came to the...uh...very...was...very...very helpful that I was able to buy during the day for the exchange of all kinds of clothing which I    brought from the...from the ghetto and...uh...the Poles to us and were selling bread against...exchanging against...uh...potatoes, against that clothing which we brought out and this was a tremendous help if I was able to come back with the ghetto which is also illegal and brought back some food. </sentence><sentence id="456">So it was not a question of getting a pay or pay for the work. </sentence><sentence id="457">It was a question how much can I bring back to feed the family. </sentence><sentence id="458">And...uh...somehow we were guarded by...uh...a German...older Germans which were probably mobilized as...uh...to...not for duties on the frontiers. </sentence><sentence id="459">And there was one German who was in our group, used to come every morning...uh...to take us out from the ghetto and to guard us while we were working and...uh...bring us back. </sentence><sentence id="460">I don't remember the name of that German. </sentence><sentence id="461">It was probably a man in the 50's, an older man or in 40s, late 40s or 50s. </sentence><sentence id="462">But he never screamed. </sentence><sentence id="463">There were others that were screaming cause we were...we were even afraid for the screaming of the Germans. </sentence><sentence id="464">He was never screaming. </sentence><sentence id="465">That means he was a good man. </sentence><sentence id="466">And whenever I turned to him, asking him for permission can I go across the street, can I buy a...can I take some water or can I buy a loaf of bread, whatever it is, he would always let me do it. </sentence><sentence id="467">And he was very much attached. </sentence><sentence id="468">Uh...One day he showed me the pictures of his children. </sentence><sentence id="469">And he looked at the...one of the pictures. </sentence><sentence id="470">He says, "Here is a...my son. </sentence><sentence id="471">He's in the army. </sentence><sentence id="472">He's like you." </sentence><sentence id="473">I did not understand what he means, he's like you. </sentence><sentence id="474">He said, "He's in your age. </sentence><sentence id="475">It's the same like your age." </sentence><sentence id="476">And...uh...I don't know what went through this man. </sentence><sentence id="477">He never spoke, but somehow he thought about his son, and he looked at me sometimes and he says, "He's like you." </sentence><sentence id="478">He's my age. </sentence><sentence id="479">I don't know what he wanted to say. </sentence><sentence id="480">If he is like you...if he's Jewish or if he's like you as a young man. </sentence><sentence id="481">But he...he was tremendously helpful. </sentence><sentence id="482">The underground, which I belonged, found out which there're doing the work that I was very much...have good possibilities of going out every day to the...with the battalion on the Aryan side and coming back. </sentence><sentence id="483">The underground started to get interested in it. </sentence><sentence id="484">And...uh...once...uh...somebody of that...the underground went with me and he came back the same night. </sentence><sentence id="485">He disappeared in the middle of the day. </sentence><sentence id="486">I don't know where he went, but he wanted probably to check out the way we are going in and going out. </sentence><sentence id="487">And we had to    be counted in the morning how many went out and how many came back. </sentence><sentence id="488">Nobody asked for names or anything. </sentence><sentence id="489">We just were counted. </sentence><sentence id="490">After a week of this...uh...going in and out, I got again a visitor from the underground who came to me...to my house and he says, "I want you to know from now on, when somebody will come and will give you that passport you accept him to go out. </sentence><sentence id="491">We understand it...the problem that somebody has to come back. </sentence><sentence id="492">We will always send somebody with you if we will have somebody to return. </sentence><sentence id="493">And that went out for a few months. </sentence><sentence id="494">And that was a tremendous good channel for the underground of sending people...of exchanging between the...I was...uh..just a simple person in the underground. </sentence><sentence id="495">I did not have any leadership role, so I really did not know exactly what they were preparing and what they were doing, but I felt...uh...like a doing a service. </sentence><sentence id="496">And...uh...this went on. </sentence><sentence id="497">I also was able to contact on the Aryan side some people which became very friendly in the beginning for buying and I made contact with them that even once during the boarding on the Aryan side, I asked the German fellow...the...the soldier who was guarding me if I...I can leave for 2 hours, and I went to a home. </sentence><sentence id="498">For the first time I came into a house after years in the ghetto and to see the way Poles are leaving everything normal. </sentence><sentence id="499">Everything when down a normal life, and that lady, Juliana Persch...uh... gave me a proposal that I can try to bring my family to her. </sentence><sentence id="500">I came back to the ghetto and told my father about this. </sentence><sentence id="501">In the beginning, he didn't want to hear about this. " </sentence><sentence id="502">What do you mean, we're gonna to leave the ghetto?" </sentence><sentence id="503">But this took a few months, but later on we used that contact. </sentence><sentence id="504">And we brought...I brought my parents out from the ghetto and I brought mine sister, the younger one, and my brother. </sentence><sentence id="505">My older sister was taken away, in the meantime, to...by the Germans...to the concentration camps. </sentence><sentence id="506">Mine...uh...(pause)...but one day at 5 o'clock in the morning when the first day...minute when the curfew was opened...uh...there was a knock on the door of...uh...a girl who walked in. </sentence><sentence id="507">My mother opened the door and she asked...uh...that she wants to see Benjamin. </sentence><sentence id="508">Uh...My mother says, "What's so early. </sentence><sentence id="509">He still asleep. </sentence><sentence id="510">He has to go to work." " </sentence><sentence id="511">No, you have to wake him up." </sentence><sentence id="512">She was very insisting. </sentence><sentence id="513">Uh...My mother did not know exactly what to do, but the girl was very insisting and...uh...she went into...to the room    where I was sleeping and she says, "Ben, wake up. </sentence><sentence id="514">Somebody's here to see you." </sentence><sentence id="515">I walked out. </sentence><sentence id="516">And I walked out and here was a girl or I did not...uh...I only...she only gave me the password and she says, "You have to take me out today from the ghetto.". </sentence><sentence id="517">And I says, "Listen, it's too early. </sentence><sentence id="518">She says, "Yes." </sentence><sentence id="519">She says, "I am going to sit and wait here because I must leave with you together." </sentence><sentence id="520">At 7 o'clock in the morning, we had to leave the ghetto and that girl went along with me. </sentence><sentence id="521">I really did not...uh...for me was another person of the underground to be taken out. </sentence><sentence id="522">I was used to this everyday. </sentence><sentence id="523">I did not even get into any conversations. </sentence><sentence id="524">I only asked her, "Do you know anything...uh...who is going to come back cause I cannot take you." </sentence><sentence id="525">And she gave me a name of who is going to come back. </sentence><sentence id="526">So I saw she...she was very informed. </sentence><sentence id="527">I took her to the ghetto...uh...to the...to the...to the brigade...to ..and when we came to the...uh...to the gate to go through, somehow, I don't know why....what was the reason, the German who was inspecting us asked...picked on...on that girl which I took with me which it normally was not happen...says, "You go into the booth. </sentence><sentence id="528">I got to inspect you..". </sentence><sentence id="529">Now I know that...uh...what happened with her that she had...uh...documents...the map of the Treblinka which was drawn in the ghetto by people who came back from Treblinka to be sent by the underground and...uh...to...to London. </sentence><sentence id="530">So we had to bring it out from the ghetto. </sentence><sentence id="531">She was carrying that document. </sentence><sentence id="532">While she was in the booth...while she was in the booth, the only thing which I know that her name was Feiga and Vladka, with two names she gave me. </sentence><sentence id="533">While she was in the booth, some commotion started and a shooting started on the outside and the German left her alone, not completing the search and run out to see what's the shooting. </sentence><sentence id="534">And there was a shooting about another group, not in the group with our group. </sentence><sentence id="535">She rapidly dressed herself and she came up with me to the group because we could not leave until and she...we walked...we were given permission to walk. </sentence><sentence id="536">And she was not completely searched. ( </sentence><sentence id="537">Sigh) Today, I should, you know if I recall it, you know, later on when I found out what she was carrying, I don't think that I would risk the life of the whole group because if that document will be found on her, probably the whole hundred people or whatever, all of us will be killed. </sentence><sentence id="538">I don't know if I    would make that decision of risking the life of the people, but I did not know. </sentence><sentence id="539">And...uh...she was also not ...uh... prepared that she will be...normally we were not searched. </sentence><sentence id="540">Anyway, after we went through and she came out and dressed and after we were on the trucks a few blocks, she jumped off the truck and I never saw her. </sentence><sentence id="541">I saw her later. </sentence><sentence id="542">Uh...This girl later on was...uh...I met her when I came to the Aryan side. </sentence><sentence id="543">This all story the way I met her. </sentence><sentence id="544">I asked for her because I wanted to know what happened with that girl and when I came back to the ghetto a lot of time the people of the underground asked me if I met Vladka on the Aryan side, and I really did not know who is that Vladka. ( </sentence><sentence id="545">Sigh) She was...she got very acquainted with me and I asked... met another man on the Aryan side and I kept asking if they ever know how I can contact her. </sentence><sentence id="546">This was the time when I already decided to live on the Aryan side. </sentence><sentence id="547">I already got the passport from the underground, not to be part of anything particular on the Aryan side, but just the...the underground gave me...uh...without any assignment, they gave me a passport. </sentence><sentence id="548">Uh...Zygmunt...uh....Frydrych, which was killed the first days of the Warsaw ghetto uprising brought me that passport; and...uh...1 assumed the name Czeslaw (Miedzyrzecki). </sentence><sentence id="549">The passport...uh...with all the stamps, all the photographs, all the recommendation and that's how I became Czeslaw Miedzyrzecki on the Aryan side. </sentence><sentence id="550">And | asked for that girl during...in the...on the Aryan side, living as a Christian boy already.l asked for Vladka. </sentence><sentence id="551">Finally, somebody made a date for me to meet at 11 o'clock at the front of the monument on a certain day. </sentence><sentence id="552">I don't recall today exactly when was that day. </sentence><sentence id="553">And...uh...here came Vladka. </sentence><sentence id="554">Uh...When she heard about me, she immediately said that she agreed to meet with me and...uh...that was our date, first date on the Aryan side. </sentence><sentence id="555">She as a full blooded Christian girl, you know, very well dressed and...uh...posing with a lot of her energy. </sentence><sentence id="556">I was a little bit timid, afraid...uh...scared. </sentence><sentence id="557">I was not so sure of myself, but we had that date and that's how we started to have that...uh...contact. </sentence><sentence id="558">In the beginning we met once a week. </sentence><sentence id="559">Then we started to meet...uh...almost twice, three times daily, and Vladka became later on my companion, my wife, for until today. </sentence><sentence id="560">It was a whole history how we lived    together as Christians both in the underground. </sentence><sentence id="561">Both of us could not reveal that we have contact with each other, even to our close friends cause that would be impossible to reveal. </sentence></p></dialogue>

</sentence><sentence id="915">I became very much attached to her. </sentence><sentence id="916">And I was counting the...the hours, the days when I am going to meet again. </sentence><sentence id="917">Now I know that...uh...our meetings did not...were not able to occur too often because she was involved in traveling to concentration camps. </sentence><sentence id="918">And...uh...once she told me that she's going to Radom and she asked me if I knew anybody in Radom. </sentence><sentence id="919">By coincidence I knew that there was...one of my neighbors was working in a...in a labor

were working in that concen...in that labor camp in Radom. </sentence><sentence id="922">So she was...she came to Radom...she had to look also for a contact. </sentence><sentence id="923">So she asked the inmates, she came as a Christian on the other side of the fence and she asked about...uh...who knew Meltzer. </sentence><sentence id="924">Naturally Meltzer came over. </sentence><sentence id="925">And she told Meltzer that she's bringing regards from Benjamin , so she had confidence because Vladka never revealed that she's Jewish to these people, but...uh...when they heard that the Christian girl is telling them that they have regards from a Jewish fellow which they know, they got confidence and she revealed that she is from the underground and she would like to help. </sentence><sentence id="926">This became a major contact for them and...uh...in that camp was Mr. Meltzer and there were other people. </sentence><sentence id="927">Among them were also Mr. Dunop. </sentence><sentence id="928">And Mr. Dunop...uh...she gave in that time and Mrs.Meltzer...she asked her to create a confidential group in the camp of...uh...put together a group and she will be back a week later and she will bring them whatever they need, money and documentation. </sentence><sentence id="929">Vladka has it quite well written on her book on both side of the wall she has a chapter about Radom. </sentence><sentence id="930">That's how I became a little bit more involved in know what is...what is she doing. </sentence><sentence id="931">As a matter of fact that were...Mrs. Meltzer...uh...gave a piece of paper to Vladka, and she says, "Listen. </sentence><sentence id="932">Before I was taken out from the Warsaw ghetto, I placed my little girl with a Christian woman. </sentence><sentence id="933">Her address is so and so...uh...in Praga." </sentence><sentence id="934">And...uh...Vladka took that address and the next day, she went to visit that little girl, and she took me along. </sentence><sentence id="935">And so for the first time. </sentence><sentence id="936">She took me along because probably she wanted to make sure if I identify the girl that this is correctly. </sentence><sentence id="937">So the first time I was involved through her in...in the work. </sentence><sentence id="938">Naturally, we came and we found that girl and we started to speak and I did not...she did not say anything that Iam Jewish. </sentence><sentence id="939">We both arrived. </sentence><sentence id="940">We came and we...we told that lady...Vladka told that lady that

id="942">Emile Coska. </sentence><sentence id="943">Emile Coska. </sentence><sentence id="944">And...uh...there was other children from that camp which we took over so it was twice...so the work was in the    underground of helping get documentation and preparing...you know, trying to bring out children. </sentence><sentence id="945">But that was my first experience of actually working in the underground. </sentence><sentence id="946">I was very restless and...uh...I was in hiding together with my parents. </sentence><sentence id="947">From that contact which I made on the Aryan side and it was in Praga__ 44, these people had their...some shops in the back of the house and...uh...that lady...uh...agreed to...to bring my family there, which I brought. </sentence><sentence id="948">We were about 9 people in that hiding...in a...in a small attic probably the size of...uh...5 yards or 6 yards, one way. </sentence><sentence id="949">It was a small hiding, but we were all sitting in that hiding. </sentence><sentence id="950">And I was the only one which was going in and out and working officially in her factory, which was a meat factory of cleaning...uh...pieces, you know. </sentence><sentence id="951">It was not far from the slaughter house. </sentence><sentence id="952">And...uh...there were all kinds of parts of the meat which they used for...uh...for butchery after

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1037">Q:How did you convince your parents to come to the Aryan side? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1039">A:Okay. </sentence><sentence id="1040">Well, I came back to my parents after working already daily, and they saw that the only place where I come back and I bring bread was from the Aryan side. </sentence><sentence id="1041">And they saw these deportations. </sentence><sentence id="1042">I start..uh...working with my father and telling to him, "Listen. </sentence><sentence id="1043">I have a place. </sentence><sentence id="1044">Let's go out." </sentence><sentence id="1045">My father was not so much convinced, but we had...we had very close friend from the same building which we were living. </sentence><sentence id="1046">He was the chairman of our...of our house committee and my father was very close with him. </sentence><sentence id="1047">He was...uh...uh...more, you know...uh...he was not...he was not a practicing so deeply religious Jew, like my father. </sentence><sentence id="1048">His name was Ziferman, and when he heard that idea, he said to my father, "Listen. </sentence><sentence id="1049">I want you to go with your son, and I would like to join you, but if you don't want to go at least give me a chance to go." </sentence><sentence id="1050">So Mr. Ziferman convinced my father that we should go to the Aryan side. </sentence><sentence id="1051">He had a only son, Adam no...Adam. </sentence><sentence id="1052">They changed the name to Novak. </sentence><sentence id="1053">Mr. Ziferman, Mrs. Ziferman came also later and after the war, they liberated...were liberated, came to the United States and they only survivor they brought died already, but the surviving is the son Novak...Adam Novak. </sentence><sentence id="1054">They changed the name on the Aryan side, Adam Novak, who was born with me in the same house...uh...a little bit younger than me. </sentence><sentence id="1055">So we were the three people of the Ziferman and we were four people...or...five people of my immediate family in that small hiding. </sentence><sentence id="1056">Finally, I convinced my father. </sentence><sentence id="1057">But here came the problem of my mother. </sentence><sentence id="1058">My mother was already...uh...not a well...was a sick woman and she did not know...very typically Jewish looking. </sentence><sentence id="1059">But my mother finally was also convinced and through these labor groups, I brought up later on...not myself, through others, I brought them out to the Aryan side. </sentence><sentence id="1060">But my mother came out from the ghetto with a...with a truck, not walking because she could not...not walk such a big way. </sentence><sentence id="1061">And finally I placed them all in that place. </sentence><sentence id="1062">And the only protection we had was Vladka, which she came to...to us very often to inspect and the other lady, the Christian woman, did not know that...uh...Vladka is Jewish, but she knew that we are somehow connected with the underground. </sentence><sentence id="1063">And we paid monthly for our upkeep there, but it was not because only of money. </sentence><sentence id="1064">These...uh...this woman...the Juliana which we were not only five....the two families, she had another two other families. </sentence><sentence id="1065">She really worked hard for all of us. </sentence><sentence id="1066">Whatever we contributed was really peanuts against what it cost, not talking about the risks. </sentence><sentence id="1067">Uh...But...uh...Juliana somehow was very much...uh...connected with the Germans. </sentence><sentence id="1068">She was...uh...of German descent, a full...she spoke perfectly German. </sentence><sentence id="1069">And to cover up, she used to invite a lot of German officers to her house and she used to make parties and we were always in the hiding in the other rooms while they had parties. </sentence><sentence id="1070">And this for her in...in the house...the...the Polish people looked at her that she is something...uh...which has contact with the Germans and people didn't want to have to do anything too...too much with her. </sentence><sentence id="1071">In the meantime, she was hiding us, the Jews. </sentence><sentence id="1072">Anyway...uh...but this place one day we were discovered. </sentence><sentence id="1073">And the Germans came to look in these houses for...for the Jews. </sentence><sentence id="1074">Luckily they did not find us. </sentence><sentence id="1075">Just by miracle. </sentence><sentence id="1076">If they would knock on one of the walls, they would found all of us. </sentence><sentence id="1077">We were...when they were searching the house, they were doing it in a very rapid way. </sentence><sentence id="1078">Somebody squeezed on us, but...uh...they did not know exactly what was going on. </sentence><sentence id="1079">And...uh...but the next day, after    that we were discovered. </sentence><sentence id="1080">We had to find a place. </sentence><sentence id="1081">And I found a place, a contact with the...with the cemetery in Praga...uh...Exactly how I came to him I do not recall, but...uh...Mr...uh...Kartosha, which was the caretaker of that cemetery...uh...I con...1 was able to convince him that we will move in with our family...uh...to ..-uh...to Mr. Kartosha on the cemetery. </sentence><sentence id="1082">He had a small shack on the cemetery living and he had...uh...a place for his goats. </sentence><sentence id="1083">Uh...The goats occupied a very small place and he gave us a little bit space in the room of the...not in the room...of that shack of the goats. </sentence><sentence id="1084">Uh...We really were not even able to...to sit. </sentence><sentence id="1085">It was enough space to...to stand, but at night he was allowing us to come into...to his rooms, small rooms and we were sleeping on the floor, be able to stretch it out. </sentence><sentence id="1086">What was...uh...very....uh...probably unusual that my father agreed to come with me on the Aryan side under one condition. </sentence><sentence id="1087">That he will take along with him the tallis and tefillin. </sentence><sentence id="1088">And the greatest argument I had with my father was, "What do you need the Sadaria? ( </sentence><sentence id="1089">Sidur?)" </sentence><sentence id="1090">He said, "When we will be liberated....we always believed that we will...we get...he will not part with this. </sentence><sentence id="1091">Anyway, I gave in to the conditions because if he would be discovered, my father had a very bad Polish accent and he could be discovered just by speaking a few words. </sentence><sentence id="1092">I gave in to this when I brought him out and he came along with the Tallis. </sentence><sentence id="1093">And my mother...uh... on Friday used to light the candles there on the cemetery for Friday. </sentence><sentence id="1094">They were practicing. </sentence><sentence id="1095">They were continuing to believe in this. </sentence><sentence id="1096">And...uh...1 was going to start out and to go out more and more to be in contact with Vladka. </sentence><sentence id="1097">This...uh...the one day...this was already in the time before the ghetto uprising which was becoming February, March or March...we knew that there... </sentence></p></dialogue>

</sentence><sentence id="1468">I don't think that...uh...more than 20 were remaining in the woods, and then from the 20, maybe 15 survived the war. </sentence><sentence id="1469">And...uh...that after this became the activity when the Warsaw ghetto was liquidated....the activities of...uh...the underground was how to help people in hiding and how to help people in their...in concentration camps and contacts, and there was also a thought in those days since we know that they are Hungary...this was 1943...that Hungary Jews are free. </sentence><sentence id="1470">So there was...uh...a trend how to be able to go to Hungary. </sentence><sentence id="1471">And I was almost ready to go to Hungary. </sentence><sentence id="1472">And in the meantime, we were living as and hiding on the Aryan side and....uh...we had a lot of losses, denunciations and...uh...Germans were very active. </sentence><sentence id="1473">The Germans knew that there's a large segment of people in hiding on the Aryan side, either by...uh...people...righteous people who tried to save Jews...uh...or by people who did it also by risking their lives and...but using....uh...this    as a means of making a living by hiding Jews. </sentence><sentence id="1474">Uh...Both of them...we are grateful to both of them, as long as we were able to survive. </sentence><sentence id="1475">But the Germans in those days knew

</sentence><sentence id="1479">How he came I don't know? </sentence><sentence id="1480">But the fact was he was in this, and he was also with two well known collaborators of the Germans. </sentence><sentence id="1481">Uh...One of them is Kosoftski which openly belonged to the work of...for the Gestapo. </sentence><sentence id="1482">And he was even carrying...that was the only man which I saw carrying a...a revolver issued by the...by the Gestapo. </sentence><sentence id="1483">Naturally, Kosftski was later on killed by the underground in Warsaw. </sentence><sentence id="1484">This was a later period. </sentence><sentence id="1485">And...uh...it became a situation that was first in a...in a...in a hotel in a different section. </sentence><sentence id="1486">I think it was the Royal, the name of the hotel. </sentence><sentence id="1487">Then we moved...they moved to Hotel Polski, and I would say that close to a thousand people living as...in hidings on the Aryan side were seeking to get these documentations. </sentence><sentence id="1488">In the beginning these documentations were very expensive. </sentence><sentence id="1489">You needed a fortune of

this thing...the repatriation is Mr.Guzik." </sentence><sentence id="1492">He says, "Guzik. </sentence><sentence id="1493">He's a close friend of mine. </sentence><sentence id="1494">Let me go. </sentence><sentence id="1495">Take me to him. </sentence><sentence id="1496">I will talk to him. </sentence><sentence id="1497">I will make sure that you getting a passport and...uh...we'll pay him back one day whatever is necessary." </sentence><sentence id="1498">And naturally I brought my father to Guzik, and Guzik...uh...met my father. </sentence><sentence id="1499">There was very little conversation, but Guzik says, "You want me to help your son." </sentence><sentence id="1500">And he said, "That's what I came for." " </sentence><sentence id="1501">Okay. </sentence><sentence id="1502">Are you wanta leave?" </sentence><sentence id="1503">He says, "No. [ </sentence><sentence id="1504">have a wife.

The...Vladka used to come and L...since this was a very safe place to be in Ireland on the Aryan side and if you came into this it was on Lugar, the street was Lugar I think. </sentence><sentence id="1509">Lugar 25 I felt very safe over there. </sentence><sentence id="1510">The moment you walked in you were free. </sentence><sentence id="1511">It was like an island. </sentence><sentence id="1512">So I spent most of the time there in that hotel talking to people and transports leave and Guzik sent his wife and his daughter. </sentence><sentence id="1513">So this was the best proof and we spoke to Guzik. </sentence><sentence id="1514">He says, "You ask me how is it." </sentence><sentence id="1515">He says, "I am sending my wife and my daughter." </sentence><sentence id="1516">And it's correctly, he did send his wife and his daughter. </sentence><sentence id="1517">So we felt maybe it is chance and from the underground papers we knew that something was going on that the Germans are trying to exchange Jews for trucks. </sentence><sentence id="1518">We did not know exactly. </sentence><sentence id="1519">But the underground never got a confirmation. </sentence><sentence id="1520">So as a result Vladka did not want have nothing to do with this. </sentence><sentence id="1521">Although she felt very bad that I have to leave and that's...she started to spend the last days to be with me in__, she said, "I am not going to leave. </sentence><sentence id="1522">I am not going to leave because we don't know anything about this. </sentence><sentence id="1523">We don't trust the Germans. </sentence><sentence id="1524">She didn't trust. </sentence><sentence id="1525">She didn't want to leave. </sentence><sentence id="1526">And I decided since I am one of five people of the family, I will go and I will take a chance and see. </sentence><sentence id="1527">And the first transport left. </sentence><sentence id="1528">The second transport. </sentence><sentence id="1529">I was supposed to be in the third transport. </sentence><sentence id="1530">But when the third transport left, it became really very...everybody could have obtained a passport, not for big

the office somehow everybody got a passport. </sentence><sentence id="1533">So that came a little bit also suspicious to us. </sentence><sentence id="1534">Why...why do you giving out so these passports so easily. </sentence><sentence id="1535">But in the day which I suppose to leave...uh...mine brother came the day before to say goodbye to me. </sentence><sentence id="1536">But somehow, he turned to be and he says, "Listen, Ben." </sentence><sentence id="1537">Naturally, he did not turn to me, "Listen, Ben." </sentence><sentence id="1538">He spoke to me Yiddish or Polish. </sentence><sentence id="1539">Uh..."You know I don't have such good features, Christian features like you. </sentence><sentence id="1540">You are very close with Vladka. </sentence><sentence id="1541">Here you are the ___ run. </sentence><sentence id="1542">Why don't you give me the passport and I will leave." </sentence><sentence id="1543">And the passport was with my picture with my

</sentence><sentence id="1559">The next day the Germans came with the trucks to take the people for the transport and I overheard...uh... a conversation between the Germans...and I remained there

You...you are going out with a boy having a good time." </sentence><sentence id="1881">Her whole credibility would be under question. </sentence><sentence id="1882">That means that she's not the only one who knows everything. </sentence><sentence id="1883">Maybe she shares some information with me, which she didn't. </sentence><sentence id="1884">Very little Vladka ever told me what she was doing. </sentence><sentence id="1885">And I was never pressing her to tell me. </sentence><sentence id="1886">So I really during the underground did not know exactly what she was doing. </sentence><sentence id="1887">But it was very embarrassing, but it's a coincidence which remains with us and...uh...but that...those bikes are...were very    helpful to us for the...she learned how to ride the bike because after the Polish uprising, we escaped due because from one place to the other because we knew both how to ride bikes, and we escaped on those...on these bikes. </sentence><sentence id="1888">So it was...uh...a good...uh...thing that she learned how to ride...ride a bike.

walked out on the street or I walked out on the street, I never knew that I will come back and she never knew that she come back, and she had many of mess ups. </sentence><sentence id="1949">She was

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2046">A:Uh...That was for me, personally, a period between 1943 and 1944, it's almost a year...uh...or a little bit less than a year, but in these few months,

had to parade in the city of Warsaw. </sentence><sentence id="2051">And I must say that although I was brought up in so much believing in humanity, so much believed that mankind is good, that...uh...goodness is...is only...is in mankind by itself, it's only the bad thing is being manipulated by government, by regimes, and the Aryan side, I was...I realized that governments and regimes

of my time in the zoo. </sentence><sentence id="2062">Cause everything which...uh... was human was...uh...first of all, it was a place where to spend time because I did not have what to do with my

shack, were very abrasive to my parents, never to the owner and never to me. </sentence><sentence id="2072">But they always knew that they are weaker, that they can push them and...uh...when my mother passed by and my father, the goats used to really violently push them. </sentence><sentence id="2073">And they felt they knew that my mother or my sister or my father will not do anything to them. </sentence><sentence id="2074">At the same time, if I walked in or the owner walked in, the goats were very, you know, watching us and listening what to do. </sentence><sentence id="2075">I also know that about...uh...remember a lady, Mrs. Shefner, used to tell me she used to be in hiding in a...in a place where there were chickens. </sentence><sentence id="2076">And even the chickens after awhile

and was afraid for every human being. </sentence><sentence id="2078">That was a tremendous blow to all mine revolutionary ideas of...uh...ideas of mankind, of goodness, of only...only the problem

I went...I went to the place of that bunker and I saw the place was untouched. </sentence><sentence id="2251">That means the people are there. </sentence><sentence id="2252">And I started to dig. </sentence><sentence id="2253">I did not know that they were there and alive, all of them. </sentence><sentence id="2254">When they heard me digging, they thought that they were discovered. </sentence><sentence id="2255">While I was digging dirt, they were on the other side putting more dirt, in effect, in defending themselves and also deciding if they're going to be reached, they will

not knowing that they were liberated. </sentence><sentence id="2263">Three days later...I did not go anymore for digging because I was scared what I heard. </sentence><sentence id="2264">I did not continue. </sentence><sentence id="2265">Three days later we found them alive on the street. </sentence><sentence id="2266">They recognized us. </sentence><sentence id="2267">Uh...This is one of the moments of an individual. </sentence><sentence id="2268">Uh...Then I and Vladka left Warsaw with another couple...uh...together ....uh...the boy was a Christian boy and the girl was Jewish. </sentence><sentence id="2269">And the whole city has to be evacuated and we were brought to one point. </sentence><sentence id="2270">For a few days...uh....before we decided to leave, I decided to get dressed as a woman. </sentence><sentence id="2271">And I walked around 3 days dressed as a woman and everybody encouraged...was encouraging me that I looked good. </sentence><sentence id="2272">Uh...The reason why I wanted to look like a woman I didn't want to be separated because with Vladka, I felt safer. </sentence><sentence id="2273">Parents I did not have anymore any contact with them and I walked out. </sentence><sentence id="2274">I walked around with high heels, white shoes, and    with a...with a makeup on my face, but I looked terrible. </sentence><sentence id="2275">Vladka used to tell me, "You look like a terrible prostitute." </sentence><sentence id="2276">The last day before I decided to walk out, I decided no. </sentence><sentence id="2277">I took off all the clothes of the woman of the clothes and I put back my...my men's dress suit or whatever I had, the shoes. </sentence><sentence id="2278">I says, "Whatever will happen will happen." </sentence><sentence id="2279">The only thing which happened, I had a little bit kinked hair. </sentence><sentence id="2280">And that was a weak point because...uh...usually Jewish people had kinked hair. </sentence><sentence id="2281">And I did not have the possibilities in all this time to press them. </sentence><sentence id="2282">So we decided that I am going to put a big bandage on my head. </sentence><sentence id="2283">And I was walking around with a bandage. </sentence><sentence id="2284">Uh...the bandage became so dirty that some people said, "Why don't you go in to see a doctor because you're going to get an infection from the dirt. </sentence><sentence id="2285">How can you have a wounded head with such a dirty bandage?" </sentence><sentence id="2286">So we can walked out of the city, somehow the German did not stopped us, but the Germans prepared...uh...wagons, horses and wagons, and the entire population to take those who are wounded to...because they couldn't walk the 20 miles to Pruszkow to where the trains were to take us to...because others to this concentration camp. </sentence><sentence id="2287">One of the Poles saw me walking...me and Vladka, and he saw me wounded...uh...and motioned with his hand come and we jumped on his wagon and he covered us immediately with a sheet and somehow...uh...Vladka he gave a Red Cross...uh...arm band and we were...I never knew who that Pole is. </sentence><sentence id="2288">He never knew who I am. </sentence><sentence id="2289">He did not think that Hitler was thinking that he's saving a Polish patriot. </sentence><sentence id="2290">And...uh...this way we escaped. </sentence><sentence id="2291">When the whole column of the...of the...of the horse...the wagons moved, when we came in between the woods someplace, we run out of that wagon, and we run and we came to Pruszkow to another city...town, and there where I was able to remain for awhile. </sentence><sentence id="2292">I rented a...uh...a small...a bed, with a Polish woman and husband. </sentence><sentence id="2293">I don't think that she...that they were from the high class society. </sentence><sentence id="2294">She was.. baby was...was not...she was not such a delicate person. </sentence><sentence id="2295">But whether I do, the Germans every night used to go around and look for the party...for the people who escaped to find them. </sentence><sentence id="2296">So I convinced them one day that, listen, it's going to be very bad if they're going to find us. </sentence><sentence id="2297">They're going to..not us Jews, they're going to take her to concentration camp. </sentence><sentence id="2298">And I convinced him on    his house on this 3rd day to build a bunker in the floor. </sentence><sentence id="2299">And anytime we heard at night that it's going to be, you know, there're going to look for the people, I convinced them that he should...we should both hide. </sentence><sentence id="2300">The woman doesn't matter. </sentence><sentence id="2301">But the men should hide. </sentence><sentence id="2302">And I pushed him in that hole laying but while...while he was laying with me there for 1 night, the second night, the third night he says, "Czeslaw. </sentence><sentence id="2303">I am not going to go in. </sentence><sentence id="2304">I am not a Jew, I should be hiding." </sentence><sentence id="2305">He didn't turn...he didn't think for a minute that I am a Jew, but he didn't want to hide himself. </sentence><sentence id="2306">And that day in the morning I talked to Vladka, "It's time to leave because I think he's getting a little bit nervous and there where the bicycle came handy. </sentence><sentence id="2307">We took...we had two bicycles. </sentence><sentence id="2308">We bought two bicycles and with these two bicycles, we started to travel to find different spots. </sentence><sentence id="2309">And one spot that we found because we knew about a girlfriend of ours...uh...which is now living in Montreal and she's the head of the Holocaust...uh...Center--uh, Krysia Starker. </sentence><sentence id="2310">We know...We knew that where she was living. </sentence><sentence id="2311">And this was...uh...we went in this direction to her. </sentence><sentence id="2312">When we arrived there and we asked for her...uh...this was , she said, "What did you do? </sentence><sentence id="2313">Why do you come here?" </sentence><sentence id="2314">I said, "Why. </sentence><sentence id="2315">What's wrong?" </sentence><sentence id="2316">She said, "This is the command...the command of the German Army." </sentence><sentence id="2317">And...uh...we had no choice.

<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="2999">Let's go back a little bit and touch on a couple of things. </sentence><sentence id="3000">Ben, the one thing you didn't give us at all is what life was like in the ghetto when you were in the ghetto way back when. </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3001">A: Michael, you are with me 10 years. </sentence><sentence id="3002">In the 10 years, I told you many stories. </sentence><sentence id="3003">I was trying through you to bring back and you knew...you heard a lot, but it's impossible to speak about everything and much more difficult is to describe everything. </sentence><sentence id="3004">There are scenes which are in my mind which I am not able to describe. </sentence><sentence id="3005">I am too poor with my language to be able to do it, but I was trying. </sentence><sentence id="3006">You ask me about the life in the ghetto. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3013">Q:In the Warsaw ghetto. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3015">A: In the Warsaw Ghetto. </sentence><sentence id="3016">The Warsaw ghetto is only a symbol. </sentence><sentence id="3017">There were other ghettos and there people were sacrificing lives in other ghettos too. </sentence><sentence id="3018">There were concentration camp. </sentence><sentence id="3019">But the Warsaw ghetto will be remembered for many reasons because Warsaw represents like the symbols for others. </sentence><sentence id="3020">Warsaw, I think, today life, especially Jewish life, is very organized. </sentence><sentence id="3021">I wish it could have been organized like this the years when we were there. </sentence><sentence id="3022">The war would be different. </sentence><sentence id="3023">Jewish life was organized to such an extent that every house had their own committee. </sentence><sentence id="3024">And we cared for each other. </sentence><sentence id="3025">We had no means, but we shared. </sentence><sentence id="3026">We were living under constant terror and more...more important, we were living under constant feeling of hunger and helplessness. </sentence><sentence id="3027">We were living in a world abandoned by the entire world, by neighbors. </sentence><sentence id="3028">We could have looked into the windows of our neighbors through the wall and our neighbors could have looked into the ghetto. </sentence><sentence id="3029">But...uh...there was very little reaction. </sentence><sentence id="3030">What was the aim of the creation of the ghetto. </sentence><sentence id="3031">Today, I start to understand this. </sentence><sentence id="3032">I did not understand this in those years. </sentence><sentence id="3033">The other was the concentration, a gathering of...ingathering of the victims under the conditions of making them...uh...impossible to live, deprived of everything. </sentence><sentence id="3034">Everything what we did in the ghetto was illegal. </sentence><sentence id="3035">Eating bread, which was rationed, was illegal. </sentence><sentence id="3036">Beside breathing, if you could, everything was illegal. </sentence><sentence id="3037">Schools were closed. </sentence><sentence id="3038">Children lost their parents. </sentence><sentence id="3039">around the ghetto hungry without any shelters, dirty. </sentence><sentence id="3040">We were suffering of that dirt. </sentence><sentence id="3041">Everything was lice were crawling about people on the street. </sentence><sentence id="3042">You could have seen not...not with the naked eye. </sentence><sentence id="3043">You could have seen more lice on the people than you could have seen the clawing. </sentence><sentence id="3044">All this was in preparation to give us a slow death. </sentence><sentence id="3045">But this was not enough...not at first enough. </sentence><sentence id="3046">But in spike of everything, we behaved more humane than anybody could have even thought about this. </sentence><sentence id="3047">We had culture events by the hundreds and thousands in those days. </sentence><sentence id="3048">Each house had a culture director, not director, a culture person in charge. </sentence><sentence id="3049">When we had to stay indoors, we had every night prepared a different lecture. </sentence><sentence id="3050">Some of them from well prepared speakers, but most of them by young people. </sentence><sentence id="3051">So this was not a life, you know, of allowing to ourself just    to disintegrate or to be brought down to the...to the way the Germans wanted us. </sentence><sentence id="3052">But it was done with calculation. </sentence><sentence id="3053">Today we know the way we were treated in the Warsaw ghetto, people were treated not a ghetto, there was a pattern. </sentence><sentence id="3054">Nothing was done in the ghettos by just by the will of the commander which came. </sentence><sentence id="3055">He came with a text book and with instructions how to create Judenrat, how to create ghetto, how to create the rationing, how to create the labor camps. </sentence><sentence id="3056">Everything was well __. </sentence><sentence id="3057">So when we speak about the ghettos, we should also remember the way the people, not only militarily opposed them, which is important, but the spiritual resistance. </sentence><sentence id="3058">In my building was the Rabbi, a very, very lone Rabbi. </sentence><sentence id="3059">He was in hiding. </sentence><sentence id="3060">And I was given the responsibility, because I was the secretary of the house committee to make sure that nobody knows that he lives there, but to make sure that food is being delivered to him. </sentence><sentence id="3061">But he has his disciplines, even with those terrible situations, I cannot forget they used to come. </sentence><sentence id="3062">And from their portions of bread to bring the bread for the Rabbi. </sentence><sentence id="3063">That the Rabbi should be not hungry. </sentence><sentence id="3064">The devotion to the Rabbi. </sentence><sentence id="3065">He perished later in a concentration camp. </sentence><sentence id="3066">Now...uh...from the point of view of getting information. </sentence></p></dialogue>
