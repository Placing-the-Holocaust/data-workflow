<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3">A: Johanna Newman, which is a rather difficult name to put on for this country that's what it was. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="5">Q: Where were you born? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="7">A: I was born uh on December 2nd, 1930, in Hamburg, Germany. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="9">Q: And did your parents ? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="11">A: I'm an only child and uh an only grandchild for the first five years of my life. </sentence><sentence id="12">My cousin Stephen was born in 1936. </sentence><sentence id="13">I was very close to my maternal grandparents who lived very near us in Hamburg. </sentence><sentence id="14">Spent many very happy childhood hours in their uh company. </sentence><sentence id="15">Had a wonderful relationship with my grandfather, who passed away in December 1935, and that was a great uh calamity to my young years. </sentence><sentence id="16">I became perhaps even closer to my grandmother at that time, and that grandmother played a very important role uh in my life. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="17">She still managed to get out of Germany. </sentence><sentence id="18">She was in America and when we arrived in 1946 we resumed that close relationship until her dying days uh in the early "60's. </sentence><sentence id="19">Uh on my father's side uh my grandfather lived in Berlin. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="20"> Unfortunately the grandmother, after whom I am named, Johanna, passed away when my father came out of the 1st World War. </sentence><sentence id="21">She died in February 1919 from the then-epidemic of the so-called Spanish Influenza and I obviously never knew her. </sentence><sentence id="22">I did know the second partner of my grandfather was a very lovely lady by the name of , well-known but the sister of the wellknown uh . </sentence><sentence id="23">Uh I did visit these grandparents in Berlin several times. </sentence><sentence id="24">I'm not  http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection </sentence></p><p><sentence id="25"> Uh the parents of my cousin are Lotta (ph) and Eric , and unfortunately my uncle Eric just passed away uh about two and uh since both my parents died within ten weeks of each other in 1961, I can honestly say that my two aunts and my uncle very much took the place of my parents not only to me but also to my children. </sentence><sentence id="26">have the same emotional attachment to these two aunts and one uncle as I have. </sentence><sentence id="27">Uh I spent many happy hours with my aunt and uncle after my cousin was born, and uh when they decided that it was time to leave Germany which was in March of 1937, they uh so-called brother figure and now had disappeared. </sentence><sentence id="28">They had left, and we were left alone uh with my grandmother She was not married and she left Germany after the Kristallnacht, in December of 1938. </sentence><sentence id="29">She lived with my grandmother and again with her too I had a very wonderful relationship and still do. </sentence><sentence id="30">Uh I would think that uh the loss of my aunt and uncle and my cousin was overcome in same measure that now school started for me. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="31">And I entered school, the school year of 1937, school in Hamburg uh called at one time School. </sentence><sentence id="32">Rather famous for it's girls school of uh high but by the time I went to the school it was no longer called . </sentence><sentence id="33">I believe it was closed in 1933 and the , but uh the buildilng was taken over by the Jewish community uh center, community council or whatever it was called in Hamburg when Jewish children no longer could attend school. </sentence><sentence id="34">And I went to this school. </sentence><sentence id="35">The school was one, at that point, perhaps on the scale of an American so-called Hebrew day school, a half-day uh singular subject and half-days. </sentence><sentence id="36">Unfortunately I only went to that school for about a year and a half before we left Germany but the year and a half I was there were very happy years. </sentence><sentence id="37">I remember my some of the girls that went to school and in particular the daughters of my parents" friend, friends, the Meyers, Dr. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="38">Meyer and his wife Edith and their three daughters, uh no, three children. </sentence><sentence id="39">Sorry. </sentence><sentence id="40">Two daughters and one son. </sentence><sentence id="41">One of the daughters, . </sentence><sentence id="42">The Meyers immigrated with us to Albania and the Millers went to America and , but when I came to America after the war in 1946, this was my first contact was Eve Miller and I think that I could say that really the clouds over my childhood did not begin until well, the death of my two grandfathers, which obviously had some effect. </sentence><sentence id="43">Uh in particular because they didn't want to tell me that my grandfather had passed away, which obviously UhI spent a lot of time consoling my grandmother. </sentence><sentence id="44">Uh I do remember but nevertheless it seems that my presence uh being with her did help her. </sentence><sentence id="45">Uh as, and obviously then my father had to go to Berlin, and again there was a the memorial candles that were burning in our home and I do remember that very vividly, and really both parents were in doing the same thing. </sentence><sentence id="46">And strangely enough both are my parents dying within ten weeks of each other and I was in for more than. </sentence><sentence id="47">Uh and as I say, I think that the first clouds that I can recollect obviously began when in October of 1938, one day the teacher came into our classroom and said all those children whose parents had immigrated into Hamburg uh please leave  http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection </sentence></p><p><sentence id="48"> deported, together with their families that very uh evening, and that was October 1938. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="49">Obviously that left some impression on all of us children. </sentence><sentence id="50">I don't know to what extent thet meant anything to us, but I'm sure it also created a great deal of uncertainity and insecurity of our parents as that did in itself must have been felt by the children. </sentence><sentence id="51">Then the next big event obviously was the 10th of November, 1938 - the Kristallnacht. </sentence><sentence id="52">And I have very vivid and very clear recollections of that event. </sentence><sentence id="53">Like every other morning I went to school, and uh this is not the uh era of radio and television and we didn't know what happened during the night. </sentence><sentence id="54">I was sent to school like every other morning, and my way to school passed a big uh Synagogue, the center of ,Jewish life in Hamburg. </sentence><sentence id="55">And in fact the city of Hamburg has done a great deal to uh bring the whole life of what they call the Jewish life under the which is that section of Hamburg where the orthodox Jews lived, where the big synagogue was. </sentence><sentence id="56">Uh they bought all this back to life with many, in many different ways, particularly the permanent exhibits. </sentence><sentence id="57">I think the place where the synagogue stood today has a memorial plaque which was only last year uh inaugurated and we brought the exhibit to in July which was wonderful. </sentence><sentence id="58">But nevertheless, this is the place I had to cross on my way to school, and what I saw was hoards of people standing in front of the synagogue, and throwing stones </sentence></p><p><sentence id="59"> windows. </sentence><sentence id="60">And uh as we arrived, of course we ran past the uh the place itself, the noise, the shouting, the screaming. </sentence><sentence id="61">I suppose there was an aura of because we still didn't know what was happening but I suppose just the mere fact that so many people were there </sentence></p><p><sentence id="62"> and throwing stones into the stained glass windows was enough to make us and arrived at school and were immediately told that our parents would pick us up. </sentence><sentence id="63">We should remain calm and we wouldn't have school that day. </sentence><sentence id="64">And indeed a few minutes later, or a half hour later or whatever the case may be, my mother did arrive and took me to my grandmother's home where my father already was. </sentence><sentence id="65">And here then unfolded slowly but surely the uh grim story of what happened during the night, that the synagogues all through Germany had been set on fire, destroyed. </sentence><sentence id="66">were burned in most cases. </sentence><sentence id="67">It is known that in Hamburg sacrificed themselves to run into the synagogue to save some of the , hid them and I believe were successful in doing so. </sentence><sentence id="68">Uh that the had been demolished. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="69">merchandise had been thrown into the streets covered with water and with ink and I mean it was chaos and total destruction. </sentence><sentence id="70">Uh my father decided that he had to see for himself what was happening and indeed did go into the downtown area of Hamburg. </sentence><sentence id="71">He came back . </sentence><sentence id="72">In the meantime uh many uh men who had arrived for their usual place of work were already being imprisoned or taken off to uh police stations and eventually ended up in Dachau or in or many other places that at that time already existed as uh concentration camps. </sentence><sentence id="73">I'm not sure whether Mauthausen was already in existence but Dachau and were. </sentence><sentence id="74">And my aunt at that time was engaged to be married to a man by the name. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="75"> and he had arrived at work and was immediately taken by the police to . </sentence><sentence id="76">We stayed the entire day with my grandmother, so the events that were taking place and this was as I said the center Jewish life, so obviously knew where the Jews lived my  http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection </sentence></p><p><sentence id="77"> this was a pogram (ph) that would last for an entire week. </sentence><sentence id="78">We thought that this would be over in twenty-four hours or that day or whatever. </sentence><sentence id="79">And at night we did go home uh much against everybody's advice, but my father insisted that uh he was going to sleep in his own home and he was not going to be intimidated. </sentence><sentence id="80">And we did go home that evening and uh slept in our apartment. </sentence><sentence id="81">I don't believe that too much happened during the night. </sentence><sentence id="82">They may have knocked on our door. </sentence><sentence id="83">We didn't answer uh the door, but the next morning we took a few possessions and decided to go and stay with my grandmother for the duration of the pogrom again known to anybody. </sentence><sentence id="84">Uh I believe that either that day or the next day my father and the friend of the, their's uh Dr. , uh decided to go out of town and I'm not sure how they made their way, to summer resort called . </sentence><sentence id="85">It's outside of Hamburg. </sentence><sentence id="86">It was the for being prepared for uh Palestine at that time, and also a children's home. </sentence><sentence id="87">In fact I spent one summer there as a child. </sentence><sentence id="88">And uh this uh was surrounded by a forest, and I believe that however many Jews took refugee in spent the days in the forest. </sentence><sentence id="89">Maybe the nights too. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="90"> for some reason I guess the SS never got down there, and did not imprison anyone </sentence></p><p><sentence id="91"> that was there. </sentence><sentence id="92">My father stayed there for the duration of the pogram, What they did is they manufactured uh leather gloves for work people. </sentence><sentence id="93">All kinds of gloves for different professions. </sentence><sentence id="94">And my father had designed a specific glove which was patented and I have the patent at home, which perhaps would, will become an artifact if the Museum is interested in it. </sentence><sentence id="95">Uh he had designed a glove with a certain reinforcement which made these gloves more uh economical to use or longer lasting let's say, uh with certain reinforcements on the palm, and these were gloves for all kinds of industry. </sentence><sentence id="96">And in fact if anything his you know mere talking in the era of course after the big depression un in Germany, across the world I should say, uh and he had really with this business that he had built up in Berlin, worked his way up tremendously during the last few years, and ironically as it may sound because of the war industry that was taking place already at that time in Germany, his orders and his business dropped quite considerably and uh until the Kristallnacht and when business sort of became impossible. </sentence><sentence id="97">Uh Jews were no longer allowed to . </sentence><sentence id="98">Un one other event that did take place and which unfortunakely in my book I made a mistake in the date, saying that it took place in August of 1939. </sentence><sentence id="99">It has been corrected, but nevertheless went down as "39, but obviously it took place in August of 1938, and that a decree by the government that all Jews, male and female, had to adopt a Jewish name. </sentence><sentence id="100">And you had to add your middle name to your name, the middle name. </sentence><sentence id="101">All women became Sarah and all men became Israel. </sentence><sentence id="102">So that now my name became Johanna Yuta (ph) Sarah Gerechter and my mother was Alice Sarah Gerechter and my father was Siegbert Israel Gerechter. </sentence><sentence id="103">And it's interesting that I realized that even people like my own son and daughter-in-law never heard of this uh law that one can be forced to add a name to their existing name. </sentence><sentence id="104">And how come that people didn't become suspicious enough to just throw everything away but uh they didn't. </sentence><sentence id="105">Uh my father had maintained that he had been a uh high officer during World War I. He had the Iron Cross. </sentence><sentence id="106">He had received in 1935 a cross which was given only to all front line fighters, meaning people who for four years of the Ist World War spent it on the front line, and how could the same men now deny him an existence or a livelihood and would throw him out. </sentence><sentence id="107">I mean that was something . [ </sentence><sentence id="108">believe that it was part of the psychology played by the Germans. </sentence><sentence id="109">Psychology played a very very uh important and powerful role I think can tell from the fact that people would be deported and yet  http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection </sentence></p><p><sentence id="110"> obviously many of the other uh daily uh amenities of life. </sentence><sentence id="111">I'm a child. </sentence><sentence id="112">I'm panic- stricken or very fearful. </sentence><sentence id="113">The thing I expressed in my book, a feeling of constant fear. </sentence><sentence id="114">Uh I remember events such as uh, what do you call it, uh air raid alarms . </sentence><sentence id="115">Of course we Jews were not allowed to go to an air raid uh shelter, even at that stage of the game. </sentence><sentence id="116">But you had to uh comply with and you were being tested whether that was well enough done so not a not a ray of light would come out. </sentence><sentence id="117">And we had to stay in our apartment. </sentence><sentence id="118">The sirens would go. </sentence><sentence id="119">The uh uh fire department would do whatever they were instructed to do, and I remember a tremendous fear, feeling of fear. </sentence><sentence id="120">I mean I can feel that fear even today. </sentence><sentence id="121">I think I can feel the fear that I experienced the night that we went home to uh back to our own apartment Kristallnach the feeling that my father would be taken. </sentence><sentence id="122">I think that I had enough understanding to realize what that would mean. </sentence><sentence id="123">And the tremendous fear . </sentence><sentence id="124">Uh this used to I guess that goes way back to 1935, "36 when the big rallies or uh big taking place speak to his supporters, to his uh the masses of </sentence></p><p><sentence id="125"> and these would be broadcast on the radio stations. </sentence><sentence id="126">And people would put on their </sentence></p><p><sentence id="127"> radios, and I remember but this must have been summer time. </sentence><sentence id="128">Windows were open and I was supposed to go to sleep, and I could hear this voice and it is something that I recall vividly and that feeling of fear surfaced all over again. </sentence><sentence id="129">I could feel it like I felt  http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection </sentence></p><p><sentence id="130"> thorough job, so I'm sure that I can go back much further. </sentence><sentence id="131">Uh my father's family even though he was born in which was the heart of Prussia, uh under American law after the after the uh Ist World War it had been ceased (ph) to Poland and according to American law it was Polish and therefore he went on the Polish quota, which caused all the problems that it caused that we couldn't get to America before the war. </sentence><sentence id="132">But nevertheless, he in his own heart was a German and had always been a German. </sentence><sentence id="133">And uh I have to say that today perhaps I can understand it much better that they had such trust that this could never happen to them. </sentence><sentence id="134">Uh I don't know how, I don't really know how much would an American Jew who has been here for several generations, if the same situation would confront him, though he has the experience of only fifty years ago in the in the back of his mind, but how much would he feel that something so drastic, so total and so inhuman could take place. </sentence><sentence id="135">I I'm not sure. </sentence><sentence id="136">But nevertheless this was the feeling. </sentence><sentence id="137">So that my parents did not register very early for the American quota. </sentence><sentence id="138">My mother and I both having been born in Germany had not, no great problems. </sentence><sentence id="139">The quota, our quota came up very quickly, and we could have left for America several times before leaving for Albania. </sentence><sentence id="140">I think we were called to the Consule at least twice if not three times. </sentence><sentence id="141">However, my father according to American law, went on the Polish quota, and that was a small quota and this was, and he had a high number because many eastern European Jews had registered much much earlier. </sentence><sentence id="142">And of course we weren't going to leave without him, so needless to say each time we gave up our quota and someone else possibly left in our stead. </sentence><sentence id="143">I believe did. </sentence><sentence id="144">So that here in the, and the uh Meyer family had not registered early so they really could not leave Hamburg. </sentence><sentence id="145">They had to also find another asylum. </sentence><sentence id="146">And it was exactly that. </sentence><sentence id="147">It was a search for an asylum no matter where. </sentence><sentence id="148">And uh the passibilities were very very slim. </sentence><sentence id="149">They thought of England. </sentence><sentence id="150">Well England required quite a substantial amount of money as the security deposit for every one that uh entered England. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="151">I'm not sure what the amount was and I don't think that my parents could have afforded that, and neither apparently could the uh Meyer family, so that we had to find other ways out. </sentence><sentence id="152">Uh my father I believe had uh - no, not I believe, I know - had cousins in Argentina. </sentence><sentence id="153">Was very difficult to get into Argentina. </sentence><sentence id="154">You had to prove that you were some how or other uh connected professionally to agriculture, and of course that he couldn't prove. </sentence><sentence id="155">He was a business man, through and through. </sentence><sentence id="156">So that was out. </sentence><sentence id="157">So somehow, and I'm not quite a hundred percent sure how this Albania uh possibility surfaced, but what I had heard always was my mother had met the Albanian attache to Germany at a bridge party, and uh during the conversation it turned out that he was about to be married and wanted to go ona honey...his honeymoon to Switzerland. </sentence><sentence id="158">And uh my parents and the Meyer family lent him some money. </sentence><sentence id="159">He got us in return, perhaps not in return - I don't want to make it sound that this was a bribery. </sentence><sentence id="160">I think that he really and honestly was able to officially give them visas to go to Albania. </sentence><sentence id="161">And uh Dr. Meyer and my mother flew to Berlin for the day, and they obtained the uh Albanian visas and our passports or a letter - I'm not quite sure. </sentence><sentence id="162">At any rate uh - I'm hesitating on this flight business because my grandmother was not allowed to know at that point that my mother was going to take an airplane back to her would have been absolute uh disaster. </sentence><sentence id="163">I mean how does anybody go into an airplane. </sentence><sentence id="164">But nevertheless when she came safely back the same evening she was told and she sighed relief that she didn't know before. </sentence><sentence id="165">At any rate we did get visas. </sentence><sentence id="166">Uh and uh now the process of leaving Hamburg mysteriously began. </sentence><sentence id="167">My recollections on that are very very sad. </sentence><sentence id="168">Number one I had to leave Grandmother because we could not think of taking, well in today's world perhaps her age was not all that advanced - she was in her mid60's. </sentence><sentence id="169">Today I'm pretty close to that and I </sentence></p><p><sentence id="170"> This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="171">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="172"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection </sentence></p><p><sentence id="173"> consider myself not an old person, but in those days I think one could not think of taking her to a primative country like Albania and this is all we knew about Albania. </sentence><sentence id="174">Uh she was left alone in Hamburg with an older sister. </sentence><sentence id="175">Uh her, the chances that she she alone would still make it to America were fairly good, although she too by coincidence was born in Posen (ph). </sentence><sentence id="176">I believe that my grandfather from my father's family and her family knew each other in Posen of course. </sentence><sentence id="177">Uh but uh at any rate she was on the Polish quota as well and we took a chance to just leave her in Hamburg. </sentence><sentence id="178">That was very sad. </sentence><sentence id="179">Uh my my parents uh now proceeded to unravel all their affairs in Hamburg. </sentence><sentence id="180">We had to give up our things. </sentence><sentence id="181">We had to give our home. </sentence><sentence id="182">Uh and we thought that we would go to Albania, transfer our documents with the American Consule to the American Consule in , which indeed we did and that we would go to Albania for a period of maybe four months, five months, half a year. </sentence><sentence id="183">Uh I'm not even sure that they thought it would take that long. </sentence><sentence id="184">Considering and uh thinking back of the amount of luggage that we took with us, and the kind of clothes we took with us, it was really considered only a matter of months that we would be in Albania. </sentence><sentence id="185">Uh the rest of our belongings, that which we were allowed to take out, because here we are, January, February, 1939. </sentence><sentence id="186">We're not allowed to take out any silver. </sentence><sentence id="187">We're not allowed to take out mare than 10 marks per person. </sentence><sentence id="188">Uh we're not allowed to take out any jewelry. </sentence><sentence id="189">We're not allowed to take out many other things, nothing that was newly purchased. </sentence><sentence id="190">I mean there were very very specific uh rules and regulations. </sentence><sentence id="191">I believe that in my papers at home in Haifa I even have lists of things my parents took with them. </sentence><sentence id="192">I have I think a document that states uh that you're only allowed to take out things that were purchased one year prior to your uh immigration and things of that sort. </sentence><sentence id="193">I mean everything was made very clear. </sentence><sentence id="194">They packed a lift (ph) under the supervision of German uh officials. </sentence><sentence id="195">Everything was checked, what went in there, and uh these lifts were left in the storage of the harbor in Hamburg with the intention that as soon as we would arrive in America we would send for these lifts. </sentence><sentence id="196">I believe that at the time the rule was that you could not just simply send off your lift to the United States, and it makes sense, because I think the United States, or the harbor of New York would have been flooded with lifts of people who unfortunately never made it themselves there. </sentence><sentence id="197">So our lift was left in uh Hamburg, in the uh harbor of Hamburg, and uh we left Hamburg on uh I believe the date was the 23rd of February, 1939. </sentence><sentence id="198">At least this is what the official exit document that I have states. </sentence><sentence id="199">Uh my father had a very hard time detaching himself from literally thousands of letters, documents, photographs, etc. </sentence><sentence id="200">It was impossible that he could take all of these things that were very dear to him and that meant so much to him. </sentence><sentence id="201">These were letters still written by his mother to him when he was in the war. </sentence><sentence id="202">Uh his younger brother had fallen for Germany eighteen days before the end of World War I. He's buried somewhere in France. </sentence><sentence id="203">Uh his mother, as I stated before, already died when she was uh a young woman in February of 1919. </sentence><sentence id="204">She had gone to Berlin to wait for him as he arrived. </sentence><sentence id="205">He had been such a patriot that although the war ended in November of 1918, he had volunteered to fight against the Bolsheviks (ph) and went into Russia and never came back from the war until February 1919. </sentence><sentence id="206">Uh she was in Berlin. </sentence><sentence id="207">She awaited him at the railroad station. </sentence><sentence id="208">And sometime during that period she contracted as I said the Spanish Influenza. </sentence><sentence id="209">She went back to Posen and died very shortly thereafter. </sentence><sentence id="210">And he could not even go to her funeral because he was a German soldier, or ex-soldier. </sentence><sentence id="211">Posen by this time was Polish and I don't think that he got uh a permit to go into Posen. </sentence><sentence id="212">Uh I believe a little bit later on, probably 1920, everyone who lived in Posen was given the option to opt for either the Polish citizenship or German citizenship, and of course my grandfather uh opted and and part of the other family opted for the </sentence></p><p><sentence id="213"> This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="214">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="215"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection </sentence></p><p><sentence id="216"> German citizenship, and they all went to live in Berlin. </sentence><sentence id="217">So as of 1920, I believe that uh all whoever was left in Posen of the family Gerechter and whatever else their names were all went to live in Berlin. </sentence><sentence id="218">But to come back to our own family, so I remember so very distinctly my father making arrangements with the superintendent of the building where we lived, that he could use the furnace room of the house and burn all what he couldn't take with him. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="219">Papers, documents, etc. </sentence><sentence id="220">etc. </sentence><sentence id="221">He took some things with him, but very few. </sentence><sentence id="222">We were so limited in our baggage and our luggage that it was really uh very difficult to decide what to take and what not to take. </sentence><sentence id="223">Uh it came to the point where my mother and father had to go to the uh customs officials and give them, hand them over, their silverware, their candlesticks, their...anything, any objects in the house that were made of silver, none of which could be taken along. </sentence><sentence id="224">The uh cutlery and uh you know, whatever uh else was of silver in the house. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="225">Uh I do remember my mother going out and being permitted to buy three sets of cutlery, of uh silver-plated cutlery to be taken with us. </sentence><sentence id="226">One for each of us, and nothing more. </sentence><sentence id="227">And her jewelry. </sentence><sentence id="228">When they came to the customs official, someone recognized her, an elderly gentlemen and it turned out that one time he worked for my grandfather, possibly ten or fifteen years earlier in his business. </sentence><sentence id="229">And because he recognized her, he allowed her to take just a few extra items along. </sentence><sentence id="230">They were pa...that is to say extra items of jewelry, because otherwise all they were permitted really was their wedding rings, and as I said, a set of uh three sets of cutlery for each of us. </sentence><sentence id="231">Uh she was allowed very few additional items, and those items were in this place, packed in a sealed little package. </sentence><sentence

in it. </sentence><sentence id="234">And a copy of that list, when we finally left Germany and crossed the Pass into Italy, that list was over there with the customs official, officials. </sentence><sentence id="235">My parents were taken out of the train when we uh passed across the border and uh the package at that place was opened up and they compared the list and contents of that package with the list that they had received. </sentence><sentence id="236">That's how strict things were handled in those days. </sentence><sentence id="237">At any rate, the day of departure arrived. </sentence><sentence id="238">I remember all night long my parents were still packing. </sentence><sentence id="239">I remember the last night in our home. </sentence><sentence id="240">Uh the farewell to toys and everything else and of course the very very sad farewell to my grandmother. </sentence><sentence id="241">I still re...see her standing on her balcony and waving at us as the taxi drove away and took us to the railroad station in Hamburg. </sentence><sentence id="242">We left from the railroad station called and uh I took a doll with me. </sentence><sentence id="243">I took a ball with me. </sentence><sentence id="244">I remember a little pin that my grandmother had given me and a few other toys. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="245">And uh we traveled to Munich and slept the first night in Munich and continued the next day to Italy. </sentence><sentence id="246">That is to say we crossed the Pass. </sentence><sentence id="247">My parents, not everyone but at random, people were taken out of the plane...out of the train and uh some of them were even uh bodily examined. </sentence><sentence id="248">Now my mother was taken into one room and my father in another, totally stripped and totally examined and my mother ca---and I was left with the Meyers on the train. </sentence><sentence id="249">For some reason the Meyers were not examined. </sentence><sentence id="250">As I said, people were taken at random. </sentence><sentence id="251">And uh remember my mother coming back on the train and telling us her experience and among other things that the woman who examined her, touched her hair and said what do you have in there, and she said permanent, and uh the woman said don't answer me so fresh. </sentence><sentence id="252">Well, we finally crossed the and uh - look, some people smuggled things out. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="253">That's for sure, and we know that and it perhaps even saved their lives. </sentence><sentence id="254">It was money smuggled or perhaps between pages of books and it was uh people had false bottoms to their pocketbooks or suitcases - who knows what. </sentence><sentence

prison, and uh we left with the ten marks per person. </sentence><sentence id="261">We left with the little package that was packaged in Hamburg, and that's all we had with us. </sentence><sentence id="262">We arrived in Bologne the next day, and uh here we didn't know what we would be doing because the ten marks by now had been used up the one night in Munich and uh the Meyer family of five and the three stood on the platform in Bologne and really didn't know where to turn. </sentence><sentence id="263">To our great surprise, uh there were Italian students who uh who were organized by the Jewish Committee uh of Italy, and apparently in many such centers of uh cities where trains would come from Germany, these students had made it their business to be there and uh receive German or other immigrants that were fleeing Germany. </sentence><sentence id="264">Well, I remember two students taking us in hand, taking us to a beautiful beautiful hotel. </sentence><sentence id="265">And caring for us for an entire week until we were able to receive money from our relatives in America, and the same went for the Meyer family. </sentence><sentence id="266">Uh the money had to be uh dispatched, and I guess in those days uh telegram was already in existence of course, but I don't know how quickly it went. </sentence><sentence id="267">But we were for an entire week taken care of my these students in Bologne who also took us around town, showed us Bologne, fed us, took us to restaurants, and just took care of us until we were able to uh pay for our uh passage for, first of all from for our ticket, railroad ticket from Bologne to Bari (ph). </sentence><sentence id="268">In Bari we took a boat to Albania. </sentence><sentence id="269">Now, we were not allowed to pay for these two tripls, because this was out of territorial Germany. </sentence><sentence id="270">They would not allow us to pay with German money in Germany for these two tickets, which would have made life a lot easier and, but this were all calculated on the part of the Germans. </sentence><sentence id="271">Uh of course we all know that uh supposedly all the money that was uh left and all the jewelry and everything else, all belongings, were put into a socalled uh account, or whatever it was called. </sentence><sentence id="272">And uh supposedly someday this all was supposed to come back. </sentence><sentence id="273">Of course it never did. </sentence><sentence id="274">By the way, speaking of the lift in in Hamburg, many many years later uh my parents already were no longer alive, and the German court somehow found out that uh indeed there was a lift stored in a certain man's uh warehouse uh which had been distributed. </sentence><sentence id="275">The contents of not only our lift but I suppose many other people's uh lifts, had been distributed to so-called bombed-out German families. </sentence><sentence id="276">And I received the glorious amount of $400 American dollars, or was it 400 marks - I'm not quite sure anymore - uh maybe sometime in the early early "60's as compensation for the lift. </sentence><sentence id="277">Anyway, we're now uh in uh Bologne. </sentence><sentence id="278">As I said we uh were taken care, beautifully taken care of by these people and it is only weeks ago now that I read in a book written by a woman called Susan , . </sentence><sentence id="279">She writes about the Italian Jews and Italy and its Jews, etd. </sentence><sentence id="280">It's a fantastic book I think. </sentence><sentence id="281">Unfortunately, uh she doesn't mention Albania at all, and I'm trying to get in touch with her which I haven't succeeded in. </sentence><sentence id="282">Uh I think it's a pity that she doesn't know about Albania and the Italian role there. </sentence><sentence id="283">But uh she is describing this organization of Italians who are helping Jews who come across the border to make their life more pleasant and easier. </sentence><sentence id="284">And I never realized that this was a nationally organized uh group of people who who did this for a long period of time. </sentence></p><p><sentence

reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection 1 Tape #2 ...We arrived on March Ist, 1939, in the early, early hours of the morning. </sentence><sentence id="297">We went up on board and the site that uh we saw was one of extreme depression. </sentence><sentence id="298">It was a one dock and port, piles and piles, heaps and heaps of charcoal on the pier. </sentence><sentence id="299">It was pouring rain. </sentence><sentence id="300">The black water was everywhere, running all over the pier from the charcoal. </sentence><sentence id="301">There were few uh Albanians, for the most part gypsies because they use...used to use gypsies for their heavy work and for carrying and so on. </sentence><sentence id="302">Covering their, and this I kept seeing it all through the years whenever it rained, these people would use as a protection just the jute bags over their heads and this is was the sight that met our eyes. </sentence><sentence id="303">It was really really depressing. </sentence><sentence id="304">And I remember my mother crying bitterly and saying I am not leaving this ship. </sentence><sentence id="305">I am going to straight back to . </sentence><sentence id="306">She absolutely could not envision how she would ever be able to set foot to this kind of a unbelievably depressing uh sight. </sentence><sentence id="307">Well again to our surprise, because we really had no idea what was expecting us in Albania, uh there were other immigrants, European immigrants already in Albania, and someone from the pier called up in German, are there any German Jews, are there any Jews on board? </sentence><sentence id="308">And uh we were very happy that this gentleman who had already been in Albania, this was his job to be there every day when boats arrived to see whether there would be refugees on these boats. </sentence><sentence id="309">And uh so he helped us get off the boat and uh take us to one of the local hotels. </sentence><sentence id="310">Well ho...hotel is an overstatement of facts, but that's what they were called. </sentence><sentence id="311">Exceeding...everything was exceedingly primative. </sentence><sentence id="312">Uh we had, coming from Hamburg, uh hygiene being the epitomy of our lives and so on, this was really unbelievable. </sentence><sentence id="313">But nevertheless here we were. </sentence><sentence id="314">Uh I don't know. </sentence><sentence id="315">We children perhaps because of our age, by this time I had just turned my eighth birthday in December before we left, and uh the uh children of the family Meyer, one was younger - I believe he was only five - and uh the other, the the girls - one was a year older than myself and one was exactly the same age. </sentence><sentence id="316">So I don't know ta what extent we could empathasize with the feeling our parents experienced. </sentence><sentence id="317">I think that to us some of this was exciting because it was new and it was different and and it was just all uh a new experience for us children. </sentence><sentence id="318">I think at this point we uh we were certainly very insecure because we didn't know what was facing us or what school would be like or the usual things that children do - toys, we had almost none with us, just what we could carry in our arms or our little bag that each one of us had over their shoulder, and uh I do remember very well that for many many years the one thing that I missed so terribly was my school bag, and I always had in the back of my mind, well one day when I get to live in New York, my school bag was . </sentence><sentence id="319">In Germany we used to wear the school bag on your on your back. </sentence><sentence id="320">I had some particular like for this I suppose. </sentence><sentence id="321">I don't know exactly why, but that was so important to me that I did not have that with me. </sentence><sentence id="322">Uh another thing I had received as a gift from an uncle of my mother's a doll house that he had made himself and of couse I had to leave that behind, needless to say, and that was a tremendous uh and I missed it very badly. </sentence><sentence id="323">Well, these are the things that children of that age I think we experiencing. </sentence><sentence id="324">The lack of the uh ususal, the schooling, the friends, the playgrounds, the toys, the family the grandparents, etc. </sentence><sentence id="325">Uh but the other insecurities of where does the next meal come from or where are we going to live and where are we going to sleep and so on which parents have to worry about, I think that didn't quite trickle down to us at that point yet. </sentence><sentence id="326">At any rate we lived in a hotel, so called hotel, very filthy, very dir...very much infested by bedbugs and lice and the whole gambit, and uh the other immigrants and there were at that point I believe something like sixty people there. </sentence><sentence id="327">They were all from Austria, mostly This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="328">It is not the primary source, and it has not

</sentence><sentence id="330">Uh had rented or I should I should start a little bit differently at this point. </sentence><sentence id="331">There were Albanian Jews and that is to say there were two families originally from Greece who had lived for many years in Albania and they were considered Albanian Jews. </sentence><sentence id="332">Uh there names were uh Kohn (ph) and Levy (ph). </sentence><sentence id="333">They ran rather large dry goods stores and uh they were weal...very Jews. </sentence><sentence id="334">Their origin as I say was from Solonika (ph) I believe and uh when these other people had arrived a little bit earlier than we, I don't believe that anybody was there more than maybe a year longer than we. </sentence><sentence id="335">In other words in 1938 I believe is immigration to Albania started. </sentence><sentence id="336">Uh these people had sort of assumed the role of uh to the highest to the Joint Distribution in America. </sentence><sentence id="337">Made contact with them, and they were sending American dollars to these two families who in turn gave us the Albanian equivalent of this money. </sentence><sentence id="338">But in all these years they made very nice uh currency out of these Jews that came to to to escape Germany. </sentence><sentence id="339">Never mind. </sentence><sentence id="340">At any rate uh these people had organized themselves in uh they had rented a very very large house, call it a uh a hostel, and uh these sixty people, more or less, were living, a room per family, in this house with a very hugh kitchen, communal kitchen of course, and uh they had uh organized in such a way that several women each day would take turns at cooking and preparing the food and several men would take turns every day in purchasing uh the produce etc. </sentence><sentence id="341">and prepare the two meals. </sentence><sentence id="342">They were in the process of renting a second such hostel right across the street from the first one but had not completed the arrangements yet so that we for example uh had no room in the original home, and had to live in this hotel. </sentence><sentence id="343">So it was us and uh the Meyer family and there were a couple of other couples or single people who in the meantime were staying in one or the other of these hotels. </sentence><sentence id="344">I think at that time there were just two. ( ) </sentence><sentence id="345">One was called .The other one was called, and uh but for meals we had to go everyday to this hostel which was perhaps not a long way. </sentence><sentence id="346">I don't really recall. </sentence><sentence id="347">I do recall that as a child it was a trecherous waly to walk. </sentence><sentence id="348">You have to remember that uh roads as such weren't reallly known in Albania and it was all very uh muddy. </sentence><sentence id="349">This was the rainy season in February and March into April, and uh we had to go twice a day for meals to the home, to the uh hostel. </sentence><sentence id="350">And it wasn't until a few months later, and I'm not quite sure exactly whether it was May or June that the second hostel had been rented and when we could move, be moved in there. </sentence><sentence id="351">OK. </sentence><sentence id="352">Uh so this us procedure here went on all through March and into April. </sentence><sentence id="353">April 5th, 1939, we woke up to a barrage of cannon uh shots. </sentence><sentence id="354">And we didn't quite know what it was. </sentence><sentence id="355">We were told immediately that the royal family had just uh the Queen of Albania had just delivered a uh an heir to the throne and uh they were shooting . </sentence><sentence id="356">Well that was very nice and the King of Albania, King uh offered that these sixty or maybe by now sixty-five or seventy immigrants Albanian citizenship in honor of the birth of his son. </sentence><sentence id="357">Well, it never came to this, which there were times when we wished it had taken place but in the end history proved that it would have been terrible if it had happened, because we would never have gotten out of Albania. </sentence><sentence id="358">.Two days later we again were awoken by terrible uh noises of artilleries shooting but this time it was the real thing. </sentence><sentence id="359">Italians had landed in . </sentence><sentence id="360">Uh it was the week of Passover. </sentence><sentence id="361">Passover was early that particular year. </sentence><sentence id="362">I believe I looked up in my book earlier and I believe that the Seder night was uh on the 3rd or 4th of uh April or 5th of April that year and uh there were rumors that something was happ...going to happen and indeed they had told us that day, on the 6th of uh April, not to come back for supper that night but to stay in the hotel and they gave us some food to take back to the hotel with us. </sentence><sentence id="363">And uh sure enough on the 7th in the morning, 7th of April, 1939, the Italians had landed in Albania, had occupied the port part of . </sentence><sentence id="364">The fighting in the streets took uh maybe three, four, five hours at the most. </sentence><sentence id="365">I don't This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="366">It is not the primary source, and it has not been

</sentence><sentence id="368">But we were staying in this hotel and of course this was one of the uh uh hotels very close to the port and uh altogether how many streets were in and uh we didn't quite know where to run for shelter because uh the rooms had all large windows and the shooting was going on and the windows were being broken, uh the panels were were falling into the rooms so we ran up and down the stairs. </sentence><sentence id="369">The stairs were a windowless area at that time. </sentence><sentence id="370">Well, about ten or eleven o'clock in the morning the uh Italians finally came into the hotel and took us into the nearby uh ( ) solid back. </sentence><sentence id="371">It was a solid built house. </sentence><sentence id="372">Uh my mother and I were taken over, followed by my father by some Italian soldiers. </sentence><sentence id="373">They were all very kind and very accommodating and very helpful, but right in front of the hotel was a machine gun and a dgad Albanian soldier over whom we almost fell. </sentence><sentence id="374">Uh we were kept in the all day long, and uh in the mean time of course the rest of the country uh abandoned their fighting. </sentence><sentence id="375">The Albanians didn't stand any chance whatsoever and the war was over within a few hours and the Italians were now in possession of Albania. </sentence><sentence id="376">It's been, it was part of the Italian empire such as , , or parts of Africa, etc. </sentence><sentence id="377">Uh as far as we were concerned of course the Italians really were to us excellent, wonderful. </sentence><sentence id="378">Uh the word anti- Semitism did not have, not only didn't exist, didn't have any meaning to them. </sentence><sentence id="379">They didn't know what it meant. </sentence><sentence id="380">Uh we were Germans at least as far as they were concerned. </sentence><sentence id="381">When we timidly would tell them they were Jews, their replies would always be well, we have Jews in Italy and they're Italian citizens. </sentence><sentence id="382">Some of them are even in the Facist party, which of course is true. </sentence><sentence id="383">We all know by now that there were Italian Jews who were very ardent uh supporters of Facism and such. </sentence><sentence id="384">At any rate uh we as I said eventually moved into this other hostel and the Italians were there, and everything was good and fine and uh life went on and here we were waiting for our call-up to the American consulate because we mustn't forget that this was still the ultimate uh aim. </sentence><sentence id="385">We only came here to stay for the few months it would take for the American consule to call us because our to America. </sentence><sentence id="386">Well, when the Italians occupied Albania, that of course was part of the Axis now, and the American consule left and went to Naples. </sentence><sentence id="387">I don't know exactly why because that was also uh Italy was also uh the Axis but anyway, there was no longer an American consulate in and our papers and everything else went with them to Naples and now we became, we got under the jurisdiction of the ( ) Naples. </sentence><sentence id="388">Uh the SS was well-known in those days. </sentence><sentence id="389">Each consule is oh can demand whatever he wants to demand as to security and ( ) uh guarantees that they will not become burdens to the American government. </sentence><sentence id="390">Indeed this is what happened, and of course we all know that ( ) could have come to America, didn't come to America only because of this ( ) . </sentence><sentence id="391">At any rate we are now in the summer of 1939 and uh our papers are now in Naples and so are the papers of the Meyer family. </sentence><sentence id="392">There were other people who also uh had uh these quota and affadavits to go to America, and some did. </sentence><sentence id="393">Here and there children kept uh leaving Albania and ( ) other places such as France and Holland and of course we know what happened to them. </sentence><sentence id="394">A few, very few, went to uh went to America. </sentence><sentence id="395">But among them were the Meyer family who in December of 1939 were called to the consule in Naples, did leave Albania for Italy, and eventually arrived in the United States. </sentence><sentence id="396">Uh our quota was not up yet, and we were toying with the idea at one point why not leave with them and stay in Italy and wait for our quota, which could have been advantageous and maybe not. </sentence><sentence id="397">You can never tell. </sentence><sentence id="398">But we ultimately decided to remain in Albania and await our call-up.

where they deported the Italians by trucks, via back into Italy. </sentence><sentence id="629">And they became the rulers of Albsnia. </sentence><sentence id="630">Uh at this point, it became very
