rags. </sentence><sentence id="463">Now in the meantime, these women came and we were told to get out of the houses and assemble. </sentence><sentence id="464">And I remember I was so afraid with my doll that one of them would break him, I don't remember if I left the doll there or if I took the doll with me. </sentence><sentence id="465">But it was dangerous take anything with you because they thought you were hiding something and that's how we saved, and then a day later when the coast was clear; they didn't find anything, then they...we got the potatoes back. </sentence><sentence id="466">I remember the worst day for me was a day in 1943. </sentence><sentence id="467">It was November 11. </sentence><sentence id="468">The rumor went around that people were missing; that people

</sentence><sentence id="471">And if you did, you broke most of your bones and who would help you then. </sentence><sentence id="472">And even if you did get out in one piece, who would help you when you got out? </sentence><sentence id="473">People didn't know anybody on the outside to give you some food or where to go, etc.and I mean you had the SS guarding the place, so it was very difficult.

there. </sentence><sentence id="482">It was just a horrible, horrible day. </sentence><sentence id="483">It was now I know what was supposed to happen on that day. </sentence><sentence id="484">I think that they really did not only want to count us. </sentence><sentence id="485">Probably what they wanted to do is either shoot down, Babi Yar style or send the whole transport to Auschwitz on that day. </sentence><sentence id="486">Because news had leaked out to the British radio. </sentence><sentence id="487">And that we were all standing there, about 50,000-60,000 people.
