<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="243">Q: Now, what was happening to your father and your birth mother in those years? </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="267">Q: And your grandmother? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="269">A: And unfortunately when she died in "42, the Christian lady just chased my grandmother out, she said, I don't want to keep this old lady, out. </sentence><sentence id="270">And she ended up in one of the concentration camps, and you know the end of it is, you know, death. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="290">Q: Mm-hm, okay. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="292">A: And apparently there was a big Jewish commun -- I mean, I don't know how big, but it was a r -- arelatively large Jewish community there. </sentence><sentence id="293">And Boryslaw was known for having oil -- oil. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="294">So, you know, they were digging for oil and they found oil in Boryslaw, so they had, you know, those -- </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="295">Q: Derricks? </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="296">A: Yes, right there, right. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="298">Q: So now it's the end of the war and your father comes to get you. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="300">A: Yeah. </sentence><sentence id="301">What my father said, that during the time of the war, when he managed to escape each time there was an aksia -- </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="302">Q: Right. </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="303">A: -- and one time he was even caught and he ran away from -- managed to escape the camp. </sentence><sentence id="304">He used to come periodically to visit me at that village, but I was not supposed to know that he was my father and they gave him a nickname like Chapchuss. </sentence><sentence id="305">You know, whatever, that means nothing. </sentence><sentence id="306">It's -- it's, you know, it's like a blabber word, whatever. </sentence><sentence id="307">So whenever they said oh, Chapchuss is coming to see you. </sentence><sentence id="308">Because in case, if one of the neighbors or Germans would come in, I may say, aw, Marek Wein -- whatever. </sentence><sentence id="309">In order not to have that, he was called Chapchuss. </sentence><sentence id="310">So, that was the name. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="319">Q: What was your new name during the war? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="321">A: Oh, my name was Anna Theresa Beitsko. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="323">Q: And that was the name of the family? </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2193">A: Yes, conc -- there are a lot of things that are happening that concerns me. </sentence><sentence id="2194">First of all, I see anti-Semitism on the rise. </sentence><sentence id="2195">That concerns me. </sentence><sentence id="2196">I don't know whether we are doing enough to stop it. </sentence><sentence id="2197">I'm sure there are means to stop it, but we -- maybe we are ignoring it and thinking the wave will go away. </sentence><sentence id="2198">That concerns me a great deal. </sentence><sentence id="2199">What concerns me also is that the attitude toward the state of Israel, my feeling is, in United States, has changed from the time that we arrived 45 years ago, or 46 years ago, to what is happening today. </sentence><sentence id="2200">It's not the same, it changed for the worse. </sentence><sentence id="2201">And I don't know if this is a -- a propaganda by a lot of Muslim countries, and -- and -- and maybe anti-Semitism was kind of, you know, hidden and begins slowly to mushroom out. </sentence><sentence id="2202">Maybe that hatred was there and somehow it -- it -- it -- it was either covered up, or maybe it has to do with the newer generation that sees things differently than the older generation. </sentence><sentence id="2203">It -- it could be. </sentence><sentence id="2204">What scares me that -- that what we hear today, we did not hear that 40 or 30 years ago. </sentence><sentence id="2205">Whether it's in France, whether it's in -- in -- in Sweden, whether it's in -- in -- in Norway, Holland. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2249">Q: In their sense of lack of awareness? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2251">A: Lack of awareness, lack of knowledge, easy to blame. </sentence><sentence id="2252">It does. </sentence><sentence id="2253">And I'll give you an example. </sentence><sentence id="2254">Yesterday I heard a story of a child, and I don't want to mention names, who went to a camp over summer and there were -- he was put with another kid. </sentence><sentence id="2255">It's -- it wasn't just only a Jewish camp, it was a camp for Jews and everybody else. </sentence><sentence id="2256">And there was another child in his bunk who was not Jewish -- and we are talking about 11 year old kid, who said to the Jewish kid, he said, all Jews should die. </sentence><sentence id="2257">Now where does an 11 year old child come with such a statement? </sentence><sentence id="2258">He must have heard it at home, or in the surrounding that he comes from. </sentence><sentence id="2259">So the father mentioned that the Jewish kid slugged him, gave him a beating for it, you know. </sentence><sentence id="2260">And -- and it shows you that 11    year old kid today, you know, like -- so are we reversing? </sentence><sentence id="2261">What's happening? </sentence><sentence id="2262">I wish I would have an answer for all that, but I really don't. </sentence><sentence id="2263">But I'm very sensitive to it, I guess more than others. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2278">Q: Because? </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2300">A: Absolutely, yes, very much so. </sentence><sentence id="2301">Yeah. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2304">Q: But -- for educational pur -- </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2305">A: For educational purposes, for the second generation, because what happened, you know, things are forgotten, as the years pass by. </sentence><sentence id="2306">And we know for instance that some leaders of countries deny the whole idea of Holocaust, it never existed, like Ahmadinejad. </sentence><sentence id="2307">And what bothers me very much, that those very, very ultra-Orthodox Jews side with him and say there is no need for the state [indecipherable] the Messiah will arrive. </sentence><sentence id="2308">And I don't know how long, but if he would have crawled already, he would have been here, right? </sentence><sentence id="2309">So I don't know when the Messiah will arrive. </sentence><sentence id="2310">But yeah, def-definitely there is a need. </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2311">Q: Do you feel that what you went through as a young child, and all your childhood is the defining event of who you are, the defining element of who you are? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2313">A: Oh yes. </sentence><sentence id="2314">Yeah, I think so. </sentence><sentence id="2315">Yeah, I think it's a defining [indecipherable] yes. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2319">Q: You said it's made you more sensitive, you did say that. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2321">A: Right. </sentence><sentence id="2322">Yes. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2325">Q: And then the other ways tha -- </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2326">A: More aware of different situations. </sentence><sentence id="2327">Stronger, in a sense that I don't give in so quickly. </sentence><sentence id="2328">I -- I don't know if it's inborn or -- or -- or whatever I -- I like to achieve. </sentence><sentence id="2329">I set a goal, I go after it. </sentence><sentence id="2330">I don't back out or -- or feel oh, I can't do it, or whatever. </sentence><sentence id="2331">I guess that's it, basically. </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2332">Q: Do you think about your childhood often? </sentence></p></dialogue>
