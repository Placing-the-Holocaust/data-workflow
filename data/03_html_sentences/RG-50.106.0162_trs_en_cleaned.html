<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="255">Q: When did you see your first swastika? </sentence></p></dialogue>

When did you first hear about a man called Adolf Hitler? </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="267">A: Probably around 1935, because one did listen to speeches and the fact that he was able to arouse almost riotous reactions, and people started talking about what was going to happen next. </sentence><sentence id="268">Again, wa -- how political is a five year old, and I couldn't really absorb what was going on in the same way as my parents, who obviously were quite concerned, as I said, whether it's a ocean voyage, learning English and so forth. </sentence><sentence id="269">That became pretty clear even before the end of the treaty,    14 Interview with Frank Liebermann September 24, 2003 and I'd say around 1935. </sentence><sentence id="270">By the time I started school, which was in 1935, it was already fully segregated and I just thought that's the way it had to be. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1422">A: Well, I -- I would say I'm -- I -- I've become a student of history, Biblical and otherwise. </sentence><sentence id="1423">And if you do that, you realize that the Jewish community has always done well in a free society. </sentence><sentence id="1424">And therefore, I think there's a reason why Jews tend to be liberal in their own self interest. </sentence><sentence id="1425">And some of the trends we have th -- do worry me, because we don't seem to be getting our message across as well as we did in former years. </sentence><sentence id="1426">In other words, I'm not -- when -- even when Senator Lieberman mentions God too often, I don't think that's -- that belongs in politics. </sentence><sentence id="1427">Now, one of the things that made things so easy for the Germans is that the churches and synagogues were fun-funded by the state. </sentence><sentence id="1428">In other words, you gave a 58 Interview with Frank Liebermann September 24, 2003 certain part of your taxes to go to the church of your choice. </sentence><sentence id="1429">And therefore, they had complete records of what everybody was and thought, whether they were with them inic -- or against them. </sentence><sentence id="1430">And I therefore don't like some of the trends that we see now in fighting terrorism, of invading civil liberties. </sentence><sentence id="1431">I mean, I certainly don't mind giving my name, but some of the illegal searches and so forth, scare me. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1477">Q: And you are concerned about the stability of the State of Israel? </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1605">Q: Has working there affected your memories of your early childhood? </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1631">Q: When you're at the museum and you've gone through the exhibit in the fifth floor, in the 1930's in Germany, do you identify with that? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1633">A: The one that really got me -- oh, sh -- one second, I turn it off [tape break] -- not re -- the one that I got -- probably was most emotional about was the present exhibit on the children. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1637">A: Yes. </sentence><sentence id="1638">And the last ti -- wa -- again, when I was emotional is in "Schindler's List" when they lead the children away. </sentence><sentence id="1639">That's something that I can't come to terms with, and I think of my cousin, who when we left she was three years old. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1653">A: No, no, no. </sentence><sentence id="1654">I mean, I identify as what happened to -- children were totally helpless and -- and I would sa -- it's probably -- that's the only pogrom that's di -- that really -- attacked the children first. </sentence><sentence id="1655">From a phils -- philosophical way of destroying the community. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="1656">   65 Interview with Frank Liebermann September 24, 2003 </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1657">Q: What is your relationship with other survivor volunteers at the museum? </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1658">A: Good. </sentence><sentence id="1659">I have no -- I mean, I like some better than others. </sentence><sentence id="1660">Some people you relate to, that's normal. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1670">Q: Do you feel a connection with those who came from Germany? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1672">A: Again, I look strictly as people. </sentence><sentence id="1673">I don't have any -- no more -- I usually ask where people are from, whether they're from Ohio or New Zealand and places that I've been to. </sentence><sentence id="1674">From the museum, that's more interesting. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="1675">End of Tape Three, Side A Beginning Tape Three, Side B </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1676">Q: This is a continuation of the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum volunteer collection interview with Frank Liebermann. </sentence><sentence id="1677">This is tape number three, side B, and we were talking about your experiences at the museum. </sentence><sentence id="1678">Would you encourage other survivors to volunteer at the museum? </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1679">A: I think it's -- I think it's quite important that I sometimes do ask, if I'm the survi -- actually, I don't consider myself a survivor, because my parents with their good fortune got me out before "38, or during "38 and I really had a minimum of    66 Interview with Frank Liebermann September 24, 2003 trauma. </sentence><sentence id="1680">But by being represented as somebody who is authentic, I think it adds to the experience of people at the museum, and I do get asked. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1684">Q: You get asked what? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1686">A: Whether I was a survivor. </sentence><sentence id="1687">And I say yes, even though I don't believe it myself. </sentence><sentence id="1688">In other words, the category of survivor is somebody who really went through some of the hell which happened after Crystal Night. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1692">Q: What are your feelings when you walk into the building? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1694">A: I think it's a fabulous piece of architecture. </sentence><sentence id="1695">In other words, the somewhat disjointed look is, I think, a marvelous achievement. </sentence><sentence id="1696">People often ask me, you know, about the map that they give out. </sentence><sentence id="1697">And I said, it really doesn't help because people didn't know from one moment to the next what's going to happen. </sentence><sentence id="1698">So you can't put that in a map. </sentence><sentence id="1699">That's my standard comment. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1706">Q: Do you feel like you belong there? </sentence><sentence id="1707">There's a connection to the museum for you? </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1716">A: Ah, I do not tend to be that emotional. </sentence><sentence id="1717">In other words, I appreciate the happenings and I -- I try to ra -- I try to believe in reason over emotion. </sentence><sentence id="1718">Not that I   67 Interview with Frank Liebermann September 24, 2003 don't get emotional, but this is not -- I don't have the connection that way, except I think that it -- that it's an important part of education and I have taken -- I've invited -- for instance, I've invited my kids and grandchildren to the celebration of survivors, November first. </sentence><sentence id="1719">And I think that's important. </sentence><sentence id="1720">But from an educational point of view, rather than a strict emotional point of view. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1727">Q: What are your thoughts about the non-Jewish staff and volunteers? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1729">A: They again -- it depends which ones. </sentence><sentence id="1730">Some of them are strictly business, others are really devoted. </sentence><sentence id="1731">And also in th -- among the volunteers are some non-Jewish volunteers. </sentence><sentence id="1732">You don't know what reasons people have for reacting. </sentence><sentence id="1733">So-Some of them take it strictly they've had experience in museums and it's a museum job. </sentence><sentence id="1734">Others do it because they feel it -- it's particularly important. </sentence><sentence id="1735">And both kinds of people are useful. </sentence><sentence id="1736">No other comments. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1745">Q: Do you go to many of the lectures and presentations? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1747">A: I don't have time, because I leave there and go directly to work. </sentence><sentence id="1748">If they have something in the evening, preferably on weekends, it's much easier than during the week. </sentence><sentence id="1749">Course I -- I get home around quarter to six. </sentence><sentence id="1750">By the time I have dinner during the week, that's -- that makes for a long day -- we -- and we go to the theater a lot in the weekends and have cond -- all kinds of subscriptions. </sentence><sentence id="1751">It's -- you can only do so much. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="1752"> 68 Interview with Frank Liebermann September 24, 2003 </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1753">Q: You had said that the hidden children exhibit was particularly meaningful for you. </sentence><sentence id="1754">Are there any other exhibits in the permanent collection that -- or any other temporary exhibits that really were very memorable, or are very memorable for you? </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1755">A: Again, they have all been very educational, whether it's bringing up the book burning and the intellectual philosophy of race superiority and so forth, which was popular in -- throughout the world, it was just taking that to an extreme. </sentence><sentence id="1756">And I say one of the -- one of the things that's unbelievable about the Nazi movement is the high emotional pitch that it could get to. </sentence><sentence id="1757">And that's such a danger sign that it still hasn't been explained to me. </sentence><sentence id="1758">In other words, how the political rallies can be so devastating. </sentence><sentence id="1759">On so -- so-called educated people. </sentence><sentence id="1760">That's the reason I tr -- I try to be unemotional. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1767">Q: Because it's dangerous to be emotional. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1769">A: Yes. </sentence><sentence id="1770">You said it in different words. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1773">Q: Has the world learned lessons from the Holocaust, do you think? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1775">A: I wish it really had, but the fact that it's recognized hopefully will be helpful. </sentence><sentence id="1776">We probably won't know for another two or three generations. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1779">Q: In closing, do you have any message to those two or three generations? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="1781"> 69 Interview with Frank Liebermann September 24, 2003 </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1782">A: Unless you lear -- unless you study history, you can repeat mistakes. </sentence><sentence id="1783">That's the reason I've been -- i -- the Holocaust really has made me look at history, including by the way, the re-religious history of the New Testament, or rather the -- the Christian Bible, to be correct. </sentence><sentence id="1784">That in making it the national religion of Rome, Constantine basically had to absolve the Romans. </sentence><sentence id="1785">And therefore, it was easiest to blame the Jews. </sentence><sentence id="1786">And that is not an uncommon way of interpreting history, that it's always written by the victors, about the people who can't answer, after the fact. </sentence><sentence id="1787">So the study of accurate history is extremely important and history is generally not taught very well, as to what the real issues are. </sentence><sentence id="1788">I think that's the end of my thought. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1796">Q: Anything else you'd like to add before we close? </sentence></p></dialogue>
