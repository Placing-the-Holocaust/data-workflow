<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="834">Q: What was the transport like? </sentence><sentence id="835">What was the trip like to Auschwitz? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="838">A: A nightmare. </sentence><sentence id="839">A real nightmare. </sentence><sentence id="840">Um, the train was overloaded with people, and, uh, we were, I would judge maybe a hundred and fifty people. </sentence><sentence id="841">There was no room to sit. </sentence><sentence id="842">We had to stand. </sentence><sentence id="843">I don't know how it was in others because I..I always didn't want to talk to people and ask in camp how was it. </sentence><sentence id="844">We...uh...we were standing and, uh, a lot of people died...old people...babies. </sentence><sentence id="845">No water. </sentence><sentence id="846">No food. </sentence><sentence id="847">No light. </sentence><sentence id="848">No air. </sentence><sentence id="849">And no toilet facilities. </sentence><sentence id="850">And next to me was a woman who had a little child with her, a little girl, and she uh told me that the people who came to arrest them from in the hiding places said the same thing with the same words as the Jewish Council said...as those guys said who arrested us, "Take your children with you." </sentence><sentence id="851">And she did. </sentence><sentence id="852">So I thought maybe I did something wrong. </sentence><sentence id="853">Maybe I did not really believe that there maybe would be a chance to have the child with you. </sentence><sentence id="854">So they took us...was a three and a half day trip, and, uh, (long pause) twice the car stopped and the soldiers came in and they took our watches one time, and then they wanted our money telling us that the money wasn't worth anything. </sentence><sentence id="855">Where we were going we should give our money, and my husband decided...we had our money in belt, money belt. </sentence><sentence id="856">We had that on, it on all those years. </sentence><sentence id="857">And he didn't give anything. </sentence><sentence id="858">So when they closed again, we started to rip up this money...thousands of guilders. </sentence><sentence id="859">Wasn't easy to do. </sentence><sentence id="860">It's a physical step, also to rip it in little pieces. </sentence><sentence id="861">But we did. </sentence><sentence id="862">I don't know- it was stupid probably, but we did it. </sentence><sentence id="863">And, uh, we arrived in the middle of the night, the fourth night and was...you know, bright lights, and the doors opened, and the blue and white striped prisoners which were the prisoners from Kanada which we did not know Kanada existed. </sentence><sentence id="864">They looked very clean, starched uniforms. </sentence><sentence id="865">They'd never answer any questions. </sentence><sentence id="866">We said, "Where are we?" </sentence><sentence id="867">No questions. </sentence><sentence id="868">Just getting the luggage out. </sentence><sentence id="869">And all the people had brought with them, half households. </sentence><sentence id="870">It was all gone and  1 people, I'm sure it was at every train the same were very upset, and they always got promised, "We bring it to you where you are. </sentence><sentence id="871">We know where you will be." </sentence><sentence id="872">And, uh, at least we didn't have to go through that. </sentence><sentence id="873">The woman and the child and I were together when we started to move in rows after we were separated from the men. </sentence><sentence id="874">And we walked...the ramp was endless. </sentence><sentence id="875">I don't know how long, how many cars there were, but it seemed endless and there was the man standing who made the decision who shall live or who shall die, but we did not know that. </sentence><sentence id="876">He looked at the three of us and he asked me if that was my child, and I said no, and he made the movement with the thumb for one side to go for me and to the other side for this woman and her child, and I assumed that she had that privilege because they were taking care of the children. </sentence><sentence id="877">And, uh, this man was very good looking. </sentence><sentence id="878">I have never forgotten the look of Dr. Mengele because I found out the next day it was Mengele. </sentence><sentence id="879">There were more doctors than Mengele to do that since it was 24 hours going, train after train. </sentence><sentence id="880">But this was Mengele, and, uh, he was very good looking, and, uh, his uniform and his boots. </sentence><sentence id="881">He was just a perfect specimen of a man. </sentence><sentence id="882">And, uh, somebody had said, you know, when...a few months..few years ago when there was so much about Mengele, "Would you recognize him?" </sentence><sentence id="883">I said, "No, I'm sure not." </sentence><sentence id="884">The way he looked then at his height and, how can you? </sentence><sentence id="885">So he to the aside, he sent me, it was the side of life, and the other was the side of death, as I heard the next day also. </sentence><sentence id="886">And, uh, there were no Jewish children in Auschwitz, just a few Dr.Mengele wanted. </sentence><sentence id="887">Otherwise, there were no Jewish children. </sentence><sentence id="888">And the mothers were killed with them when they had the mother. </sentence><sentence id="889">Uh, I have met...before I forget that and I come to it, I met a woman who was with us in the barrack. </sentence><sentence id="890">A young woman. </sentence><sentence id="891">A very beautiful looking woman. </sentence><sentence id="892">She was very depressed. </sentence><sentence id="893">And after..I had very . </sentence><sentence id="894">.I had hardly any contact with her. </sentence><sentence id="895">All of a sudden she said to me, "You know what I did? </sentence><sentence id="896">I knew they would kill the children, and I let my children go," and uh she said, "I couldn't help him them because I would be killed too." </sentence><sentence id="897">She knew all that. </sentence><sentence id="898">She said, "I heard it maybe two days before I was on the train and I let my children go." </sentence><sentence id="899">I don't know what happened to her. </sentence><sentence id="900">I don't know how she lived through it. </sentence><sentence id="901">I wish she would be living and that she could have children again. </sentence><sentence id="902">I don't know. </sentence><sentence id="903">But that...went with me for many, many years. </sentence><sentence id="904">How do you live with that? </sentence><sentence id="905">The, uh, the side where we were, we were told to wait, and then came my husband who was also sent to this good side, and we talked for a long time until the women were called into a large, a very large room. </sentence><sentence id="906">And I must say when we were walking to this place in the woods I heard voices. </sentence><sentence id="907">I heard women speak. </sentence><sentence id="908">I heard dogs and I heard music. </sentence><sentence id="909">And I said to the other women I said, "I thought we would come to Auschwitz where they kill everybody. </sentence><sentence id="910">This is life. </sentence><sentence id="911">We are coming into life. </sentence><sentence id="912">You hear the noises? </sentence><sentence id="913">You don't have to worry." </sentence><sentence id="914">So, uh, we were called into that room and we got first our tatoo, and the girls who gave that were sitting at a long table on a wall and they all were wearing black satin dresses. </sentence><sentence id="915">Not the same dress, but the same material, and their hair was beautiful, long. </sentence><sentence id="916">Young women, very, very attractive women. </sentence><sentence id="917">And they had a book, and they put our name in and then they gave our tatoo and then we were with them going into a circle of soldiers with big dogs and then we had to take off our clothes, strip. </sentence><sentence id="918">The one who stripped me, helped me stripping, took at the same time my wedding band off my finger. </sentence><sentence id="919">I had forgotten I had it. </sentence><sentence id="920">Maybe I would have tried to put it in my mouth or whatever. </sentence><sentence id="921">I didn't know. </sentence><sentence id="922">So she took it and, uh, I still thought they were Germans. </sentence><sentence id="923">I did not understand that they were Jewish prisoners. </sentence><sentence id="924">So they helped us and they found out...tried to find if we had jewelry hidden some other places and, uh, they shaved us,  2 our head hair and our body hair. </sentence><sentence id="925">They left our shoes because that day no wooden shoes had come. </sentence><sentence id="926">I heard, um, Anne Frank's mother who was with us. </sentence><sentence id="927">And I knew the Franks. </sentence><sentence id="928">And I did not know that they had been arrested shortly before us, so I didn't know that. </sentence><sentence id="929">So I heard her discussing with one of those women...the woman..and she was with one daughter...no...she was with two daughters. </sentence><sentence id="930">There she was with two daughters... And ,uh, the woman said she should give her her shoes, and...and Mrs. Frank hesitated, and the girl said, "I bring you every day soup for your two daughters if you give me your shoes and I give you mine." </sentence><sentence id="931">And she was very naive and she did this. </sentence><sentence id="932">She never got a drop of soup. </sentence><sentence id="933">The woman who was handling me also said that...that must have been before or the same time...I don't know anymore. </sentence><sentence id="934">She said, "You have good shoes on." </sentence><sentence id="935">I said, "Yes, I am very glad I have good shoes on." </sentence><sentence id="936">She said, "Would you like to change with me?" </sentence><sentence id="937">I said, "No." </sentence><sentence id="938">That's it. </sentence><sentence id="939">And then we came under the cold shower and then we were outside the house and we got a dress, uh a . </sentence><sentence id="940">.dress. </sentence><sentence id="941">It could have been chiffon or it could have been wool. </sentence><sentence id="942">It could have been a size 10 or it could have been a size 25. </sentence><sentence id="943">It made no difference. </sentence><sentence id="944">I got a dress and we went to the barrack for the night. </sentence><sentence id="945">That was all happening in the morning when we arrived during the night..all that took the to the other night. </sentence><sentence id="946">We still didn't get to eat. </sentence><sentence id="947">We still couldn't go to the latrine. </sentence><sentence id="948">In the meantime it was a latrine. </sentence><sentence id="949">And we were, uh brought to the barrack and we were exhausted. </sentence><sentence id="950">Absolutely exhausted. </sentence><sentence id="951">And I had a dream which was with me for many years and, uh, I dreamt that I was coming home and I was telling my family and my friends the strange things that had happened to me this day, this weeks, I don't know anymore. </sentence><sentence id="952">Probably the most upsetting was this being changed into a different person with losing your hair, losing everything you had, just as you are born. </sentence><sentence id="953">I think that was the greatest shock. </sentence><sentence id="954">You couldn't see yourself, but you saw the others, so you knew what you were looking like. </sentence><sentence id="955">I think it was the greatest shock for all of us, because nobody menstruated anymore. </sentence><sentence id="956">That was over. </sentence><sentence id="957">And our young girls, we had a lot of young girls, we had the whole uh orphanage of Jewish girls from Paris, girls of 15 years old, and they came from Morocco, and they were brought to Paris, and they were all taken, and we had them all. </sentence><sentence id="958">Beautiful girls. </sentence><sentence id="959">Fifteen years old. </sentence><sentence id="960">All they could speak was their own language. </sentence><sentence id="961">They had nothing else. </sentence><sentence id="962">They couldn't talk to anybody else. </sentence><sentence id="963">They were very upset when they were not menstruating. </sentence><sentence id="964">Everybody very young was uh concerned, but then it was a blessing. </sentence><sentence id="965">What would we have done? </sentence><sentence id="966">We had nothing. </sentence><sentence id="967">We had no underwear. </sentence><sentence id="968">We had nothing. </sentence></p></dialogue>

was very short time that we could sleep. </sentence><sentence id="1139">When the morning came and the first day in Auschwitz started, was a roll call. </sentence><sentence id="1140">Roll call in Auschwitz I'm sure that everybody had about the same experience...that's uh the barrack elder was counting everybody, we were standing with five in...and I always, always...I don't know why... tried to stand exactly in the middle. </sentence><sentence id="1141">Not in front, not in the back, and not on the side. </sentence><sentence id="1142">I wanted to be little and short and not being seen. </sentence><sentence id="1143">I don't know why. </sentence><sentence id="1144">Later on, I found that the women who were tall were always picked to special things. </sentence><sentence id="1145">They were not always good. </sentence><sentence id="1146">So I didn't want to be picked for anything. </sentence><sentence id="1147">I didn't want to be there. </sentence><sentence id="1148">So, uh, we were counted but every roll call, every roll call was wrong. </sentence><sentence id="1149">It never came out that we were as many people as they had had on their books. </sentence><sentence id="1150">And the women got very...those women, those barrack elder, were very upset about it. </sentence><sentence id="1151">They were also very beautiful dressed, with black dresses. </sentence><sentence id="1152">Uh, I still didn't know that they were prison, Jewish prisoners. </sentence><sentence id="1153">It didn't dawn on me that they would be prisoners. </sentence><sentence id="1154">Look at us and look at them. </sentence><sentence id="1155">And, uh, then came the SS men to check it, and that didn't work out. </sentence><sentence id="1156">So he was very angry, and they were worried and they looked through the barrack and they found people who were hiding under the mattresses and they were found people who had died, and though they put them all there on the floor and counted them, and I think then maybe they were then, uh, accepting the numbers. </sentence><sentence id="1157">I don't know. </sentence><sentence id="1158">Even they mostly spoke German and I tried always to understand what they were saying, it was difficult. </sentence><sentence id="1159">When this roll call was over, then volunteers had to go to the kitchen to get the coffee. </sentence><sentence id="1160">And it was in big barrels and you had to carry them with uh sticks, and uh I felt so strong and so healthy, I always volunteered. </sentence><sentence id="1161">I don't know why. </sentence><sentence id="1162">I guess I was curious to see what the kitchen looked like. </sentence><sentence id="1163">I think that was it. </sentence><sentence id="1164">You didn't see much because you never had...got into the kitchen and most of the people who worked in the kitchen were born in Poland and spoke Polish and, uh, for long times before all that happened, there was always uh, uh, another world in between the Germans and the Eastern Jews and that was in Auschwitz also. </sentence><sentence id="1165">Maybe even stronger, that  4 didn't dawn on me first either. </sentence><sentence id="1166">Eh . .. </sentence><sentence id="1167">Maybe stronger because there were so many Polish women who had been there or some other camp and ghettos for a long time already. </sentence><sentence id="1168">This was "44. </sentence><sentence id="1169">They started in 39. </sentence><sentence id="1170">So, uh, they had so called jobs, and when somebody came, new in, who had been hiding or so, they always had a job for them. </sentence><sentence id="1171">Always. </sentence><sentence id="1172">They got...we never saw them again. </sentence><sentence id="1173">They got help. </sentence><sentence id="1174">We didn't...I didn't...I didn't know anybody. </sentence><sentence id="1175">I came with a Dutch group, and I was considered to be Dutch because I spoke Dutch with them. </sentence><sentence id="1176">The Dutch women were uh very unfortunate because they could never adjust, practically. </sentence><sentence id="1177">They, uh, died like the flies, especially in Auschwitz. </sentence><sentence id="1178">And, uh, I didn't understand that. </sentence><sentence id="1179">I met the Hungarian women who had come a few months before us. </sentence><sentence id="1180">Very intelligent, very...also attractive women. </sentence><sentence id="1181">They were at that...in this camp | was...it was uh, Birkenau B-2, uh, they were the keepers of the latrines, and the washrooms, and I uh washing...I don't know for some reason I thought I just have to wash every day and they were not always open, but I got friendly with them and I could come in. </sentence><sentence id="1182">Now washing is a big work because we had high, uh, uh, wash stands on high heels and you had to climb in there and then there was come cold water. </sentence><sentence id="1183">That was all. </sentence><sentence id="1184">And then you put your dress on again. </sentence><sentence id="1185">But it gave me a very good feeling that I had done that. </sentence><sentence id="1186">I felt...I felt I needed that. </sentence><sentence id="1187">And, uh, the Dutch women said to me, "You are crazy. </sentence><sentence id="1188">The next thing is you get pneumonia. </sentence><sentence id="1189">How can you go under that cold water? </sentence><sentence id="1190">You get pneumonia." </sentence><sentence id="1191">I said, "Maybe there is some loose dirt because it's already you know some...a whole day, but whatever there is, I feel good." </sentence><sentence id="1192">They didn't go. </sentence><sentence id="1193">It was not very comfortable climbing, but also the friendship I had with the...with the women from Hungary helped me to get in and have some time to talk to them. </sentence><sentence id="1194">The same with uh the latrine was closed at many hours. </sentence><sentence id="1195">I could always get in. </sentence><sentence id="1196">And, uh, we...we became good friends. </sentence><sentence id="1197">They were much younger than I was. </sentence></p></dialogue>
