<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="25">A: It was a very community-oriented family. </sentence><sentence id="26">My grandfather was a very interesting, self-made industrialist; and he...the community really loved him, and he was elected every year to be the community leader. </sentence><sentence id="27">And it was a very caring family. </sentence><sentence id="28">The rabbi used to come in, lunch time, and...and discuss with him the public affairs; and Grandfather was always available. </sentence><sentence id="29">He was, for me, a very, very beautiful man. </sentence><sentence id="30">He used to tell me stories, and ask me to write stories. </sentence><sentence id="31">So I had...I just really, really loved him. </sentence><sentence id="32">And when Grandmother died in 1939, I felt such a special compassion. </sentence><sentence id="33">I must take somehow care of Grandfather. </sentence><sentence id="34">And always asked him, "Let me do something for you for Shabbat. </sentence><sentence id="35">Let me do....". </sentence><sentence id="36">And he says, "I'm all dressed." </sentence><sentence id="37">When I looked down and I said, "But I think your shoe needs some shining." </sentence><sentence id="38">And he said, "No, you are too big for that. </sentence><sentence id="39">I, I couldn't permit you." </sentence><sentence id="40">And I said, "Please, Grandfather! </sentence><sentence id="41">I just...let me do just something for you." </sentence><sentence id="42">Grandfather was so very special for me. </sentence><sentence id="43">And a very compassionate, wonderful man who took care of the community. </sentence><sentence id="44">Who took care of the orphans of our city. </sentence><sentence id="45">Anybody who would get married and didn't had family, Grandfather was taking care of them. </sentence><sentence id="46">So it was an open house for the community, in a way. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="70">Q: What about your parents? </sentence><sentence id="71">What were they like? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="74">A: Father was a very elegant, very kind, wonderful man. </sentence><sentence id="75">Mother had a great big responsibility to take care of the four children, because Father was travelling a lot to business. </sentence><sentence id="76">Actually every week, went up to Budapest. </sentence><sentence id="77">He had an office there. </sentence><sentence id="78">And so Mother had a hard responsibility to raising the children; and she was, | think, very stern, very demanding. </sentence><sentence id="79">We had to know always who we are, and there were a lot of restrictions. </sentence><sentence id="80">And, you know, when you're young and...and separate so tragically as we separated, you really don't have a good picture at all. </sentence><sentence id="81">You don't...you have a very distorted picture, of your mother particularly. </sentence><sentence id="82">Uh, you didn't came to terms about how you was accepted, or...or...so that it's very hard for me to give any kind of picture of Mother. </sentence><sentence id="83">I just remember one of my rebellious natures about her. </sentence><sentence id="84">On Mother's Day, the school was asked always to...children were in the school asked to perform; and I remember the last Mother's Day, I got a poem about a very soft, gentle, loving mother. </sentence><sentence id="85">And I felt, "It's a mockery. </sentence><sentence id="86">This is not my mother, and I will not read this poem!" </sentence><sentence id="87">And I chose a poem about the trees that are cut so suddenly down, and it's a very beautiful poem. </sentence><sentence id="88">Until today I remember, because I didn't told my teacher. </sentence><sentence id="89">I didn't told anybody that I will change the script, and I will just say this poem about the trees that are cut down so terribly harshly, and what is their sin. </sentence><sentence id="90">Almost like I would speak about our community that was taken away so suddenly. </sentence><sentence id="91">So the trees almost replaced this community. </sentence><sentence id="92">But, of course, we did not know anything nearer to it before, what will happen to our community. </sentence><sentence id="93">But the poem was so interestingly prophetic about this forest that it will be erad...eradicated; and the trees will all gone and the...and the birds will not sing anymore, and what is the sin of this forest? </sentence><sentence id="94">So you can imagine the surprise of my mother, the surprise of my teacher, when I'm coming and talking about the forest. </sentence><sentence id="95">So you... you see, I wasn't clear, really, about the mother. </sentence><sentence id="96">If I could fashion her that time, probably I would made her extremely tender, extremely soft; but later I knew how important it was that she was firm and stern, because Auschwitz was so horrible. </sentence><sentence id="97">And it was almost her sternness, her demands were almost an education in survival, in a way. </sentence><sentence id="98">I don't know how to tell you that. </sentence><sentence id="99">But in very early stage of...of the tragic upheaval in Hungary, a drunk man came into our house and says, "You know, you will all be taken out, and you will be all...all be burning up, and so....". </sentence><sentence id="100">He said some horrible words. </sentence><sentence id="101">And I got so frightened, I pretended that I faint. </sentence><sentence id="102">I just was...it was...just fell down. </sentence><sentence id="103">And Mother--instead of taking care of this man, taking him out from household--she came over first and slapped my face, and said, "In our house, we don't faint." </sentence><sentence id="104">Well, that was good education in Auschwitz, because in Auschwitz we didn't fainted either. </sentence><sentence id="105">And so maybe in that respect, if I...[ should apologize to my wonderful mother who really gave me a little survival instincts. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="139">Q: Tell me about your.... Here's a kleenex. </sentence><sentence id="140">Tell me about your brothers and sister. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="143">A: I had an older sister, who was two and a half year older than I was. </sentence><sentence id="144">Her name was (clearing throat) Edith. </sentence><sentence id="145">Edith was brilliant. </sentence><sentence id="146">She was very, very intelligent. </sentence><sentence id="147">Edith wrote poetry, and Edith helped already in the office; and she was very self-sufficient. </sentence><sentence id="148">I was meek and shy and afraid. </sentence><sentence id="149">Edith was brave and not afraid. </sentence><sentence id="150">And she was always my shield, my strength. </sentence><sentence id="151">And Edith already earned a salary in the office, and her first purchase was a bicycle. </sentence><sentence id="152">And she was so proud of her purchase; and the first thing that the Germans, when they came in, took away were the bicycles and the radios. </sentence><sentence id="153">And it was very, very hurting. </sentence><sentence id="154">It was so tangible; because we...we just were not prepared for anything so brutal. </sentence><sentence id="155">That somebody comes into your house and takes out items, and says, "That you cannot have. </sentence><sentence id="156">That's not yours anymore, no matter how precious that is for you." </sentence><sentence id="157">And in the beginning it was really just items, but later it was life, [you know? ( </sentence><sentence id="158">ph)] We didn't knew it in the beginning. </sentence><sentence id="159">So for the whole tragedy, there wasn't much preparation in Hungary. </sentence><sentence id="160">If there was any voices from the outside, our town was pretty much shielded. </sentence><sentence id="161">Our family was even more protected. </sentence><sentence id="162">Our children...we did not know that anything horrible can happen to us. </sentence><sentence id="163">For me, it felt that our family lived in this town forever. </sentence><sentence id="164">Everybody knew us. </sentence><sentence id="165">Everybody knew who we are. </sentence><sentence id="166">We knew where our place was. </sentence><sentence id="167">So there was an order that I never felt could be broken. </sentence><sentence id="168">Summers we would go to summer vacations, to the Balaton [a resort area and lake in western Hungary, 55 miles southwest of Budapest]; and in...it was an industrious family. </sentence><sentence id="169">It was a productive family. </sentence><sentence id="170">Even if we were wealthy, it wasn't...that was not important. </sentence><sentence id="171">Everybody kind of had to do a task or that task, and be helpful in the household or whatever. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="201">Q: Your brother, too? </sentence><sentence id="202">You had a brother... </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="205">A: And we had two...I had two little brothers. </sentence><sentence id="206">So, because Mother had this task, I have decided I will be the the mother of my little brother; the younger one. </sentence><sentence id="207">The older one was too close to me, and | didn't have any jurisdiction. </sentence><sentence id="208">But the little one, I could be the mother; and I adored that little boy. </sentence><sentence id="209">His name...my older brother's name is Ocsi, and the younger was Imi. </sentence><sentence id="210">And Imi was three and a half year old when we went to the (cough)...to Auschwitz, and he was so adorable. </sentence><sentence id="211">I used to pretend that I'd play house, and...and he's really my...my baby. </sentence><sentence id="212">And I will shield him, and I will play mother all the time; and be that mother that I wanted my mother really should be: very tender, very loving, very caring. ( </sentence><sentence id="213">Clearing throat) All four of us one day found ourself in a calamity we could not imagine. </sentence><sentence id="214">I was reading a book--Stefan Zweig's book, The...The Restless Heart-- and I thought, "Oh, they say that they will take us to ajourney. </sentence><sentence id="215">I will save this book. </sentence><sentence id="216">It's a wonderful romance. </sentence><sentence id="217">I will read it on the journey." </sentence><sentence id="218">Because when you travel, you take a book and you read. </sentence><sentence id="219">Not knowing where they take us, how they take us; and that uh they really will reduce us, slowly, to animals. </sentence><sentence id="220">And everything came in degrees; steps, you know. </sentence><sentence id="221">And you always said, "No. </sentence><sentence id="222">Really, it's not happening. </sentence><sentence id="223">It can't happen in the 20th century." </sentence><sentence id="224">First telling you that you have to leave your house. </sentence><sentence id="225">What does it mean? </sentence><sentence id="226">You are going, and they say the word, a very strange word. </sentence><sentence id="227">It was nothing in Hungary. </sentence><sentence id="228">They're taking you to a ghetto. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="253">Q: Uh let's go back just a little bit, alright? </sentence><sentence id="254">Uh, because I want to know really how it happened. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="257">When did things...before the ghetto, when did things begin to change? </sentence><sentence id="258">What was it like </sentence></p><p><sentence id="259"> when the war broke out? </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="260">A: Right. </sentence><sentence id="261">But it came gradually. </sentence><sentence id="262">Degrees, you see. </sentence><sentence id="263">And to a smaller town it came slower than to a bigger town, where you had radios all the time. </sentence><sentence id="264">And...and we knew the war. </sentence><sentence id="265">We knew that there were refugees. </sentence><sentence id="266">Uh, poor people always came. </sentence><sentence id="267">Almost every day we had some visitor who sat at our table and told stories what's happening. </sentence><sentence id="268">Sometimes we didn't believe them. </sentence><sentence id="269">Sometimes we felt they're just telling us story to get, maybe, the meal or something else. </sentence><sentence id="270">Then...and now we couldn't have help any more in the house. </sentence><sentence id="271">And we...we got a Jewish girl, who was a refugee from Czechoslovakia; and she used to tell me stories that she had to go flee in the middle of the night, and she couldn't find her boots. </sentence><sentence id="272">And she just found one boot and she went with one boot, crossing the border over into Hungary. </sentence><sentence id="273">I couldn't imagine such a horrible thing; that somebody in the winter who... who walking in one boots to cross the country. </sentence><sentence id="274">But we always felt so very protected; and Grandfather would say, "Look, maybe it happens in Poland, in Czechoslovakia. </sentence><sentence id="275">But Hungary is civilized. </sentence><sentence id="276">We are very good taxpayers. </sentence><sentence id="277">They need us here. </sentence><sentence id="278">It will not happen." </sentence><sentence id="279">And then one day, they say that you pack up twenty-five kilo. </sentence><sentence id="280">What is twenty-five kilo? </sentence><sentence id="281">What do you take? </sentence><sentence id="282">Your pots and pans? </sentence><sentence id="283">Your photographs? </sentence><sentence id="284">Your...food? </sentence><sentence id="285">I remember that day, that Mother send me to somebody, to a neighbor, to get a recipe about uh certain--like toll house cookies, that you just spoke about a few minutes ago--because for the trip that would keep longer. </sentence><sentence id="286">And I thought to myself, "Gee, I don't even like it. </sentence><sentence id="287">Why would we take...? </sentence><sentence id="288">I would never eat that. </sentence><sentence id="289">I mean, it's just so dry." </sentence><sentence id="290">So I went and got the recipe; and so Mother and the help and all, they're baking up these toll house cookies or whatever, they.... It was some some kind of a bread kind of thing (cough) for the journey. </sentence><sentence id="291">Prior to that, there was talks about rumors that maybe they're taking us to Madagascar. </sentence><sentence id="292">And so quickly Mother enrolled to a class, baking class. </sentence><sentence id="293">I don't know from where they...some of the women got the information that they ...that they need to be bakers, or maybe they.... I don't know what was the logic. </sentence><sentence id="294">Anyhow, somebody gave a class on baking...a baking class. </sentence><sentence id="295">And the class was held at the rabbi's house. </sentence><sentence id="296">And I used to transcribe the recipes for Mother, for all this fancy, wonderful bakers...bake...baking goods. </sentence><sentence id="297">So those are the recollections that I have, that we knew that something will happen. </sentence><sentence id="298">But really nobody, nobody had imagination; and then (clearing throat) to...to really believe the extent. </sentence><sentence id="299">Nobody. </sentence><sentence id="300">And then because of Grandfather position, they arranged a special ghetto for a couple of people...uh, where the school was, opposite the synagogue. </sentence><sentence id="301">And I had a picture of the synagogue. </sentence><sentence id="302">I will show it a little later. </sentence><sentence id="303">And...and so it was the school-house. </sentence><sentence id="304">So we were in the schoolhouse. </sentence><sentence id="305">Some people in that area...the way they divided the ghetto, they build a wooden wall one end of the street and the other end of the street. ( </sentence><sentence id="306">Clearing throat) And it was a (cough) kind of a natrow passage with the synagogue, the rabbi's house, the school and uh two more Jewish homes. </sentence><sentence id="307">And um...the Jewish butcher who...who lived behind the...the synagogue. </sentence><sentence id="308">So this was one ghetto. </sentence><sentence id="309">The other ghetto that they divised was in the brick factory, that the rest of the community went. </sentence><sentence id="310">And we had some permissions to go out twice a week to the market-- that was probably ten minutes away--to buy some food in the market. </sentence><sentence id="311">But it wasn't any warm water; so when we were there for about a week, I had an idea--I always loved children very much--to gather all the children. </sentence><sentence id="312">There were about ten...ten, twelve children--and take them to the ritual bath; because it wasn't any warm water to wash them for "Shabbat." </sentence><sentence id="313">But I didn't dare to ask my mother, because she wouldn't let me and we couldn't go out from the ghetto only with permission and she wouldn't let me to speak. </sentence><sentence id="314">I mean, it was not in my position to go and speak to anybody. </sentence><sentence id="315">But the soldier who was watching us was a little bit bored; and I went over to him and said, "Look at the children. </sentence><sentence id="316">Look how dirty they are. </sentence><sentence id="317">What do you think, I will take them out; and I promise you, I promise you I'll bring them back in half an hour. </sentence><sentence id="318">Just wash them in the ritual bath." </sentence><sentence id="319">And to my great amazement, he permitted that. </sentence><sentence id="320">And so, without Mother's knowledge, I assembled the children and took them out; and sure enough, we came back. </sentence><sentence id="321">And Mother didn't found out, so I felt very, very lucky; because you can imagine the risk. </sentence><sentence id="322">And then I had another idea. </sentence><sentence id="323">Why don't I take the children into the garden of the synagogue--that was just secluded--and I and Edith will be the kindergarten teacher, and we'll teach them songs and play with them. </sentence><sentence id="324">And we did that. </sentence><sentence id="325">So Edith was wonderful, because she right away felt this is a very good idea; and also said, "Let us not say it to Mother, because she will not let us. </sentence><sentence id="326">She will not let us do it, because she will say, "It's too much work;," or, "Something may happen to the children or to you." </sentence><sentence id="327">She will not agree. </sentence><sentence id="328">It's...it's our...." So in a way, we started to be very independent and kind of rebellious, and continued to do that even in the ghetto. </sentence><sentence id="329">And...and sure enough, we had the children there. </sentence><sentence id="330">And one day the door opens as we are singing and the children are in a circle, and Mother comes in with a bowl of cherries. </sentence><sentence id="331">She went to the market. </sentence><sentence id="332">They let her out, and she brought the bowl of cherries to us. </sentence><sentence id="333">So she knew all the time what we are doing; and those were the most wonderful cherries I ever had. </sentence><sentence id="334">I never, never had anything so wonderful since then. </sentence><sentence id="335">And so, Mother knew Edith and I were the kindergarten teachers of these children; and it was now official that we took care of the children. </sentence><sentence id="336">So one day they say that (cough)...now, that special ...special permission is not granted anymore. </sentence><sentence id="337">We also going over to the brick factory. </sentence><sentence id="338">And we went over, and...for one night, and we slept on the floor; and the next morning they took us to the railroad station. </sentence><sentence id="339">Marching through our town was like a scene out of the Bible. </sentence><sentence id="340">From ancient time. </sentence><sentence id="341">I could not tell you the humiliation I felt; carrying our baggage, passing our house, looking into our window, seeing the people who occupied our house looking at us, and nobody stopping. </sentence><sentence id="342">They marched us to the railroad. </sentence><sentence id="343">Nobody says, "Come on. </sentence><sentence id="344">You cannot do it." </sentence><sentence id="345">On a June day, 1944, 20th century men cannot be just taken from their homes, from their town, from their house, from their belonging, marched into a cattle train, seventy people. ( </sentence><sentence id="346">Cough) Before they marched us all in, they took the men to a labor camp. </sentence><sentence id="347">So when Father found out that they're taking the men to a labor camp, one morning he got up and said hastily goodbye to us; and said, "Just don't forget who you are," and, "Escape." </sentence><sentence id="348">Those are the two words I remember. </sentence><sentence id="349">And he went up to Budapest; and somehow, because he was so sure and so very elegant, nobody stopped him. </sentence><sentence id="350">And he went, like always he would go to his office; and here he got in Budapest the Raoul Wallenberg papers. </sentence><sentence id="351">And my father did not go to Auschwitz; but we, the family, (clearing throat) were in the cattle train in the hottest day with one sanitary bucket for seventy people--seventy to seventy-five people. </sentence><sentence id="352">Our bundled (cough) luggage piled on top of each other; realizing that we have not even standing room, or very little. </sentence><sentence id="353">I tried to be close to the window, and I remember I was standing all the time; because it was almost just maybe room for squatting down where you were standing. </sentence><sentence id="354">But really no sitting place; and Edith next to me. </sentence><sentence id="355">At the border from Hungary to Czechoslovakia, they opened the cattle train. </sentence><sentence id="356">And I asked the soldier if he would let us go to the bathroom. </sentence><sentence id="357">He said, "There's no bathroom here, but you can go behind the train. </sentence><sentence id="358">I remember that it was (clearing throat) very funny feeling to be moment free, and look at the sky; but we still did not know where are we going. </sentence><sentence id="359">And Edith keep telling me, "Maybe we just...they will just take us to work. </sentence><sentence id="360">And maybe very soon that we will come back, and...you know. </sentence><sentence id="361">I mean, it will not be so bad." </sentence><sentence id="362">They took us day and night. </sentence><sentence id="363">And at one place, the train suddenly stopped; at Vecses (ph)], and we suddenly understood. </sentence><sentence id="364">And I could see through the blinds that some people--three people--jumped down from the train. </sentence><sentence id="365">And, of course, the SS right away after them; and I think they caught two of them with the...and shot them right away. </sentence><sentence id="366">So even if the rest of the train could not see--the cattle train inside--I saw all what happened, because I was so...you couldn't move away from your position. </sentence><sentence id="367">Wherever you was positioned, you was like plastered; and it was a little plank there open, and I could see through and also a little bit through the window. </sentence><sentence id="368">And I saw how they dragged this man that they caught with their dog. </sentence><sentence id="369">So I witnessed first time that savage brutality that really was the lead in to Auschwitz. </sentence><sentence id="370">And when the train stopped again, we arrived. </sentence><sentence id="371">This horrible place. </sentence><sentence id="372">Everybody in strange uniforms. </sentence><sentence id="373">I told Edith, "It looks that they took us to the wrong place. </sentence><sentence id="374">Somehow, somebody will come and apologize. </sentence><sentence id="375">Somebody will say it's totally wrong. </sentence><sentence id="376">You don't belong here. </sentence><sentence id="377">This looks like an insane asylum. </sentence><sentence id="378">People are shaved heads and striped clothes." </sentence><sentence id="379">So since we couldn't comb our hair and Mother was so very "Pedant" [German word meaning a person who is meticulous or precise], Mother said, "Put a handkerchief over your head, you know, and come down from the...from the cattle train." </sentence><sentence id="380">And I had my little brother, who couldn't find his shoe. </sentence><sentence id="381">And I was trying to tell him that he has to be more orderly. </sentence><sentence id="382">A three and a half year old must find his shoe. </sentence><sentence id="383">There was no time to look for anything. </sentence><sentence id="384">Just had to go down, line up in five. </sentence><sentence id="385">And fast, and rapid. </sentence><sentence id="386">And anybody who couldn't go was just hit by the stick. </sentence><sentence id="387">It was like madness. </sentence><sentence id="388">I (cough) lined up; and a tall German soldier came to me and started to, you know, look a minute and then just looked at me and said, "Haben Sie Kinder?"

(snapping fingers)..."life"..."death." </sentence><sentence id="501">He just with his hand motioned. </sentence><sentence id="502">One day Edith said, "You know, I don't feel good anymore. </sentence><sentence id="503">I don't feel good." </sentence><sentence id="504">And our little friend, Ibi got very delirious from the same bad plank bed; was the plank board that we shared. </sentence><sentence id="505">And Ibi started to talk words I couldn't understand, and was...she had terrible high fever. </sentence><sentence id="506">And anybody who was sick or had any kind of rash or something was selected in the morning out. </sentence><sentence id="507">Sometimes they took them to the infirmary. </sentence><sentence id="508">Sometimes they took them somewhere else. </sentence><sentence id="509">This morning they took Ibi. </sentence><sentence id="510">And then the next morning, Edith says, "I...I feel sick. </sentence><sentence id="511">You must let me go. </sentence><sentence id="512">I must go into the infirmary." </sentence><sentence id="513">And I begged her, "Edith, you can't! </sentence><sentence id="514">They will take you!" </sentence><sentence id="515">But somehow they saw her, that she was sick. </sentence><sentence id="516">She couldn't stand up for the counting. </sentence><sentence id="517">And they took her to the infirmary; but by now I was veteran. </sentence><sentence id="518">I knew when is the best time to go away from group, when I can go in and see her. </sentence><sentence id="519">So every morning I would go in to Edith and see her there. </sentence><sentence id="520">See Ibi, my friend, totally in delirium; and see Edith getting higher and higher fever every...every day. ( </sentence><sentence id="521">Sniffling) I went to the woman at the gate, and begged her to let me in; and if I would give away my bread she let me in. </sentence><sentence id="522">And she asked me some favors to do. </sentence><sentence id="523">Not so kindly, of course. </sentence><sentence id="524">At least, they were favors. </sentence><sentence id="525">She said, "First take all the dead out. </sentence><sentence id="526">Carry the dead out. </sentence><sentence id="527">Then you can go in." </sentence><sentence id="528">I never saw a dead person before, and now I had to carry the dead people out first in order to see Edith. </sentence><sentence id="529">And I told her...I said, "I'm not afraid. </sentence><sentence id="530">They were just like me yesterday. </sentence><sentence id="531">I'm not afraid." </sentence><sentence id="532">So I carried them. </sentence><sentence id="533">Sometimes I had to carry out the... the bedpans, the...the--they were not bedpans that...they were buckets (cough), filled buckets that spilled over as you walked (cough)--in order to go in to Edith. </sentence><sentence id="534">But there were so few who could get into the infirmary that when they saw me coming, people from all the beds pulled at me. " </sentence><sentence id="535">What's happening outside? </sentence><sentence id="536">Tell what's happening!" </sentence><sentence id="537">And I knew that I must tell them stories. </sentence><sentence id="538">I must tell them that the war is almost over, that they just should hold out, that I just heard gun shot...shootings in the middle of the night. </sentence><sentence id="539">Nothing will happen, and they just...just be brave ...hold out, because the war will be soon over. </sentence><sentence id="540">We are going home soon. </sentence><sentence id="541">So those were my stories every morning, before I could see Edith. </sentence><sentence id="542">And one morning when she wasn't any more in that high fever, I said, "Now when I'm taking the dead, you crawl with me. </sentence><sentence id="543">You come after me, because they're taking away. </sentence><sentence id="544">Ibi is already not here. </sentence><sentence id="545">You must come with me out of here." </sentence><sentence id="546">And that's what happened. </sentence><sentence id="547">Edith came out. </sentence><sentence id="548">And here we...we were (cough) together again. </sentence><sentence id="549">Somehow Edith got better, but very weak. </sentence><sentence id="550">And then there were selections again and again and again. </sentence><sentence id="551">One day they said to us, "You will get winter clothes. </sentence><sentence id="552">Go. </sentence><sentence id="553">March up." </sentence><sentence id="554">They selected a bunch of children. </sentence><sentence id="555">This time, the Blockaltester selected the children. </sentence><sentence id="556">And she kind of told us stories; because, of course, the SS wouldn't tell where you are going. </sentence><sentence id="557">But she said, "You will get warm clothes. </sentence><sentence id="558">Don't be afraid. </sentence><sentence id="559">Just go. </sentence><sentence id="560">Just go. </sentence><sentence id="561">Warm clothes." </sentence><sentence id="562">And I said to Edith, "Don't worry. </sentence><sentence id="563">I will come back and bring you some warm clothes. </sentence><sentence id="564">I will just snatch another one extra for you."

So I went over to an other friend, and asked if she would want to run away with us. </sentence><sentence id="1090">I didn't talk loud because it was very dangerous. </sentence><sentence id="1091">If I would...if anybody would find out that we planned something, it would give us out; because easily the group could be punished if something...somebody just tried to do anything out of the ordinary. </sentence><sentence id="1092">Every morning that was told us. </sentence><sentence id="1093">If we try anything that it's not permitted, a person will be shot. </sentence><sentence id="1094">So it was very risky to do anything. </sentence><sentence id="1095">But the friend agreed, and I told Edith, "Now let's dig a hole, and let's go down to the bottom of the hay." </sentence><sentence id="1096">It was about three meters. </sentence><sentence id="1097">It was a very high hay. " </sentence><sentence id="1098">And we just tell in the morning that we feel asleep...we fell into this hole. </sentence><sentence id="1099">If they find us, we'll say we didn't heard anything. </sentence><sentence id="1100">We just down into the hay." </sentence><sentence id="1101">It had to be done very secretly. </sentence><sentence id="1102">And we just parted the hay as fast as we could all together. </sentence><sentence id="1103">First we dig that hole into the hay, the bottom of the hay; and three meters above us were the rest of them were sleeping. </sentence><sentence id="1104">And we went close to the plank, and the planks were giving some air. </sentence><sentence id="1105">They were not totally sealed. </sentence><sentence id="1106">You could see also through. </sentence><sentence id="1107">They couldn't see in, but you could see out; and it was tiny little um room between...between the wooden planks, you know, that you could get some air in and also look out. </sentence><sentence id="1108">And we had a little bread. </sentence><sentence id="1109">I had a little bread in my... in my clothes, and Edith had a bread and Ibi had some bread, that we somehow managed to save. </sentence><sentence id="1110">And we said, "We...we will just pretend that we fell asleep." </sentence><sentence id="1111">In the morning...of course, we didn't slept all night. </sentence><sentence id="1112">In the morning, we hear them whistling, and whistling, and whistling again.

And after probably an hour and a half delay and search and whistle and counting, the group went away. </sentence><sentence id="1119">They marched away. </sentence><sentence id="1120">There is no way to explain what it is--freedom-- at that moment, that you don't hear the voices anymore, that you know that they went away, and now you are somehow...your plot worked! </sentence><sentence id="1121">You are free. </sentence><sentence id="1122">So Edith says, "Now we will tell Bible stories. </sentence><sentence id="1123">We will tell all the stories that we remember from the Bible where miracles happened. </sentence><sentence id="1124">Don't you remember the Red Sea parting? </sentence><sentence id="1125">It happened to the Jews, you know. </sentence><sentence id="1126">Could it happen to three children? </sentence><sentence id="1127">It was a miracle." </sentence><sentence id="1128">Slowly, slowly we said the "Shabbat" songs, and the shma... everything that came to our mind to make the time pass; and we knew we need time here. </sentence><sentence id="1129">We need time to stay there. </sentence><sentence id="1130">Suddenly, we hear the door opening and a German comes in and raking the hay. </sentence><sentence id="1131">But we were so quiet and so under that hay, that even if I could feel the boots on...on my head, he couldn't feel us. </sentence><sentence id="1132">See, now we were not breathing even. </sentence><sentence id="1133">And after a while, went away and closed that barn to the natrowest--I mean only just for air to come. </sentence><sentence id="1134">I can't tell you how narrow it was. </sentence><sentence id="1135">I mean, I'm trying to ...to show it now with my hand, probably. </sentence><sentence id="1136">And so night comes, and we are singing our songs for ourselves; and we...now that another day passed, and...and the group is further away, and maybe we are...we are safe. </sentence><sentence id="1137">And then we decide--it was Thursday--"Let's wait until Shabbat; Shabbat...after the three stars, we will come out." </sentence><sentence id="1138">By then the group is far away; and then we will just try our luck. </sentence><sentence id="1139">So now this little bread had to...had to somehow be enough. </sentence><sentence id="1140">And so we doled out morsels, and we told stories for ourself: what was the "Shabbat" dinner like at home? </sentence><sentence id="1141">What are we eating now? </sentence><sentence id="1142">Is now a wonderful soup, and now this wonderful chicken dinner Mother would cook; and I would remind Edith how terrible a child I was, that I didn't wanted to eat. </sentence><sentence id="1143">I never liked the food. </sentence><sentence id="1144">How I will apologize to Mother when I come home! </sentence><sentence id="1145">And we will not tell her how we suffered. </sentence><sentence id="1146">We will never let her know what happened in Auschwitz, never let her know what happened on this road. </sentence><sentence id="1147">She will never know it. </sentence><sentence id="1148">Just one more time together. </sentence><sentence id="1149">So Saturday night, we waited "til the stars came out and we said the Shma three times. </sentence><sentence id="1150">And we went to the door, but the door was so narrow that barely we could fit through. </sentence><sentence id="1151">We couldn't go front. </sentence><sentence id="1152">We could only go sideways to come out from this door, from this little opening. </sentence><sentence id="1153">It was already dark outside. </sentence><sentence id="1154">We saw from the distance um...a hut. </sentence><sentence id="1155">And there was light in the hut. </sentence><sentence id="1156">And we knocked on the door; and it was a German heavy-set, tall man sitting in front of a desk, with his pipe on the table and a dog next to him. </sentence><sentence id="1157">And Edith, who spoke very beautiful German, said to him, "Please, don't send us away. </sentence><sentence id="1158">We don't need food. </sentence><sentence id="1159">We already know how to live without food, so you don't have to worry about our food. </sentence><sentence id="1160">Just give us any work. </sentence><sentence id="1161">Let us do anything. </sentence><sentence id="1162">The only thing we want is to meet our parents again. </sentence><sentence id="1163">We are three children. </sentence><sentence id="1164">We didn't do anything wrong. </sentence><sentence id="1165">We fell asleep. </sentence><sentence id="1166">We didn't hear the group going. </sentence><sentence id="1167">Let us stay here." </sentence><sentence id="1168">The man looked at us, and at her; then he looked at his dog, and said to the dog, "Get those damn Jews. </sentence><sentence id="1169">Get those Verfluchtener Juden." </sentence><sentence id="1170">We turned around, with our head down, marching out through this open yard. </sentence><sentence id="1171">Where are we going? </sentence><sentence id="1172">What are we doing now? ( </sentence><sentence id="1173">sniffling) Edith says, "I see a hand in the dark. </sentence><sentence id="1174">Do you see a hand in the dark? </sentence><sentence id="1175">Somebody motioning from the...from the barn." </sentence><sentence id="1176">We didn't know it is a barn, but on the other end of the yard. </sentence><sentence id="1177">It was quite dark, so we couldn't see really; just a silhouette and a hand. </sentence><sentence id="1178">And I said, "Yes, I'm seeing it. </sentence><sentence id="1179">Let's hurry, and let us go there." </sentence><sentence id="1180">And we...it was a barn, and soon we understood that there are some Italian soldiers there who are war refugees. </sentence><sentence id="1181">And they spoke broken German, and we spoke broken German; and we told them that we fell asleep. </sentence><sentence id="1182">We didn't know that the group left, and please help us. </sentence><sentence id="1183">All we want is to meet our parents. </sentence><sentence id="1184">And they said just to stay here, just... next to the cows. </sentence><sentence id="1185">Boy how we envied the cows! </sentence><sentence id="1186">How wonderful existence they had, compared to ours. </sentence><sentence id="1187">So suddenly some warm water arrives, bring us some drink, and then wash our hand and face. </sentence><sentence id="1188">And then we realized that from the hay, as we were digging, we were totally covered with black um dust that accumulated in that hay. </sentence><sentence id="1189">And that we are not recognizable, even as we looked. </sentence><sentence id="1190">Normally we were not recognizable, so even now more. </sentence><sentence id="1191">And somehow one of them spoke a little better German, and say to us that in a little while somebody will come and take us to their barrack, and they will have food for us. </sentence><sentence id="1192">In little while, somebody came and took us. </sentence><sentence id="1193">And you cannot imagine- -no way I will have the language, I will not have the ability to paint it or say it in any other way--what it feels when you look up at the sky and you're free, you see the stars shining and you are...you feel free. </sentence><sentence id="1194">I keep looking back if the SS is not following me. </sentence><sentence id="1195">Nobody followed us. </sentence><sentence id="1196">This Italian worker went in the front, and we just went after him until we reached his...the little barrack. </sentence><sentence id="1197">It turned out there were 13 Italians. </sentence><sentence id="1198">And the table was set...three, three bowls, three spoons. </sentence><sentence id="1199">Somebody took out the guitar and started to play music, and we were stunned. </sentence><sentence id="1200">We couldn't believe that this kind of magic can ever happen, not to three children. </sentence><sentence id="1201">I watched their faces if they are not disgusted, the way we looked; because we had sores on our legs. </sentence><sentence id="1202">We had no coverage. </sentence><sentence id="1203">We had no stocking, and the the frost and the sore and the dust and the filth. </sentence><sentence id="1204">But they are singing. </sentence><sentence id="1205">They play the guitar. </sentence><sentence id="1206">They told us to eat, warm food, and they talked very rapidly in Italian. </sentence><sentence id="1207">We didn't understood. </sentence><sentence id="1208">But later, the one who spoke a little German said, "Don't worry. </sentence><sentence id="1209">Tomorrow morning when we go to work, we will do a place for you in the forest. </sentence><sentence id="1210">We'll take you there and hide you. </sentence><sentence id="1211">So after you eat, just go back to the...to the barn. </sentence><sentence id="1212">And tomorrow morning you come here again for food, and then just wait here "til we'll pick you up for the forest." </sentence><sentence id="1213">You can imagine that we didn't slept all night.(Sigh) The miracle could happen for three children. </sentence><sentence id="1214">And the morning came, and they took us back to their place and they hastily said goodbye, and said, "Don't worry. </sentence><sentence id="1215">We'll come. </sentence><sentence id="1216">We will have the place for you ready by noon. </sentence><sentence id="1217">Just stay here." </sentence><sentence id="1218">And sat there quietly. </sentence><sentence id="1219">Then the door opens, and an old SS man comes in and says, "Follow me.

because somebody told me if I cook her some potato, the potato peel will stop her diarrhea. </sentence><sentence id="1364">So I tried to do that, but of course nothing helped. </sentence><sentence id="1365">And then I dragged her to an infirmary, and I tried to pretend that I am sick, too; and tried to help there to take away the bed pans. </sentence><sentence id="1366">And very soon an English soldier came and says, "You must leave the infirmary. </sentence><sentence id="1367">It's only for the very ill. </sentence><sentence id="1368">You can't be here." </sentence><sentence id="1369">I tried...I didn't know English, so I tried somehow in German to tell her, tell him, "Please let me stay with my sister. </sentence><sentence id="1370">Please don't take me away." </sentence><sentence id="1371">He asked me what barrack I am;

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1768">A: I was in Sweden. </sentence><sentence id="1769">And (cough) one day the chief doctor came to my bed, and said, "If I will bring you the best news of your life, will you promise me you will be alright?" </sentence><sentence id="1770">I was so weak, he didn't wanted to tell me any kind of news. </sentence><sentence id="1771">And I promised him. </sentence><sentence id="1772">And says, "I have a telegram from Tangier, where your relatives lived, that your father is alive in Hungary." </sentence><sentence id="1773">I was so weak that he was..he came by himself; because he was so worried that the good news may just finish me up. </sentence><sentence id="1774">But it was such an incredible news, because, you know, that it had to be shared with all the girls in the hospital. </sentence><sentence id="1775">With...with everyone, because so few of...of us had anybody who came back who was alive. </sentence><sentence id="1776">So in a minute the whole floor knew that my father is alive; and I ran around, you know. </sentence><sentence id="1777">I got up from the bed, and I was...I felt like I'm healthy. </sentence><sentence id="1778">I...1 can walk. </sentence><sentence id="1779">And the doctor said, "Just take it easy. </sentence><sentence id="1780">Don't...don't...don't dance. </sentence><sentence id="1781">Don't run around. </sentence><sentence id="1782">Don't..." It...it was just unbelievable that somebody from the family is alive. </sentence><sentence id="1783">It was such an incredible mixed feeling, because actually the death--you didn't accept it totally. </sentence><sentence id="1784">You always hoped that Mother is alive. </sentence><sentence id="1785">You always hoped that (cough) you will find your sister. </sentence><sentence id="1786">You always hoped that...that somehow something about your brother. </sentence><sentence id="1787">I mean, forever played games with your brain. </sentence><sentence id="1788">But when something so concrete as a telegram came... So I started to get first a letter from Tangier...from the relative, Mrs. [Renee] Reichman. </sentence><sentence id="1789">And...and then later, from my father. </sentence><sentence id="1790">And so Father wrote that he would like I should come back to Hungary as soon as the doctor lets me go. </sentence><sentence id="1791">And I could barely wait to...to...for that moment. </sentence><sentence id="1792">The Swedish people were incredible. </sentence><sentence id="1793">They were so gentle and good to us. </sentence><sentence id="1794">I felt like I... woke up in...in heaven. </sentence><sentence id="1795">After this brutality, after...after this horror, after this inhumanity, to come to a civilized country, that three hundred years didn't have any war. </sentence><sentence id="1796">Who...who.... Volunteers come into the hospital. </sentence><sentence id="1797">They bring us a magazine, and we should show them from the magazine-- because we couldn't speak Swedish--what food we want to eat. </sentence><sentence id="1798">I mean, after Bergen-Belsen, after Auschwitz, what incredible people! </sentence><sentence id="1799">It was like angels gliding. </sentence><sentence id="1800">They would organize concerts. </sentence><sentence id="1801">I would hear music. </sentence><sentence id="1802">They didn't know how to make our lives whole again. </sentence><sentence id="1803">Such magical, wonderful people. </sentence><sentence id="1804">This family connected--the family that sent the telegram connected also us to a family in London, who had a representative in Sweden who wasn't Jewish. </sentence><sentence id="1805">And this representative got a telegram that there is a, that there is a...this little girl here in one of the hospitals; and please look him up, it's part of the family. </sentence><sentence id="1806">And this wonderful Swede, instead of sending his secretary or sending a letter, he got in his car and he went to the hospital. </sentence><sentence id="1807">But you know, we were so sick that...that we were taken from one city to the other. </sentence><sentence id="1808">They couldn't figure out; we had every illness there was. </sentence><sentence id="1809">So they always sorted out us--children with tuberculosis, people with tuberculosis went to one place. </sentence><sentence id="1810">So when he arrived to this hospital, I was already in another hospital; and he kind of repeated two, three times. </sentence><sentence id="1811">When he catched up with me, he said, "You know, ..." Um, the nurse came in and said that there's somebody from my family here. </sentence><sentence id="1812">I said, "I don't have family. </sentence><sentence id="1813">I have nobody." </sentence><sentence id="1814">She said, "No, you have to come out. </sentence><sentence id="1815">You...you.... Somebody is waiting for you outside." </sentence><sentence id="1816">And I was so...still so frightened; to be taken out from the group meant total insecurity, you know. </sentence><sentence id="1817">You are sick...only if you are in a group, if you are nobody.... And so anyhow, the nurse coaxed me out; and she said, "This is this gentleman, and he says he's related to you." </sentence><sentence id="1818">And he explained that that he's not related, but he's the representative of my relatives from London. </sentence><sentence id="1819">I guess that nurse and that...that the uncle in London asked this gentleman to look after me. </sentence><sentence id="1820">And this gentleman--who was so humane, so incredible, magnificent, wasn't a Jewish man--instead of sending letters or trying through the telephone, he went and and he...he found me. </sentence><sentence id="1821">And he said, "Look, I have a daughter just like you, your age. </sentence><sentence id="1822">You come to my house and get to know her." </sentence><sentence id="1823">And I said, "No, I'm still sick. </sentence><sentence id="1824">The doctor won't let me go." </sentence><sentence id="1825">And he says, "Just come in then for a weekend. </sentence><sentence id="1826">Get to know Mary. </sentence><sentence id="1827">She's a very good girl." </sentence><sentence id="1828">And I thanked him very much; but I didn't wanted to go. </sentence><sentence id="1829">And it took me a little while, after that he left, to see what a gentle, wonderful man this was, who came and with such gentleness tried to coax me back to life. </sentence><sentence id="1830">And... and then when the doctor permitted, and when I was a certain weight and...and I could really go, the doctor permitted and I visited them. </sentence><sentence id="1831">And I met Mary. </sentence><sentence id="1832">And it was so magical this summer, because I was in London and I met Mary again and we recalled this unbelievable time. </sentence><sentence id="1833">How his [her] father brought me back and reconnected me with everything that was humane in the most gentle, most wonderful fashion. </sentence><sentence id="1834">And I told Mary the story of the hat... </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1903">Q: Look at me if you can. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1905">A: I met...I was several times in Stockholm after that, and this wonderful Mr. [Gustaf] Haggberg-- Haggberg was his name--would take me to the opera, would take me to the most beautiful restaurant. </sentence><sentence id="1906">Would show me the word "freedom," how civilized man behaved, show me how to be without prejudiced. </sentence><sentence id="1907">And I made a vow: "If I ever grow up, I will be like Mr. Haggberg. </sentence><sentence id="1908">I will not hate. </sentence><sentence id="1909">I will not be prejudiced. </sentence><sentence id="1910">I will learn to love the world again, and all people." </sentence><sentence id="1911">And one day after a correspondence with my father, we decided that I should come back to Hungary. </sentence><sentence id="1912">And I came to Stockholm to say goodbye to Mr. Haggberg. </sentence><sentence id="1913">And Mr. Haggberg looks at me and says, "Alice, do you have a hat?" </sentence><sentence id="1914">You know, I don't have a country. </sentence><sentence id="1915">I don't have a name. </sentence><sentence id="1916">I am nobody. </sentence><sentence id="1917">I...my hair barely grows up. </sentence><sentence id="1918">I have one dress. " </sentence><sentence id="1919">A hat? </sentence><sentence id="1920">No, I don't have a hat." </sentence><sentence id="1921">He said, "Alice, you cannot travel through Europe without a hat! </sentence><sentence id="1922">You have to have a hat. </sentence><sentence id="1923">You are a young lady now." </sentence><sentence id="1924">And he rings the bell and rings Vera, the secretary; comes in and says, "Vera, you must go right now and buy a hat for Alice. </sentence><sentence id="1925">She cannot travel through Europe without a hat!" </sentence><sentence id="1926">And so we went into a place, the first place, the first little "chapeau" that came--a brown little "chapeau" that came to my hand--I put it on and...and bashfully said, "That's perfect. </sentence><sentence id="1927">Thank you." </sentence><sentence id="1928">And that little hat was my dignity. </sentence><sentence id="1929">He gave back my dignity. </sentence><sentence id="1930">And I went back to Hungary and I met my father. </sentence><sentence id="1931">And was an incredible reunion on the train. </sentence><sentence id="1932">And very soon he told me that he really is getting married the next week. </sentence><sentence id="1933">And it was for me a very difficult...difficult moment, to realize that Mother is really not coming back, that Father's life must go on the way he wants it to, to go on. </sentence><sentence id="1934">And that perhaps I shouldn't come back. </sentence><sentence id="1935">It was hard. </sentence><sentence id="1936">And I decided very soon after that I should really not live in Hungary, that I really should go to Israel. </sentence><sentence id="1937">It was no "aliyah." </sentence><sentence id="1938">It was no possibility. </sentence><sentence id="1939">And I went up to one of the the group. </sentence><sentence id="1940">It was B'nai Akiva. </sentence><sentence id="1941">And I told them that I must go, illegal or what; and anyway, I must go. </sentence><sentence id="1942">I must go. </sentence><sentence id="1943">I must go away from here, to Israel. </sentence><sentence id="1944">And they say that there is a Brichah, there is a group of people that will go in a certain time; but I have to have a lot of documents. </sentence><sentence id="1945">I have to have a lot of...because they are totally illegal, and they go from Yugoslavia. </sentence><sentence id="1946">And that they are...that this group in Budapest is not responsible if we will arrive to Israel or no. </sentence><sentence id="1947">But that's my only chance. </sentence><sentence id="1948">So I had to find all the documents; and they were very difficult, because Father.... I didn't want that Father should know yet that I am going to Israel, because he wouldn't hear of it. </sentence><sentence id="1949">He just wouldn't hear of it. ( </sentence><sentence id="1950">Cough) And I know that I have no future, that I must go away; that if...if there is anything left for me in life, then it's not...not there anymore. </sentence><sentence id="1951">I must find my way. ( </sentence><sentence id="1952">Cough) And I went up to this group of people; and I told them very strongly that if they don't help me to Israel, then I don't want to live. </sentence><sentence id="1953">I just don't want to live. </sentence><sentence id="1954">And the young man who sat at the desk was very sweet and very smart. </sentence><sentence id="1955">He says, "Don't do anything drastic things here. </sentence><sentence id="1956">At least not here." </sentence><sentence id="1957">So he was smiling, and he says, "I will help you. </sentence><sentence id="1958">I will help you. </sentence><sentence id="1959">But it will be very difficult for you, because your father has to sign. </sentence><sentence id="1960">You are a minor yet, and he has to sign for you. </sentence><sentence id="1961">And we have to make you a false passport. </sentence><sentence id="1962">So you have to get all the papers." </sentence><sentence id="1963">So I have to...had to go to all the offices. </sentence><sentence id="1964">And one day two men came up and told my father to sign; and Father was still under the spell of the Germans, in fear. </sentence><sentence id="1965">He signed before he read what he's signing; and he was signing that I can go on "aliyah" illegally. </sentence><sentence id="1966">And, of course, when he realized he was very, very sad; and said, "Look, you can't leave me. </sentence><sentence id="1967">You are my only child." </sentence><sentence id="1968">And I told him that he had to start his life the way he started, and I must now chart my life    the way I have to. </sentence><sentence id="1969">And my future is in Israel. </sentence><sentence id="1970">And he must...he must let me go. </sentence><sentence id="1971">And so very tearfully we went in to the notary; and he was crying, and I was crying, and he signed it. </sentence><sentence id="1972">And I got a telegram in the middle of the night that eight o'clock in the morning I should be at the railroad station and just find so and so. </sentence><sentence id="1973">And I got on the train; and a mother was running after me and says, "Please take care of my child." </sentence><sentence id="1974">You know, I was always tall and always looked older than what I was. </sentence><sentence id="1975">And so I said, "Your child? </sentence><sentence id="1976">Where is your child?" </sentence><sentence id="1977">And here was a girl. " </sentence><sentence id="1978">My gosh, she's older than I am! </sentence><sentence id="1979">She's eighteen years old. </sentence><sentence id="1980">I'm not eighteen. </sentence><sentence id="1981">She should take care of me, maybe." </sentence><sentence id="1982">And the mother said, "No, no. </sentence><sentence id="1983">You just take care of her." </sentence><sentence id="1984">I said, "OK, I do." </sentence><sentence id="1985">And so we got up on that on the train, and was a lot of commotion. </sentence><sentence id="1986">You know, it was a lot of people who went with; they're supposed to be together, but they were not together. </sentence><sentence id="1987">And we got to Yugoslavia, where one of...a tiny baby died on the train. </sentence><sentence id="1988">So we had to bury the baby under the wheels of the train. </sentence><sentence id="1989">And her death already was such a tragic mood that all of us who were there...we just...we just couldn't talk. </sentence><sentence id="1990">In the middle of the night we boarded The Exodus; and we got on the the boat in Bakar [a small port five miles east of Rijeka]. </sentence><sentence id="1991">And it was terribly scary because it...several kilometers we had to walk "til the boat, in the dark of the night. </sentence><sentence id="1992">Just a lamp pointed the direction, a hand lamp, because we were illegal. </sentence><sentence id="1993">It was still under...Israel was not...Israel was still not Israel that time. </sentence><sentence id="1994">And we got on the boat, and we were right away selected out to...to...to guard the boat. </sentence><sentence id="1995">And, you know, selection was always scary; but this time I really wanted it...to guard the boat. </sentence><sentence id="1996">I had no idea what to do. </sentence><sentence id="1997">And they gave me a gun, and I said, "Did you ever had a gun before? </sentence><sentence id="1998">I don't even know what to do with this!" </sentence><sentence id="1999">I says, "Never before. </sentence><sentence id="2000">And we are guarding the boat, you and I?" </sentence><sentence id="2001">I couldn't believe. </sentence><sentence id="2002">But Exodus was a tiny little boat, and still in terrible danger of being attacked. </sentence><sentence id="2003">You know, The Exodus went several times back and forth to Yugoslavia. ( </sentence><sentence id="2004">Cough) And so the second day on the boat, somebody tells me, "There is a girl who went crazy on the boat, and cries that she will be thrown into the, the ocean." </sentence><sentence id="2005">So I went to see the girl; and this is the girl whose mother told me to take care of her. </sentence><sentence id="2006">So you can imagine what I felt. </sentence><sentence id="2007">So I said, "There must be a doctor on this boat." </sentence><sentence id="2008">I went up to the doctor; and again, in German, trying to explain to him that there's a girl whom I'm in charge of who has to be taken care because...because she's sick. </sentence><sentence id="2009">And um doctor said, "You don't understand. </sentence><sentence id="2010">This is a boat that will be attacked very soon on the open sea, and we have no room for anybody who is insane." </sentence><sentence id="2011">And shortly...the, the...the infirmary was a little cubicle, you know; maybe for four or five people. </sentence><sentence id="2012">Says, "There's no room here for anybody." </sentence><sentence id="2013">So I have to keep this...and I said, "No, I give the promise for this mother, and I will do.... I will not leave until you promise me to take care of this girl." </sentence><sentence id="2014">He says, "Well, if you bring her up...." After, you know, it was negotiating back and forth. </sentence><sentence id="2015">After a while, he said, "If you bring her up, I will take care of her. </sentence><sentence id="2016">Let's see what I can do." </sentence><sentence id="2017">And I pulled that poor girl screaming, screaming and hollering--she was sure I will throw her into the ocean, you know--she didn't wanted to go. </sentence><sentence id="2018">And we went up; and I told the doctor that I'd stay with her until until we arrived to Haifa. " </sentence><sentence id="2019">I will be her private nurse. </sentence><sentence id="2020">You don't have to go worry. </sentence><sentence id="2021">Give me the medicine, and I will stay." </sentence><sentence id="2022">And that's what I did. </sentence><sentence id="2023">And then after a while, the captain of The Exodus came; and he looked at me. </sentence><sentence id="2024">He says, "I hear that you are giving orders on my boat." </sentence><sentence id="2025">I said, "No, I'm not giving orders. </sentence><sentence id="2026">But this was a mother...I, I made a vow to this mother that I would take care of her child. </sentence><sentence id="2027">And here it is, and I'm staying with her until we arrive. </sentence><sentence id="2028">So nobody has to worry. </sentence><sentence id="2029">I'm taking care of her. </sentence><sentence id="2030">I'm here from morning to evening. </sentence><sentence id="2031">I just go down to sleep. </sentence><sentence id="2032">I'm with her all the time, so you don't worry." </sentence><sentence id="2033">So the captain went away, and he was very nice. </sentence><sentence id="2034">Every day he came back, and every day he told me a little story about The Exodus. </sentence><sentence id="2035">So I found out that this was the youngest captain ever. </sentence><sentence id="2036">And that...that the...the run before us, the English came up to look for him, for the captain; and he was so young and he was so very good humored. </sentence><sentence id="2037">And he put on the captain's uh hat, and he said, "Do you think maybe I am the captain? </sentence><sentence id="2038">I don't know...we don't know where the captain is. </sentence><sentence id="2039">We didn't saw the captain. </sentence><sentence id="2040">Maybe I am the captain." </sentence><sentence id="2041">You know? </sentence><sentence id="2042">So the English kind of dismissed him, and never thought that he could be the captain of this boat. </sentence><sentence id="2043">And they never found him; and he told me this story. </sentence><sentence id="2044">And so.... </sentence></p></dialogue>
