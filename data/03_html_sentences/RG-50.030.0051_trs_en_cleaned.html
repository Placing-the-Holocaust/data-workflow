<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="77">A: Father was a very elegant, very kind, wonderful man. </sentence><sentence id="78">Mother had a great big responsibility to take care of the four children, because Father was travelling a lot to business. </sentence><sentence id="79">Actually every week, went up to Budapest. </sentence><sentence id="80">He had an office there. </sentence><sentence id="81">And so Mother had a hard responsibility to raising the children; and she was, | think, very stern, very demanding. </sentence><sentence id="82">We had to know always who we are, and there were a lot of restrictions. </sentence><sentence id="83">And, you know, when you're young and...and separate so tragically as we separated, you really don't have a good picture at all. </sentence><sentence id="84">You don't...you have a very distorted picture, of your mother particularly. </sentence><sentence id="85">Uh, you didn't came to terms about how you was accepted, or...or...so that it's very hard for me to give any kind of picture of Mother. </sentence><sentence id="86">I just remember one of my rebellious natures about her. </sentence><sentence id="87">On Mother's Day, the school was asked always to...children were in the school asked to perform; and I remember the last Mother's Day, I got a poem about a very soft, gentle, loving mother. </sentence><sentence id="88">And I felt, "It's a mockery. </sentence><sentence id="89">This is not my mother, and I will not read this poem!" </sentence><sentence id="90">And I chose a poem about the trees that are cut so suddenly down, and it's a very beautiful poem. </sentence><sentence id="91">Until today I remember, because I didn't told my teacher. </sentence><sentence id="92">I didn't told anybody that I This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="93">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="94"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection will change the script, and I will just say this poem about the trees that are cut down so terribly harshly, and what is their sin. </sentence><sentence id="95">Almost like I would speak about our community that was taken away so suddenly. </sentence><sentence id="96">So the trees almost replaced this community. </sentence><sentence id="97">But, of course, we did not know anything nearer to it before, what will happen to our community. </sentence><sentence id="98">But the poem was so interestingly prophetic about this forest that it will be erad...eradicated; and the trees will all gone and the...and the birds will not sing anymore, and what is the sin of this forest? </sentence><sentence id="99">So you can imagine the surprise of my mother, the surprise of my teacher, when I'm coming and talking about the forest. </sentence><sentence id="100">So you... you see, I wasn't clear, really, about the mother. </sentence><sentence id="101">If I could fashion her that time, probably I would made her extremely tender, extremely soft; but later I knew how important it was that she was firm and stern, because Auschwitz was so horrible. </sentence><sentence id="102">And it was almost her sternness, her demands were almost an education in survival, in a way. </sentence><sentence id="103">I don't know how to tell you that. </sentence><sentence id="104">But in very early stage of...of the tragic upheaval in Hungary, a drunk man came into our house and says, "You know, you will all be taken out, and you will be all...all be burning up, and so....". </sentence><sentence id="105">He said some horrible words. </sentence><sentence id="106">And I got so frightened, I pretended that I faint. </sentence><sentence id="107">I just was...it was...just fell down. </sentence><sentence id="108">And Mother--instead of taking care of this man, taking him out from household--she came over first and slapped my face, and said, "In our house, we don't faint." </sentence><sentence id="109">Well, that was good education in Auschwitz, because in Auschwitz we didn't fainted either. </sentence><sentence id="110">And so maybe in that respect, if I...[ should apologize to my wonderful mother who really gave me a little survival instincts. </sentence><sentence id="111">This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="112">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="113"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection </sentence></p></dialogue>
