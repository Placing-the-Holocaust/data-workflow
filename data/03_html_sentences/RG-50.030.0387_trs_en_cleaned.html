<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="722">A: My plans were just about broken. </sentence><sentence id="723">I knew that I probably wouldn't go to school any more. </sentence><sentence id="724">And I was very reluctant to stay and work on the farm. </sentence><sentence id="725">And when the war came and we -- when we lost the war to Germans and the Soviets, I knew I was going to be stuck and work on a farm with my father, which -- I was quite resigned to it. </sentence><sentence id="726">Said, "Well, hopefully the war will end and maybe I wi-- I can go back to school and perhaps live -- even live in a city. </sentence><sentence id="727">But for now, I'm stuck here, so I better make the best of it." </sentence></p></dialogue>
