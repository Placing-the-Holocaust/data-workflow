<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="709">A: My plans were just about broken. </sentence><sentence id="710">I knew that I probably wouldn't go to school any more. </sentence><sentence id="711">And I was very reluctant to stay and work on the farm. </sentence><sentence id="712">And when the war came and we -- when we lost the war to Germans and the Soviets, I knew I was going to be stuck and work on a farm with my father, which -- I was quite resigned to it. </sentence><sentence id="713">Said, "Well, hopefully the war will end and maybe I wi-- I can go back to school and perhaps live -- even live in a city. </sentence><sentence id="714">But for now, I'm stuck here, so I better make the best of it." </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="733">Q: I'm not sure I really understood what happened in that little town in Silesia? </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="749">Q: How did you hear about it and how did you know exactly what had happened? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="751">A: It was on a Polish radio, it was in -- was in Polish papers. </sentence><sentence id="752">Polish intelligence at that time apparently, was quite keen. </sentence><sentence id="753">And they knew all about it. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="757">Q: So where were you -- where were you when you first heard about that and what were your thoughts? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="759">A: I was in my village, listening to a crystal radio and I thought, "Well, it's inevitable, the war is co -- war is coming and we'll have to fight." </sentence><sentence id="760">I was too young to -- to be conscripted. </sentence><sentence id="761">My father was too old. </sentence><sentence id="762">He, of course, wanted to go and join. </sentence><sentence id="763">They said, "Go -- old man, go back home. </sentence><sentence id="764">You had yours." </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="771">Q: And when -- how quickly did you feel the presence of Germans in your town? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="773">A: Within about three weeks, they were, in our neighborhood, the -- kind of a pincer movement went around Warsaw. </sentence><sentence id="774">The -- Warsaw was still fighting, but they went around and approached our neighborhood. </sentence><sentence id="775">There was quite a sharp firefight in my village. </sentence><sentence id="776">Started early morning -- the Polish cavalry came in and some infantry came in. </sentence><sentence id="777">The cavalry dismounted and sent horses back and they dug in on the periphery of my village. </sentence><sentence id="778">They had a whole bunch of little, anti-tank artillery. </sentence><sentence id="779">Was two fat wheels, and a horse and they could pull it like the dickens. </sentence><sentence id="780">Two men could pull that little thing. </sentence><sentence id="781">It was very effective against German tanks. </sentence><sentence id="782">So they dug in and they were waiting, and of course, the Germans attacked. </sentence><sentence id="783">And it's kind of strange, my father said, "Well, why don't you take the cows to the pasture?" </sentence><sentence id="784">And my father dug a dugout for the family, in a garden in the orchard, so they were -- went all there and I took their horses and the cows to the pasture in the back -- way back, beyond the village -- it was a communal pasture. </sentence><sentence id="785">By the time I -- I did get there, I couldn't come back because there was a -- I mean, was honest to goodness firefight. </sentence><sentence id="786">It was long distance artillery German -- German artillery shooting. </sentence><sentence id="787">And a--a kind of bombarding the neighborhood, there was a -- more machine guns going all over, so I just stayed behind the village, there, for about two hours. </sentence><sentence id="788">In about two hours, the Poles retreated and went and then came two cavalry men, who said, "Hey, little boy, do you know that little wood across the hill, there?" " </sentence><sentence id="789">Of course I know it." " </sentence><sentence id="790">We have horses  5 there, about 15 horses, can you go and get the horses here?" " </sentence><sentence id="791">Oh, sure. </sentence><sentence id="792">Why not?" </sentence><sentence id="793">So I started running, kind of over the hill -- I run over the hill and there was lot of firing and going and then I see -- all of a sudden, I was kind of running on the border of a hi -- of a-- of a field. </sentence><sentence id="794">The border was kind of a strip of grass, it was higher than a field and I see right by my feet there, dust flying. </sentence><sentence id="795">And I didn't think -- think much of it, but it was somebody shooting machine gun from a way, way distance there -- German machine gun and hitting right where I was running, below my feet. </sentence><sentence id="796">It was several times, right below my feet. </sentence><sentence id="797">Apparently, whoever was shooting, was shooting little too low, thank goodness. </sentence><sentence id="798">When I ran to --[ ran over the hill, the horses were gone. </sentence><sentence id="799">So I laid down behind a bunch of trees, big Olszyna"" trees. </sentence><sentence id="800">There were such trees here. </sentence><sentence id="801">And artillery was shooting and hitting in -- in transit was hitting a top of a trees and branches were falling down. </sentence><sentence id="802">So I just laid there for about half an hour, then it slowed down, I went back to the village, village was on fire and about two-thirds of the village was burned. </sentence><sentence id="803">There were nobody -- no civilian casualties. </sentence><sentence id="804">There were about 35 Polish soldiers, who were killed. </sentence><sentence id="805">There were about 100 of Germans who were killed, back in approach the village. </sentence><sentence id="806">There were about 11 tanks that were mashed to smithereens by those little ca -- Polish cannons. </sentence><sentence id="807">And of course the Poles ran away and the Germans came in. </sentence><sentence id="808">We were taking -- getting water in pails, out of a -- out of a well and I was -- I climbed up on a top of a roof to prevent our house from being burned, because the neighbors house were burning, so I was handed the pails of water, I was pouring on the -- on the roof of the house to prevent it from burning on. </sentence><sentence id="809">And the refugees who are running around the Warsaw, the bunch -- were a group of people from Warsaw who were running around, "What will happen to us, what will happen to us? </sentence><sentence id="810">The Germans are going to kill us." </sentence><sentence id="811">Well, the German patrol came down the village and they just came, they didn't bother anybody, went across the village and went into the woods beyond the village, where the Polish army escaped. </sentence><sentence id="812">And more patrols came and more patrols came. </sentence><sentence id="813">But they were very correct, they did not bother anybody. </sentence><sentence id="814">They questioned a few men and they took document -- asked for documents and they did not bother anybody. </sentence><sentence id="815">In -- in other places, they would take young men and -- and kill them. </sentence><sentence id="816">In our village, they were quite correct. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="867">A: Well, kind of, but I was almost a bystander, but I was little foolhardy running over the top of a hill where the shooting is going on. </sentence><sentence id="868">Of course I can --I could run. </sentence><sentence id="869">I said, "I can run -- outrun anything. </sentence><sentence id="870">Nobody can hit me -- aim and hit." </sentence><sentence id="871">And they didn't. </sentence><sentence id="872"> 6 </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="879">Q: Did you tell your father this story? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="881">A: Well, yeah, sure, of course I told him, I bragged about it. </sentence><sentence id="882">And he said, "Good for you." </sentence><sentence id="883">Because my father went with horses to the forefront, where the Polish soldiers were dug in, he was doing some field work. </sentence><sentence id="884">And when there started shooting, he just stayed with them. </sentence><sentence id="885">And he went to talk to them in a -- in the -- in foxholes, said, "You better go there. </sentence><sentence id="886">Get on this side, get on this side." " </sentence><sentence id="887">What do you know, old man?"

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2345">A: We drop back to countryside, we took a week or two off, then we -- most of the time we found the places we wanted to take care of ourselves. </sentence><sentence id="2346">Sometime our commander would contact us and gave us -- gave us an order to do this or to do that. </sentence><sentence id="2347">And there was a -- one of the Eisengrupp -- Eisens -- Eis -- Einsatzgruppen in neighborhood where my -- not exactly my own family neighborhood, but close by. </sentence><sentence id="2348">It was in a town called Biala  4 Podlaska. </sentence><sentence id="2349">It was about 100 kilometers east of Warsaw. </sentence><sentence id="2350">There was the group that was large, it was very well entrenched. </sentence><sentence id="2351">Very, very foxy, we just couldn't do anything to them. </sentence><sentence id="2352">So he called me the carpet and he said, "You are supposed to take care of that group. </sentence><sentence id="2353">You don't sa-- you don't have to kill all of them, but really give them a good thrashing." </sentence><sentence id="2354">I said, "Commander, I tried -- we tried everything, I tried everything, nothing works." </sentence><sentence id="2355">Said, "You have to do something."

" </sentence><sentence id="2381">Ganz gut." </sentence><sentence id="2382">So I said, "I - Ich wiinschte mit ihre officer gesprochen.**" </sentence><sentence id="2383">I want to speak to your officer, your commander here. " </sentence><sentence id="2384">Weiter- weitermachen.*(r)" "Go right in." </sentence><sentence id="2385">So I went in, I went through the corridors, I went up the steps, I went to the back there and there was an outside window, I unlatched the window. </sentence><sentence id="2386">I went downstairs again, I went to the back and I notice there's a gate there with a bolt, so I pulled the bolt slowly out. </sentence><sentence id="2387">Then I went to the corr-- second floor again -- again had to go to second floor to go to the front, so I walked. </sentence><sentence id="2388">There was some secretaries running out and some officers running back and forth.
