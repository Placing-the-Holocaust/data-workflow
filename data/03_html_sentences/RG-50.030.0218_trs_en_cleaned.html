<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="519">A: When we came out we went back to the house, to the Farber's house, and nobody talked. </sentence><sentence id="520">Everybody kept to himself. </sentence><sentence id="521">It was like someone died in the family. </sentence><sentence id="522">Actually they did. </sentence><sentence id="523">But nobody talked about it and each one of us went back to their own chores. </sentence><sentence id="524">After each deportation the Germans, they (re)organized the factories, re-registered the people. </sentence><sentence id="525">The factory that I worked with my mother was called Madritsch (ph). </sentence><sentence id="526">This was a German firm, actually Austrian, an Austrian firm that used to make military coats. </sentence><sentence id="527">and I used to work in  0 the pressers room where I used to wring out the rags for the pressers. </sentence><sentence id="528">I used to come home with blisters on my hands. </sentence><sentence id="529">I couldn't move them. </sentence><sentence id="530">All day, you know, have my hands in water and and wringing out rags and then after the pressers got through with pressing the coats, they loaded coats on my shoulder and I used to carry the coats to the to the other side of the building where they were sewing on the buttons on the coats. </sentence><sentence id="531">That's where my mother worked, and as I said, after each deportation they re-registered and the ghetto was getting smaller. </sentence><sentence id="532">Each time they were making the ghetto smaller. </sentence><sentence id="533">The ghetto after the second deportation, they split the ghetto in two. </sentence><sentence id="534">There was Ghetto A and Ghetto B. Ghetto A was for the slaveworkers and Ghetto B was for people who didn't work - for the old people and for children. </sentence><sentence id="535">And then after the deportation when they were re-registering - let me, let me go back a little bit - | want to make a point of something. </sentence><sentence id="536">When I was carrying the coats there was a group of women, the wives of the managers, German managers and the owners of the firm came for an inspection of the factory, to Tarnow. </sentence><sentence id="537">And when one woman saw me carrying the coats, she says, oh what a pity - that little boy with a load like this on his shoulders. </sentence><sentence id="538">Soon after I was called to the office. </sentence><sentence id="539">I said to myself, oh, this is the end. </sentence><sentence id="540">So when I came to the office, there was the owner of the factory, the Austrian, standing there with a smile, and he says to me, how do you like to work over here? </sentence><sentence id="541">I said, it's alright. </sentence><sentence id="542">He says, how is your health? </sentence><sentence id="543">I said fine. </sentence><sentence id="544">It seems like his wife said something about me. </sentence><sentence id="545">He says, then he says to me, if you need anything, come to me and tell me. </sentence><sentence id="546">And this manager, the Jewish manager Mr. Weinstock, who managed the factory, was getting fidgety and he excused me by saying that I have to back to work and shoved me out of the door. </sentence><sentence id="547">This Mr. Madritsch I'll never forget because this Mr. Madritsch after the war, wrote a book, how he saved 500 Jews in Tarnow by creating a factory. </sentence><sentence id="548">He did it with a purpose, and he wrote a book and they put up a tree in his name in Yad vaShem. ( </sentence><sentence id="549">Very interesting.) </sentence><sentence id="550">He had a partner, Mr. Titsch (ph), who also was honored by Yad vaShem, and I want to make a point that after the deportation when they were re-registering the Jewish people, I went over to the table, to the Gestapo table that was standing in the middle of the market place, and you know, there was a line of people. </sentence><sentence id="551">I came to the table and they put my name down. </sentence><sentence id="552">And then Mr. Weinstock was standing over there and he didn't want to register my mother. </sentence><sentence id="553">I was very desperate. </sentence><sentence id="554">I looked around and I said, why not. </sentence><sentence id="555">He said we don't need so many people. </sentence><sentence id="556">I looked around and I saw Mr. Titsch standing talking to an SS officer. </sentence><sentence id="557">I went over. </sentence><sentence id="558">I was a little kid. </sentence><sentence id="559">I had no fear because I knew that they liked me, you know, this Mr. Madritsch liked me and he was there with the with a group inspecting the factory at that time. </sentence><sentence id="560">I went over and I said, they registered me, but they don't want to register my mother, in my in my broken German. </sentence><sentence id="561">He looked at me with a smile. </sentence><sentence id="562">He took me by the shoulder and led me to the table and he said to the SS man, he said put his mother's name down. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="617">A: One morning I got up early before all the others. </sentence><sentence id="618">I looked around the room. </sentence><sentence id="619">There were ten people on the floor sleeping and as I was dressing I looked out of the window that was leading outside the ghetto and I see trucks, German trucks with soldiers, a whole column going towards the ghetto gate and as they were riding down towards the gate they were dropping off Polish policemen across the street to stand guard watching the ghetto. </sentence><sentence id="620">I knew right away what's going to happen. </sentence><sentence id="621">This was the third deportation taking place and right away I screamed out an alarm - the Germans are coming. </sentence><sentence id="622">And everybody got up and they started running in every direction. </sentence><sentence id="623">People didn't know what what to do. </sentence><sentence id="624">They were not prepared for it. </sentence><sentence id="625">And my parents and my sister started running towards that hiding place again in the lumber yard. </sentence><sentence id="626">We couldn't get there because the we realized when we were in the street already that the gate that the German trucks were coming in to where it was in our way, between the hiding place, the lumber yard and us. </sentence><sentence id="627">And we couldn't get through. </sentence><sentence id="628">So we turned around and my father told us to get in to the first building that was on our way, as we were retreating, and it was a big courtyard, an old house where you come into the house and there is a big door, a wooden door and then a big courtyard and there was a complete chaos in that courtyard. </sentence><sentence id="629">People were running, screaming names Chaim, Moishe. </sentence><sentence id="630">And they had a big ladder against a wall of a building and there was an opening in the wall, high up, and they were climbing the ladder to that hiding place. </sentence><sentence id="631">How many people can go into that - there were about a few dozen people running around like chickens. </sentence><sentence id="632">My sister, she was a little girl, turned around on her on her heel, comes back running into the street with her pigtails flying - she says, I am not going in there. </sentence><sentence id="633">And she started running towards our house. </sentence><sentence id="634">And without a word we followed her. </sentence><sentence id="635">As we were on our way back to our house, we heard the Germans marching in the streets behind us because they had those hobnails on the boots and we were running back as fast as possible and on the way my mother said, you know, I heard about a hiding place that a man was building in his apartment. </sentence><sentence id="636">Let's go over there. </sentence><sentence id="637">So it was on the first floor where we used to live in our in our house where the Farbers lived, and at the end of the balcony because the the courtyard had a balcony all around, a wooden balcony, so at the end of the balcony there was an apartment and we came over there and there was a padlock on the door. </sentence><sentence id="638">My father turns around to me. </sentence><sentence id="639">He says go back to the apartment and get the axe. </sentence><sentence id="640">I run first to the apartment and brought the axe and my father ripped off the padlock and we heard already Germans entering the building downstairs. </sentence><sentence id="641">We came to the apartment. </sentence><sentence id="642">Was quiet. </sentence><sentence id="643">Nobody was there. </sentence><sentence id="644">So my mother called out - we are Spetts. </sentence><sentence id="645">Please let us in. </sentence><sentence id="646">I know that there is a hiding place over here. </sentence><sentence id="647">And nobody answered. </sentence><sentence id="648">So my mother threatened. </sentence><sentence id="649">She said, if I don't hear from you we're going to move the furniture around. </sentence><sentence id="650">We're going to look for the hiding place. </sentence><sentence id="651">Finally from under the bed, a voice came from under the bed. </sentence><sentence id="652">They said bend down, crawl under the bed. </sentence><sentence id="653">There is an opening. </sentence><sentence id="654">And we all did. </sentence><sentence id="655">There was a a panel. </sentence><sentence id="656">The the door from another room - the frame was taken out and blocked off. </sentence><sentence id="657">You wouldn't even know that there was another room behind that wall. </sentence><sentence id="658">We crawled into another room where there were about eight people there. </sentence><sentence id="659">And the owner of the apartment  2 told us that his two daughters went to work early that morning and locked the apartment with a padlock and they didn't have any food. </sentence><sentence id="660">We stayed over there for almost a week. </sentence><sentence id="661">That's how long the deportation took. </sentence><sentence id="662">But they had a pail over there for doing the business and they shared food with us. </sentence><sentence id="663">Very nice people. </sentence><sentence id="664">The daughters never made it back. </sentence><sentence id="665">It seems later on that they were grabbed in the street and put on a train and while they jumped out through that cattle car opening -
