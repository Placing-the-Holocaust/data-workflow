Jewish boys" school and myself being very eager uh to join him but that shouldn't happen though until after 1945 when we returned from Sweden. </sentence><sentence id="4">Um, I don't remember much and I couldn't I imagine, of the actual German occupation but when it started rather. </sentence><sentence id="5">Uh the German occupation of Denmark started . . . </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="9">Q: Could we hold it? </sentence><sentence id="10">Let's ask a little more about your childhood only because people seeing this tape are not necessarily what traditional native Jewish family means. </sentence><sentence id="11">Uh, what for instance, uh, did you eat kosher at home? </sentence><sentence id="12">Did you light sabbath candles at home? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="17">A: Well, in uh in the early childhood, uh my parents didn't keep a kosher home. </sentence><sentence id="18">Uh they did do it however later on when I, just after I was bar mitzvahed, uh they started keeping a kosher home, and also my my mother would light the the sabbath candle. </sentence><sentence id="19">But we would go to the synagogue uh on the high holidays. </sentence><sentence id="20">Uh to please my grandparents I would once in a while go in on the sabbath also but that was really not the, uh something that happened too often. </sentence><sentence id="21">But my parents were very active in Jewish community life. </sentence><sentence id="22">In Denmark my dad belonged to a number of Jewish organizations. </sentence><sentence id="23">He headed one of them and uh now if if only I can translate it properly - it would really correspond to what you would call a brotherhood here. </sentence><sentence id="24">Uh, it was meant as support organization where small independent un entrepreneurs, uh business people, tailors, etc., </sentence><sentence id="25">what they, when in need they could loan money to get through a period of time. </sentence><sentence id="26">Then they would repay it. </sentence><sentence id="27">And it was often, it was all organized by this small organization which was quite powerful. </sentence><sentence id="28">And then at the same time the organization also got involved in the promotion of Yiddish culture. </sentence><sentence id="29">Uh they would stage uh performances when there were uh uh Yiddish actors visiting Denmark, etc. </sentence><sentence id="30">Um, now there were at that time and there still are quite a number of Jewish associations in Denmark, in spite of the fact of course that the community was and is rather small. </sentence><sentence id="31">Uh today the community is about the same size as it was before the Second World War. </sentence><sentence id="32">Uh just around 7,000 people. </sentence><sentence id="33">And uh at that time there was a Jewish boys school and there was a Jewish girls school. </sentence><sentence id="34">Now they've been, uh after the war they were combined into one. </sentence><sentence id="35">And it takes the kids up through uh secondary school, through junior high school, but then for further education, uh the kids have to attend the public schools or other private schools. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="55">Q: You were very young. </sentence><sentence id="56">Did you go to a nursery school of some kind? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="59">A: Yes, I did go to the new Jewish uh nursery school which was located the same place as the girls" school was at that time. </sentence><sentence id="60">Uh, I remember going to the uh nursery school, mostly because I hated it when I was forced to take an afternoon nap. </sentence><sentence id="61">But uh I do remember some of the things that happened at at the nursery school, where we were taught uh things that perhaps you wouldn't be teaching in Christian schools in the sense that uh - well the old Jewish tradition of putting such great emphasis on children's education. </sentence><sentence id="62">Uh now I can mention here  that the boys" school took in uh the boys already at the age of five and started teaching them proper Danish etc. </sentence><sentence id="63">etc. </sentence><sentence id="64">Uh where as public schools only took in uh students at the age of seven. </sentence><sentence id="65">So also in the kindergarten, at the age of four or uh, you would be, uh they would start teaching you uh proper subjects. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="73">Q: What did they teach you? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="75">A: Well, I don't know. </sentence><sentence id="76">It's it's difficult today to say what I learned at the age of three, four and five or, but uh, I don't know. </sentence><sentence id="77">Honestly I can't specify. </sentence><sentence id="78">I couldn't. . . </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="83">Q: You probably sang songs . . .? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="85">A: Exactly, exactly. </sentence><sentence id="86">We learned how to spell. </sentence><sentence id="87">We learned the letters and that kind of uh stuff. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="91">Q: What about outside of school? </sentence><sentence id="92">Uh, what, your playmates, were they all Jewish? </sentence><sentence id="93">Was it a mixed group? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="97">A: It was definitely a mixed group. </sentence><sentence id="98">Definitely. </sentence><sentence id="99">And this was very typical of a Jewish family at that time and even today in Denmark because Jews have lived in Denmark since the 17th century. </sentence><sentence id="100">Uh during the early part of the 17th century the then king who was King Christian IV, declared a city in Denmark, in the southern part of (ph), an open city, and that  5,000, 5,500. </sentence><sentence id="101">But then in the late "60's, as a result of the unrest and the difficulties in Poland, there was a new influx of Polish Jewish immigrants. </sentence><sentence id="102">Uh, a couple of thousand came in uh just around 1970. </sentence><sentence id="103">And now forms of course an integral part of the Jewish community. </sentence><sentence id="104">But again, uh you asked about Jews in Denmark - did I play with with uh non-Jews as well as Jews, etc. </sentence><sentence id="105">And and I said I certainly did. </sentence><sentence id="106">And this again has to do with the fact that although the Jewish population has received new waves of immigrants through the uh but not waves, but a few times this has happened, the Jewish population in Denmark has always been very much assimilated. </sentence><sentence id="107">Uh, when you speak about Jews in Denmark you you don't classify them as such, as Jews. </sentence><sentence id="108">You classify them as Danes of Jewish extraction or Jewish religion or Jewish family. </sentence><sentence id="109">You don't distinguish between groups whether a person is a Catholic or Jewish or he is uh Lutheran or he's an atheist. </sentence><sentence id="110">Uh, this could be due to the fact also that the church in Denmark has for centuries not really been powerful. </sentence><sentence id="111">You know, something like 90- odd percent of the Danish population belongs to the State church which is the Lutheran Church. </sentence><sentence id="112">But if you look at church attendance in Denmark, it's down to a few percent. </sentence><sentence id="113">So, this has to do with the fact that that you don't you don't feel that there is a difference between, when as a kid, playing with uh Jewish friends or non-Jewish friends. </sentence><sentence id="114">I I guess that to go on from there, there weren't anti-Semitists. </sentence><sentence id="115">There really hasn't, for a long, long time, has had no real meaning in Denmark. </sentence><sentence id="116">Uh, what perhaps could be percei... uh conceived as anti- Semitism, anti-Semitism, in the sense that there's a word - to steal, from old, old Danish or northern which is called "to Jew" something. </sentence><sentence id="117">The person using that word, the non-  German's, the German influence in Denmark, while Denmark was being occupied by them. </sentence><sentence id="118">And in in the beginning it seemed that it was possible. </sentence><sentence id="119">The Danish government stayed on as a government. </sentence><sentence id="120">The Danish police force was allowed to continue. </sentence><sentence id="121">Uh the Danish army as such was disbanded and so was the uh the navy, but the police force remained the controlling uh force in Denmark and of the many, no, let me put it another way - uh of course there was a lot of give and take between the Germans and the Danes at that time on on an official level. </sentence><sentence id="122">But one of the things that was made abundantly clear to the Germans was that the Danes would never accept the execution of the Jews. </sentence><sentence id="123">The Jewish issue was not an issue in Denmark, and would not be. </sentence><sentence id="124">The government could not tolerate that it be made an issue. </sentence><sentence id="125">And this was respected by the Germans. </sentence><sentence id="126">Uh, I don't remember much from the first few years of the war. </sentence><sentence id="127">Uh the clearest impact was from just a month before, when we speak about the war I mean, there were a lot of things from my childhood, but but this also actually goes to to to indicate that the changes in the daily life were not that many. </sentence><sentence id="128">But I remember clearly on August the 28th, 1943, uh we had our annual family tour of the Tivoli Gardens. </sentence><sentence id="129">The Tivoli Gardens are something completely unique for Denmark - it's an amusement park; it's a flower garden; it's got 23 restaurants; and it's right smack in the center of Copenhagen; and it, there is no entertainment or amusement park in the world like it. </sentence><sentence id="130">I'm Dane and I'm proud of it and I'll insist there's nothing like it. </sentence><sentence id="131">And for a kid being taken to the Tivoli Garden was usually the highlight of the summer season and we had been in, was normally once during the, early part of the season which starts in, around the first of May and then one the late uh part of the season. </sentence><sentence id="132">And I remember clearly that evening on the uh August the 29, I'm sorry - August 28, 1943, when leaving the Gardens there was a crowd in the street looking on as an enormous convoy of German tanks rode through the streets of Denmark, of Copenhagen. </sentence><sentence id="133">Of course, as a kid, I didn't know that the cause of it was that it had come to an impasse between the Danish government and the German occupation forces. </sentence><sentence id="134">And on the following day the pow... the Danish government stepped down, refused to cooperate with the Germans any longer. </sentence><sentence id="135">And the Police Corps, the Danish police force uh was disbanded at, rather they were sent to concentration camps, a large number of the Danish police. </sentence><sentence id="136">But this I guess is one of the early, of earliest clear memories I have from the war. </sentence><sentence id="137">But there's another, there's another memory which perhaps, I don't know - I think it's actually half a year or year earlier - uh being called out in the street by my elder brother in early evening to see a fantastic red hue over the evening sky and that turned out to be a sabotage, the effect of a sabotage of I think the Danish sugar factories. </sentence><sentence id="138">So that they shouldn't be supplying to the German troops. </sentence><sentence id="139">And you could see simply the fire lighting off the evening sky. </sentence><sentence id="140">It could have been half a year earlier but I'm not, I'm not completely sure of the of the date of that. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="185">Q: Did your brother later tell you what this was? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="187">A: No, I 1 remember, I I remember having heard, hearing these are the sugar factories going up. </sentence><sentence id="188">I remember that. </sentence><sentence id="189">Uh, then uh I remember after August 29, 1943, which was really the crucial day in the occupation history, the German occupation history of Denmark, because uh I think to a large extent the Danish population wanted to disassociate themselves completely from the Germans. </sentence><sentence id="190">Uh now one shouldn't forget that Germany for more than 100 years - that's not quite true - let's say from 1849 - has always been considered the big brother down  south. </sentence><sentence id="191">We had, Denmark had wars against Germany in 1849 - we were lucky at that time - there were some other nations that helped us beat the Germans, but in 1864 we were severely beaten and part of the Danish, southern Danish territory was taken away from them and and taken over by Germany. </sentence><sentence id="192">Part of that territory was was given back to Denmark after the 1st World War in 1919, but there's always been an an apprehension against these very very powerful Germans just south of the border. </sentence><sentence id="193">So to go back to to August 29, 1943, I think for a large part of the population, there was a bit of an urgency to disassociate themselves from the Germans and they, I think many of them heaved a sigh of relief that finally the Danish government refused to further cooperation. </sentence><sentence id="194">Uh everybody knew I guess, I'm speaking about the adults, everybody knew no doubt that it would mean uh hardships because now the Germans were in total power, total control. </sentence><sentence id="195">But uh on the other hand uh people couldn't accept uh how the Germans were behaving in Europe and such because although the press was completely censored and controlled by the Germans - one shouldn't forget that the BBC was broadcasting all the time and although of course it was under strict penalty to listen to BBC everybody did it. </sentence><sentence id="196">And information about concentration camps and what had happened to minority groups, what was happening to minority groups, as to all the Jews in Europe, had started to had started to come up to their Denmark. </sentence><sentence id="197">And... </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="209">Q: What was, excuse me. </sentence><sentence id="210">What was the atmosphere of your family at this time, after the 29th? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="213">A: After the 29th, very much an atmosphere of apprehension, that uh something bad could happen and that we should be prepared for it and that perhaps we would have to leave our home. </sentence><sentence id="214">This did happen, the talk about that, during the month of uh September. </sentence><sentence id="215">And now the whole atmosphere in Copenhagen changed very much uh because there was a curfew on after the 29th of August and you could feel that things were not going the right way. </sentence><sentence id="216">I think that even a kid at that time could feel it, and perhaps what the kid could feel most was the apprehension of his parents. </sentence><sentence id="217">And all the elders. </sentence><sentence id="218">Uh, but still I would say that when it happened, that day that my dad came home in the early afternoon, and he usually worked very very hard - uh leave very early in the morning and come home rather late - but when he came home and said, pack up your or rather don't pack up your things, because we're not going to take any luggage, but put on as many clothes as you could possibly have on you without being very conspicuous uh - it did come as a surprise that we had to leave the place. </sentence><sentence id="219">And that was on, let's see now, September 30th, 1943. </sentence><sentence id="220">That means that it was actually the day before the you you might perhaps have heard that there was a warning issued to the Jewish community on the eve of Rosh Hashanah, and that was on October Ist. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="229">Q: Were you in the synagogue and did you hear ...? </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="230">A: Yes. </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="231">Q: Your father came home and said you had to leave? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="233">A: That's right. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="235">Q: What did you do? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="237">A: Well, I said we we were told that uh uh that we couldn't bring any luggage whatsoever. </sentence><sentence id="238">That we should put on as many warm clothes as we possibly could, and we went over and stayed over night with uh some friends of my parents, some Christian friends of uh of my parents, and we were told that we would just be staying for one night, which also happened. </sentence><sentence id="239">And and the following morning, we went, the whole family, to the railroad station, and took a train down to the southern part of Denmark. </sentence><sentence id="240">Uh, I remember that, again this happened time and again during the escape to Sweden, that we were told try not to be conspicuous. </sentence><sentence id="241">That's very very important. </sentence><sentence id="242">And, well, I would say that I understood that this was serious, but I did also feel that to some extent this was an adventure. </sentence><sentence id="243">I don't think you can expect much else from from a six year old kid. </sentence><sentence id="244">Uh there was definitely an element of adventure involved. </sentence><sentence id="245">Uh there's one instant that, from that train ride which took about four to five hours, that I very very clearly remember ... </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="255">Q: Excuse me. </sentence><sentence id="256">Four to five, or forty-five? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="259">A: No, no. </sentence><sentence id="260">Four to five. </sentence><sentence id="261">Four or five hours. </sentence><sentence id="262">Uh if we had a map I could show you, but I've got it in the back. </sentence><sentence id="263">It doesn't matter. </sentence><sentence id="264">Uh I remember we were sitting in the train; and suddenly I saw the door open at the other end of the train. </sentence><sentence id="265">And my uh mother's younger sister with her husband came in. </sentence><sentence id="266">And I was about to say something to my mother about it, and my dad looked at me and said, "Don't talk. </sentence><sentence id="267">Don't say hello. </sentence><sentence id="268">Don't greet them." </sentence><sentence id="269">Again it was...and I found that very strange, of course. </sentence><sentence id="270">But afterwards, I was told that no it was just that people shouldn't notice that something unusual was going on. </sentence><sentence id="271">Now, we came down to this southern Danish city called Nykobing Falster, which is on an island south of Zealand [Dan: Sjaelland], which is the island where you got the Copenhagen . </sentence><sentence id="272">And we were put up </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="273">Q: Excuse me. </sentence><sentence id="274">Did you hear any details, any rumors of how those people got there? </sentence><sentence id="275">Any sense of organization behind this? </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="276">A: Only afterwards I heard it. </sentence><sentence id="277">I heard afterwards that this route that we followed was organized and financed to a large extent uh by a very very well-known uh Danish business man, uh Christian business man. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="280">Q: What was his name? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="282">A: His name was Buglon Jansen (ph). </sentence><sentence id="283">He owned and operated uh kind of small department store and household articles right in the center of Copenhagen on the City Hall Square. </sentence><sentence id="284">Was a very well-known personality. </sentence><sentence id="285">And - but we had this, this must have been, now we are speaking about the 30's, we left on the 30th, now we are speaking about the 2nd of October. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="290">Q: OK. </sentence><sentence id="291">You are still at this hotel? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="294">A: We're still at this hotel and we were given an early dinner and then we were told that as soon as it starts getting dark or just before dark, at dusk, we will leave and we were put in to a couple of cars - cars using the old wood-burners. </sentence><sentence id="295">There was no gasoline. </sentence><sentence id="296">Yes, basically. </sentence><sentence id="297">They drove on on the energy from from wood. </sentence><sentence id="298">Yes. </sentence><sentence id="299">Wood and coal they used. </sentence><sentence id="300">And it was not completely dark. </sentence><sentence id="301">It must have been, it was dusk, and dusk lasts in Denmark normally around an hour or so, and we were driven out of the city and then I remember that we came on a small country road and came to the start of a forest where there was uh - what do you call it - it was a private road, so uh there was a - what do you call it (a gate) - there was a gate. </sentence><sentence id="302">And we waited for a couple of minutes and then uh a man came out from a small house and opened the gate so that we could drive through this private forest and if I'm not mistaken, I seem to recall that there were about three or four cars. </sentence><sentence id="303">Now we stopped short of a beach, a very rocky beach, and now it was getting really dark. </sentence><sentence id="304">And we went down to the beach and there were a number of us - afterwards I found out there were seventeen people - and one could hear the sound of a diesel engine coming closer and closer. </sentence><sentence id="305">That was the only sound we could hear. </sentence><sentence id="306">And there something happened on the beach which my dad has - he always commented on it later on - and I don't know if he did it so many times and that's the reason why I remember it as if I remember it myself - but this really proved that I apparently I did understand the gravity of the situation. </sentence><sentence id="307">Because my dad was a chain smoker of cigars, and my dad was about to light a cigar ...  TAPE BREAK ..."Dad, don't do it. </sentence><sentence id="308">The airplanes can see you." </sentence><sentence id="309">So I'm, honestly, I believe I remember it but it could be because I've been told this so many times. </sentence><sentence id="310">But uh, there's little doubt that that I did, and so did my my sister and brother, appreciate the severity of the situation, the seriousness. </sentence><sentence id="311">Now, then we were taken on to the boat, which was an old, very very smelly fishing boat. </sentence><sentence id="312">And uh we were taken downstairs where we were told to lie down on some bunks and my sister complained when she uh lied down that uh there was something very hard underneath her. </sentence><sentence id="313">And when when uh the uh blanket was pulled away, it it was a gun. </sentence><sentence id="314">It was a rifle or something like that, which of course was exciting to the kids. </sentence><sentence id="315">Anyway uh we started, and that time this, now it was absolutely pitch black outside, and what I remember from the voyage, except for being sea sick a couple of times - I don't know really whether, how much of it [remember it myself or how much of it I remember because I've been told, but uh I remember wailing, uh in the sense that people uh people are crying. </sentence><sentence id="316">Uh, I remember the engines stopping and hearing shouts up on the deck, and uh this was as I said a very old boat, and uh the engines had since stopped. </sentence><sentence id="317">So they worked on them and got them going again. </sentence><sentence id="318">This happened twice. </sentence><sentence id="319">Then also uh we, and this I don't know whether I was told afterwards or I was told during the trip, but the uh heart of the of the of the screaming and crying was due to the fact that the German patrol boats caught uh sight of us. </sentence><sentence id="320">And they had two young skippers who had never tried to run a boat before. </sentence><sentence id="321">Uh they, this I must have been told afterwards, they took the boat right in to the mine fields hoping that the drop was so shallow that nothing would happen and knowing that at least the Germans wouldn't pursue us in there. </sentence><sentence id="322">And uh fortunately the boat was shallow. </sentence><sentence id="323">During the night uh I remember being, people being sea sick, all over. </sentence><sentence id="324">And then, when daylight broke, I heard new screaming and this, I've been told afterwards I know for sure, was because when people looked up from the deck, and looked for, we had reached land, or rather we had approached land, and we had approached a small harbor, a fishing harbor or harbor. </sentence><sentence id="325">People got scared when they saw uniformed uh soldiers or police on the piers because the Swedish military uniforms were very much like the Germans. </sentence><sentence id="326">They were this green color. </sentence><sentence id="327">But uh, we did get in to the port. </sentence><sentence id="328">And that voyage took eleven hours. </sentence><sentence id="329">Uh normally you can cross between Denmark and Sweden at the closest point in twenty minutes. </sentence><sentence id="330">But my dad had explored the possibilities for crossings uh up north of Copenhagen where there's very narrow, uh this sound as it's called between Denmark and Sweden. </sentence><sentence id="331">It's very narrow. </sentence><sentence id="332">But the risk was too big. </sentence><sentence id="333">And that, let me back track just a second. </sentence><sentence id="334">Afterwards I was told that the reason why we met uh our, my my uncle and my aunt on the train was that they went down south to to investigate possibilities of getting over on another route, and afterwards they realized that that was too risky. </sentence><sentence id="335">They had to go up north again. </sentence><sentence id="336">So they only came over to Sweden about four or five days later. </sentence><sentence id="337">Uh </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="383">Q: Back up one more minute. ( </sentence><sentence id="384">Yes, sure.) </sentence><sentence id="385">Before you go on, I would like to go back to this boat. </sentence><sentence id="386">You have said you had two young men who had never sailed a boat like that before. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="391">(Yes, yes. </sentence><sentence id="392">That's right. </sentence><sentence id="393">That's right.) </sentence><sentence id="394">How old were they and how did they do this? </sentence><sentence id="395">What kind of help did they have, if any? </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="396">A: Well, they were as as far as I recall just around the twenties uh the two of them. </sentence><sentence id="397">Nineteen, twenty, or twenty, twenty-one. </sentence><sentence id="398">Uh somehow or other they had been recruited to sail the boat and they had offered to sail the boat. </sentence><sentence id="399">And uh they had been given some maps but uh they really didn't know much about the route over. </sentence><sentence id="400">Uh afterwards I was told, when we learned it in Sweden, they went on to the UK to join the the free Danish forces in the UK. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="406">Q: Do you know their names? </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="416">Q: What happened to you ....? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="418">A: Well, we were greeted by Swedish police and taken very well care of. </sentence><sentence id="419">We were taken to a hotel where the whole family was given a room and there I remember we had a chance to to wash and to sleep, but being six years old one is of course one very adult so I said all the time I didn't feel like sleeping and there was a double bed in the room and my parents uh lay down on the bed and also my older sister and brother, and I didn't want to. </sentence><sentence id="420">I had no interest in in being cramped in that bed, plus of course I was very adult being six years and uh didn't matter that I hadn't slept that much that night, so I sat down at the chair at the end of the bed and of course it took ten minutes before I was asleep in that chair. </sentence><sentence id="421">But uh we stayed. </sentence><sentence id="422">This city we...this town we arrived at is called Trelleborg, and it's at the very southern tip of Sweden. </sentence><sentence id="423">And the next day, my dad uh phoned some friends, Jewish friends, in Geteborg [Eng: Gothenburg]. </sentence><sentence id="424">This friend was uh a well-known industrialist. </sentence><sentence id="425">He ran several uh uh garment factories in Sweden and he was a personal close friend of my maternal grandmother. </sentence><sentence id="426">So they arranged that we went up to Gothenburg and stayed there for a couple of days and then we went further up to a small city call Uddevalla uh where my dad worked at one of the factories owned by this friend of my my grandfather. </sentence><sentence id="427">And uh my mother had to work there because to to make a living. </sentence><sentence id="428">My dad didn't bring any money out of Denmark. </sentence><sentence id="429">Uh whatever he did, he used to pay for our voyage, although the the route as such was financed as I mentioned before by this Danish businessman, who ever could pay should pay and however much because then in turn some people who couldn't pay would also uh be carried over. </sentence><sentence id="430">And uh my dad had a small uh factory uh in Denmark - a small garment factory which was left behind. </sentence><sentence id="431">And uh so he had to start completely afresh in Sweden. </sentence><sentence id="432">And we lived in in Uddevalla where my dad and my mother both worked at this garment factory and uh the three of us, the three kids, were sent to a Swedish school, Swedish public school. </sentence><sentence id="433">And I think that we as kids, while we we didn't definitely we were not made to suffer uh my dad and mom combined could make a living although it was more of a subsistence living than it was a luxury living. </sentence><sentence id="434">But uh... </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="452">Q: What did your mother do while your father was at the factory? </sentence><sentence id="453"> 0 </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="456">A: She was also uh working in that factory. </sentence><sentence id="457">I don't remember exactly what her job was there. </sentence><sentence id="458">My my dad worked there as a cutter. </sentence><sentence id="459">I don't remember exactly what my mother did. </sentence><sentence id="460">But that - and we stayed in Uddevalla for about six months. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="466">Q: What was it like there? </sentence><sentence id="467">You were now how old? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="470">A: Well, the first few days of the, was a bit strange because uh we spent, I think we spent a couple or first actually a couple of weeks at a big summer house belonging to this Swedish Jewish industrialist, and this and in this summer house there were a number of other families also waiting to be channeled out into uh more normal life in Sweden. </sentence><sentence id="471">And uh there one lived together with other families in exactly the same situation. </sentence><sentence id="472">So uh it was not living in Sweden as much those couple of weeks as living in a Danish Jewish environment in a house in Sweden, and of course everybody was affected but uh by what had happened to them and whether all their family had managed to escape or there were some of their relatives who had been taken by the Germans. </sentence><sentence id="473">Uh I should mention here of course that out of the population of around 7,000 uh Danish Jews, uh more than ninety percent managed to escape to Sweden and uh uh only a very few were taken by the Germans and uh of the Danish Jews, the Danish Jews were all taken to a concentration camp in Czechoslovakia, the Theresienstadt, which although of course it it was, it was a Theresienstadt, and it was a sub-human way of of living, it was considered one of the milder uh concentration camps of all the German camps. </sentence><sentence id="474">Uh but of course, during those couple of weeks we stayed in that house in in north, outside of Uddevalla all talk, what ever was discussed concerned what had happened in Denmark and what had happened to relatives and uh people were delighted of course when they had phone calls from other relatives who had managed to to arrive in Sweden, to get to Sweden and and could tell that they were safe etc. </sentence><sentence id="475">Uh after about, I think we were there for two weeks in that house, we moved into the the the proper city of Uddevalla where we had a flat of our own and that's when we started attending Swedish uh public schools and uh there were a couple of other refuge families living in the same block but apart from that we had Swedish friends. </sentence><sentence id="476">I mean as kids we had Swedish playmates, went to their homes and they came to our homes. </sentence><sentence id="477">We we, I guess we, that hap... that was the case of for our kids, all during the time in Sweden that again my parents arranged for a secure family life. </sentence><sentence id="478">So that uh no doubt we were protected. </sentence><sentence id="479">Very much so. </sentence><sentence id="480">Uh we stayed in Uddevalla for six months, and then we moved down to Gothenburg uh where my dad uh got another job with within the same group and uh after about, and we started, let me mention that of course, that when we moved to Gothenburg, we were able to attend a Danish school that was established for refugees in Gothenburg. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="492">Q: Let's hold . . . </sentence><sentence id="493">go back. </sentence><sentence id="494">From the time you got on the boat, to the time you arrived in Goteborg, you as a child went through a whole lot of changes. </sentence><sentence id="495">How did you feel at the various stages? </sentence><sentence id="496">You were at first but what did you feel? </sentence><sentence id="497"> 1 that my parents were relieved. </sentence><sentence id="498">This would affect a child. </sentence><sentence id="499">Uh more apt to to make a joke. </sentence><sentence id="500">Uh not only the child but the parents and that affected their whole outlook on life. </sentence><sentence id="501">Uh going by by by train up through Sweden was exciting. </sentence><sentence id="502">And and one thing clearly stands to my mind and that was on the way up to Uddevalla, I think I mentioned that we stayed for a a couple of nights in the flat of this industrialist. </sentence><sentence id="503">And I'll never, I'll never forget at night looking out the window and seeing all the neon lights. </sentence><sentence id="504">Now Copenhagen had a blackout uh forced upon them by the Germans since 1940. </sentence><sentence id="505">You never saw neon lights. </sentence><sentence id="506">You never saw street lights because you you had to black out everything. </sentence><sentence id="507">That was impressive. </sentence><sentence id="508">Also that fact that you could buy chocolate which was a luxury - well it didn't exist in Denmark during the war. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="526">You could buy bananas. </sentence><sentence id="527">That was certainly something new. </sentence><sentence id="528">I was just used to eating artificial banana made made made from extras, some extract or something like that. </sentence><sentence id="529">Sugar etc. </sentence><sentence id="530">Uh this was a new life in many ways. </sentence><sentence id="531">But of course the the important part was really the the family nucleus. </sentence><sentence id="532">That it was safe being together with the parents and and the sister and the brother. </sentence><sentence id="533">Uh and also when we moved to to Geteborg, my maternal grandparents came to Goteborg. </sentence><sentence id="534">Uh so I guess as a as a kid although it was under strange foreign circumstances it was very much of a traditional life for for a kid. </sentence><sentence id="535">It was a very secure family life. </sentence><sentence id="536">Uh the the change not in the feeling of security but the change in the family life came in - it must have been mid or the fall perhaps of 1944 when my dad uh joined the uh Danish uh Brigade as it was called, the the uh the Danish military police force that was built up in Sweden towards the end of the 2nd World War. </sentence><sentence id="537">And uh, with the approval of the Swedish government. </sentence><sentence id="538">And uh in very close contact with the Danish underground movement and with the uh so-called free-Danish army in the UK. </sentence><sentence id="539">Uh my dad only came back to visit us perhaps once, twice a month. </sentence><sentence id="540">And uh again, perhaps it it wouldn't be different for a family life even without a war but but where the dad is away. </sentence><sentence id="541">But of course we felt that the dad was not there. ( ) </sentence><sentence id="542">Well, perhaps some more responsibility, a feeling of responsibility although I was a kid. </sentence><sentence id="543">Or or the baby rather. </sentence><sentence id="544">My brother uh was uh, he was bar mitzvahed in in March "45 and of course he was the one who really had to take the responsibility while the while our dad was away. </sentence><sentence id="545">But again, I was six, I was seven at that time. </sentence><sentence id="546">I was seven - I must have been at that time. </sentence><sentence id="547">I guess I wasn't much different from other kids. </sentence><sentence id="548">Uh except at certain moments when I felt that it wasn't completely like other families, like like the Swedish playmates were, like they had their family life uh because we're living in a foreign country, all the time speaking about going back to Denmark. </sentence><sentence id="549">There was little doubt about that. </sentence><sentence id="550">We were listing to the uh the Danish radio from uh the BBC to hear about the events and uh I guess what it did mean was that uh in some respects at least a mature... a maturity in some fields that uh you wouldn't normally see in in a seven year old kid which which would be a natural reaction I would think. </sentence><sentence id="551">Uh... </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="578">Q: Could we hold it for a minute? </sentence><sentence id="579">They have to change the tape and then we will go on. </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="580">Q: ... for a seven year old alone with brothers and sisters, father away . . .? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="582">A: Yeah, but you know, one thing is certain and that is we were, there was this very positive inference in knowing all the time we would be going back. </sentence><sentence id="583">There was never doubt that we would be going back. </sentence><sentence id="584">And this of course gives a sense of security. </sentence><sentence id="585"> 2 </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="586">Q: You knew that your people were . . .? </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="587">A: Oh yes, exactly, exactly, exactly. </sentence><sentence id="588">TECHNICAL CONVERSATION  3 TAPE #2 </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="591">Q: Now, we have a lot to talk about. </sentence><sentence id="592">Your father is away at the . . .? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="595">A: Yeah, that's right and uh the uh uh family living in Goteborg and he is quite a distance away and coming back perhaps once a month or so for for an extended weekend. </sentence><sentence id="596">Uh we were, my dad was paid the equivalent of a salary while in the army simply so that the family could be supported. </sentence><sentence id="597">Uh so life in many ways went went on as it had while he had been there but of course the dad wasn't there. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="601">Q: What did you pick up from your mother in terms of uh how she felt and how she was carrying on? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="603">A: My mother has always been a very very calm person. </sentence><sentence id="604">Always very much in control uh of herself and although my dad was a very very strong personality, the typical Jewish father, uh the patriarch of of the family, my mother certainly proved that she could run the family during his absence. </sentence><sentence id="605">Uh I think that you asked me before what it meant to to a six year old boy or seven year old boy to live under such conditions - I think it's true for all of us that we matured very much from the experience and we learned to cope with things. </sentence><sentence id="606">Well, you have to. </sentence><sentence id="607">So out of necessity we learned how to manage. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="613">Q: What did that mean? </sentence><sentence id="614">What did coping mean? </sentence><sentence id="615">What kinds of things . . . ? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="619">A: Well, I don't I don't think our world was much different from other kids but perhaps still there was a feeling that it was very important to behave so as not to create more problems because we were all aware as kids that it was a very difficult time for our parents. </sentence><sentence id="620">And it's not that we didn't misbehave. </sentence><sentence id="621">Of course we did. </sentence><sentence id="622">We were kids. </sentence><sentence id="623">But I think that we had, we we had a perception of try not to create more problems than necessary. </sentence><sentence id="624">Now whether my parents felt the same way I'm not sure, although I am because my parents have afterwards commented that we did behave uh extremely well as kids during these very trying years. </sentence><sentence id="625">But of course we we made the same kind of tricks as all other kids did but there was still this sense of there's a limit to what you can do, allow yourself to do because it is causing additional problems for the grown-ups. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="633">Q: Mischief, but not real mischief? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="635">A: No. </sentence><sentence id="636">Exactly, exactly, exactly. </sentence><sentence id="637">And of course there is little doubt either that that living through through such a period ties the family extremely strongly together. </sentence><sentence id="638">Very much so because you become dependent - you you realize how dependent you become on each other. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="643">Q: What was your relationship with your brother and your sister? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="645">A: The normal relationship between an older brother and a younger brother in getting annoyed if asked by the parents to take me along to something he wanted to do with his with his peers  4 and uh me crying if he if he wasn't too happy about taking me along and making me feel it, but uh normal kids. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="647">Q: What happened then? </sentence><sentence id="648">Uh... </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="651">A: Well, during the spring of "45, everybody knew what was going to happen but nobody knew when it would happen. </sentence><sentence id="652">Uh... </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="655">Q: Again, how did you know? </sentence><sentence id="656">You, at age eight? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="659">A: Well, from from hearing it, from my brother who was very mature of course under the circumstances at the age of thirteen and from hearing it from my mother, from hearing it in school, and and of course the sources were partly the Swedish news media. </sentence><sentence id="660">But uh again the most important source of information was the BBC's, the British Broadcasting Service's Danish service and there I can assure you I do remember as if it were yesterday, on the eve of May 4th, 1945, uh my mother was out at some function but the three kids, we were alone in the flat, and we had the radio on, and then we certainly heard, suddenly heard the message from London that the German forces in Denmark, Norway, Best...(ph), and Holland had capitulated with effect on the following morning. </sentence><sentence id="661">Uh, that made quite an impression, even on kids. </sentence><sentence id="662">But again, a sense of adventure. </sentence><sentence id="663">That was an element of it. </sentence><sentence id="664">But there was also this sense of feeling that now we knew for sure our parents would be happy and that we would be going home. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="671">Q: What did you do? </sentence><sentence id="672">Describe the scene? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="675">A: I remember we jumped on the beds. </sentence><sentence id="676">Uh, but strangely enough I, I remember clearly listening to the radio and hearing the news, and that we jumped on the beds, but I don't remember what happened when my mom came home. </sentence><sentence id="677">I don't. </sentence><sentence id="678">But uh I know that during the following days there was of course jubilation everywhere. </sentence><sentence id="679">And we were growing very impatient to because we wanted to know when could we get home. </sentence><sentence id="680">Uh the following day we uh heard, uh my mother had a phone call from my dad that he was going back to Denmark with the police force because they had been ready. </sentence><sentence id="681">That police force, the Danish police force in Sweden, if uh the war had dragged on, if the occupation had dragged on, the plan was that the police force should go in to Denmark as a military unit. </sentence><sentence id="682">Uh but fortunately that wasn't necessary so it went in in the morning of May Sth, which was the day of the, the official day of the liberation and took over the police functions in Denmark, and my dad was in on on the Sth of May. </sentence><sentence id="683">And then I remember during the the uh the following weeks very often my mother was called to the phone. </sentence><sentence id="684">My dad was calling, telling how things were going, and we were all waiting to know when will we be allowed to go back and uh, I remember when we went to the train station finally, on June Ist, and took the train back to Denmark. </sentence><sentence id="685">That was quite something. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="697">Q: What was it like, that train ride? </sentence><sentence id="698"> 5 </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="701">A: Everybody. </sentence><sentence id="702">This this was, well, this was just one victorious train ride. </sentence><sentence id="703">Uh people singing, people jubilating. </sentence><sentence id="704">Uh it was like you see a sports team coming home from a victory in in many ways, and of course lots of people crying of course. </sentence><sentence id="705">So uh that was on the Ist of June that we returned to Denmark. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="711">Q: Describe what it was like. </sentence><sentence id="712">Did you go back to your house? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="715">A: No. </sentence><sentence id="716">What had happened was that neighbors of ours had promised to look after our flat but they had taken over the flat when we came home, so there wasn't any flat. </sentence><sentence id="717">Uh and uh the same thing had happened to my dad's factory where uh a friend had promised to look after it but uh there was no factory to come home to. </sentence><sentence id="718">But but these are, these were minor things. </sentence><sentence id="719">They were considered minor things and I wouldn't say they were typical either but it it happened to my parents. </sentence><sentence id="720">Uh we were, the first few nights we were back we were staying with friends of my parents. </sentence><sentence id="721">He was the, he was as a non-Jewish head of the Jewish boys school. </sentence><sentence id="722">Oh yes, such a thing could happen in Denmark. </sentence><sentence id="723">Oh yes, easily can can happen. </sentence><sentence id="724">Uh he was a very very highly respected uh teacher. </sentence><sentence id="725">He was non-Jewish, but but he was head of the Jewish boys school, so we stayed with them for a couple of days and then my dad had found a summer cottage up in the country-side where we used to go for summer holidays, and we spent the summer there and then my dad found a a flat in Copenhagen where we uh where we moved back to when school started and then normal life began again. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="737">Q: Take it back. </sentence><sentence id="738">You had a lodge in Copenhagen? </sentence><sentence id="739">Describe for us what the city looked like to you? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="743">A: You know, I was, I remember, much to my surprise, I didn't recognize the city. </sentence><sentence id="744">I had been away for a year and a half. </sentence><sentence id="745">I had been so absorbed first in living the Swedish way with the Swedish schools, then living a normal life in Geteborg that the year and a half I didn't remember the road, I didn't recall the road really, or didn't remember the buildings on the road going from the from the railroad station to where we were staying but when we came to where we were staying I remembered it all. </sentence><sentence id="746">But this was like, to me Copenhagen was was really at that time was like visiting a new city for the first time until I got to the place where we were living, because that was just across from uh where we had, where we used to have our flat or our apartment. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="751">Q: Had the city been damaged? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="753">A: No. </sentence><sentence id="754">Not much. </sentence><sentence id="755">Not not compared to to other cities in Europe. </sentence><sentence id="756">Uh there was some damage but nothing compared uh to what you saw in other places, but what was remarkable was due to the shortages of all kinds during the war, you saw very very few cars. </sentence><sentence id="757">You saw horse-drawn carriages and carts but very very few cars. </sentence><sentence id="758">And that lasted for about four or five months, and then you saw the cars coming back. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="765">Q: What about your neighbors? </sentence><sentence id="766">Uh, or in this case not your neighbors, you were staying temporarily. </sentence><sentence id="767">Uh how did people, how did Christian Danes greet you when you back? </sentence><sentence id="768"> 6 </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="773">A: Very very warm. </sentence><sentence id="774">Extremely warm. </sentence><sentence id="775">Uh, I guess for them also there was little doubt that we would be returning. </sentence><sentence id="776">This was just an an episode. </sentence><sentence id="777">It was something temporary, that we had to leave. </sentence><sentence id="778">Uh, again, let me go back all the way to what I said before or in the beginning - Jews in Denmark was not an isolated ethnic minority group. </sentence><sentence id="779">They were Danish of Jewish extraction. </sentence><sentence id="780">So they, we were neighbors and nothing else. </sentence><sentence id="781">I guess this is a very important aspect when when we talk about what happened uh during the 2nd World War in Denmark. </sentence><sentence id="782">And then I know that, I've uh given a few speeches on the events of October "43 in Denmark and I know it's said well but look at other countries where people also assimilated and it didn't help them. </sentence><sentence id="783">But this is just one of the other ones because you must take it as a whole where the important part being the proximity to Sweden, the fact that the Germans were disorganized in October "43. </sentence><sentence id="784">Not disorganized but unorganized. </sentence><sentence id="785">They had not yet established their own civilian uh fleets, patrol fleets. </sentence><sentence id="786">Uh there were many Germans sympathetic to the Jewish population. </sentence><sentence id="787">Oh yes. </sentence><sentence id="788">Oh yes. </sentence><sentence id="789">The worst part, the the worst uh were really the the Danish Nazis. </sentence><sentence id="790">There were a few of them. </sentence><sentence id="791">But but no large number but there were they were there and they were uh they were rather influential. </sentence><sentence id="792">One shouldn't forget that the warning to the Danish Jews about the uh the impending persecution was given by uh a staff officer of the German Embassy. </sentence><sentence id="793">Uh.. . </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="815">Q: Contradictions abound. </sentence></p></dialogue>
