<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="24">A: I came from a small town. </sentence><sentence id="25">There were not many Jewish families in our town. </sentence><sentence id="26">We were maybe a handful. </sentence><sentence id="27">I was a child, and I don't -- I, I couldn't tell you how many. </sentence><sentence id="28">But it was a close-knit Jewish community. </sentence><sentence id="29">Prior to the war, I personally didn't -- I did not feel any antisemitism directed towards me or my family. </sentence><sentence id="30">As far as I remember, we lived in peace with our neighbors. </sentence><sentence id="31">My friends were not Jewish as well as Jewish. </sentence><sentence id="32">In fact, my very best friend was not Jewish. </sentence><sentence id="33">She was a young lady, a young girl my age, who used to sleep in our home. </sentence><sentence id="34">We would share a bed, many times, and -- as I would sleep in her home. </sentence><sentence id="35">And I, I personally never felt any antisemitism directly towards me, or directly towards my family. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="48">Q: What kind of work did your father do? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="50">A: My dad came to this country just before the war broke out. </sentence><sentence id="51">Our families were farmers mostly. </sentence><sentence id="52">And I don't really recall. </sentence><sentence id="53">I think he was, he was an owner of a store -- clothing store, prior to coming to -- his coming to this country. </sentence><sentence id="54">I don't really remember him. </sentence><sentence id="55">To tell you the truth, when I came to this country, I came to my -- I had very few memories of my father. </sentence><sentence id="56">He was like -- it was like coming to a stranger. </sentence><sentence id="57">You know? </sentence><sentence id="58">So I really don't know. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="68">Q: And when your mother was looking after you, when you were growing up as a small child, could you tell us whether she looked after you alone? </sentence><sentence id="69">Or were there others in the  family? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="72">A: Well, we had -- my grandmother lived in town. </sentence><sentence id="73">And, of course, I had uncles and my aunt. </sentence><sentence id="74">And we did have family. </sentence><sentence id="75">There were some cousins. </sentence><sentence id="76">We were very fond of our grandmother, and I spent a lot of time there; and my mother also had her parents, who lived in another town. </sentence><sentence id="77">And so she had support from both families, both on her husband's side and on her, her own parents" side. </sentence><sentence id="78">But after my dad came to this country, he used to help us. </sentence><sentence id="79">When my dad came to this country, it was right after, I believe, the Depression. </sentence><sentence id="80">And he came to Chicago, and earned three dollars a week working for Vienna Sausage Company in Chicago. </sentence><sentence id="81">And the story went that my dad would send us a dollar and a half to live on in Europe -- which was a lot of money at that time in Europe. </sentence><sentence id="82">And, of course, he lived on a dollar and a half here. </sentence><sentence id="83">And when my dad came here, immigration was very strict. </sentence><sentence id="84">In those days, a man had to show that he could support a family before he was allowed to bring a family to this country. </sentence><sentence id="85">And I believe there's a long story behind this, but by the time my dad was able to send us papers to immigrate to this country, the war had broken out. </sentence><sentence id="86">And my mother was afraid to take her family. </sentence><sentence id="87">I had two younger brothers; and my mother was afraid to take three children on a ship that might have been bombed on the waters, that were beginning to be bombed already because the war had broken out. </sentence><sentence id="88">I, I believe this is the joke of, of the century: her being afraid to take us on a boat that might be bombed, and then getting caught in the war in Europe and concentration camps. </sentence><sentence id="89">You know? </sentence><sentence id="90">So.... </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="110">Q: As you speak of the war beginning, could you tell us what your first impressions were of the beginning of the war? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="112">A: The first -- okay. </sentence><sentence id="113">The first that I really knew that Jews were being persecuted in Europe was as a child. </sentence><sentence id="114">I recall my mother taking us -- meaning my brothers, my two brothers and herself -- going to my grandfather's town where my grandparents lived, where my mother was born and came from. </sentence><sentence id="115">And she took us there, often times, for visits. </sentence><sentence id="116">And, I believe, in 1939 when the Germans took away citizenship from the Polish Jews that emigrated to Germany, became German citizens, established businesses in Germany and fought for the German government. </sentence><sentence id="117">These Jews were asked to leave Germany when Hitler came into power. </sentence><sentence id="118">He took away their businesses, as you well know; and he took -- confiscated everything they had, and sent them back over the border to Poland. </sentence><sentence id="119">When these Jews came to Poland, they had no place to go. </sentence><sentence id="120">They had no homes; and of course the Polish community did not want these Jews back. </sentence><sentence id="121">So a lot of the Jews were being persecuted, and a lot of them went into the mountain areas. </sentence><sentence id="122">My grandparents lived close to the Polish border in Czechoslovakia; and, of course, in -- near the mountains. </sentence><sentence id="123"> I recall, as a child, these Jews coming down from the mountains looking for Jewish homes; and begging for food, begging for warm clothing and so forth, to take back to their families in hiding. </sentence><sentence id="124">I recall, as a child, helping my grandfather; taking buckets, pretending we were going to feed the animals, and going into the barns for whatever reason. </sentence><sentence id="125">And carrying food and warm clothing in these buckets to take back to these people, so that they could take it back to their families. </sentence><sentence id="126">I recall hearing horror stories of Jews being persecuted in Poland and in Germany. </sentence><sentence id="127">Of course, we didn't know about concentration camps at that time. </sentence><sentence id="128">But we knew -- I knew, as a child, that Jews were being persecuted. </sentence><sentence id="129">And I recall hiding many of these young Jewish people that would come; and putting them into wagons and covering them with straw and whatever, and taking them into different parts of Czechoslovakia, to different towns. </sentence><sentence id="130">So that we could help these young Jews escape. </sentence><sentence id="131">We still had freedom at that time, and little did we know that we were going to be next. </sentence><sentence id="132">That we were going to be persecuted. </sentence><sentence id="133">So I did know at that time that Jews were being persecuted. </sentence><sentence id="134">But we still lived in peace with our neighbors. </sentence><sentence id="135">We, as I said, were not being persecuted at that time. </sentence><sentence id="136">Our life was peaceful. </sentence><sentence id="137">The businessmen did or went about their business as they pleased. </sentence><sentence id="138">And that was my first recollection. </sentence><sentence id="139">Then I recall going back home to our hometown in Czecho- in Klyucharki. </sentence><sentence id="140">And I had a young uncle that must have been 17, 18 years old at the time; and as Czechoslovakia was being occupied, this uncle pretended he was going to take eggs and things off of the farm to go into the big city of Munkacs. </sentence><sentence id="141">He would take these things and put them in a basket on his bicycle and pedal to the city; strictly to find out about what was happening in the city, what was happening around the world, so to speak. </sentence><sentence id="142">Because that was the only news we could really get. </sentence><sentence id="143">We didn't have television and we didn't have radio, as they do today. </sentence><sentence id="144">And my uncle used to come back and bring us bits and pieces of news. </sentence><sentence id="145">We were not allowed to listen to this news, we as children. </sentence><sentence id="146">We were being protected. </sentence><sentence id="147">And we were just -- we were getting bits and pieces of this. </sentence><sentence id="148">So I did know that in certain areas Jews, because they were Jews, they were being persecuted. </sentence><sentence id="149">But we ourselves were not touched by it at that point. </sentence><sentence id="150">Actually, I personally was not affected by this until Hitler marched into Czechoslovakia and took over the country. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="190">Q: Do you remember that? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="192">A: My first recollection was when I went to school. </sentence><sentence id="193">The night before going to school, my friend who was not Jewish -- she and I slept in our home. </sentence><sentence id="194">Slept in the same bed, played as children do. </sentence><sentence id="195">I remember my mother opening the door and telling us to go to sleep, because we were being noisy and the next day was school. </sentence><sentence id="196">She and I got up in the morning to go to school, one morning. </sentence><sentence id="197">When we came to school, she was allowed to walk in and the door was closed to me. </sentence><sentence id="198">I was told I was not allowed to walk into class anymore. </sentence><sentence id="199">I needed to go home, because I was Jewish. </sentence><sentence id="200">A teacher who was my teacher, who took out a white handkerchief from his pocket the week before to wipe a smudge off of my face, turned to me one day and told  me I must not come to school anymore. </sentence><sentence id="201">All of a sudden, for whatever reason, I needed to go back home and not come back to school. </sentence><sentence id="202">I remember going home and crying, and not understanding why I was not allowed to go to school anymore. </sentence><sentence id="203">A few minutes later, my two brothers came home crying. </sentence><sentence id="204">They too were sent back home, and were told not to go to school anymore. </sentence><sentence id="205">Because we became quote "Jewish" overnight. </sentence><sentence id="206">My mother had to sit down with us and tell us the facts of life. </sentence><sentence id="207">Tell us why we were not allowed to go to school anymore; tell us that the country was invaded by a man called Hitler who was a bad man. </sentence><sentence id="208">We did not know about the killings at that time -- at least, I didn't. </sentence><sentence id="209">But we were told that there were certain rules we needed to follow from now on, and one was not to go to public school. </sentence><sentence id="210">I recall the laws being set down one by one. </sentence><sentence id="211">Not being able to go to a grocery store, except during certain hours. </sentence><sentence id="212">Not being able to work our farms anymore. </sentence><sentence id="213">Not being able to walk into a bakery anymore, except during certain hours. </sentence><sentence id="214">Not to go into a park and sit on a bench, unless it said, "For Jews Only." </sentence><sentence id="215">The wearing of the yellow star. </sentence><sentence id="216">And the hours we were allowed to be out, and the hours we were -- has to be back in the house. </sentence><sentence id="217">And those were the first that I personally felt. </sentence><sentence id="218">And then, of course, the laws that came down one by one. </sentence><sentence id="219">Everyday there was a new law, and everyday we had to obey the new law. </sentence><sentence id="220">And we were not allowed to walk down the street anymore. </sentence><sentence id="221">If someone came towards us that was not a Jew, the Jew needed to step off the sidewalk to allow the next person -- who of course was not Jewish -- to walk by. </sentence><sentence id="222">I recall our neighbors turning their backs on us. </sentence><sentence id="223">Spitting on us. </sentence><sentence id="224">Neighbors who lived in peace with us, who were our friends the week before. </sentence><sentence id="225">And then, of course, we were lucky we were farmers; because we would have starved to death. </sentence><sentence id="226">You know, it's interesting. </sentence><sentence id="227">You, you sit and, and you talk, and as you sat and memories came back. </sentence><sentence id="228">It took me many, many years to find out why my mother would put food on the table for her three children at night, give us our dinner, and after she served us, she would walk out of the room. </sentence><sentence id="229">She never stayed in the room where we ate. </sentence><sentence id="230">I could never understand this. </sentence><sentence id="231">Just recently -- shows you how smart I am -- I've just recently figured this out. </sentence><sentence id="232">I probably had forgotten all of this. </sentence><sentence id="233">The reason she didn't stay with us was because there wasn't enough food to go around. </sentence><sentence id="234">So those are my early memories of Hitler walking into Czechoslovakia. </sentence><sentence id="235">And, of course, then there was the knock on the door in the middle of the night. </sentence><sentence id="236">We were told to gather our belongings, take warm clothes, take our valuables, and to take our pots and pans. </sentence><sentence id="237">We were told we were going to be relocated. </sentence><sentence id="238">And as we know today, they lied. </sentence><sentence id="239">And we believed. </sentence><sentence id="240">I'm not sure if our parents knew what was going to happen or not. </sentence><sentence id="241">But we believed. </sentence><sentence id="242">I think we needed to believe. </sentence><sentence id="243">And, of course, as we know how brave Hitler was -- the knock came in the middle of the night. </sentence><sentence id="244">It was the last days of Passover when they came to get us, and they told us to take whatever food we could. </sentence><sentence id="245">We didn't have bread in the house yet. </sentence><sentence id="246">We still had matzo. </sentence><sentence id="247">I remember my mother packing matzo to take with us to the ghetto. </sentence><sentence id="248">It seems like yesterday. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="306">Q: You mentioned to the ghetto. </sentence><sentence id="307">Was the ghetto in the town or did they transport you? </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="308">A: In our case a ghetto was in a small -- in our small town. </sentence><sentence id="309">The Germans took over the grammar school, a small school. </sentence><sentence id="310">They emptied the school. </sentence><sentence id="311">They put a fence around the school. </sentence><sentence id="312">They brought soldiers. </sentence><sentence id="313">They brought dogs. </sentence><sentence id="314">For some reason, always dogs. </sentence><sentence id="315">And the guards, of course. </sentence><sentence id="316">And they put us into this school -- which became our ghetto. </sentence><sentence id="317">All the Jewish family from the -- families from this community were put into this school. </sentence><sentence id="318">We slept on the floor. </sentence><sentence id="319">We had our bedding, because we brought it with us. </sentence><sentence id="320">We were not abused while we were in this so-called ghetto. </sentence><sentence id="321">Food was brought to us every day. </sentence><sentence id="322">We didn't have an over-abundance of food, but we were not starving. </sentence><sentence id="323">Of course, our neighbors did not come to see us, nor did they come to ask if we needed any food or any help. </sentence><sentence id="324">I will never understand that part. </sentence><sentence id="325">I will never understand how one human being -- a neighbor, a friend -- can turn against you. </sentence><sentence id="326">A person that has lived with you in peace, that has watched you born, that has gone to school with you, knows your family and knows your life history, can turn against you as a human being. </sentence><sentence id="327">But nevertheless, that's what they did. </sentence><sentence id="328">The Germans would come -- the soldiers would come every day to the ghetto. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="350">They would take our young people on a work crew -- I was too young, but they would take most of the young people -- and they would take them to do forced labor. </sentence><sentence id="351">Whatever they did, I don't know. </sentence><sentence id="352">There were different jobs for all the young men, as well as women. </sentence><sentence id="353">They would tell us that they would bring them back at night; and in most cases, most of them did come back at night. </sentence><sentence id="354">The ones that didn't, we were told that they were sent to a different area but we would see them in some future time. </sentence><sentence id="355">Of course, we never did. </sentence><sentence id="356">And this is how we lived for several weeks. </sentence><sentence id="357">We -- the families stayed together; and we could have lived that way, very well. </sentence><sentence id="358">We would not have had all of the comforts of home. </sentence><sentence id="359">But if they would have let us, we could have survived in that type of an atmosphere. </sentence><sentence id="360">Until the trucks came to empty out the ghetto; and, of course, to take us to the famous trains. </sentence><sentence id="361">When they came to empty the ghettos, again they told us we were going to be relocated. </sentence><sentence id="362">I had two younger brothers, of which one was nine and one was seven. </sentence><sentence id="363">When they came to take us on to the trucks, as we were walking on to towards the trucks, my youngest brother turned back and ran back into the school. </sentence><sentence id="364">He would not come out. </sentence><sentence id="365">He hid underneath a table. </sentence><sentence id="366">They carried him out, bodily, and threw him on to this truck as he was kicking and crying, as if he knew where he was going to go. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="384">Q: Your mother, you, your brothers... </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="386">A: ..My grandparents, my aunt, my relatives, and all the other Jews in the community -- we were all loaded onto this train, going to Auschwitz. </sentence><sentence id="387">When we were put onto this train, which, of course, I don't need to describe to you. </sentence><sentence id="388">It was a cattle car, as you know. </sentence><sentence id="389">No windows and no seats. </sentence><sentence id="390">No toilet. </sentence><sentence id="391">When we got onto the trains, none of us knew we were being taken to a concentration camp. </sentence><sentence id="392">None of us knew anything about Auschwitz. </sentence><sentence id="393">At least, I don't think we knew. </sentence><sentence id="394">We honestly thought we were going to be relocated. </sentence><sentence id="395">Until the door closed, and we heard the lock go on from the outside. </sentence><sentence id="396">I believe, that was the first  we knew wherever we were going to be taken to, it was not going to be freedom, and it was not going to be a great relocation. </sentence><sentence id="397">We were not told where we were being taken to, nor did we know what direction we were going in. </sentence><sentence id="398">I recall there was a small window on top of this compartment, the train we were on. </sentence><sentence id="399">They would lift a child up that could read. </sentence><sentence id="400">A man would lift the child up as the train would pass a station, so that the child could read what direction the train was going in, what stations we passed. </sentence><sentence id="401">And that would give us a clue where we were going to. </sentence><sentence id="402">This is how we knew where -- towards what destination we were being taken to. </sentence><sentence id="403">The train would stop once, sometimes twice, a day and wait for other Jews to be brought to be put back -- to be put on to this train. </sentence><sentence id="404">Until the compartment was so full that there was standing room only. </sentence><sentence id="405">It got to the point where if one needed to sit down, someone else needed to stand up; because there truly was absolutely -- it was a packed train. </sentence><sentence id="406">When the train would stop sometimes once a day, they would push in a bucket for our personal use, for toilet. </sentence><sentence id="407">They would push in a bucket of water; and they would take one of the men off the train to go and get water. </sentence><sentence id="408">And usually it was a matter of choosing who would go to get this bucket of water, because we weren't sure if the person would come back or not. </sentence><sentence id="409">And usually it was a young man that would volunteer. </sentence><sentence id="410">And that bucket of water needed to go around for every single person. </sentence><sentence id="411">And often times it didn't make to the very end. </sentence><sentence id="412">Many people would not get any water on that given day. </sentence><sentence id="413">How do I tell you about a train ride like that? </sentence><sentence id="414">About the dignity that is taken away from you when you need to use a bucket as toilet in the middle of a compartment on a train, in front of everyone? </sentence><sentence id="415">About sharing water with every single person? </sentence><sentence id="416">About the mothers holding on to hungry children. </sentence><sentence id="417">The crying. </sentence><sentence id="418">The stink. </sentence><sentence id="419">The fear. </sentence><sentence id="420">It's strange, fear gives out a certain smell and that mixed with open bucket -- it's a smell I don't believe one can ever forget. </sentence><sentence id="421">It's, it's not to be described. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="458">Q: How long were you in that train? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="460">A: I believe, two and a half days. </sentence><sentence id="461">I believe we were there two and a half days in all, with the stopping and going. </sentence><sentence id="462">I can't tell you exactly. </sentence><sentence id="463">I believe if I live to be 100, that smell will stay with me. </sentence><sentence id="464">And I will always hear the crying of the babies; and in particular, the young mother trying to feed an infant, breast feed an infant, and not having any milk to feed this infant. </sentence><sentence id="465">These revisionists that don't believe, I would like to take them all and put them into a compartment like that and show them what it feels like. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="472">Q: When the train finally stopped-- ? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="474">A: When the train stopped in Auschwitz, of course, we didn't know where we were. </sentence><sentence id="475">The train arrived in the middle of the night, so we were greeted by very bright lights shining down on us. </sentence><sentence id="476">We were greeted by soldiers, SS"-- men as well as women. </sentence><sentence id="477">We were greeted by dogs and whips, by shouting and screaming orders to try to empty the train, by " Schutzstaffeln [Protection Squads] (German)  confusion, and by men in striped uniform. </sentence><sentence id="478">We didn't know it at the time, but the men in uniform were the Jews who were brought there before us. </sentence><sentence id="479">They were called "Kanada," which I found out later. </sentence><sentence id="480">Their job was to empty the train. </sentence><sentence id="481">One of those men saved my life. </sentence><sentence id="482">That was the first. </sentence><sentence id="483">When they had asked us to empty the trains, these men would come onto the compartment of the train; and they would try and push and pull us off the train as fast as they could. </sentence><sentence id="484">These men were not allowed to speak to us; but, in their own way, they tried to help young people. </sentence><sentence id="485">They walked amongst us, and in Yiddish would whisper to a child, "You're 15. </sentence><sentence id="486">Remember you're 15." </sentence><sentence id="487">When we got off the train and they asked us to line up according to age, I lined up with -- I became 15 years old, lined up with the 15 years old. </sentence><sentence id="488">And I truly believe that man, whoever he was, saved my life. </sentence><sentence id="489">Time out.

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="513">A: When they asked us to line up, of course,... When we, when we got off the train, the men needed to go to one side, the young boys -- I believe it was to the left. </sentence><sentence id="514">It's like a picture. </sentence><sentence id="515">The babies were taken away and put onto trucks. </sentence><sentence id="516">Today that I am a mother and a grandmother, I can understand this more than I did at the time. </sentence><sentence id="517">The young children and the babies that were taken out of mothers" arms and put on to these trucks; and the mothers running after them. </sentence><sentence id="518">And the crying and the screaming, "My baby!" </sentence><sentence id="519">And they were told they would see them later. </sentence><sentence id="520">Of course, as we know today, they never did. </sentence><sentence id="521">The old people, the cripples whoever couldn't walk, these were put on trucks. </sentence><sentence id="522">The young people needed to line up. </sentence><sentence id="523">Women and men were separated, as were children. </sentence><sentence id="524">My mother and I stood on the same line when they told us to line up, and then they started to call age. </sentence><sentence id="525">Mother was a young woman. </sentence><sentence id="526">They called, "Age!" </sentence><sentence id="527">And I told my mother she stood in the wrong line. </sentence><sentence id="528">My mother went into another line. </sentence><sentence id="529">I found out several hours later that the line she went in went directly to the gas chambers. </sentence><sentence id="530">I'm sorry. </sentence></p></dialogue>

</sentence><sentence id="574">We did not discuss the Holocaust in our home. </sentence><sentence id="575">It was taboo. </sentence><sentence id="576">I would not associate with any survivors. </sentence><sentence id="577">I would not join any organizations. </sentence><sentence id="578">I got married. </sentence><sentence id="579">My husband knew I was a survivor. </sentence><sentence id="580">We raised a child who knew his mother was a survivor, would come home from school when he would learn about the Holocaust -- as little as was taught at that time, because we're going back 30 some years -- and would ask questions. </sentence><sentence id="581">I could not answer the questions. </sentence><sentence id="582">I would give a one syllable "yes" or "no" answer. </sentence><sentence id="583">And after a while, a child realizes that these are things we don't talk about. </sentence><sentence id="584">And so he stopped asking. </sentence><sentence id="585">This is how I lived for many years. </sentence><sentence id="586">This was my way. </sentence><sentence id="587">Until about five, five and a half years ago, my son called one night, and he said, "Mom, I just read an article in the newspaper put in by the Holocaust Foundation of Illinois, asking for survivors to come forth and have their stories recorded." </sentence><sentence id="588">He says, "Mom, you need to do this. </sentence><sentence id="589">You need to do this, because I need to know. </sentence><sentence id="590">It's time." </sentence><sentence id="591">And he called me once, and he called me twice; and I kept saying, "Yes, I'll do it." </sentence><sentence id="592">I had seen the article several times, but I ignored it because I could not handle it. </sentence><sentence id="593">And one day he called me and he said, "If you don't call, I will call the Foundation. </sentence><sentence id="594">Mom, please go. </sentence><sentence id="595">Don't ask for anything. </sentence><sentence id="596">Sign whatever they tell you to sign. </sentence><sentence id="597">But ask for a tape. </sentence><sentence id="598">Ask for a tape so that we -- your grandson, now, and I -- will know what happened." </sentence><sentence id="599">And so I did. </sentence><sentence id="600">And this is when the memories started to fall back into place. </sentence><sentence id="601">This is when I went back into camp, and started to relive all of this. </sentence><sentence id="602">The reason I'm telling you this is because many things are blocked out in my mind. </sentence><sentence id="603">One of the things is, crossing the threshold from the train station into the camp itself. </sentence><sentence id="604">Whether it's really blocked out or not, I don't know. </sentence><sentence id="605">But probably, psychologically, it's there; but it needs to come out. </sentence><sentence id="606">I remember the gate. </sentence><sentence id="607">I can see the gate in front of me: "Arbeit Macht Frei(r)." </sentence><sentence id="608">I see the separation. </sentence><sentence id="609">I see the lines. </sentence><sentence id="610">I see the trucks moving. </sentence><sentence id="611">But I do not recall going into the camp. </sentence><sentence id="612">The first memory of camp is sitting in a chair and having my hair shaved. </sentence><sentence id="613">And I recall the hair falling in my face, mingling with my tears. </sentence><sentence id="614">And then a uniform being thrown at me and a pair of clogs. </sentence><sentence id="615">Pushed outside. </sentence><sentence id="616">I recall walking outside, and &gt; Work Makes [You] Free (German)  seeing all of these hundreds and hundreds of other women with their heads shaved. </sentence><sentence id="617">Some holding on to their uniforms, and some wearing their uniforms already. </sentence><sentence id="618">And here was Fritzie -- this pampered child -- thrown into a snake pit, so to speak. </sentence><sentence id="619">A lady walked up to me, and kept staring at me. </sentence><sentence id="620">The lady turned out to be my mother's youngest sister, whose hair was shaved already and who was in uniform. </sentence><sentence id="621">It was due to that lady that I survived Auschwitz concentration camp. </sentence><sentence id="622">But that was really my first memory of walking into Auschwitz. </sentence><sentence id="623">This lady held my hand all the way through the months of Auschwitz. </sentence><sentence id="624">I'm not sure any survivor can describe Auschwitz to you. </sentence><sentence id="625">I know you said you are going back there; but unless you've lived under those conditions for one day, you will never know. </sentence><sentence id="626">How does one describe the walking into Auschwitz, the, the smell? </sentence><sentence id="627">And someone pointing out to you that those are gas chambers, that your parents went up in smoke?When I asked, "When will I see my mother?" </sentence><sentence id="628">several hours later after I came into the camp, I was shown the smoke. </sentence><sentence id="629">This is how I found out where she went. </sentence><sentence id="630">How do I describe fear? </sentence><sentence id="631">How do I describe hunger to someone that has probably had breakfast and lunch today? </sentence><sentence id="632">Or even if you're dieting, or even if you're fasting for a day? </sentence><sentence id="633">I think hunger is when the pit of your stomach hurts. </sentence><sentence id="634">When you would sell your soul for a potato or a slice of bread. </sentence><sentence id="635">I believe that once one has experienced hunger, they will never ever forget it. </sentence><sentence id="636">How do I describe living with lice in your clothes, on your body? </sentence><sentence id="637">The stink. </sentence><sentence id="638">The fear. </sentence><sentence id="639">The selections. </sentence><sentence id="640">The Appells*. </sentence><sentence id="641">The being told when to go to a toilet, not when you needed to use it. </sentence><sentence id="642">The using of the morning coffee to wash your face with. </sentence><sentence id="643">The knowing that Dr.Mengele* will be there for his selections every single day. </sentence><sentence id="644">And mostly, mostly death in the gas chambers, the smoke. </sentence><sentence id="645">There is no way to describe your first coming to Auschwitz. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="732">Q: As you struggle to remember and help us to know, can you share with us some of your impressions of what you saw and how you reacted to it? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="734">A: I think the, the reaction is -- I think the first thought is, to survive. </sentence><sentence id="735">Your concern for your family. </sentence><sentence id="736">Your wondering what happened to them. </sentence><sentence id="737">The people around you. </sentence><sentence id="738">The seeing of death day in and day out. </sentence><sentence id="739">Not knowing when your turn was going to come. </sentence><sentence id="740">But I think the struggle to survive, in all of us. </sentence><sentence id="741">And, and none of us really know the kind of energy we put in every day to survive, unless we're faced with this. </sentence><sentence id="742">And I know many people thought of dying, and many people thought of committing suicide. </sentence><sentence id="743">My thought was always of tomorrow. </sentence><sentence id="744">And I believe that's what -- maybe youth -- but my, my hope was always of tomorrow. </sentence><sentence id="745">The struggles to survive. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="758">Q: You mentioned the word "selection." </sentence><sentence id="759">Could you tell us a little about that process? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="762">A: Selection. </sentence><sentence id="763">We needed to get undressed every day. </sentence><sentence id="764">And we needed to run -- not walk -- in * roll call (German) deg Dr. Josef Mengele  0 front of Dr. Mengele, or his entourage, which was SS soldiers. </sentence><sentence id="765">We needed to show that we still had strength left to -- whether it was to work or to live another day. </sentence><sentence id="766">I recall some women were beginning -- as the hair grows back, they were beginning to get gray hair. </sentence><sentence id="767">And they would go and take a little piece of coal from one of the pot-bellied stoves that was in a barrack. </sentence><sentence id="768">And they would use this coal to color their hair with, so that they would look a little younger. </sentence><sentence id="769">I mean, one grayed at the age of maybe 18 or 19 under those conditions. </sentence><sentence id="770">And they would run -- we would run in front of whoever it was that was doing the selections, to show that we could survive one other day. </sentence><sentence id="771">If one had a scar, a pimple, if one didn't run fast enough, if one didn't look right for whatever reason to the particular person that was doing the selection. </sentence><sentence id="772">They would stand there with a stick -- to the right or to the left -- as you ran by them. </sentence><sentence id="773">One never knew if they were in the good line or the bad line. </sentence><sentence id="774">One line would go to the gas chambers. </sentence><sentence id="775">The other line would go back to the camp and to the barracks, to live another day. </sentence><sentence id="776">This is how the selection was done. </sentence><sentence id="777">I believe there were so many people that needed to be gassed every day. </sentence><sentence id="778">And we knew the trains were coming in; and we watched the people marching. </sentence><sentence id="779">And we knew many of the barracks were being emptied out, day in and day out, to make room for the new people that were coming in. </sentence><sentence id="780">We never knew when our turn would come next. </sentence><sentence id="781">So one always lived in fear, and one always tried to get through these selections for one more day. </sentence><sentence id="782">And, of course, the Appell. </sentence><sentence id="783">They would wake us up at the crack of dawn and empty out the entire barracks. </sentence><sentence id="784">And we would need to line up in fives to be counted, twice a day -- the first thing in the morning and the last thing at night. </sentence><sentence id="785">To make sure no one had escaped, no one was missing. </sentence><sentence id="786">Sometimes we would stand there for hours and hours. </sentence><sentence id="787">Just stand to be counted, until every single person in the particular camp was accounted for. </sentence><sentence id="788">You must remember, there were thousands and thousands of people in each camp. </sentence><sentence id="789">Whether it rained or the sun was out, if it was hot or if it was cold. </sentence><sentence id="790">We had very little clothing. </sentence><sentence id="791">And, of course, in the summer we had to wear whatever we had. </sentence><sentence id="792">So if the sun would beat down on you, many people would faint during these "Appell" counts. </sentence><sentence id="793">Nobody ever wanted to be at the beginning of the line, and nobody ever wanted to be at the front of the line; because for whatever punishment was being dished out, they would pull people from the beginning or the end of the line to punish these people. </sentence><sentence id="794">To show us what would happen to us if we did not obey orders in every day living. </sentence><sentence id="795">And, of course, the dead people that that would die during the night from starvation or disease, or from killing, from beatings, they too would need to be carried out from the barracks every single morning, and lined up in front of the barracks. </sentence><sentence id="796">They, too needed, to be counted. </sentence><sentence id="797">Every single body needed to be accounted for. </sentence><sentence id="798">Day in, and day out. </sentence><sentence id="799">We would not get any food until every single person was accounted for. </sentence><sentence id="800">And then we were allowed to march and get our breakfast, which often times just consisted of a cup of coffee. </sentence><sentence id="801">Often times they would give us a little soup and a small slice of bread. </sentence><sentence id="802">And most of the time, of course, we didn't have any water. </sentence><sentence id="803">So we would use that hot coffee to wash our faces and our hands with. </sentence><sentence id="804">So we wouldn't even get the hot coffee in the morning. </sentence><sentence id="805">This was our existence while we were in Auschwitz. </sentence><sentence id="806">My job in Auschwitz was -- they would line us up  1 every morning and they would take us outside; and we would carry huge rocks from one side to another. </sentence><sentence id="807">One day we would come, and we would take these huge rocks from this side and we would carry them to that side. </sentence><sentence id="808">The next day, they would bring us back; and we would take these same huge rocks, and we would carry them from that side back to this side. </sentence><sentence id="809">Now you need to know, we were undernourished. </sentence><sentence id="810">We were all weak. </sentence><sentence id="811">And to carry a big rock like that was a lot of weight and a lot of work. </sentence><sentence id="812">By the time they take us back to the barracks at night, we could barely crawl. </sentence><sentence id="813">But we needed to show that we could still walk, and we were strong enough to give one more day. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="868">Q: How long did that go on? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="870">A: That went on for several months. </sentence><sentence id="871">It went on for close to nine months. </sentence><sentence id="872">Until one day they came and they were emptying out our barrack. </sentence><sentence id="873">And we knew exactly where we were going to go. </sentence><sentence id="874">They lined us up, and they were marching us towards the gas chambers. </sentence><sentence id="875">It was our turn. </sentence><sentence id="876">My aunt and I, and the rest of the women, marched towards the gas chambers. </sentence><sentence id="877">And they had a selection. </sentence><sentence id="878">My aunt was chosen to go onto a truck to be taken somewheres else. </sentence><sentence id="879">And I was chosen to stay, to march into the gas chambers. </sentence><sentence id="880">The last my aunt saw of me, was walking towards the gas chambers as she crawled down from the truck and begged could I come onto the truck with her. </sentence><sentence id="881">And they were laughing and said no, but she could come down and join me, as the trucks were pulling away. </sentence><sentence id="882">As we started to walk towards the gas chambers and we were walking in, I was at the end of the line -- again, because of my aunt. </sentence><sentence id="883">Six of us were pulled out of line; and I was literally in the door of the gas chamber. </sentence><sentence id="884">I will never know the reason why. </sentence><sentence id="885">Six of us were pulled out and put onto another truck, with several other women, to go to work in a factory. </sentence><sentence id="886">Forced labor. </sentence><sentence id="887">When they brought us to the factory, I was the youngest of 600 women. </sentence><sentence id="888">Our job was -- we were doing parts. </sentence><sentence id="889">Each one of us had a different job to do, and this was -- they were doing parts for airplanes. </sentence><sentence id="890">My particular job was to put the spring into the compass that would go onto an airplane. </sentence><sentence id="891">Because I was the youngest, 599 women shared their precious food with me. </sentence><sentence id="892">Allowed me a little extra food every day. </sentence><sentence id="893">If anyone could rest, I was the one that would rest. </sentence><sentence id="894">I was their hope to survive. </sentence><sentence id="895">I was their hope to carry the message to the world. </sentence><sentence id="896">To tell the world what happened. </sentence><sentence id="897">It took me 40 some years to remember a promise I made to 599 women. </sentence><sentence id="898">But I remember today. </sentence><sentence id="899">And I remember every time I stand up to speak, it was due to them that I made the last days of camp. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="930">Q: Of the 600 women including yourself, do you recall how many were able to come out with you? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="932">A: No. </sentence><sentence id="933">I don't know what happened to any of them. </sentence><sentence id="934">As Germany started to lose the war, they started to gather us, of course, and the famous death march. </sentence><sentence id="935">And we, too -- all of us were  2 -- joined a group, the group from other concentration camps and factories. </sentence><sentence id="936">And started the death march. </sentence><sentence id="937">I don't know if you're familiar with the death march, but it was -- I don't know how to describe it. </sentence><sentence id="938">All of us were weak already, but we knew -- we did not know where we were going to go, but we knew that it was the last days of the war. </sentence><sentence id="939">We knew because of the bombings; and we knew because of the way the German soldiers were pushing us and pulling us already, and emptying the camps and whatever. </sentence><sentence id="940">They took us all and put us together, all of the people from camps. </sentence><sentence id="941">And they had us march through towns and through fields. </sentence><sentence id="942">They didn't know where to put us anymore, and they didn't know what to do with us. </sentence><sentence id="943">And there was no food, because the Germans were losing the war. </sentence><sentence id="944">Often times, as they marched us through a town, a window would open and a shutter would open, and either a potato or a loaf of bread would come flying out; and the shutter would close after. </sentence><sentence id="945">And we would all pounce on this potato or this -- whatever this piece of food was that came at us. </sentence><sentence id="946">And, of course, they would shoot at us; but we didn't care at that point, because we were hungry. </sentence><sentence id="947">The streets were literally covered with bodies. </sentence><sentence id="948">As we marched, we would pass bodies. </sentence><sentence id="949">Body after body after body. </sentence><sentence id="950">People that were dropping dead from hunger, from disease, from dysentery; because they did not have the strength, or because they gave up. </sentence><sentence id="951">So we knew it was towards the very end. </sentence><sentence id="952">We would sleep in the fields. </sentence><sentence id="953">We lived on whatever we could find. </sentence><sentence id="954">If we could find a carrot, a potato, snails, snails! </sentence><sentence id="955">In order to survive. </sentence><sentence id="956">The planes would come down low, and shoot at us often times. </sentence><sentence id="957">Towards the very last, a friend -- a girl whose name I do not recall -- and I ran into the forest. </sentence><sentence id="958">I believe they saw us run. </sentence><sentence id="959">I believe the Germans saw us run; because they could have shot us at that that point. </sentence><sentence id="960">But they didn't. </sentence><sentence id="961">We ran into the forest and spent the first night in the forest sleeping. </sentence><sentence id="962">And we spent all the next day there, because we were afraid to go out. </sentence><sentence id="963">And when it started to get dark, she and I found a town to walk to. </sentence><sentence id="964">And we came to a farmer. </sentence><sentence id="965">And, of course, they had to know who we were. </sentence><sentence id="966">Our heads were shaved and we wore striped clothing. </sentence><sentence id="967">And we begged for food; and they did give us food, and told us to go into the barn. </sentence><sentence id="968">Because they had to go and give us -- get us stamps, because they didn't have enough food. </sentence><sentence id="969">And we went into the barn; and when the man left, we ran out of the barn and ran away, because we were afraid they would turn us in. </sentence><sentence id="970">And we lived in the forests until the Russians liberated us. </sentence><sentence id="971">You know, as we read books today and we watch films, and of course, we know the Germans "did not know what was going on." </sentence><sentence id="972">So they tell us. </sentence><sentence id="973">Not true. </sentence><sentence id="974">They all knew what was going on. </sentence><sentence id="975">They marched us through the towns to the forced labor, with our heads shaved and wearing striped uniforms. </sentence><sentence id="976">Often times, a window would open and they would throw food at us. </sentence><sentence id="977">The workers that worked in the factories with us. </sentence><sentence id="978">They tell us, "Hitler did this." </sentence><sentence id="979">Did Hitler really do this by himself?

</sentence><sentence id="985">Hitler didn't do it by himself. </sentence><sentence id="986">Hitler had lots of help. </sentence><sentence id="987">What about these men that were the guards in the camps, that would go home at night to play with  3 their children and listen to their music and hug their wives while they were killing our parents and our sisters and brothers? </sentence><sentence id="988">Did they keep a secret? </sentence><sentence id="989">Can they keep a secret?How many people can keep a secret? </sentence><sentence id="990">We were told they didn't know. </sentence><sentence id="991">What about all the people that lived in the towns around Auschwitz and other concentration camps, that saw the flames day in and day out? </sentence><sentence id="992">That smelled the stink of the bodies burning, day in and day out? </sentence><sentence id="993">What about all the people that saw the trains passing by, and the people begging for water, for food to give to their babies?

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1099">A: When we heard that Russia had occupied the particular town we were liberated in, we went to them and presented ourselves as prisoners, as they could see, because we were skin and bones, and of course our hair had not grown back in the few days, and we were still in uniform. </sentence><sentence id="1100">We joined other survivors. </sentence><sentence id="1101">They took us to an area where they had other survivors that they had liberated. </sentence><sentence id="1102">And then the Russians took us into a town, where they took over an apartment building; and they put us all into this building and literally made it like a ghetto type of a surrounding. </sentence><sentence id="1103">Although they did give us all the medical attention we needed, and they did give us food and they gave us a bath and they gave clothing. </sentence><sentence id="1104">They had to put guards around us, because they were afraid we were carriers of disease at that point, as probably we were. </sentence><sentence id="1105">Most of us were sick. </sentence><sentence id="1106">And they -- as I said they put guards there; and they put they put wires on the windows. </sentence><sentence id="1107">But they did -- we were given freedom at that point. </sentence><sentence id="1108">And I think the, the windows and so forth were being protected -- we, we were given the protection from their soldiers at that point, more than anything. </sentence><sentence id="1109">Because we were women; and, of course, you know, the protection we needed. </sentence><sentence id="1110">After that, after we had medical attention and all, they had asked us where we wanted to go. </sentence><sentence id="1111">And I chose to go back home to my hometown, hoping that someone from my family had survived and would come back home. </sentence><sentence id="1112"> 4 I was one of the first to come back home. </sentence><sentence id="1113">And when we came -- when I came back to our town, our home was destroyed. </sentence><sentence id="1114">Soldiers had used it as a lookout post. </sentence><sentence id="1115">It was kind of on a hill, and they could see different directions from it. </sentence><sentence id="1116">So it was totally destroyed. </sentence><sentence id="1117">My grandmother's home still stood. </sentence><sentence id="1118">There were no windows, but the home was intact. </sentence><sentence id="1119">And I moved into that home. </sentence><sentence id="1120">And we had a train that would pass by our village once a day. </sentence><sentence id="1121">And I would go to meet that train every day, to see if someone else had survived. </sentence><sentence id="1122">And little by little, some of our young people started to trickle back, one by one. </sentence><sentence id="1123">And my grandmother's home became the gathering place for all of us. </sentence><sentence id="1124">We all moved in. </sentence><sentence id="1125">We had what you call communal living; except that we did it out of necessity, "cause we had nothing else. </sentence><sentence id="1126">And we all migrated to this one home, and lived off of potatoes and carrots or whatever we could get off the fields. </sentence><sentence id="1127">Our neighbors did not come to offer us anything. </sentence><sentence id="1128">Our neighbors -- who used our furniture, who used my aunt's clothes and my mother's clothes, that we recognized -- not once came to ask if we needed any food or warm clothing. </sentence><sentence id="1129">I like to think that it was done out of shame, maybe out of guilt. </sentence><sentence id="1130">I don't know. </sentence><sentence id="1131">I like to think that this is why they never came forth. </sentence><sentence id="1132">And we all lived that way until we all went in our different directions. </sentence></p></dialogue>
