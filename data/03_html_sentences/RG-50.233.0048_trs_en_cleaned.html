<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="495">Q: They didn't know you were coming? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="497">A: They didn't know I was coming, they were very happy to see me, they thought I was already dead, maybe, or whatever, and I decided at that time, there were bombardments while I was in Rovno. </sentence><sentence id="498">During the day the German airplanes used to fly in and bombard sections of the city. </sentence><sentence id="499">In order for my family to be safer, I told them to move to a section which was called Kapkaz that was the other part of the city, like one section is towards east of the city like facing the Russians and we had an uncle who was the keeper of the synagogue. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="500"> Tape 1, Side 1 </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="501">A: To bring them over to that part of the town was already late and I had to go back to where I was assigned to be there at 10 o'clock. </sentence><sentence id="502">Because about 7:30 or 8'clock, I left my family, I said goodbye to my father, my whole family and (a portion of tape is blank). </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="503">A: I am going to repeat a few sentences. </sentence><sentence id="504">When I brought my family over to Kafkaz it was late in the day and I had to go back to Slobonov where I was assigned. </sentence><sentence id="505">We didn't know at the time that the Germans are going to take over most of the territory. </sentence><sentence id="506">We figured it's just a temporary thing and the Russians are going to be able to fight back the Germans and life is going to go on normal. </sentence><sentence id="507">I was responsible for my job where I was in Slobonov so I had to leave my family. </sentence><sentence id="508">My mother did not want me to go back. </sentence><sentence id="509">She insisted I should stay with the family, in that synagogue. </sentence><sentence id="510">I spoke to my father, he was more like sort of reasonable, and he said to me, I remember and I"!l never forget it, he said, my son, you are a grown man, you have to make your own decisions what to do. </sentence><sentence id="511">If you think that it is important for you to go back, then you have to go back. </sentence><sentence id="512">So I had no problems with my father, but my mother was insisting I should stay with them. </sentence><sentence id="513">I made up my mind to go back because I felt that if I don't, I will be responsible for the job I'm supposed to do on the railroad in Slobonov because it is a major depot place where soldiers and with the Russian soldiers and they had to be transported from one place to the other and it was important for me to be there. </sentence><sentence id="514">So, I said to my parents that I'm going to be there tonight. </sentence><sentence id="515">After I finish my job in the morning I'll see you back. </sentence><sentence id="516">Ill come back to the city and see you again. </sentence><sentence id="517">On the way to Slobonov walking, I walked out about six kilometers, about half way, from the city of Rovno to Slobonov there was an attack. </sentence><sentence id="518">It was sort of getting dark that day, already late in the day, and I was walking with the road of the railroad, that's how I came to Slobonov and a lot of planes were coming towards us and there were another few people and everyone was hiding and I was also hiding from the airplanes. </sentence><sentence id="519">We didn't know they were going to attack us, they were flying very low and I saw them go towards Rovno, towards the city of Rovno. </sentence><sentence id="520">A few minutes later I looked out, all the airplanes they spread like sort of in one line and they attacked the city of Rovno from one end to the other. </sentence><sentence id="521">And a few minutes later I saw the whole city burning. </sentence><sentence id="522">I was six kilometers out of the city. </sentence><sentence id="523">It was very hard for me to make a decision what to do now. </sentence><sentence id="524">I didn't know whether my family was killed at the time or not, because the city was on fire from one end to the other. </sentence><sentence id="525">I made a decision to go to work because I figured like that. </sentence><sentence id="526">If I don't go to work and nothing happened to my family I would be a deserter, because I was sort of mobilized already by the Russian army to be on the railroad, and then they will kill me as a deserter, the Russian government. </sentence><sentence id="527">If my family is dead, I won't see them anyhow. </sentence><sentence id="528">So I decided that in the morning when I finish my work, I will run back to the city. </sentence><sentence id="529">Being that I came back to Slobonov I was on my place of work, watching the cars on the outside. </sentence><sentence id="530">I was assigned to that, we had a few attacks in the middle, like already dark later on, we had attacks by the German airplanes on the railroad, on the station. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="562">A: On the station that I was working. </sentence><sentence id="563">A whole group of people started to run out of the station because they aimed at the depot, at the station where I was working. </sentence><sentence id="564">And I ran out to the outskirts of Slobonov. </sentence><sentence id="565">We went into a house a few kilometers from the depot, from the Slobonov station and I walked into the house and I said I have to stay here, I have to rest until this thing is over and I'Il have to rest here in your house and the woman did not disagree, she let us in, there were a few men already sleeping on the floor, and she said I have no room, the only place I have is on the floor. </sentence><sentence id="566">If you want to accept it, it's O.K. I asked her, I said please, if I fall asleep, wake me up, but early, early in the morning. </sentence><sentence id="567">Being that I was tired and I didn't sleep for a few days, traveling from Lubov to Rovno, I was very tired so I fell asleep on the floor. </sentence><sentence id="568">I was so tired that the woman just couldn't get me up early in the morning and she let me sleep. </sentence><sentence id="569">She didn't know the reason why I had to be up early. </sentence><sentence id="570">About 8 o'clock, sort of, in the morning I got up. </sentence><sentence id="571">I said, why didn't you wake me up, I was supposed to be on the station working. </sentence><sentence id="572">Well, I walked out of the house and I ran towards the station where I was supposed to be working. </sentence><sentence id="573">As I came close to the rails, I saw German tank facing a column of Russian soldiers with their gun from the tank pointing at them and all the Russians with their hands up were standing in front of their building from that column. </sentence><sentence id="574">And I couldn't figure it out that the Germans were there already because I didn't see Germans until that point, that was the first tank I ever saw German except in the air, the bombardment. </sentence><sentence id="575">So I walked around behind the tank. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="615">Q: To the east? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="617">A: To the east. </sentence><sentence id="618">I decided to go as fast as I can towards those locomotives and they were going very slow because they couldn't, looks like ahead of them they had some problems, so they were traveling very slow and I could catch up with them, and the last locomotive was a friend of mine that also was operating that locomotive. </sentence><sentence id="619">When he saw me run he slowed down and he picked me up. </sentence><sentence id="620">And on that locomotive I was until we got into Russia. </sentence><sentence id="621">Never had a chance to go back to Rovno to see if my family was alive or dead. </sentence><sentence id="622">And this was the last time I ever saw my family. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="820">Q: The building... </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="836">A: This incident took place, 1946. </sentence><sentence id="837">There came an order from, it looks like, you know we were involved with the and other organizations that worked underground from Israel to bring the people, the Jewish people into Israel at the time. </sentence><sentence id="838">An order came for us to depart Bittem, start going towards sort of Italy and we had to go to another town which was called Katowice and from Katowice we had special papers made for us like new names and the names were given to all the ninety people, more than ninety because families of these youngsters that lived outside of this particular building were also taken at the same time so all of us were given Greek names, each one had a Greek name sort of, that we were not Jews but Greeks escaping, going to Greece and we got false documents with Polish stamps that we were Greeks and in the middle of the night, one night, we smuggled the border from Poland to Czechoslovakia. </sentence><sentence id="839">We had a special guide in the middle of the night. </sentence><sentence id="840">Old and young, were walking through the woods in the dark and people were falling and it was raining that night, and was mud on our feet, but we had to go as fast as possible because the guide he knew the way and he was going fast. </sentence><sentence id="841">So the whole length of that echelon, all the people that were going in one line sort of, it stretched for a long way, we managed to get in to Czechoslovakia. </sentence><sentence id="842">And we had an assigned building that was waiting for us. </sentence><sentence id="843">They took us to that particular house. </sentence><sentence id="844">We came in all muddy with shoes full of mud and wet. </sentence><sentence id="845">We had to wash ourselves outside in the middle of the night and from there we had to go, the woman from the house took care of us, and we had something to eat and early in the morning they brought a truck, a flat truck sort of, maybe about two feet high, flatbed not covered, they took all the older people and the children, the young children, on that truck, and it traveled to Bratislava. </sentence><sentence id="846">Lying down on the truck like from , that was the town that we started, right on the border to Bratislava, the older people were lying and they were covered with a canvas, and that's how they traveled all the way to Bratislava to a hotel where they had in Bratislava for the refugees. </sentence><sentence id="847">The younger people were assigned to go by train so being that is a tiny little town, didn't see too many people, slowly two by two, a boy and a girl, walked towards the train station and we wanted to buy tickets. </sentence><sentence id="848">As we went to the station, two by two, not in a group, the station manager, whoever was there, noticed that so many people are here. </sentence><sentence id="849">He never had that many people going by train to Bratislava that he called the police, the Czechoslovakian police, the police came and arrested us. </sentence><sentence id="850">Naturally we had documents that we were Greeks so we had to, Greek we did not know how to speak, so we spoke whatever we knew in the Seder, in the praying book, so sort of this kind of language sort of we spoke. </sentence><sentence id="851">We didn't understand each other, but we made believe that we speak Greek. </sentence><sentence id="852">They arrested us, the whole group. </sentence><sentence id="853">A Jewish organization in Bratislava found out that we were arrested by the Czechoslovakian police, they worked very hard and they got us out and they transferred us to Bratislava into that hotel where we were going to leave Czechoslovakia. </sentence><sentence id="854">They didn't want us there. </sentence><sentence id="855">So we were lucky that they didn't send us back to Poland because we really smuggled out of that country with false papers. </sentence><sentence id="856">When we got to Bratislava they organized a group of, about 200 people, to go to the border to come to Vienna. </sentence><sentence id="857">The leadership that was in charge of that group had a permission to take out twenty people out of   Czechoslovakia on the border crossing. </sentence><sentence id="858">They made 200 out of that twenty, they added another zero and they took 200 people on that particular document. </sentence><sentence id="859">When we came to the border, they gave the Czechoslovakian guard on the border a couple of cartons of American cigarettes. </sentence><sentence id="860">So we crossed the border and now we are in no-man's land. </sentence><sentence id="861">We came to the Russian side which was part of Vienna. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="889">Q: The Russian occupation zone? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="891">A: The Russian occupation zone of Vienna. </sentence><sentence id="892">They gave them a couple of bottles of vodka and they let us through. </sentence><sentence id="893">So we boarded a streetcar in Vienna and with the streetcar we went to the American side of Vienna and we stayed in the Rothschild Hospital in Vienna. </sentence><sentence id="894">That was like sort of a place, we organized that hospital as a transition place, a place for refugees until it was time to go further towards Italy. </sentence><sentence id="895">My uncle Menachim was with me at certain times. </sentence><sentence id="896">He found me in Russia. </sentence><sentence id="897">That was my mother's youngest brother. </sentence><sentence id="898">He was in the Russian army and then he was bombarded and shot. </sentence><sentence id="899">He wound up in certain parts of Russia where he found me accidentally and I was with him at certain places. </sentence><sentence id="900">Which, if you are interested, later on I will go into it. </sentence><sentence id="901">He volunteered during Russia he volunteered to the army and we separated again in Russia. </sentence><sentence id="902">He was in Czechoslovakia until the end of the war even after the war, fighting Germans and somehow he survived and he wound up in , in a camp, displaced persons camp, where he was in sort of citizens police, in camp police, as a policeman. </sentence><sentence id="903">All the Zionist organizations had a conference in this camp and through one person at the conference he found out that I was in Vienna on the American side in Rothschild Hospital. </sentence><sentence id="904">That person at the conference took a message to me telling me about my uncle that he is living in P which at that time I did not know where it was, and I should pick myself up and travel with the next transport that passes by Linz and he'll wait for me. </sentence><sentence id="905">Well, I excused myself from this organization because I was with the Zionist organization going towards Israel all this time, and I said my uncle was there and if you don't mind I want to travel to meet him. </sentence><sentence id="906">That was the first relative I ever found since the war started. </sentence><sentence id="907">And, as I was traveling, they gave me permission and I was traveling towards Linz. </sentence><sentence id="908">He was waiting for me, he didn't know which transport, but he was waiting for one transport to the other until he found me on the transport. </sentence><sentence id="909">But the transport was not supposed to stop in Linz, only stop there for refueling or something, water. </sentence><sentence id="910">That transport was going towards Italy with Jewish people that were going to Israel. </sentence><sentence id="911">And as I came to Linz I knew that somebody was going to wait for me at the station. </sentence><sentence id="912">I looked out the window and he spotted me and he was in sort of a Jewish with a Star of David on his sleeve, with a whistle on his neck over here with a uniform Jewish Police, with a hat. </sentence><sentence id="913">So somehow the Austrian police at the station allowed him to get me off that transport and take me with him. </sentence><sentence id="914">And that's how I was able to get into this particular camp or displaced persons camp. </sentence><sentence id="915">He signed me into that camp which was a little hard because this particular camp did not allow new people to sign into that camp. </sentence><sentence id="916">The only ones that they allowed was brothers, sisters, relatives that were there and if they found them they allowed them to take into the same room they had in the camp. </sentence><sentence id="917">Because there was no room in this camp for newcomers. </sentence><sentence id="918">He managed to do that by saying that I was his brother, not a nephew and I was able to get into this camp under the name of Grossman, which was his name too, my name was changed a few times before that, so I accepted the name Grossman. </sentence><sentence id="919">He accepted the name Grossman because he knew that in America his brothers names were Grossman, so he didn't want to make complications, so he marked the name Grossman and I became a Grossman which I was a few times before when I met him, and that's how I am a Grossman all this time it would be too hard to explain to anybody why I am not Tannenbaum, but Grossman. </sentence><sentence id="920">So under Grossman I live in the United States since I came here. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="971">Q: Would this be after the winter? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="973">A: I don't, I can't recall the time when Stalingrad made the . </sentence><sentence id="974">Maybe in 1942 or the beginning of "42, something like that. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="977">Q: You passed the winter near Moscow? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="979">A: Yes. </sentence><sentence id="980">When I found out that this transport is going to Stalingrad and I figure they are pushing, according to the information I got, I knew that I am going to have to fight for Stalingrad and probably get killed like everybody else did. </sentence><sentence id="981">But I decided to go deeper into Russia. </sentence><sentence id="982">And I took a group of four guys, four railroad people that I knew; they were from Kovid, from my area. </sentence><sentence id="983">I told them, I said, now we're not going to work on the railroad anymore, looks like we're going into some kind of a different uniform and we're going to have to fight or shoot or something like that, because the whole transport is going towards Stalingrad. </sentence><sentence id="984">If you want, I say we should do another thing and go someplace else. </sentence><sentence id="985">Being that we didn't know where to go, but we decided, all the five of us, decided to escape from that place because we are not needed anymore, in the middle of the night we went from that place. </sentence><sentence id="986">We were not arrested or kept under special supervision, but if somebody would see us go away from that transport they would be suspicious. </sentence><sentence id="987">So in the middle of the night we decided to go to the railroad station that was not far from Zagorsch and go wherever it is possible to go deeper to Russia, deeper in Russia because the Germans were very close. </sentence><sentence id="988">We found, I particular noticed a transport that was assembled with cars from the Moscow Metro and they were already stationed, they were on platforms, platform beds on the railroad cars and those cars were hooked up next to these particular platform station. </sentence><sentence id="989">I said to my friends, I say, look, I don't know where, but when I was in Moscow I saw these particular cars in the metro, in the underground, in the subway. </sentence><sentence id="990">I think that these trains are being evacuated because they are valuable trains, they were very nice and if they are evacuated they are not going to the front they are probably going toward deep into Russia. </sentence><sentence id="991">If we manage to get on this particular train we will probably go towards Russia, because we did not get information where the transport is going. </sentence><sentence id="992">So that train took off and went to a town of Gorki, which was north and east. </sentence><sentence id="993">It was, now I remember, it was wintertime, it was   cold, so it must have been between deg41 and "42, because I froze my hands someplace near Gorki. </sentence><sentence id="994">We went into certain, there were cars, on flatbeds, there were also trucks standing on the platforms so we managed to get into a door into the trucks and we were traveling in that particular truck in the cabins all the way to Gorki in the cold. </sentence><sentence id="995">When we got to Gorki, we found out it was Gorki, we really didn't know that we're going to come to Gorki. </sentence><sentence id="996">We came to Gorki we saw a whole transport of wounded soldiers. </sentence><sentence id="997">We were still in the uniform of the railroad. </sentence><sentence id="998">We had our uniforms on. </sentence><sentence id="999">We went in to speak to, there were passenger train, a lot of refugees were there in Gorki and they didn't allow anybody to hook on to this train because there were wounded soldiers from the front sort of going deep. </sentence><sentence id="1000">Being that they were wounded soldiers, I didn't think that these soldiers are going towards the front, they were going to deep into Russia for treatment. </sentence><sentence id="1001">So we decided as railroad people to go with them, but they didn't allow us to go into the inside of the train to the compartments because they were soldiers and we were railroad people, but they allowed us to stay in between the cars on the outside and travel till the next station, maybe we'll find another transport someplace else. </sentence><sentence id="1002">We traveled for a while. </sentence><sentence id="1003">I know when I came off I was all frozen, my hands were frozen and all the other guys were all frozen traveling in between the trains and we got out of Gorki. </sentence><sentence id="1004">We managed to hook onto some refugee trains later on in the cattle cars. </sentence><sentence id="1005">When we got into some cars there were also refugees from Europe, from Russia, from all different towns and we managed to get in there with them, travel to Quebishov, there's a town Quebishov and from Quebishov they took us to Tashkent, we got off in Tashkent, that's Asia already. </sentence><sentence id="1006">On the way we had a lot of trouble because the sanitary ways were very bad and we had lice and sicknesses and typhoid and all kinds of sicknesses among the people, but we managed, I managed to get to Tashkent. </sentence><sentence id="1007">In Tashkent as a railroad guy and as a student for a certain school in Russia in , I made an appointment with the chief of the railroad from the Tashkent. </sentence><sentence id="1008">I was lucky enough that he made an appointment for me to see him and when I got up there, he was an old man, he was the chief, the Kamisar, they call it, and I told him that, I told him a little lie, that we were bombarded o the road as I was traveling and my transport that I was with disappeared and I managed to come here and I am looking for a place to live and to stay and to work on the railroad. </sentence><sentence id="1009">Well he gave us a place, he told me O.K., you as a machinist, you know mechanics, we'll give you a job ona machine on a certain machine to work, but the other four I don't have any place except for a place in Tashkent to work on the same machine that was cutting railroad ties for the railroad. </sentence><sentence id="1010">They would be pushing the trees up to the machine by hand and that will be their job. </sentence><sentence id="1011">He gave us a place to live in Tashkent, a dorm. </sentence><sentence id="1012">They took us into places where we could clean ourselves up and delouse ourselves and we lived there. </sentence><sentence id="1013">I lived in Tashkent for about nine months working on that machine, which even though there was hunger and not enough food, but I survived in that place. </sentence><sentence id="1014">Before I got the job, I was sleeping in Tashkent on the railway station where every morning hundreds of people died, they took out, they found in the morning. </sentence><sentence id="1015">They used to clean up the station, they found dead people from typhoid that they used to pick him up and just throw him on the wagon. </sentence><sentence id="1016">These were all refugees, and I couldn't live like that, that's why I went to look for that job, and I was lucky enough to be able to get that job and signed in to Tashkent under the name of Gedale Tenenboim. </sentence><sentence id="1017">And I worked there for nine months with the machine in this factory until my uncle, Menachim came down to the station. </sentence><sentence id="1018">He passed through Tashkent, he was on his way to the Polish army with a group. </sentence><sentence id="1019">He was dismissed from the Russian army, he was wounded in his thigh and his mouth, but the Russians did not trust the Polish people to be in the Russian army so they dismissed all the Ukrainian Polish citizens, so that before the Russians took over. </sentence><sentence id="1020">They told them that if you want to go and join you can join the army in Russia which was forming up there. </sentence><sentence id="1021">When he stopped on the way to Guzar which was near the Afghanistan border, that's where the Polish army made, accepted their recruits. </sentence><sentence id="1022">He stopped in Taskent and he found a friend from the city of Rovno and he asked    him what, who are the people that he knows that are from Rovno. </sentence><sentence id="1023">Maybe there are some people. </sentence><sentence id="1024">He mentioned to him that I know there is one guy Gedale Tennenboim that comes here every morning, I used to work nights on the machine. </sentence><sentence id="1025">In the morning I used to go to the station to look for relatives, whoever passes by or who stops maybe I'll find some relatives of my mother or father or brothers or sister. </sentence><sentence id="1026">He met me and he said, he used to meet me all the time and we used to talk to each other. </sentence><sentence id="1027">When he saw my uncle he didn't know that he was my uncle; he only mentioned my name as there is one guy Gedale Tennenboim that works here in Tashkent. </sentence><sentence id="1028">He said Gedale Tennenboim, that's my sister's son. </sentence><sentence id="1029">To make it short, he went to the bureau in Russia, in Tashkent, where everybody that works in the city, not as a refugee, but if he works there has to be signed to the city, signed up as a citizen of the city. </sentence><sentence id="1030">I was signed in the books where I work and my name was right there. </sentence><sentence id="1031">He looked it up and they told him where I am, he came to the place where I was working and I'm not going to go into the details how we met. </sentence><sentence id="1032">It was quite a scene and he told me that now that I have found you, you have to go with me. </sentence><sentence id="1033">I said I can't leave the machine. </sentence><sentence id="1034">I'm working at night, night is my time when I have to be at the machine. </sentence><sentence id="1035">There are forty people working on this particular machine. </sentence><sentence id="1036">If I don't show up they can't work. </sentence><sentence id="1037">And he says never mind, he says, you're going with me. </sentence><sentence id="1038">He had a list of about fifteen people that was in a group that was going with him. </sentence><sentence id="1039">A lot of them disappeared on the road so the list got smaller and smaller. </sentence><sentence id="1040">One of the names from that particular list I took. </sentence><sentence id="1041">I don't remember the name and I decided to go with him. </sentence><sentence id="1042">Naturally, I deserted my job and I was shaking pretty badly because if the Russian , or the KGB would find me, they would probably hang me. </sentence><sentence id="1043">The next morning I was already back on the station with all of the refugees and the way I came to Tashkent and the next morning there was a train going to this particular spot of Guzar near the Afghanistan border where the Polish were recruiting members to go to England from Russia. </sentence><sentence id="1044">And I went with him and took one of the names on that list that he had. </sentence><sentence id="1045">And on the way there was, they call it an ablava the Russian were checking all the people on that station and checking their passports, their names. </sentence><sentence id="1046">All my passports, all my documents, all the pictures that I had with me I had to destroy at that particular station. </sentence><sentence id="1047">I went into the toilet, threw out all my pictures of my family, of my brothers, whatever I had with me, my parents, all documents under the name of Tenenboim, all my passports, and my documents that I had and I had to destroy because I was sort of a deserter from this particular work place and that was the end of my name Tenenboim. </sentence><sentence id="1048">From there on I took the name what was on that paper, I don't remember the name because it was a very short time and we went to Cuzar. </sentence><sentence id="1049">And when I came to Cuzar with my uncle to sign up to the Polish army to fight the Germans from the English side. </sentence><sentence id="1050">It was supposed to take all the Polish people. </sentence><sentence id="1051">Bring them to sort of Palestine, from Palestine they took them back to England and fight from maybe down there. </sentence><sentence id="1052">I don't know what the English were going to do with them, but help the English people fight Germany. </sentence><sentence id="1053">And we wanted to sign up. </sentence><sentence id="1054">When they took me for a medical examination, which they undressed us completely. </sentence><sentence id="1055">At that particular point in Cuzar I was rejected because they found out that I was circumcised and I am Jewish, not Polish even though I spoke Polish and my uncle spoke Polish and we were born in Poland, but because we were Jewish they didn't accept us. </sentence><sentence id="1056">And they gave me a document, in Polish it was written . </sentence><sentence id="1057">They gave me a document under the name of Grisorus which was the original name of my uncle, and I said I am Grisorus and the accepted it, they made me Grisorus and since then I was Grisorus. </sentence><sentence id="1058">And I had to leave. </sentence><sentence id="1059">They didn't accept me or my uncle. </sentence><sentence id="1060">From that point on the Russians had to go back to Russia, stay in Russia and they, because I was a Polish born person, they took me to different places of work, camp. </sentence><sentence id="1061">They called it . </sentence><sentence id="1062">That was work, it was an army sort of, out of civilians that were not labor, that were not taken to the Russian army because we were Polish citizens and they only took us from one camp to another camp and they shipped us to places of work like farms where they needed    workers and all kind of different places,
