<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="307">A: -- oh, sorry, from the fifth of May, I think to the 20" of May. </sentence><sentence id="308">And by the 20" of May, we knew that we were -- we were going to be left with any number of abandoned children, or lost children, or orphan children. </sentence><sentence id="309">And we set up again, because all these people, you know, all these backers of the Auxiliaire Sociale, lucky they were very rich, and many of them had castles in various corners of -- of France and we got a series of castles -- part of castles put at our disposal for them -- for starting children's centers. </sentence><sentence id="310">And I took 16 kids on -- I can't remember the date, but it was the end of May, before the Germans came into Paris, just before to -- to Villandry, which was one of the great chateaux of the Loire, and belonged to Isabelle de la Bouillerie, or rather her mother, who was American. </sentence><sentence id="311">Ann Crawford -- I can't remember what her se -- second name was. </sentence><sentence id="312">Anyway, she had married this Spaniard, who owned this wonderful castle. </sentence><sentence id="313">And they gave us the stables, and they had -- before we came they had some of the castle workers, you know, put beds, iron bedsteads and mattresses into -- and upstairs, they had actually in the stables, I don't know why. </sentence><sentence id="314">And this is where we had our children's center. </sentence><sentence id="315">And actually we ended up with I think 20 or 21 children. </sentence><sentence id="316">So that was all right, it was -- it was a very -- you know, it was a -- it was certainly for me an incredible lesson when the Germans arrived, and I adore the French. </sentence><sentence id="317">I mean, I was so pro-French, for no reason. </sentence><sentence id="318">I mean, I had nothing to fear with the Germans, and I had no reason to dislike the Germans, except what I had heard, all these elegant people around my mother say -- some of them -- some of them of course were Jews, because you know, most of the -- most of the theater people really were Jewish, and -- and most of -- my mother was -- had a lot of newspaper friends, there were a lot of Jews. </sentence><sentence id="319">And so I -- I certainly heard in ma -- my subconscious I heard more things than in my conscious, but I had a real dislike for the Germans, which when they actually came into France, I couldn't find a reason for. </sentence><sentence id="320">They were very nice when they came to France. </sentence><sentence id="321">They were very nice to the French. </sentence><sentence id="322">They were absolutely charming to me. </sentence><sentence id="323">You know, I had a -- a -- a -- I was introduced by Isabelle, of course it was not beyond making use of whatever she could make use of, so she introduced me with my father's title, which of course didn't give me anything at all, but she invented one. </sentence><sentence id="324">So -- because the -- in Hungary the daughter of a count has no title. </sentence><sentence id="325">So -- but I very quickly became countess, and they absolutely adored that, they loved this little Hungarian countess, you know, who spoke perfect German -- Viennese German at that, Volksdeutsch with a [indecipherable] art, you know, loved it -- if you understand that. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="582">A: Well yes, that was -- that was -- that was the one I wrote in fact, the -- it's -- that was really shocking. </sentence><sentence id="583">I mean, we were walking -- it was actually not coming from school, we were going for a walk, and I think, I honestly think it was a Saturday, but I'm not sure, because w-we would have been in school. </sentence><sentence id="584">Or maybe it was the 14", no I think it was on the 14", it's before the school reopened. </sentence><sentence id="585">That's it, of course. </sentence><sentence id="586">And he -- she and I went for a walk through the innerashtatsa -- through the inner city, you know where -- which is where I lived. </sentence><sentence id="587">She didn't, in fact, she lived in the fourth district, but she came and w-we -- we were always together, so we went for this walk. </sentence><sentence id="588">And we were walking along the Graben, which is a beautiful, beautiful street, right -- you know, it's right in the center, it was two minutes from where I lived. </sentence><sentence id="589">And -- and we saw this -- this -- this group of laughing people, and there were two -- two Germans -- I mean, or maybe they weren't, maybe they were Austrians, but they were in uniform, black uniforms with, you know, swastika arm bands. </sentence><sentence id="590">And we made our way through this crowd, there were probably about 50 - 60 people, a lot of people. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="601">Q: Mm. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="603">A: So we couldn't see anything from -- from outside that circle, but we made our way through, and -- and there we saw these -- this -- this group of --

</sentence><sentence id="616">What are you doing there?" </sentence><sentence id="617">I said, "Did -- did you realize that one of these men -- I mean, I don't know who the others are, but one of

said, "No, but what does that got to do with it?" </sentence><sentence id="621">And -- but Elfie was much more effective than I, because I was rather dumpy little girl. </sentence><sentence id="622">1 mean, I was not ugly, but I was dumpy, you know. </sentence><sentence id="623">I was not a beauty at all. </sentence><sentence id="624">She was a raving beauty. </sentence><sentence id="625">She was a

wonderful voice, and she had -- really she was working extremely hard at the seminar on her voice, because she had this beautiful singing voice, too. </sentence><sentence id="633">And so they -- they really -- they -- she -- they all knew she was going to be a star. </sentence><sentence id="634">I mean, there was just no doubt, she was so beautiful, you know, and talented, I mean she was talented. </sentence><sentence id="635">She was not a great dr-dramatic talent, but oh, wonderful personality. </sentence><sentence id="636">And do you know, it was really the most extraordinary thing that you can imagine. </sentence><sentence id="637">All these people who've been around there laughing, you know, and -- and -- was disgusting, it was a disgusting sight, they all melted away. </sentence><sentence id="638">I don't think it took more than five seconds and they were gone. </sentence><sentence id="639">And then these two characters disappeared, and then there were only these people, all still on their knees. </sentence><sentence id="640">I don't know how many there were, you know, I didn't count them. </sentence><sentence id="641">And then slowly they got up and they disappeared. </sentence><sentence id="642">And then prof -- Dr.Berggriin, he was a professor as a matter of fact, Dr. Berggriin came up to us, with his wife, he -- which I now realize that was his wife, little woman, little round woman. </sentence><sentence id="643">Oh, her face, you know, was just so exhausted, and so frightened. </sentence><sentence id="644">And he said in a very severe voice, ""You must never do this again, never. </sentence><sentence id="645">It is very dangerous for you." </sentence><sentence id="646">And then I found out they killed him, later. </sentence><sentence id="647">They killed him in Sobibor in "43. </sentence><sentence id="648">And her, no doubt, I mean I -- you know, I only found this out much later, but that was absolutely terrible, and of course it stayed with us. </sentence><sentence id="649">Elfie too. </sentence><sentence id="650">You know, Elfie, too, I mean I left and then I -- but Elfie and I remained in correspondence for a long time, until she really didn't dare to write any more. </sentence><sentence id="651">But she -- she really loathed them. </sentence><sentence id="652">She loathed them also partly because she found out that her father had been an illegal Nazi, and -- and he had told her, the day before this happened, on the 13" of March, my birthday, he had told her that -- or was it even on the 12", at dinnertime, he said that she was never to talk to any Jew again, and that all these s-sou -- Saujuden they called them, they would all be taken care of, or whatever, you know, eliminated. </sentence><sentence id="653">And she told me this. </sentence><sentence id="654">She was in despair. </sentence><sentence id="655">She was really in despair, because we loved all these teachers, you see. </sentence><sentence id="656">They were very important to us, I mean they were our lives. </sentence><sentence id="657">They were very important people in Vienna, but it was not because of that we loved them. </sentence><sentence id="658">They were -- even those -- I mean there was one who was actu -- actually really disliked by everybody except me. </sentence><sentence

</sentence><sentence id="661">He wrote really wonderful novels, which I had read all his novels, so I liked him already for that. </sentence><sentence id="662">And then for some or other reason he liked me, I don't know why, but he did, because I really was not a -- I was not a -- well, I mean there were very talented people at the -- you know f-for -- for acting at the -- at the school, and I was not one of the most talented ones. </sentence><sentence id="663">I was not without talent, but I was not -- you know, I would never have been a great actress. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="751">Q: Tell me -- </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="752">A: I returned with UNRRA. </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="753">Q: You returned with UNRRA. </sentence><sentence id="754">Tell me what you did with them, and where you were, and so on. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="757">A: Well, I returned for the purpose of serving in displaced person's camps. </sentence><sentence id="758">They needed people with languages, and of course they needed to -- they were very keen to have somebody who already had experience with children -- with children such as the children I had taken care of in    France. </sentence><sentence id="759">And so I -- I was sent -- I was engaged as a -- as an assistant, because I was young, an assistant child welfare officer. </sentence><sentence id="760">I then became a -- you know, I was promoted, but I went there in a rather junior position, and I'm trying to think where my first assignment was. </sentence><sentence id="761">Yes, my first assignment -- well, I was first, as a matter of fact, my very first assignment was in Dachau, which was quite a shock because I'd -- I didn't realize that that would be my first assignment. </sentence><sentence id="762">We were all -- we all went first to a t -- a -- a city called Karlsruhe, which was the -- the western allied headquarters for UNRRA. </sentence><sentence id="763">And a huge, huge sort of -- oh, it was this -- you know, former I don't know what it was, but hundreds of barracks and things, and -- and that's where we all stayed for awhile, had various lessons in this and that, and orientation, and then were assigned from there. </sentence><sentence id="764">And to my great surprise, I was called in and I was told that I was going to Dachau. </sentence><sentence id="765">And I said, "But there are no children in Dachau." </sentence><sentence id="766">And the -- the woman who was talking to me, she said, "I'm afraid you're going to have a rather shocking surprise." </sentence><sentence id="767">Which I did. </sentence><sentence id="768">I really did have a shocking surprise, because there were a lot of children. </sentence><sentence id="769">Of course, Dachau was not -- you know, Dachau is much misunderstood in the -- in the literature, and by historians. </sentence><sentence id="770">Dachau, as you probably know, was the fi -- I shouldn't be addressing you, but anyway, Dachau was the first concentration camp the Nazis opened, and it was purely a political camp. </sentence><sentence id="771">It was for -- it was intended for German political prisoners, and some cr -- and some criminal prisoners, who usually became, in fact, the kapos. </sentence><sentence id="772">It was not intended for Jews at all. </sentence><sentence id="773">And later it was represented as an extermination camp, which it never was. </sentence><sentence id="774">I have just read a -- a completely new book, which in fact has not yet been published, but is about to be published in three weeks in America, and it still has this presentation of it, which is really a great shame. </sentence><sentence id="775">This is particularly in America that they misrepresented. </sentence><sentence id="776">It is as if it's a need, always to associate, you know, the Nazis with the crime against the Jews. </sentence><sentence id="777">Now, of course, all of us who write, up to a point, have to do this, because it was the worst thing they did, and you cannot not do it. </sentence><sentence id="778">But if you do that exclusively, then you are misrepresenting history. </sentence><sentence id="779">And you're misrepresenting what Hitler was, what his plan was, what the whole thing was, and why the danger was so enormous, you know, for the whole of Europe, or the world. </sentence><sentence id="780">I mean, the death of the Jews was the worst thing, of course, and the factory killings, and -- but it was -- basically it was a part of a huge geopolitical program which really the -- most of the world doesn't know because it has so focused on that one part of it. </sentence><sentence id="781">And it's understandable, I mean, emotion is understandable, but historically it's wrong. </sentence><sentence id="782">Anyway, so when I came to Dachau, there was -- there were all these kids. </sentence><sentence id="783">And there were two groups of kids, which is also extremely interesting. </sentence><sentence id="784">There were the child -- there were no Jewish children, virtually no Jewish children. </sentence><sentence id="785">Maybe one or two somewhere, but this was not -- you know, the Jewish children -- no, there were more than one or two, there were -- there were a few, but it was -- there -- that was the easiest. </sentence><sentence id="786">They brought in -- UNRRA had a -- had a special issue, like a special division for taking care of -- of Jews who survived the Nazis, and they very sensibly assigned to this, or made responsible for this division, Jewish UNRRA officials. </sentence><sentence id="787">I mean, it was the right thing to do, because they understood better, and they can deal with it better, and they could -- and they would be accepted much better by these victims. </sentence><sentence id="788">And so this is what happened. </sentence><sentence id="789">So in Dachau too, within da -- I mean, I came there very soon after it was -- after the Americans arrived. </sentence><sentence id="790">I mean, really within days. </sentence><sentence id="791">And within -- again within days, some of UNRRA officers arrived, who took away the Jewish children. </sentence><sentence id="792">That was -- you know, that was wonderfully organized. </sentence><sentence id="793">So I was left with another -- with another UNRRA. </sentence><sentence id="794">I think she was -- I think she was a higher rank than I. But anyway, we were friends, though, and oh became -- had become friends. </sentence><sentence id="795">And we put in -- were in charge of these children. </sentence><sentence id="796">And you have -- these were all on the one hand, children whose parents had been brought into -- into Germany as forced laborers. </sentence><sentence id="797">So they were mostly Polish and Russian children. </sentence><sentence id="798">They spoke no German, they spoke Polish and Russian, and a few words of German here and there. </sentence><sentence id="799">Some Czech children, but mostly, as I say, it was eastern European children, who had either been brought in by themselves, or they had been brought in after their parents had been taken in with them. </sentence><sentence id="800">Because in quite many -- in quite a few cases, the Nazis brought in people from eastern Europe to work in Germany, letting them take their smaller children. </sentence><sentence id="801">In quite a few cases, not -- not -- not -- not -- it was not a rarity. </sentence><sentence id="802">So we were landed with quite a few quite young children, who couldn't speak [indecipherable] the girl who was -- sorry, the girl who was with me was of Polish descent, an American of Polish descent. </sentence><sentence id="803">She spoke Polish, which was a great help. </sentence><sentence id="804">Anyway, so that was one group, and the other group were German children. </sentence><sentence id="805">And they were the children of the 20" of July German officers, who had been in the assassination plan against Hitler. </sentence><sentence id="806">This was an extraordinary thing, because here you had these German children, who had gone to elite schools, you know, who were very, very German children. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="860">Q: Mm. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="862">A: They were all absolutely beautiful, almost -- almost all of them. </sentence><sentence id="863">And they were living with children who they had been taught to despise, from countries they had been taught to hate. </sentence><sentence id="864">And they were really very dependent on these children, because you know, where the children were older, they were put in charge of the groups, I mean, they had group leaders and so on. </sentence><sentence id="865">And they had no German group leaders. </sentence><sentence id="866">Of course not. </sentence><sentence id="867">Can you imagine the Americans allowing German group leaders? </sentence><sentence id="868">No sir, not even amongst children. </sentence><sentence id="869">End of Tape One, Side B    Beginning of Tape Two, Side A </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="883">A: So in fact it became very soon one of my great problems because, I mean, I was only there for two and a half weeks, but I was told from the beginning that I had no responsibility for the German children. </sentence><sentence id="884">Well this, of course, was ridiculous. </sentence><sentence id="885">I mean, to me it was ridiculous. </sentence><sentence id="886">You couldn't -- I mean, this was a terrible place, because while it had been intended for -- as I told wa -- told you before, what -- what -- what it was intended for by the Germans originally, but over the last -- over the last six months of the war, as the war turned against the Germans, they walked people from the eastern camps, including Auschwitz and so on, they walked them all the way down to -- to -- to southern Germany. </sentence><sentence id="887">And this camp, Dachau, which was meant for -- I cannot remember really how many, but certainly not more than five to eight thousand, and when I came there, there were 30,000. </sentence><sentence id="888">So I mean, it was just absolutely appalling, and impossible for the inmates, you know, to keep it clean. </sentence><sentence id="889">I mean, you ca -- if you -- i -- i -- one has to imagine, for instance, the hygienic possibilities, which really were perfectly all right, I'm sure, when they started this thing. </sentence><sentence id="890">Cause they were very hot on hygien -- hygienic matters, the Germans, and -- and you know the -- one could see -- I could see ho -- what there was originally. </sentence><sentence id="891">I mean, there were enough loos, certainly, for 5,000 prisoners, and certainly enough ablution, as they called it. </sentence><sentence id="892">It was just sort of -- oh, well it was taps, with water. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="903">Q: Right. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="905">A: But you know, with the -- lots of them. </sentence><sentence id="906">And certainly enough for five thousand people to wash, but not 30,000. </sentence><sentence id="907">It was impossible. </sentence><sentence id="908">And it was impossible to keep the loos ti -- clean. </sentence><sentence id="909">It was absolutely impossible, particularly as most of them had diarrhea, and all kinds of nasty things. </sentence><sentence id="910">So it was a terrible place when we got there, really terrible. </sentence><sentence id="911">And there wasn't very much we could do except what really our job was, which was to get the children out. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="920">Q: Sure. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="922">A: Our job, our -- this was our -- we were commissioned to do this, to get the children out, into UNRRA installations, which were being -- were just being opened. </sentence><sentence id="923">I mean, it was completely new, you see. </sentence><sentence id="924">But w-w-we did, we -- we got, in these two and a half weeks, which were all we were allowed, we -- we did get, probably about a thousand children out. </sentence><sentence id="925">And we couldn't get the German children out. </sentence><sentence id="926">We were told this was the business of the German Red Cross, and it was -- well, I had terrible fights with the Americans about this, because it was the German Red Cross, but they wouldn't allow the German Red Cross into Dachau. </sentence><sentence id="927">This was the sort of thing that happened there, and so it was a -- you know, it was a -- a -- a total impossibility, the little German children could not be taken care of. </sentence><sentence id="928">So of course we took care of them. </sentence><sentence id="929">I mean, of course we did, against -- you know, against -- but we couldn't get them out. </sentence><sentence id="930">That was impossible. </sentence><sentence id="931">So when we left, having transported, or having arranged for transport for these about thousand children, w-we saw behind us these German children. </sentence><sentence id="932">There weren't that many, I mean, there were probably about a hundred. </sentence><sentence id="933">A hundred is a hundred, you know. </sentence><sentence id="934">And there was no food. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="950">A: Well their -- they were -- that was -- I mean, we did organize that, of course. </sentence><sentence id="951">I mean, by that time they had -- there had been emergency -- the Americans were very good about that, they helped UNRRA to set up emergency camps, and there were four, I think, by that time, four children's camps which had been set up with American troops partly in charge, and partly UNRRA officials who -- for whom this was a completely new job. </sentence><sentence id="952">I mean, all of them, but -- have come from London, or -- or Washington, as I did, totally inexperienced in all this, most of them. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="991"> had been teachers in their lives. </sentence><sentence id="992">Had -- there were two doctors, you know, we had all -- we had -- we had several who had been professional officers. </sentence><sentence id="993">In fact one of them became the head of the -- of the DP camp, in the end. </sentence><sentence id="994">I mean, the -- the DP head -- there was always a DP hierarchy. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="999">Q: Mm-hm. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1001">A: You established that, and you were above it, but I mean, basically you weren't. </sentence><sentence id="1002">I mean, they did it. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1005">Q: Right. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1007">A: You just were there to -- to help them with any, really, bureaucratic problem. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1009">Q: Mm. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1011">A: Talso did do some -- you know, some welfare work, because I had -- I'd -- I'd trained to do this, you know, and -- and of course I loved doing it, particularly with the children, I mean children -- there were problems with the children, as you can imagine, I mean they were -- they were -- they were alone, they -- they didn't know where their parents were, they -- I mean, they were homesick, they were th -- million things. </sentence><sentence id="1012">But no, I was not shocked, it was -- it was a -- this is really what I meant in -- I wrote in one of my books that -- that certainly what happened in UNRRA, and what I saw and learned there, was the most valuable experience of my life. </sentence><sentence id="1013">I think it di -- it -- it -- I think it orientated, if you like, everything that I have done since. </sentence><sentence id="1014">I mean that -- all my thinking, and -- so it's -- it's extraordinary what you learn when you are -- you know, when you are close for two years to -- to people with appalling problems. </sentence><sentence id="1015">Then you -- you -- well, above all, of course, you realize that whatever your private little problems are, they're nothing. </sentence><sentence id="1016">They're nothing. </sentence><sentence id="1017">You are extraordinarily lucky. </sentence><sentence id="1018">You know, you have -- y-you have -- I, in fact, had -- had no roots, because I had no home really. </sentence><sentence id="1019">But I never minded, because I always saw myself as a European. </sentence><sentence id="1020">So it -- it meant -- made absolutely no difference, I -- I didn't -- I wasn't -- I -- I didn't miss anywhere. </sentence><sentence id="1021">I di-didn't miss Vienna, though I loved it, but I didn't miss it. </sentence><sentence id="1022">If-- if | missed anything, probably, aside from my adoration for France, I missed England most, where I had three very happy years in school. </sentence><sentence id="1023">You know, I really loved it. </sentence><sentence id="1024">And -- and really I was extremely happy when I -- when I met my husband and he -- years later in France, and he was a "Vogue" photographer, and -- and he was sent to London -- we were sent to London, and he fell in love with London, and that was a very happy thing for me, because there we were, two of us, in love with England. </sentence><sentence id="1025">So that was good. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1042">Q: Now, unless I'm mistaken, you've said your most difficult UNRRA posting was to Regensburg, in -- in deg56? </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1050">A: 20,000 Ukrainians. </sentence><sentence id="1051">And you really have to be with 20,000 Ukrainians to understand what that is. </sentence><sentence id="1052">I mean, it's -- it -- they are -- they are the most stubborn people, and I don't want to call -- that's always stupid, I want to -- don't want to generalize and say they were self-serving, but certainly their -- the he -- the people who headed that, completely different from my Poles in Vilshofen, and the next place where I was, I also had a Polish camp. </sentence><sentence id="1053">Th -- wh -- who -- who were totally unself-serving. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1058">Q: Mm. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1060">A: Now, the Ukrainians were th -- j-ju-just -- and they -- they didn't -- the -- the heads of -- of that 20,000, you know, group, they did not care who knew it, they were the heads of it, and never mind the foot soldiers. </sentence><sentence id="1061">So it -- it -- it -- it really was a -- a difficult thing, and to think that these people came -- you know, came out of a Communist -- basically out of a Communist, if you like, childhood and past. </sentence><sentence id="1062">Maybe it was the reaction to it, because it seemed to me that they were more fascist, but -- than -- than -- than most Nazis I had known, and I knew a hell of a lot of Nazis, you know? </sentence><sentence id="1063">They were also violently anti-Semitic. </sentence><sentence id="1064">I mean, they were much more anti-Semitic than any Nazis I had ever met. </sentence><sentence id="1065">And this is something that in UNRRA was a -- was a -- a -- a real problem, because we -- you know, we -- we didn't have actually -- I mean, I didn't take care of -- I told you that's a -- I already said this, of course, the -- the Jewish DP's were taken care of separately by UNRRA, and that was the right thing to do, because they were able to care for them properly. </sentence><sentence id="1066">But there were, amongst us staff, of course there were Jews. </sentence><sentence id="1067">We were totally mixed. </sentence><sentence id="1068">I mean, we came from -- I don't know, there were 12 countries represented in UNRRA. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1079">Q: Yeah. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1081">A: And the teams were totally mixed, and nobody knew who was what religion. </sentence><sentence id="1082">But it came out, you see, when there was this terrible anti-Semitism. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1085">Q: Hm. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1464">A: Well I -- I really went because I was very interested, but also because I was working for the "Daily Telegraph Magazine" at the time, and they had a wonderful editor there, I wrote about him, John Anstey, and -- and he was very interested in this problem, and so he -- he backed me, you know, he backed me for all these things, and you -- you had to have somebody like that if you were going to go do -- you know, I mean I -- I went to these trials for six months. </sentence><sentence id="1465">So of course he -- he paid all the expenses. </sentence><sentence id="1466">I mean, you can imagine what that costs. </sentence><sentence id="1467">Not to speak of my time, but he didn't pay much for that, I've got to say. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1472">Q: But you went backwards and forwards, or you stayed there? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1474">A: Yeah -- no, no, I's -- I would stay for -- for weeks and come back, which was not very good for my family, I mean it was -- it's terrible what one does to one's family, really, you know. </sentence><sentence id="1475">One thinks that this is all so important, but of course, as I found out later, I mean it certainly -- I -- I -- I -- it was not very good for my boy, who was, of course, in boarding school, but I mean, even so, it was not good for him. </sentence><sentence id="1476">He didn't see very much of me. </sentence><sentence id="1477">Well, anyway -- but these trials were, of course, fascinating, and it was fascinating to write about them, you know. </sentence><sentence id="1478">And I learned an awful lot. </sentence><sentence id="1479">But what -- what was most important to me in the end was that -- that it was not through trials that one could find out what these people were about, because trials are limited in what they can find out, however good the prosecutor is, you know. </sentence><sentence id="1480">And this -- it happened to be the one -- the one who was involved in most of these trials in Diisseldorf was a very, very good prosecutor called Alfred Spiess, who became a great friend of mine, at last he died. </sentence><sentence id="1481">But he -- he was a -- a very bright man, and he tried in fact, to enlarge these questions, too, because he also wanted to know, you know? </sentence><sentence id="1482">But he had to find out that it was simply not possible. </sentence><sentence id="1483">I mean, the courtroom does not lend itself to this. </sentence><sentence id="1484">So this is where I really got the idea. </sentence><sentence id="1485">Wit -- no, it wasn't where I got the idea, but certainly where the idea strengthened in my mind that -- that I wanted to find somebody I could talk to. </sentence><sentence id="1486">One of these people who -- cause most of them, you see, just said they were not guilty, they -- you know, they -- they -- they -- they were acting under orders, which is true of course, they were acting under orders and they -- they couldn't have done anything but what they did, which of course is not true. </sentence><sentence id="1487">But that's all they -- that's all, really, one got out of most of them. </sentence><sentence id="1488">And I was looking for one where there was -- there was some remnant of conscience. </sentence><sentence id="1489">I can't tell you how difficult that was. </sentence><sentence id="1490">I mean, all the trials I saw, the one I found, finally found Stangl, was the only one And Spiess said the same thing. </sentence><sentence id="1491">He may -- he -- you know, brought my attention to -- to Stangl, he really presented him to me. </sentence><sentence id="1492">He -- he phoned me and said, "Look, I think I've now got the man here in front of me. </sentence><sentence id="1493">You must come very quickly." </sentence><sentence id="1494">And so I took the next plane to Diisseldorf, and went to the trial, to the Stang] trial, which went on for 10 months. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1517">Q: Was this 1970? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1519">A: It was 1969, I think. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1521">Q: 769. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1523">A: Yeah. </sentence><sentence id="1524">I'm not absolutely sure about that, but I think so. </sentence><sentence id="1525">Anyway, it's in my book. </sentence><sentence id="1526">And you know, after one day of sitting there, I knew that -- that -- that Spiess had hit the nail on the head. </sentence><sentence id="1527">This was a slightly different man. </sentence><sentence id="1528">It was -- the degree was very small, how he was different, but there was just -- there was a sadness about Stangl, which I had not found in any of the others, and which Spiess had not found in any of the others. </sentence><sentence id="1529">They were arrogant, they were hard. </sentence><sentence id="1530">They were proud of what they had done. </sentence><sentence id="1531">Stang was not proud. </sentence><sentence id="1532">And quite aside from that, he was sad. </sentence><sentence id="1533">And I thought, if he was capable of being sad, unless we find out that it's only about his situation, if he was capable of being sad about the whole thing, then there was that remnant of conscience, which of course I did find in him. </sentence><sentence id="1534">Took me a long time. </sentence><sentence id="1535">Took me a very long time to find it, but I did find it. </sentence><sentence id="1536">And he was the right choice. </sentence><sentence id="1537">I mean, I couldn't have done this with -- with any of the others. </sentence><sentence id="1538">I met several of the others before, and of course after I met him. </sentence><sentence id="1539">And -- and tried to talk to them, too. </sentence><sentence id="1540">And only one of I met, who -- but he was not -- he was just not as intelligent. </sentence><sentence id="1541">I mean, Stangl was not very intelligent, but he was more intelligent. </sentence><sentence id="1542">And in fact, if he hadn't been more intelligent, he wouldn't have been given the job he was given. </sentence><sentence id="1543">I mean, he was a -- he had an enormous job. </sentence><sentence id="1544">I mean, commandant of Treblinka and commandant of Sobibor, you could not have a bigger job in that branch of the SS or Gestapo. </sentence><sentence id="1545">It was impossible to have a bigger job. </sentence><sentence id="1546">So of course he had the qualifications. </sentence><sentence id="1547">He was a brilliant organizer, which is what was mostly needed. </sentence><sentence id="1548">And -- and he was a -- he was a man, in a way -- don't misunderstand it, but he -- he was a man in a way, of quality, in that he had no -- no vices. </sentence><sentence id="1549">He was not a drunkard, he didn't play around with women. </sentence><sentence id="1550">He didn't, of course, didn't gamble, or anything like that. </sentence><sentence id="1551">And he was not a man given to violence. </sentence><sentence id="1552">So there were four things, which no doubt the Nazi bigwigs who appointed him saw just as much as I did. </sentence><sentence id="1553">I mean, they had him first -- his first assignment, his first -- I mean, he was a police officer, of course, an Austrian. </sentence><sentence id="1554">He was from Wels in Austria. </sentence><sentence id="1555">He was a provincial. </sentence><sentence id="1556">And his first assignment as a police officer, was to become the police head of Schloss Hartheim, which was a euthanasia institute. </sentence><sentence id="1557">Bad enough, God knows. </sentence><sentence id="1558">And there -- and th-these euthanasia institutes, where they appointed 96 SS people to become either heads or, you know, or officials there. </sentence><sentence id="1559">Always in higher positions, of course. </sentence><sentence id="1560">Under them they would have Ukrainians and Latvians, and usually Baltics. </sentence><sentence id="1561">They could, of course observe and -- and see these quote, qualities, unquote, which I have mentioned. </sentence><sentence id="1562">Because already in the euthanasia institute, I mean, it was quite clear that he had these qualities. </sentence><sentence id="1563">And so he was -- he was predestined to be promoted, there's no doubt about it. </sentence><sentence id="1564">And then he -- he -- he got these two jobs, first at -- in Sobibor, as a kind of preparation, which he opened, which he started, built. </sentence><sentence id="1565">And then of course, the worst one of them all, Treblinka, I mean that was the worst place. </sentence><sentence id="1566">Oh, I don't know whether any of them were worse than any other. </sentence><sentence id="1567">I mean, the -- that's -- they -- they were places, you know, which only existed for killing, I mean, they were not for anything else. </sentence><sentence id="1568">Which probably it's -- it's too extraordinary that -- that -- that 60 years later you have the same misapprehension, or miscomprehension of these places, which ha -- which existed then. </sentence><sentence id="1569">I mean, even now, again, this book I've just finished reading, which is about to come out in America, I mean again, I mean these places are -- Dachau is conc -- is -- is described as an extermination camp. </sentence><sentence id="1570">I mean, total nonsense, you know, it's full of total nonsense. </sentence><sentence id="1571">The -- the whole problem, which has been written about more than any other -- what, any other event in history, this extermination of the Jews, I mean it's -- really, it's -- it's just incredible the number of books and -- and essays, and newspaper a -- films, what -- what have you, which have been done on this subject, and still people don't know. </sentence><sentence id="1572">Too extraordinary. </sentence><sentence id="1573">Anyway, there were only -- there were only four of such camps, which were only there for exterminating people, that nobody spent a night there, nobody had a meal there. </sentence><sentence id="1574">Nobody washed there. </sentence><sentence id="1575">They came in, they were killed, that's it. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1630">Q: There was nothing except -- </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1631">A: Well, there was a -- there were so-called work Jews, where they took out of every transport which arrived, of perhaps, you know, up to 10,000 people, they would take five, or whatever, who looked young and strong, possibly spoke a language or two. </sentence><sentence id="1632">Possibly somebody liked the looks of them. </sentence><sentence id="1633">Ho -- what do I know how I chose them? </sentence><sentence id="1634">But they chose them, and -- and they were allowed to live for a while, working the camp. </sentence><sentence id="1635">The camp had to be worked. </sentence><sentence id="1636">The Germans didn't work the camp, and the Baltics didn't work the camp. </sentence><sentence id="1637">It's perfectly true that the work Jews worked the camp. </sentence><sentence id="1638">And it allowed them to survive, maybe for a week, maybe for a month. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="1647">Some of them just survived. </sentence><sentence id="1648">And you know this was a question I asked -- have asked myself a million times since then -- not a million, but one says a million, but countless times -- what would I have done? </sentence><sentence id="1649">And all these people who so readily judge such men and women, instead of judging they should ask themselves this question. </sentence><sentence id="1650">I mean, how dear is life to us. </sentence><sentence id="1651">And I tell you life is very dear to us, and I am not sure, I am not sure at all, and really I do have principles, but I'm not sure at all that I would not have done what they did. </sentence><sentence id="1652">After all, as work Jews, they could help people. </sentence><sentence id="1653">They could, and did, very often. </sentence><sentence id="1654">They also could be absolutely terrible, and some of them were. </sentence><sentence id="1655">Absolutely terrible. </sentence><sentence id="1656">Worse than the Germans, certainly. </sentence><sentence id="1657">But my God, what would you choose? </sentence><sentence id="1658">What would you have chosen? </sentence><sentence id="1659">Did you ever think about that? </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1679">A: Yeah, so am I. So am I, because my God, you know, to answer that honestly is very difficult. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1681">Q: Mm. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1683">A: But I think I would have accepted the offer, to stay alive. </sentence><sentence id="1684">You know, some -- I mean, I've talked to -- to women, not many, but I've talked to women who -- who did it by -- by becoming - - you know, by becoming the mistress of -- of this or that -- either -- either [indecipherable] or German SS. </sentence><sentence id="1685">Well, I don't know whether I wouldn't have. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1696">A: The thing is that death was so obvious. </sentence><sentence id="1697">You see, it is -- I mean, they say now that these people didn't know. </sentence><sentence id="1698">Well, of course they didn't know when they arrived, but my God, within minutes, within seconds they knew, because the work Jews told them at once. </sentence><sentence id="1699">They had not even got off the trains and they knew. </sentence><sentence id="1700">And if -- if -- if the work Jews saw somebody they liked, whose looks they liked, or who smiled at them even, I mean the smallest thing could do it. </sentence><sentence id="1701">They would say don't do that, don't do that. </sentence><sentence id="1702">Say you are that, say you are this, when you are asked. </sentence><sentence id="1703">Behave like this or that. </sentence><sentence id="1704">They would whisper to them, in whatever language, you know, communication -- they could communicate. </sentence><sentence id="1705">And they saved lives that way, of course. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1716">Q: So y -- to take you back to Stangl, you've explained your motivation in seeking him out, can you remind us very swiftly how he escaped, and how he came to trial? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1718">A: How he escaped, oh God. </sentence><sentence id="1719">Well, he escaped in Austria. </sentence><sentence id="1720">Let me try and think, I've forgotten now. </sentence><sentence id="1721">Oh, he escaped, how did he escape? </sentence><sentence id="1722">I've forgotten how he escaped, I'd have to -- </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1723">Q: Was it with the help of the Vatican [indecipherable] </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1724">A: -- I'd have the -- well, no, no, he didn't escape with the help of the aust -- I mean he -- he escaped with his own -- you know, by his own intelligence, but he -- he -- he esca -- he used the Vatican escape route. </sentence><sentence id="1725">There was an Austrian -- an Austrian bishop, whose name I've now forgotten. </sentence><sentence id="1726">You know, it's impossible to -- to keep all these names in one's mind. </sentence><sentence id="1727">But anyway, whose name I have now forgotten, but this bishop was the link man for this so-called Vatican    escape route, and had also the means -- I mean, was able to provide them with the means -- that is, Red Cross passports, and things like this, which they had to have because they had to cross borders, you know. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1733">Q: Sure. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1735">A: And they had to get to Rome. </sentence><sentence id="1736">I mean, they have to get Rome if they were going to get anywhere. </sentence><sentence id="1737">And this is certainly what happened in Stangl's case. </sentence><sentence id="1738">I mean, he was -- he was -- he went to this, he heard about this bishop, he went to him, he -- the bishop kept him there for a wh -- a few days, to let him rest and to -- and to prepare the papers. </sentence><sentence id="1739">And then he gave him the papers he needed, gave him some money. </sentence><sentence id="1740">And of course this is a terrible thing, an absolutely terrible thing, but there you were. </sentence><sentence id="1741">The Catholic church did many terrible things, they did many not terrible things. </sentence><sentence id="1742">It's -- again, it's a gray area. </sentence><sentence id="1743">Again, nothing is black and white. </sentence><sentence id="1744">You know, and they were wonderful people, they were nuns. </sentence><sentence id="1745">I mean, God almighty, what the nuns did in Austria and Germany is fantastic. </sentence><sentence id="1746">You know, the number of people they hid, children. </sentence><sentence id="1747">They hid Jewish children, but not you f -- for -- for a night or for a week, but for months, months. </sentence><sentence id="1748">And you -- you have to try and imagine what it's like to live in a Nazi country, and to hide a number of Jewish grown-ups, Jewish children. </sentence><sentence id="1749">It -- it -- it -- 1 mean -- you know, death was always around the corner, I mean just around the corner. </sentence><sentence id="1750">And the Nazis had absolutely no reason to -- to -- to spare a nun. </sentence><sentence id="1751">They disliked the nuns as much as they dus -- disliked anybody. </sentence><sentence id="1752">They disliked the Catholics. </sentence><sentence id="1753">So, it was dangerous. </sentence><sentence id="1754">So if -- if we say, you know, that like this bishop, he ju -- he was doing terrible things by saving people such as Stang], yes he did, he was. </sentence><sentence id="1755">It was terrible. </sentence><sentence id="1756">But just at the same time, there were wonderful people who saved people. </sentence><sentence id="1757">And it is absolutely true that this bishop, of course, did not know what Stangl had done, because of course, he wasn't told. </sentence><sentence id="1758">They were very careful not to tell him what these individuals had done. </sentence><sentence id="1759">Would he have helped him anyway? </sentence><sentence id="1760">I think he would have. </sentence><sentence id="1761">Because A, I think he was a Nazi, and B, he was not a good man. </sentence><sentence id="1762">I think he would have, but purely factually, he did not know who these people were. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1912">A: Yes, because women have terrible power, you know, and if they don't use this power the right way, I despise them. </sentence><sentence id="1913">I despise them. </sentence><sentence id="1914">I think -- and it isn't, you know, it really isn't that women don't know that they have this power. </sentence><sentence id="1915">You don't have to be an intelligent woman to know that you have power. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1920">Q: But you have to have some qualities that ar -- that are irresistible, and be aware that you have them. </sentence><sentence id="1921">I don't think all women can be said to be aware of that kind of thing. </sentence><sentence id="1922">I mean, doubtless this, you know, this woman clearly was -- </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1923">A: I think that if you -- if -- if you have a very strong sexual relationship with a man, you already know that you have the power, you know? </sentence><sentence id="1924">Or, if you have love, and even if you don't have that sexual relationship any more, you know what the love means to the man. </sentence><sentence id="1925">And what the withdrawal of such love would mean. </sentence><sentence id="1926">No, no, no, women are very powerful. </sentence><sentence id="1927">I'm not saying all </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="1933"> women are equally powerful, but women on the whole, are very powerful. </sentence><sentence id="1934">And if they don't use this power for the good, their own good, their husband's good, ha -- their children's good, then they are despicable. </sentence><sentence id="1935">Much more despicable than men, who are very often quite weak. </sentence><sentence id="1936">Stangl was certainly weak, I mean there's no doubt about it, he was weak. </sentence><sentence id="1937">Which is one of the reasons, probably why he did what he did, cause it made him feel strong. </sentence><sentence id="1938">I mean, it was incredible to be -- can you imagine what it is like to be in the position where you are the -- the -- the -- the -- the god over life and death, not just of a few people, but of hundred thousands of people? </sentence><sentence id="1939">I mean, i-is it imaginable? </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1960">Q: Okay. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1962">A: Why did he do it? </sentence><sentence id="1963">And I think he did it because yes, it made him feel strong. </sentence><sentence id="1964">He knew of his weakness, and he had to be strong, because his wife, who was more important to him than life, really, could not love a weak man. </sentence><sentence id="1965">So you see, he accepted a job in the police. </sentence><sentence id="1966">You remember, accepted a job in the police, that was when he was a very young man, and he -- he was a weaver by profession. </sentence><sentence id="1967">Gave that up, went into the police, why did he go in the police? </sentence><sentence id="1968">I asked him why, why? </sentence><sentence id="1969">And he said, "Oh, you know, they had these wonderful uniforms, and they were so important." </sentence><sentence id="1970">That's where it started. </sentence><sentence id="1971">And the m -- you know, the further he went, then the euthanasia, for God's sake. </sentence><sentence id="1972">I mean, think of the importance -- how important he was in a place where they were murdering -- we call it murder, they of course, didn't. </sentence><sentence id="1973">Mercy killing they called it, which is not something that is completely strange to us. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1987">Q: Is that what he called it still when he spoke to you? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1989">A: Absolutely, absolutely. </sentence><sentence id="1990">He said you cannot -- you -- you find this in there, he wa -- you cannot imagine what they were like. </sentence><sentence id="1991">You cannot imagine when they arrived, what they were. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1995">Q: Well of course I can imagine. </sentence><sentence id="1996">I mean, I have been in insane asylums. </sentence><sentence id="1997">I have been in many handicapped institutions -- in-institutions for the handicapped. </sentence><sentence id="1998">And the -- it can be terrible, and if you are uninterested, or if you are not capable of -- of communicating, if you like, i-inside, with the -- the spirit of these people, of such people -- and you know with -- with many insane, you cannot communicate, but with the handicapped, you can communicate. </sentence><sentence id="1999">But if you are incapable of it, and only see these totally destroyed bodies, which is very often the case, well then you -- you know then of course you will think they would be better off dead, as one of the nuns he talked to, a Mother Superior said she felt they were better off bed in -- dead in heaven. </sentence><sentence id="2000">Well of course she would feel that, wouldn't she? </sentence><sentence id="2001">No, not of course, but it is understandable that she might. </sentence><sentence id="2002">But think what science, what our -- what our generation -- and I know nothing about this, you know, because I am not a scientist, I am not a mathematician, I -- it's simply not my thing. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2019">Q: Mm. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2021">A: And of course Stangl would have thought that it was a mercy to kill Stephen Haw -- Stephen Hawking. </sentence><sentence id="2022">Because he would never, never have been capable of seeing that spirit, of feeling that. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2025">Q: And what did he feel at Treblinka, what did he come to feel, if anything? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2027">A: At Treblinka, well that was different, of course. </sentence><sentence id="2028">I mean, this -- the -- one -- one cannot for a moment forget the pre -- you know, conditioning all these Austrians and Germans -- mostly Austrians by the way, who were the supervisors of these extermination camps. </sentence><sentence id="2029">I mean, their -- their -- you know, their preconditioning was the most extreme that you can think of -- which ended, of course, if you like, or it began with the euthanasia. </sentence><sentence id="2030">But -- but -- by the time they were sent to the euthanasia institutions, th -- the -- the authorities knew that they were capable of it. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2037">A: He was -- he was a bl -- I mean, I was absolutely convinced from what he told me, that he wa -- that he was, you know, even before he was sent to Berlin to talk to psychiatrists, which they did before he was assigned to the euthanasia. </sentence><sentence id="2038">But even before that, they -- of course they observed him. </sentence><sentence id="2039">They observed him in his police work. </sentence><sentence id="2040">He said they couldn't have observed me, because I didn't do anything. </sentence><sentence id="2041">You don't have to do anything. </sentence><sentence id="2042">The question is how you behave. </sentence><sentence id="2043">How you talk to your superiors, or to your comrades, or to those you arrest, or whatever. </sentence><sentence id="2044">There are a million ways. </sentence><sentence id="2045">I mean, you can do this here. </sentence><sentence id="2046">You can talk, you can find out -- I mean, you could -- you could -- you could talk to different police officers here, and after half an hour, you, for instance, you would know what they were about. </sentence><sentence id="2047">And I would know what they were about. </sentence><sentence id="2048">You know, it's -- it's -- it's impossible to hide if you are a certain kind of person. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2092">A: I spent three weeks with him, every day. </sentence><sentence id="2093">And then I went back and spent another week with him. </sentence><sentence id="2094">So all together I spent four weeks with him. </sentence><sentence id="2095">But this -- these were long days, you know. </sentence><sentence id="2096">I mean, I came there at nine in the morning, stayed until half past 12, I think it was, came back at a half past one, and stayed until five. </sentence><sentence id="2097">Now -- during which time he talked all the time. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2104">Q: What is it that's kind of burned itself into your mind of -- of what he told you? </sentence><sentence id="2105">What are the images, or the particular stories that you can't forget? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2108">A: Well, first, no -- I do -- I can't tell the stories, but I mean what -- what set -- burnt itself into my mind at first, and which has been confirmed by -- you know, by -- by many other talks I've had with people such as Stangl, is their self pity. </sentence><sentence id="2109">I mean, first there is the self pity which is perfectly justified, about their childhoods. </sentence><sentence id="2110">Every one of them had a terrible childhood, I mean it's extraordinary. </sentence><sentence id="2111">It's extraordinary, I'm -- I'm horrified at the number of terrible childhoods there are. </sentence><sentence id="2112">And it's true, you know, because I looked into it afterwards in each case, and I found out, absolutely confirmed, beaten, all the rest of it, you know. </sentence><sentence id="2113">Absolutely true. </sentence><sentence id="2114">And -- and these children are conditioned, for God's sake, for violence. </sentence><sentence id="2115">You be violent with a child, and the child in conditioned toward violence. </sentence><sentence id="2116">I'm not saying that every child that is beaten as a child is going to become a Stangl, of course not. </sentence><sentence id="2117">But if the circumstances are created, where becoming a Stangl, or something like that, is admirable in the eyes of the community, that's it. </sentence><sentence id="2118">That's it. </sentence><sentence id="2119">And -- and for Stang] this was exactly it, | mean it was admirable what he was doing. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2133">Q: So from what you tell me, I mean there is no sense of, you know, being when you -- you're in a room with Stangl, of being in the presence of evil. </sentence><sentence id="2134">You're in a room with a provincial Austrian policeman who got lucky, or what? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2137">A: No, you're in the room with a -- it's not -- that's too simple, really. </sentence><sentence id="2138">And you're just saying this to draw me out, I know. </sentence><sentence id="2139">But of course it's too simple. </sentence><sentence id="2140">You can never simplify somebody like Stangl, you can say -- I can say here is just a provincial Austrian. </sentence><sentence id="2141">Of course he was just a convincial -- provincial Austrian. </sentence><sentence id="2142">But he was a provincial Austrian who went through a series of experiences which burned itself into his spirit, and corrupted him totally. </sentence><sentence id="2143">He was a totally corrupt man. </sentence><sentence id="2144">A man who should never have been allowed again into the presence of children. </sentence><sentence id="2145">Which is what his wife felt, eventually, you know? </sentence><sentence id="2146">I mean -- and -- and I'm not even saying that -- you know, I'm not even saying that you can blame only Stang] for this. </sentence><sentence id="2147">You have to blame -- you have to blame the whole -- the circumstances, and the environment. </sentence><sentence id="2148">So the people who created this environment, are of course as blameworthy as Stangl. </sentence><sentence id="2149">Do you see what I mean? </sentence><sentence id="2150">I mean, of course Stangl, had he had the right help from his wife, he could have got out of it. </sentence><sentence id="2151">But it would have been difficult, and demanded, you know, character. </sentence><sentence id="2152">I mean, the kind of character he didn't have. </sentence><sentence id="2153">I mean the kind of civic courage that he didn't have, and also some conviction of sorts that he didn't have. </sentence><sentence id="2154">For instance, the conviction that no one person, because he was Jewish, is bad, rather than another person is good. </sentence><sentence id="2155">I mean, it -- it simply -- thi -- thi -- this is -- the moment this division exists in the person, where to him, you know, where a Russian is bad, and an Englishman is good -- I mean, this is total bullshit of course, total nonsense. </sentence><sentence id="2156">And the moment you feel anything like that, which is one of the dangers of war by the way, you're lost. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2178">Q: What was the experience like for you? </sentence><sentence id="2179">Apart -- you've said that it was fascinating, but when you open that door every morning, okay you're fascinated, and you want to know, and you're getting somewhere, and -- </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2180">A: No, but it's not okay you're fascinated. </sentence><sentence id="2181">I mean the fascination is -- you know, the intellectual challenge is tremendous. </sentence><sentence id="2182">I mean, it's a tremendous -- I mean it's like -- it's like alcohol. </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2183">Q: Mm. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2185">A: You know, it's a tremendous thing, in which -- which is -- which was one thing with Stangl where I was -- where I was -- the one thing I was worried about, about myself with these conversations with Stangl, is that I was constantly the superior. </sentence><sentence id="2186">This is very dangerous for anyone's character. </sentence><sentence id="2187">It's very bad for you. </sentence><sentence id="2188">And I was lucky enough that, you know, I had this wonderful family at home. </sentence><sentence id="2189">I had the counterweight of my extremely intelligent husband, and you know, very intelligent children. </sentence><sentence id="2190">So not -- I'm saying intelligent because you know, you feel that you are so much in command, that your brain is more in your mind than anything else. </sentence><sentence id="2191">I mean, there were moments when I -- I -- I knew I couldn't go on, and I then could go on, because that's what I did. </sentence><sentence id="2192">But -- but it was very different, of course, when I undertook this thing with sha -- with Speer. </sentence><sentence id="2193">Because Speer was not just my equal, but he was way superior to me in intellect. </sentence><sentence id="2194">He was far more cultive than -- than I was at the time, you know. </sentence><sentence id="2195">He had read far more. </sentence><sentence id="2196">He -- he -- he was a -- an absolutely extraordinary man, and so it -- it was a completely different challenge. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2210">Q: Tell me a little about it. </sentence><sentence id="2211">Let's move on to Speer. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2214">A: Well, Speer -- Speer, whom I didn't like when he -- when h-he -- Speer asked me to do this. </sentence><sentence id="2215">I mean, he got in touch with me having read, "Into That Darkness." </sentence><sentence id="2216">And obviously -- I mean, as I said before, these people want to speak, they want to talk. </sentence><sentence id="2217">And Speer read, "Into That Darkness," which kept him sleepless, he said, for several nights. </sentence><sentence id="2218">And -- and he decided that this was somebody he could talk to. </sentence><sentence id="2219">Now Speer had talked to a lot of people, you know, because he was, of course, a huge personality, of enormous importance historically. </sentence><sentence id="2220">And I suppose every major journalist in the world -- certainly in the western world, tried to talk to Speer. </sentence><sentence id="2221">I mean, it would have been insane not to. </sentence><sentence id="2222">I didn't like him. </sentence><sentence id="2223">I saw him on TV, I -- you know, I read -- of course I read his books. </sentence><sentence id="2224">I thought he was an arrogant man. </sentence><sentence id="2225">His charm did not charm me. </sentence><sentence id="2226">| thought his -- he was very suave, and I couldn't bear it. </sentence><sentence id="2227">So when he -- when he wrote to me, and then followed this up with quite a lot of phone calls, I was -- I was very reluctant indeed. </sentence><sentence id="2228">He became -- he became very atta -- not attached, that's the wrong word, but he -- he liked my husband very much, already on the telephone. </sentence><sentence id="2229">I mean, they had these long conversations on art, about which Speer knew, I mean far more than either of us, of course. </sentence><sentence id="2230">But also, Don knows far more than I, but Speer knew far, far more than -- and -- and it was quite interesting for my husband, you know, who was still very actively on "Vogue," and doing lots of photography, also to do with artists and so on. </sentence><sentence id="2231">So it was all very interesting for him. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2250">Q: Mm. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2252">A: And he -- he didn't like Speer very much, any more than I did, but -- on the phone, I mean. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2254">Q: Mm. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2256">A: But somehow a kind of relationship developed, and when there had been, you know, something -- I don't know how many weeks it was, it was several weeks of these phone calls which came in from Speer, all asking me, well when would I come to Heidelberg, and I mean wasn't I planning? </sentence><sentence id="2257">I was so often in Germany, wasn't I -- blah, blah, blah, blah. </sentence><sentence id="2258">And finally I thought, what is the matter with me? </sentence><sentence id="2259">I mean, if th -- this man is so desperate for me to do a Stangl on him, okay. </sentence><sentence id="2260">I'll do it. </sentence><sentence id="2261">You know, as vulgarly as that, I thought. </sentence><sentence id="2262">And of course that kind of thought immediately disappeared the moment I met him. </sentence><sentence id="2263">I've got to say, I mean really. </sentence><sentence id="2264">I mean, we were -- we went to have lunch with him and his wife in a Heidelberg [indecipherable], and there was this humble man. </sentence><sentence id="2265">On the telephone he was just as arrogant as on TV. </sentence><sentence id="2266">So every tra - - telephone call supported my -- exta -- not every, some of them there was this curious humility. </sentence><sentence id="2267">Anyway, at lunch, I mean, you know, there was a different man. </sentence><sentence id="2268">And I thought, well wait a minute, maybe I'm all wrong about this. </sentence><sentence id="2269">What is this man, you know? </sentence><sentence id="2270">What is this? </sentence><sentence id="2271">And of course, he talked a lot during a long, long lunch. </sentence><sentence id="2272">And talked a lot about it, about Hitler, which is what I encouraged him to do. </sentence><sentence id="2273">And by the end of the lunch, and Don and I went back to our hotel, I said, "Jesus, of course the one thing that in all these weeks I didn't think about, was that this man was the closest to Hitler of anyone in Germany. </sentence><sentence id="2274">Am I crazy not to want to talk to him?" </sentence><sentence id="2275">Don said, "Oh yes, you're crazy." </sentence><sentence id="2276">So -- so anyway, that's how it started, you know, and of course the moment I started talking to him, I -- one's attitude changes. </sentence><sentence id="2277">Once -- as I told you, once -- once people start talking about their childhood, and with me they always have to talk about their childhood first, because I think everything starts in childhood. </sentence><sentence id="2278">I know that this is a -- a cliche thing to say, and Freudian and all the rest of it, but it's not Freudian, it's -- it's purely human. </sentence><sentence id="2279">It doesn't apply to everybody either, I have to say. </sentence><sentence id="2280">Because you can have a rotten    childhood, or a difficult childhood, and still become a perfectly ordinary and good person. </sentence><sentence id="2281">So it doesn't apply to everybody, but somebody who then develops in a certain way, and has had a terrible childhood, then you can find -- you know, you can find connections. </sentence><sentence id="2282">And certainly with Speer there were very, very strong connections. </sentence><sentence id="2283">He was extraordinary lonely as a child. </sentence><sentence id="2284">I mean, the middle child of three, and neither liked by his father, nor by his mother, who liked the two at the other -- one each, you know, of the other brothers. </sentence><sentence id="2285">He was very alone throughout his childhood. </sentence><sentence id="2286">And -- and -- an-and really suffered under it, I mean, he -- he suffer -- he had a -- he had a suffering childhood, Speer, which is odd. </sentence><sentence id="2287">So when he found Hitler, of course it must have been the most extraordinary experience. </sentence><sentence id="2288">And when Hitler found Speer it must have been the extraordinary experience, because, you know, if you want to make it very simple -- and why not make it simple, then a man who had never been a father, found a son. </sentence><sentence id="2289">And a son who had never had a father, found a father. </sentence><sentence id="2290">It's as simple as that, really, except it's much more complicated. </sentence><sentence id="2291">But start with the simple things, and you find answers. </sentence><sentence id="2292">Because certainly Speer and Hitler loved each other. </sentence><sentence id="2293">They loved each other. </sentence><sentence id="2294">And it took Speer -- it took Speer all those years to understand, partly, that there was something terribly wrong. </sentence><sentence id="2295">And he never, never understood it really, until he was in Spandau, and was alone, and could read. </sentence><sentence id="2296">You know, he read 5,000 books in Spandau. </sentence><sentence id="2297">And boy, he could read, you know. </sentence><sentence id="2298">And he c -- he -- by the time I met him, he knew -- boy, he knew more than anybody else did. </sentence><sentence id="2299">He really did. </sentence><sentence id="2300">I think he knew more about the Nazis -- of course, knew more about Hitler than everybody else did, but he understood more than anybody else did. </sentence><sentence id="2301">And as for this one part of this Nazism, which everybody, of course, as you -- as you know, I think, is exclusively concerned with, Speer was never an ideological anti-Semite. </sentence><sentence id="2302">He was an anti-Semite because they were all anti-Semites. </sentence><sentence id="2303">But he was not an ideological anti-Semite. </sentence><sentence id="2304">He could manage with anybody, actually. </sentence><sentence id="2305">And he could manage, of course after -- I mean, after Spandau, I mean my God, I mean in Spandau he -- you know, in Spandau he had a -- a great deal to do with -- with Jewish officers, and actually had -- I mean, he even emotionally changed a lot there. </sentence><sentence id="2306">You see, it was a -- it was a tremendous opening of understanding of what people were, you know. </sentence><sentence id="2307">People, that it's not -- it's not where they come from, it -- but what they are. </sentence><sentence id="2308">Which is the only thing that counts. </sentence><sentence id="2309">I mean, it doesn't matter where anybody comes from, what religion, or what they like to call race. </sentence><sentence id="2310">I mean, this ridiculous and dreadful word, race. </sentence><sentence id="2311">It's -- it's totally unimportant, the only thing that matters is what the individual is, with a capital I. And that's what Speer -- what Speer certainly learned in Spandau. </sentence><sentence id="2312">So you know by the time -- by the time he came to me, I mean he was really preconditioned to really talking. </sentence><sentence id="2313">And he did, I mean he -- he -- Speer t-taught me more than I could ever give him. </sentence><sentence id="2314">He would have hated this book, of course, absolutely hated it. </sentence><sentence id="2315">He was very, you know, he was very, very dubious about what I would write. </sentence><sentence id="2316">And he was so right. </sentence></p></dialogue>

[ </sentence><sentence id="2382">tape pause] -- dubious or not, he talked to you anyway. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2385">A: Yes, he -- b-because once, you see that that's -- that of course is -- I mean, it's the secret, you know, I mean what have I been doing for the last three hours -- you know, three and a half hours, when I really told myself, and told Don, three hours is it, no more. </sentence><sentence id="2386">And -- and I have talked to you. </sentence><sentence id="2387">When people start to talk, they talk, because the point is that -- and this applies to almost everybody, as you have found, too, I'm quite sure in your professional life. </sentence><sentence id="2388">But people like Speer -- and I won't say people like I, because I don't mean to compare myself to Speer, but -- but -- but people of some, if you like, some intellect, or some -- they are not protected by this. </sentence><sentence id="2389">They need it just as much, or it happens just as much. </sentence><sentence id="2390">And certainly Speer -- I mean there were days when he -- when he obviously had had some experience with jailers, or whatever, I don't know, when he -- when it was really very difficult to get him to go on. </sentence><sentence id="2391">But on the whole, he was completely different, of course, from Stangl, I mean obviously. </sentence><sentence id="2392">But he was looking forward to these conversations. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2402">Q: How tortured was he emotionally by the process you put him through, and the process he put himself through in Spandau? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2404">A: He was -- Speer was -- I tell you Speer was more tortured by guilt than anybody I've ever met. </sentence><sentence id="2405">He felt guilty for every Jewish death. </sentence><sentence id="2406">Every one of the six million. </sentence><sentence id="2407">And he never said that, but I know this, I know this. </sentence><sentence id="2408">He was desperate about it. </sentence><sentence id="2409">The only mistake was -- and I could never, never -- I could never persuade him of this, that he too felt that that was the only thing he needed to feel guilty about. </sentence><sentence id="2410">And when I said to him, and I did of course, not once, but oh, how many times, you brought the forced laborers to Germany, you are responsible for the death of a hundred thousand of them. </sentence><sentence id="2411">This was your work, not Sowers, who was hanged for it. </sentence><sentence id="2412">He was under your orders, it was yours. </sentence><sentence id="2413">It simply didn't touch him, it was like -- as if I didn't say anything. </sentence><sentence id="2414">I might as well have kept my mouth shut. </sentence><sentence id="2415">He felt no guilt for this. </sentence><sentence id="2416">This was part of his - - I won't call it duty, but it was -- it was simply part of what he was there for. </sentence><sentence id="2417">And as far as he was concerned, of course -- and this is true, I mean, of course I checked all this. </sentence><sentence id="2418">When he found out that foreign laborers -- I mean, fo -- he called them Gastarbeiter, but hell, they weren't Gastarbeiter. </sentence><sentence id="2419">When fo -- foreign laborers were mistreated anywhere, if he found out, he took measures. </sentence><sentence id="2420">He did. </sentence><sentence id="2421">And -- and you know, he mentioned a number of occasions to me. </sentence><sentence id="2422">Every occasion that I could look into, I did. </sentence><sentence id="2423">Every single one of them was confirmed. </sentence><sentence id="2424">He took steps, it was changed, the people were properly treated, they were moved into different places where they were properly treat -- or whatever. </sentence><sentence id="2425">So, he did. </sentence><sentence id="2426">Even so, the system, it is the system, and he agreed to the system, and he supported it, and he was Hitler's closest friend, and he was responsible for God's sake. </sentence><sentence id="2427">He was responsible, he was responsible for their deaths. </sentence><sentence id="2428">But he knew it, you see, and he was -- he was the unhappiest man of all the Nazis I met. </sentence><sentence id="2429">He was the most important, and he was the unhappiest. </sentence></p></dialogue>
