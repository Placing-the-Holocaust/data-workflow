the war, this was right after the war. </sentence><sentence id="194">So let me see, and after this is Berlin. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="195">Well, here is one more picture, we call it the classic, quote unquote, because we are lined up, posed again as all those pictures were in those years, the three sisters. </sentence><sentence id="196">The oldest sister Anna -- Hanya, the middle sister Chrisha, Chris, and myself, Renia, Regina. </sentence><sentence id="197">We lined up and our kids always laugh at this picture, and they make us -- we -- of course, we are a very close family, we always have been extremely close, and -- and because we survived the war together, and -- and the fact that we were never separated during the war, which is almost incredible. </sentence><sentence id="198">It just absolutely was a miraculous thing that we were never separated. </sentence><sentence id="199">We were very close then, and we are very close now, and so are our kids. </sentence><sentence id="200">So our kids always laugh when they remember this picture, because this is the family classic. </sentence><sentence id="201">And throughout the years, whenever we have big of -- family occasions, weddings, Bar Mitzvahs, Seders, they make us line up. </sentence><sentence id="202">And I can show you though the years, I have pictures of the three of us lined up in the exact position. </sentence><sentence id="203">We have to stand, and we have to stand there like the steps, except now we are not steps. </sentence><sentence id="204">In those days one was biggest, one was middle, one was small. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="205">Now we're sort of varied in size, and we, of course, gotten so much older, too. </sentence><sentence id="206">But the point is that I

Berlin, which was a part of our -- that's where our outings wer -- took place, because we lived in the DP camp in Schlactensee. </sentence><sentence id="212">And as I look at these pictures with my friends, one of it has the bombed out church in the background. </sentence><sentence id="213">Gives you an idea that this was only one year after the war ended. </sentence><sentence id="214">But we look like real schoolgirls out for a good time. </sentence><sentence id="215">And we had a very -- I always talk about the experience in the DP camp as one of the nicest, because I was really still a child, and there was every effort made to have all the children who were at the camp at that time, to have those children come back to the life of a child. </sentence><sentence id="216">Of course, there was a school established, and -- because children were coming in at all ages, and with all educational backgrounds, we were sorted out, so to say, by age, because this was primarily a Hebrew school, even though the subjects were -- the curriculum was like any other school, except it was all in Hebrew. </sentence><sentence id="217">And basically the kids who went to that school really, truly identified with the group, even though some of the children were orphans and came to the DP camp with cousins or others. </sentence><sentence id="218">Some were children with parents who came out of Russia, for example. </sentence><sentence id="219">I had one friend, Tunia, who came from Russia, and she was my age, and she was in that class. </sentence><sentence id="220">Now we had, in

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1245">A: Oh, it certainly did. </sentence><sentence id="1246">No, because you see, I -- I ha -- I am always of the opinion, have always been, as a child, as a grown-up, that there have to be -- there has to be a certain framework for society to operate within. </sentence><sentence id="1247">All the excesses that do nothing to enhance people's life, to me do not -- do not do anything to either elevate the spirit or to elevate the mind, or to improve somebody's economic conditions. </sentence><sentence id="1248">I mean, if you have a -- an idea, at least the idea should benefit somebody or something, or should build something, but to destroy it and leave it destroyed, is totally against my -- my understanding of life, because I have seen what happens when you are simply allowing something to happen, and everything in the process gets destroyed. </sentence><sentence id="1249">Of course, the Holocaust is a much bigger issue, mi -- a million times over bigger. </sentence><sentence id="1250">But the fact is that if you allow books to be burned, and the next step you allow people to be burned, i-i-1- i -- it almost -- it almost makes you think that if such excesses, that grow out of not any specific need, but the desire to rebel for rebellion's sake is totally wrong because it does nothing to improve anything. </sentence><sentence id="1251">And of course now it's -- it's quite obvious that this This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="1252">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="1253"> Interview with Regina Gelb " March 23, 2001 was what the -- the -- this was one period in American life that as the years go on, will show to be not such a happy chapter. </sentence><sentence id="1254">It really was not a happy chapter. </sentence><sentence id="1255">I -- I felt terribly disturbed in those days. </sentence><sentence id="1256">I've calmed down about it now, because I've seen some of these -- these rebellious kids grow into very decent people, but I know that the aftermath of the 60's is still with us. </sentence><sentence id="1257">I mean, absolutely, all this permissiveness, and all that -- that followed from it still is around us. </sentence></p></dialogue>
