<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="504">A: I don't remember that. </sentence><sentence id="505">We might have, but I don't think anybody wanted to go near the ghetto because it was full of German guards, and things were closed off with gates, and people just didn't want to get in -- near that whole thing. </sentence><sentence id="506">I do remember that I think it must have been about 1943 or so, when the Germans, I guess in response to the failure of the Lithuanian -- Lithuanians to establish a--a SS regiment or something like that, began sending, you know, selected people to the concentration camps. </sentence><sentence id="507">People who had nationalistic, you know, inclinations and things like that. </sentence><sentence id="508">And a number of people from the ministry where my father worked were shipped off to Stutthof, and you know, some of them died there. </sentence><sentence id="509">And so I remember that for -- for weeks, my father and -- and his other colleagues, you know, switched locations where they slept every night, so that they could not be easily found if -- if-- cause usually when they come to arrest you they come -- they don't go to your place of work, they -- they come to -- when you're sleeping in your -- in This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="510">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="511"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection Interview with Arvydas Kliore " February 18, 2013 your apartment or your house, whatever. </sentence><sentence id="512">So they -- they were -- well, you know, scared of getting shipped off to Stutthof and so they -- they did this. </sentence><sentence id="513">And so that was, I think it was in this se-several, in the last months of -- of the German occupation with. </sentence><sentence id="514">Cause this was going on already and they were trying to avoid that. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="529">A: Well, I don't think that our parents, and of course nobody else talked to children about what they knew what was -- that was going on. </sentence><sentence id="530">Now of course, they all knew what was going on, but they were not sharing this with us. </sentence><sentence id="531">Of course, I think that my mother was always, you know, aghast that this was going on, you know. </sentence><sentence id="532">And my father, you know, our -- this was a time when there were epidemics now going through. </sentence><sentence id="533">There was a typh -- typhus epidemic which my sister and I spent a few weeks, you know, trying to -- to get to-- Deet. </sentence><sentence id="534">And I remember that, you know, before -- before the, I guess ghetto, and -- and the destruction of the Jews, our family doctors were Jewish. </sentence><sentence id="535">Dr. Gehrler(ph) and doctor -- I du -- don't remember the name. </sentence><sentence id="536">And I think that -- and then toward the end, I guess, they weren't -- they weren't there any more, so that was, you know. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="537">This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="538">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="539"> http://collections.ushmm.org </sentence></p><p><sentence id="540"> Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection Interview with Arvydas Kliore " February 18, 2013 </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="541">Q: Did you have any memories of who th -- of these individuals? </sentence><sentence id="542">Do you remember th -- how they looked? </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="543">A: I faintly remember how Dr. Gehrler(ph) looked, because he would come and take care of us. </sentence><sentence id="544">But I don't -- don't know anything else about him or what happened to him. </sentence><sentence id="545">He obviously wound up at some -- in Paneriai or whatever concentration camp, you know. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="549">Q: Oh. </sentence><sentence id="550">When did your own interest in -- in these events that people were so silent about, when did it start to appear? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="553">A: It was, I think, always there, because I knew, of course by reading the inter -- the na -- the international press and -- and some books about the Holocaust, and -- and the -- the -- the destruction of the Jewish population of eastern Europe. </sentence><sentence id="554">And of course you would -- could not see very much of this, or any of this in the Lithuanian press here in the United States, because that was like a taboo topic, you know. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="557">Q: Why? </sentence><sentence id="558">Why do you think it was? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="561">A: Well, I think many reasons. </sentence><sentence id="562">I think one reason was that the Lithuanians who controlled the press were themselves ashamed of what was going on. </sentence><sentence id="563">They did not want to mention it or to -- to -- to -- to even, you know, mention it in the -- in their papers. </sentence><sentence id="564">Maybe it would go away, you know, that kind of thing. </sentence><sentence id="565">Now of course, there were some who were openly anti-Semitic, who said that this was all, you This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="566">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="567"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection Interview with Arvydas Kliore 8 February 18, 2013 know, some nonsense that the Jews are -- are spreading, you know. </sentence><sentence id="568">But that -- that, I think, was the minority, most of them just didn't want to, you know, hear about it. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="578">Q: But why would they have a feeling of shame? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="580">A: Because they knew that there was some -- obviously they knew that there was some involvement by -- by Lithuanian people, not just the Germans. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="582">Q: I see. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="584">A: Because when you look at -- at -- I-I started researching this thing on my own a long time ago. </sentence><sentence id="585">As soon as I got my degree and started working and se -- then started reading books. </sentence><sentence id="586">And when the computers came out, I w -- I went to the web pages of the various organizations that deal with the history of the Holocaust, and you know, find out what was going on. </sentence><sentence id="587">And after -- and -- Lithuania became independent again in 91, there was -- there were publications by the -- the history, a kind of, I guess history department or history institute, of various maps have to do with the history of Lithuania. </sentence><sentence id="588">And one of them was a map of where the executions of Jews took place in 1941. </sentence><sentence id="589">And I was amazed to see that the whole map of Lithuania was covered with these places, which also mentioned a number that were executed in each place. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="609">Q: Yeah. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="611">A: So that suggested to me that were a lot more people from the police forces of that -- of the provincial police forces, who were involved. </sentence><sentence id="612">And obviously this is the case, an-and I've been trying to find out who they were. </sentence><sentence id="613">And in fact, I'm reading a book now by -- just came out recently, I forgot the name, where a woman PhD, Sutton, I think was it -- </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="614">Q: Mm-hm. </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="615">A: Sutton, yeah. </sentence><sentence id="616">And when she shows a picture of the SS officers with the police chiefs of the Lithuanian provinces sitting, a nice picture. </sentence><sentence id="617">And of course I--I--I---it doesn't take much -- I don't have to be Einstein to figure out what they were talking about there, you know. </sentence></p></dialogue>
