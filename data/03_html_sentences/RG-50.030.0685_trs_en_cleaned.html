<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="431">A: Well she -- she was always very -- a humane person. </sentence><sentence id="432">And it's obvious that it was difficult for her to talk about something as -- as hag -- ghastly as that, you know, where -- where you know, mass killing was -- was carried out. </sentence><sentence id="433">And she -- she was, of course were very condemning of the -- of the g-guys who were -- the drunks who were shooting there, you know. </sentence><sentence id="434">But other than that, oh there was -- a-and -- course th-the -- the whole drift was that we don't have anything to do with them, these are just extremely, you know, bad people, they were the -- should stay away from them, you know. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="457">A: I don't remember that. </sentence><sentence id="458">We might have, but I don't think anybody wanted to go near the ghetto because it was full of German guards, and things were closed off with gates, and people just didn't want to get in -- near that whole thing. </sentence><sentence id="459">I do remember that I think it must have been about 1943 or so, when the Germans, I guess in response to the failure of the Lithuanian -- Lithuanians to establish a--a SS regiment or something like that, began sending, you know, selected people to the concentration camps. </sentence><sentence id="460">People who had nationalistic, you know, inclinations and things like that. </sentence><sentence id="461">And a number of people from the ministry where my father worked were shipped off to Stutthof, and you know, some of them died there. </sentence><sentence id="462">And so I remember that for -- for weeks, my father and -- and his other colleagues, you know, switched locations where they slept every night, so that they could not be easily found if -- if-- cause usually when they come to arrest you they come -- they don't go to your place of work, they -- they come to -- when you're sleeping in your -- in   http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection Interview with Arvydas Kliore " February 18, 2013 your apartment or your house, whatever. </sentence><sentence id="463">So they -- they were -- well, you know, scared of getting shipped off to Stutthof and so they -- they did this. </sentence><sentence id="464">And so that was, I think it was in this se-several, in the last months of -- of the German occupation with. </sentence><sentence id="465">Cause this was going on already and they were trying to avoid that. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="476">Q: Are there -- are there any other memories, fragments of memories from that time, about the war, about the occupation, about perhaps conversations that were had about these things, that -- that you can recall, when you were still in Vilnius? </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="496">Q: Oh. </sentence><sentence id="497">When did your own interest in -- in these events that people were so silent about, when did it start to appear? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="500">A: It was, I think, always there, because I knew, of course by reading the inter -- the na -- the international press and -- and some books about the Holocaust, and -- and the -- the -- the destruction of the Jewish population of eastern Europe. </sentence><sentence id="501">And of course you would -- could not see very much of this, or any of this in the Lithuanian press here in the United States, because that was like a taboo topic, you know. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="504">Q: Why? </sentence><sentence id="505">Why do you think it was? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="508">A: Well, I think many reasons. </sentence><sentence id="509">I think one reason was that the Lithuanians who controlled the press were themselves ashamed of what was going on. </sentence><sentence id="510">They did not want to mention it or to -- to -- to -- to even, you know, mention it in the -- in their papers. </sentence><sentence id="511">Maybe it would go away, you know, that kind of thing. </sentence><sentence id="512">Now of course, there were some who were openly anti-Semitic, who said that this was all, you   http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection Interview with Arvydas Kliore 8 February 18, 2013 know, some nonsense that the Jews are -- are spreading, you know. </sentence><sentence id="513">But that -- that, I think, was the minority, most of them just didn't want to, you know, hear about it. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="521">Q: But why would they have a feeling of shame? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="523">A: Because they knew that there was some -- obviously they knew that there was some involvement by -- by Lithuanian people, not just the Germans. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="525">Q: I see. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="527">A: Because when you look at -- at -- I-I started researching this thing on my own a long time ago. </sentence><sentence id="528">As soon as I got my degree and started working and se -- then started reading books. </sentence><sentence id="529">And when the computers came out, I w -- I went to the web pages of the various organizations that deal with the history of the Holocaust, and you know, find out what was going on. </sentence><sentence id="530">And after -- and -- Lithuania became independent again in 91, there was -- there were publications by the -- the history, a kind of, I guess history department or history institute, of various maps have to do with the history of Lithuania. </sentence><sentence id="531">And one of them was a map of where the executions of Jews took place in 1941. </sentence><sentence id="532">And I was amazed to see that the whole map of Lithuania was covered with these places, which also mentioned a number that were executed in each place. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="539">Q: Yeah. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="541">A: And--   http://collections.ushmm.org </sentence></p><p><sentence id="542"> Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection Interview with Arvydas Kliore 4 February 18, 2013 </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="543">Q: It's a small country. </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="544">A: Yes. </sentence><sentence id="545">And so it dawned on me then that this not something that could have been done by, you know, couple of hundred of Germans. </sentence><sentence id="546">I mean, they had to -- somebody had to round up the Jews in each one of these localities, drive them -- march them to the graveside, and then whoever shot them, shot them, but the -- the shooters themselves did not do this, obviously. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="550">Q: Yeah. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="552">A: So that suggested to me that were a lot more people from the police forces of that -- of the provincial police forces, who were involved. </sentence><sentence id="553">And obviously this is the case, an-and I've been trying to find out who they were. </sentence><sentence id="554">And in fact, I'm reading a book now by -- just came out recently, I forgot the name, where a woman PhD, Sutton, I think was it -- </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="555">Q: Mm-hm. </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="556">A: Sutton, yeah. </sentence><sentence id="557">And when she shows a picture of the SS officers with the police chiefs of the Lithuanian provinces sitting, a nice picture. </sentence><sentence id="558">And of course I--I--I---it doesn't take much -- I don't have to be Einstein to figure out what they were talking about there, you know. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="562">Q: Yeah. </sentence><sentence id="563">Why is this important to you? </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="586">A: Not too many. </sentence><sentence id="587">I think a lot of them take the attitude that oh, this happened, you know, 60 years ago, forget about it, you know, it's gone, let's just go on with life. </sentence><sentence id="588">They don't care what happened. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="594">A: Well, any human being should be concerned about a -- a-- some -- something that happened in which millions of innocent people were killed. </sentence><sentence id="595">And so I don't think anybody can just shake their head and -- and forget about it. </sentence><sentence id="596">Unfortunately, th-things like that haven't stopped happening since then, your -- you look at Srebrenica, and look at Rwanda and places like that. </sentence><sentence id="597">I mean, genocide, that goes on even now. </sentence><sentence id="598">And    Interview with Arvydas Kliore *deg February 18, 2013 I think people have to be aware of this an-and try to stop it, be at -- learn from mistakes that were made, or -- or they weren't mistakes, it's just a misplacement of -- of priorities -- </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="599">Q: Yeah. </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="600">A: -- where the National Socialist Order simplistic solutions to -- to complicated problems. </sentence><sentence id="601">Okay, you don't like the Jews, the Jews you think are doing something against your, you know, countrymen. </sentence><sentence id="602">So, of course, you kill them all, that's the best way to get to redress the problem. </sentence><sentence id="603">And this is exactly what they were doing in Bosnia and -- and in Rwanda and places like that, and that should be something that people would no longer think about. </sentence></p></dialogue>
