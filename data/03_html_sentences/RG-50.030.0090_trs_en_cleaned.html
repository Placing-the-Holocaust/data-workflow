<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="915">A: Yeah, we were an organized Jewish community, of which I was the secretary. </sentence><sentence id="916">And we started getting telegrams. </sentence><sentence id="917">First a telegram with a few names in it. </sentence><sentence id="918">They were German Jews-- or maybe Austrian Jews, I'm not sure--that were at that time in Lithuania, and they got the visas to go. </sentence><sentence id="919">Some of them went to Argentina, or somewhere else. </sentence><sentence id="920">All they needed was Japanese transit visas. </sentence><sentence id="921">Can we arrange Japanese transit visas? </sentence><sentence id="922">Uh, our president of our Jewish community--Anatole Ponve"--was a very fine, hard-working dedicated person. </sentence><sentence id="923">Uh he ran to the police and he talked to them about it. </sentence><sentence id="924">He says, "Look, there are six people. </sentence><sentence id="925">Here are there names." </sentence><sentence id="926">They gave their names on the...on the telegram. </sentence><sentence id="927">And, uh, they said, "Well, what do you want?" </sentence><sentence id="928">He said, "Let them come here. </sentence><sentence id="929">We guarantee, we the Jewish community, will guarantee their stay here. </sentence><sentence id="930">If they need money, and the political--uh that they are not spies, or anything of that sort. </sentence><sentence id="931">Just allow them to enter through Japan to Kobe, and from here they will take a ship." </sentence><sentence id="932">At that time there was...it was before Pearl Harbor. </sentence><sentence id="933">I'm talking about 1900... end of 1940, beginning of 1941. </sentence><sentence id="934">And, uh, they said, "OK." </sentence><sentence id="935">So we sent them a telegram that the visas can be obtained at the Japanese consulate. </sentence><sentence id="936">They got it. </sentence><sentence id="937">But then the new story started, this Japanese consul in Lithuania--in...in...in Kaunas [NB: Kovno], Lithuania--who, as it was so very well written in this book, The Fugu Plan...

" </sentence><sentence id="1410">America? </sentence><sentence id="1411">So what do you want with me?" " </sentence><sentence id="1412">You must send a telegram. </sentence><sentence id="1413">Here is the address. </sentence><sentence id="1414">The organization of the rabbis in New York. </sentence><sentence id="1415">Tell them there are eight hundred Jews here that need matzahs."

" </sentence><sentence id="1439">What's matzahs?" </sentence><sentence id="1440">I said, "Look, Jews are not allowed to eat any ordinary food. </sentence><sentence id="1441">They can only eat this special food which American communities, Jewish communities are sending for our people here." " </sentence><sentence id="1442">This is not for resale?" </sentence><sentence id="1443">I said, "No, of course not. </sentence><sentence id="1444">It is for us." " </sentence><sentence id="1445">OK. </sentence><sentence id="1446">Write a letter saying that you guarantee from the Jewish community that these food products are for distribution among the refugees and not for resale." </sentence><sentence id="1447">So I wrote the letter. </sentence><sentence id="1448">We got a permit right away. </sentence><sentence id="1449">Now, another problem. </sentence><sentence id="1450">Two rabbis come in, and they said, "We have a big problem." " </sentence><sentence id="1451">What's the big problem?" " </sentence><sentence id="1452">According to the orthodox, strict orthodox law, if a non-Jew touches the wine, it's not kosher. </sentence><sentence id="1453">We can't... You want us to drink Pesach wine, don't you, Mr. Hanin?" </sentence><sentence id="1454">I said, "Yes, of course." " </sentence><sentence id="1455">So you have to find a way." </sentence><sentence id="1456">I said, "How can I go and tell the Japanese customs...uh, the guy in charge, that his people are not allowed to touch? </sentence><sentence id="1457">That's an insult!" " </sentence><sentence id="1458">You will find a way." </sentence><sentence id="1459">I said, "OK. </sentence><sentence id="1460">Come tomorrow." </sentence><sentence id="1461">And I made an appointment with the Chief of the Customs. " </sentence><sentence id="1462">And come tomorrow in your shtayim- -hats." </sentence><sentence id="1463">And [these] guys with long beards.

" </sentence><sentence id="1469">Oh, yes," he said. " </sentence><sentence id="1470">I saw in the papers." </sentence><sentence id="1471">I said, "You see, these two are very learned people. </sentence><sentence id="1472">They are rabbis. </sentence><sentence id="1473">You see, I am also a Jew, but I am not like them. </sentence><sentence id="1474">They are special people. </sentence><sentence id="1475">They are holy people." " </sentence><sentence id="1476">Ah, so!" </sentence><sentence id="1477">You know. " </sentence><sentence id="1478">What can I do for you?" </sentence><sentence id="1479">I said, "You know this wine caskets, wine come in. </sentence><sentence id="1480">Can you please allow that I or one of the rabbis will go there and open the...and pour some wine out in a bottle? </sentence><sentence id="1481">It will be a sample to the customs inspector to see what...he has to examine what it is. </sentence><sentence id="1482">But I will do it." </sentence><sentence id="1483">As a matter of fact, I said, "I cannot do it. </sentence><sentence id="1484">The rabbis must do it. </sentence><sentence id="1485">It is holy wine." </sentence><sentence id="1486">He looks at me. </sentence><sentence id="1487">He believed me. </sentence><sentence id="1488">I said [to myself], "What am I talking about?" </sentence><sentence id="1489">But I have to do it. </sentence><sentence id="1490">And he allowed it. </sentence><sentence id="1491">As I was leaving his place, he called me back. </sentence><sentence id="1492">He said, "Hanin-san, come back." </sentence><sentence id="1493">I says, "Yes?"
