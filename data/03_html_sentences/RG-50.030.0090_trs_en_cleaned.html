<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="686">Q: Let's go back to Kobe, and...

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="692">A: Yeah, we were an organized Jewish community, of which I was the secretary. </sentence><sentence id="693">And we started getting telegrams. </sentence><sentence id="694">First a telegram with a few names in it. </sentence><sentence id="695">They were German Jews-- or maybe Austrian Jews, I'm not sure--that were at that time in Lithuania, and they got the visas to go. </sentence><sentence id="696">Some of them went to Argentina, or somewhere else. </sentence><sentence id="697">All they needed was Japanese transit visas. </sentence><sentence id="698">Can we arrange Japanese transit visas? </sentence><sentence id="699">Uh, our president of our Jewish community--Anatole Ponve"--was a very fine, hard-working dedicated person. </sentence><sentence id="700">Uh he ran to the police and he talked to them about it. </sentence><sentence id="701">He says, "Look, there are six people. </sentence><sentence id="702">Here are there names." </sentence><sentence id="703">They gave their names on the...on the telegram. </sentence><sentence id="704">And, uh, they said, "Well, what do you want?" </sentence><sentence id="705">He said, "Let them come here. </sentence><sentence id="706">We guarantee, we the Jewish community, will guarantee their stay here. </sentence><sentence id="707">If they need money, and the political--uh that they are not spies, or anything of that sort. </sentence><sentence id="708">Just allow them to enter through Japan to Kobe, and from here they will take a ship." </sentence><sentence id="709">At that time there was...it was before Pearl Harbor. </sentence><sentence id="710">I'm talking about 1900... end of 1940, beginning of 1941. </sentence><sentence id="711">And, uh, they said, "OK." </sentence><sentence id="712">So we sent them a telegram that the visas can be obtained at the Japanese consulate. </sentence><sentence id="713">They got it. </sentence><sentence id="714">But then the new story started, this Japanese consul in Lithuania--in...in...in Kaunas [NB: Kovno], Lithuania--who, as it was so very well written in this book, The Fugu Plan... Uh, one of the rabbinical students was a uh a uh citizen of Netherlands. </sentence><sentence id="715">He was a Dutch citizen. </sentence><sentence id="716"> He studying in the Mir Yeshiva in...in...in Poland; and uh he went to see a Japanese...uh, the Dutch consul and said, "Look, uh, there is this Dutch colony, Curagao, in West Indies. </sentence><sentence id="717">And I want to go there." </sentence><sentence id="718">And...and the Russians, the Russians already were in Lithuania. </sentence><sentence id="719">They occupied Lithuania at that time, became a Lithuanian Republic. </sentence><sentence id="720">And he said, uh, "They will give me exit visa, and uh if I can get in visa where to go." </sentence><sentence id="721">So he says, uh, "There is no need for visas to go to Curacao. </sentence><sentence id="722">Anybody can go to Curacao." </sentence><sentence id="723">He says, "What? </sentence><sentence id="724">No entry visas?" " </sentence><sentence id="725">Yeah." </sentence><sentence id="726">So he went back to the Russian authorities. </sentence><sentence id="727">I think that's how it worked. </sentence><sentence id="728">And says, "Look, I don't need any visas. </sentence><sentence id="729">I can go." </sentence><sentence id="730">He says, "Show it. </sentence><sentence id="731">Prove it to us." </sentence><sentence id="732">He went back to the Dutch consul; and the Dutch consul [he] told, "Look, give me a paper saying that according to the regulations there is no need for visas to enter Curacao or Surinam in Dutch West Indies, and subject to the permission from the Governor, the Dutch Governor of Curagao." </sentence><sentence id="733">And he gave him that, he wrote it down with a stamp. </sentence><sentence id="734">That was all he needed. </sentence><sentence id="735">He went there and said, "Here. </sentence><sentence id="736">I can go. </sentence><sentence id="737">Here is the stamp. </sentence><sentence id="738">Here is the proof that there is no need for a visa." </sentence><sentence id="739">He says, "Alright. </sentence><sentence id="740">We will give you the exit visa. </sentence><sentence id="741">How are you going to go?" </sentence><sentence id="742">Need a Japanese transit visa to travel across Russia to Japan, and from Japan to take a boat, you see. </sentence><sentence id="743">So he went to the Japanese, and that's how it all started. </sentence><sentence id="744">The Japanese consul started to give them visas. </sentence><sentence id="745">They were standing there... You know, news spread very fast. </sentence><sentence id="746">They started going, they were standing there day and night for their turn to get those visas. </sentence><sentence id="747">First the Dutch stamp, then the...the...the uh...the Japanese visa. </sentence><sentence id="748">And this man Sugihara, the Japanese consul, he got instructions from his people in Tokyo, "Stop issuing visas." </sentence><sentence id="749">But he didn't listen to them. </sentence><sentence id="750">He actually saved the people. </sentence><sentence id="751">I mean, part of the whole picture, you see. </sentence><sentence id="752">He was very important. </sentence><sentence id="753">Why did he do it? </sentence><sentence id="754">I met him after the war in Japan, by the way. </sentence><sentence id="755">He uh...he said, "I don't think they can leave this country anyway. </sentence><sentence id="756">So let them have some peace of mind. </sentence><sentence id="757">I'll give them the visas." </sentence><sentence id="758">Now with the Dutch consul, according to this book that I just brought to show it to you--the one written by the Rabbi*--the Dutch consul had a...a secretary. </sentence><sentence id="759">A German man, who eventually joined the German uh SA. </sentence><sentence id="760">The...the... You know. </sentence><sentence id="761">He...his job was to give to the consul the background of each uh...each person who applied for a Dutch, for that Dutch stamp, you see. </sentence><sentence id="762">And uh uh he was a German; but he was very sympathetic to the Jews. </sentence><sentence id="763">And the reason is, according to this book, is he had a Jewish girlfriend when he was in Germany. ( </sentence><sentence id="764">Laughter) Another one, another angle. </sentence><sentence id="765">It's amazing. </sentence></p></dialogue>

You know, we always thought the British were so uh high-falutin"--a consul and all that. </sentence><sentence id="1815">We went upstairs. " </sentence><sentence id="1816">Yes. </sentence><sentence id="1817">What can I do for you, Rabbi?" </sentence><sentence id="1818">So I told him, the rabbi, "He wants to know what's the purpose of your visit." </sentence><sentence id="1819">Well, he repeated the whole story about being allies with with the British and a Polish citizen, etc. </sentence><sentence id="1820">So the guy was smoking his pipe. </sentence><sentence id="1821">He said, "Yes, yes. </sentence><sentence id="1822">That's a very reasonable request. </sentence><sentence id="1823">I will have to transmit it to the to His Majesty's Ambassador." </sentence><sentence id="1824">At that time, it was King George the VI in England; in Tokyo, his [Ambassador's] name was Robert [Granger (ph)], I believe.
