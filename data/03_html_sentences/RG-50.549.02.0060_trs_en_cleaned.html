<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="109">A: Okay, I like to describe the town. </sentence><sentence id="110">This was a small town with quite a large Jewish population. </sentence><sentence id="111">When the war broke out, they were supposed to -- or they were, actually, making a ghetto in -- in Lodz. </sentence><sentence id="112">And of course my -- my father, that was his decision, and    USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0060 5 we ga -- went along with it, decided that we would move to the small town, maybe the Germans will not get there as fast as they get first to the large cities, which was really the fact. </sentence><sentence id="113">And also the reason we went to Vearshmeek was because my mother was born in Vearshmeek, and she still had rel-relatives over there, sisters and -- yeah, sisters mainly, and so on. </sentence><sentence id="114">So we moved to Vearshmeek, and in the beginning it sim -- seemed to be okay, but the fact was that -- that our life changed because of not having proper living conditions and quarters and so on. </sentence><sentence id="115">So it was difficult, and of course my father's livelihood ceased to exist, because he couldn't do what he did at home. </sentence><sentence id="116">And at home my father had a factory of military uniforms. </sentence><sentence id="117">In other words, it was Boy Scouts, tha -- I mean that led to it, Boy Scout, prepartor -- preparatory military, and then he also branched out to have sports goods like skiing outfits, and so on. </sentence><sentence id="118">So we were doing well, and I don't think he had accumulated a fortune anywhere, or anything, unless I don't know. </sentence><sentence id="119">But we had to leave everything, and just move there. </sentence><sentence id="120">My father organized for a wagon drawn by two horses, and we took what we could, and the -- just went, and of course we were very lucky, because somehow we were not disturb along the -- the way to -- you know, cause it could have been easily that the Germans would stop us and -- and suspect us of doing something wrong and so on. </sentence><sentence id="121">So we were not stopped, and we went straight to Vearshmeek. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="138">Q: What were the living quarters like there for you? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="140">A: In Vearshmeek? </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="144"> USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0060 6 </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="145">A: Well, we just occu -- well, first of all, the places in Vearshmeek -- it's a small town comparing to -- to the large city, where you have -- we didn't have skyscraper-scrapers, but we had buildings three, four, five story tall, and -- and in -- in Vearshmeek, the majority of the buildings were wooden buildings, short, you know, one story, or whatever it is. </sentence><sentence id="146">So, no water in -- in the house, no bathrooms, and so on, so of course, it was quite a difference. </sentence><sentence id="147">But it would have been all been good if1 -- if it had not end the way it ended. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="148">And also, it was difficult to make ends meet. </sentence><sentence id="149">When -- during that time in Vearshmeek, I was 14 years old or so, I -- with a friend of mine, we decided to make -- organize a kindergarten, which we did in -- in my apartment. </sentence><sentence id="150">My apartment consisted of a kitchen, and a larger room where the beds were, and table, whatever, just -- but we managed somewhat, and we had a kindergarten, and people were very happy to -- to bring the children, because they were able to do other things, although their businesses and so on did not -- did not -- almost didn't exist. </sentence><sentence id="151">But still, they were glad to have the children away, so I was earning some money. </sentence><sentence id="152">It was not a great deal, but it was enough to -- to buy food, which was the most important thing at that time. [ </sentence><sentence id="153">indecipherable] </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="154">Q: An-And so you did have enough food. </sentence><sentence id="155">And what was sanitation like i-in the -- </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="156">A: Sanitation, well, like I said, there were no bathrooms, there were no -- there's no water, but with all this, you get used to it. </sentence><sentence id="157">When the water was brought in, we used our s - - the sanitation was basically almost like before, but the fact was that it was a little harder to obtain it, you know, to -- to work at it, cause water had to be brought in, and -- and they had outies on -- in the backyard and whatever it is. </sentence><sentence id="158">So that's the way -- that's the USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0060 7 only way. </sentence><sentence id="159">If we were left alone in peace, we would have actually adapted to it, but every day they had different regulations, and finally they formed a ghetto, where at this -- to this point, there was no ghetto in the city, and then they made a ghetto. </sentence><sentence id="160">Luck -- lucky enough where we lived. </sentence><sentence id="161">And this area was going to be part of the ghetto, so we didn't have to move. </sentence><sentence id="162">But many other people had to move, and what happened then, they made them move with us. </sentence><sentence id="163">In other words, we had the kitchen, and th -- the bedroom, which was a little bit larger than -- than normally, so we had to share this with another family, it was a family of a mother and daughter, and a husband, and a grandmother, and they all were together with us. </sentence><sentence id="164">And things begin to -- begin to be quite difficult. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="175">Q: You were doing some teaching at the kindergarten? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="177">A: Beg your pardon? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="179">Q: You were doing some teaching w -- at the kindergarten? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="181">A: Yes, yes, yes. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="183">Q: What about your own education? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="185">A: I started a w -- I had half a year of high school. </sentence><sentence id="186">I started -- I finished the -- you know, public school, and then I went to a pu -- to a private school. </sentence><sentence id="187">And -- but I always wanted to learn, and I always -- and my parents especially, were very particular, as far as our education is concerned. </sentence><sentence id="188">So I know -- I had a teacher, a -- a group, in group studies where I was taking French. </sentence><sentence id="189">I tried to improve on German, I was taking Latin. </sentence><sentence id="190">I wa -- anything, anything just cause I was so hungry for knowledge. </sentence><sentence id="191">And we also, like I said, we took Hebrew, because my -- my father wanted my brother to -- to learn Hebrew, so we were -- USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0060 8 a man was coming for a half an hour, whatever it is, and was teaching us Hebrew, and -- my -- my brother and myself. </sentence><sentence id="192">So -- actually -- and then I was teaching myself a lot of things, cause I was always curious, and so -- so that -- that was my education. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="202">Q: How long did you stay in -- in this ghetto? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="204">A: In this town, we were until 19 -- ninet -- beginning of 19 four -- four -- well, maybe a little -- in 1942, beginning of 1942. </sentence><sentence id="205">And at that time, they evidently wanted to -- to get everybody out, sent the majority of people to -- to concentration camp, and they had two factories over there in Vearshmeek. </sentence><sentence id="206">One was a woodwork factory, which unbelievably belonged to my first cousin. </sentence><sentence id="207">A big plant, you know, I don't know how many acres of land, with wood, and -- and so on. </sentence><sentence id="208">And they have a -- a tremendous hall where they had machinery to cut and polish, and whatever it is. </sentence><sentence id="209">And that woodwork factory was taken over by the Germans to -- and transferred to produce articles and you know, for the war. </sentence><sentence id="210">Like, for example, they manufactured ammunition boxes, stretchers, and stuff like that. </sentence><sentence id="211">So they took it over completely. </sentence><sentence id="212">Of course, my cousin and his family were shot during that time. </sentence><sentence id="213">And of course, I don't know if they had any heirs to -- to claim it or whatever it is, but that was the situation. </sentence><sentence id="214">And of course then, like at the end of -- I may wrong as far as timing is concerned, but it might have been the end of "43, or maybe early beginning of "44, where they dissolved the camp where we were. </sentence><sentence id="215">We were working there, and I- living there, and whatever it is. </sentence><sentence id="216">They arranged a area where we were living, like for example men in one tremendous room, you know, in bunk beds, and women in the other one. </sentence><sentence id="217">So it was like a barrack, mostly. </sentence><sentence id="218">And -- and we also received one meal a day of USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0060 9 cooked -- cooked food, and then the rest of it we had to organize ourselves, so some people who were from the city had brought in money, and they, since they knew the non- Jewish people on the outside, they were elbo -- able to communicate with them, and get -- get them to bring money for -- bring food for money, so for them it was easier. </sentence><sentence id="219">For myself and my family it was harder, but we survived. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="237">Q: How long were you in the village all totaled, before you went to the work camp? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="239">A: Well, we -- we got there the very end of 1939, you know. </sentence><sentence id="240">That -- that would have been because they said they were going to close the ghetto in Lodz in 1940. </sentence><sentence id="241">So we just took off before the closing of the ghetto, because we knew -- or we had an idea that once we are closed in the ghetto, we wouldn't be able to get out. </sentence><sentence id="242">So that's what happened. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="247">Q: I want to go back and ask you -- </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="248">A: Yeah. </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="249">Q: -- one other question about your -- </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="250">A: Sure. </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="251">Q: -- family environment. </sentence><sentence id="252">W-Were y -- were your parents, or was the family particularly political in any way, or -- what were your politics? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="255">A: It was -- i-in those days, it was not -- there was no possibility from my point of view, and for what I remember, for any Jewish person to be political We just did what we supposed to do, what we were oud -- allowed to do, and th-there was -- and if there -- we were political, it would have been in the area of -- of Judaism, and speaking of Palestine USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0060 10 at that time, and -- and so on. </sentence><sentence id="256">But other than that, we had no -- not much to say as far as the politics of the country were concerned. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="260">Q: I'm going to jump ahead here, because we're covering some old ground -- </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="261">A: Fine. </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="262">Q: -- and your -- your doing a very wonderful job of -- </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="263">A: Lam? </sentence><sentence id="264">I -- </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="265">Q: -- cleaning it up [indecipherable] </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="266">A: -- that's all I remember. </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="267">Q: Yeah. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="269">A: You ask me about it in a year, most probably won't. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="271">Q: One of the things that -- that we wanted to clarify was when you got to -- I'm -- and I'm probably pronouncing -- </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="272">A: Vearshmeek. </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="273">Q: No, mosha -- Moshakow. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="299">Q: One of the things that we wanted to have you go over was the attack of the guard, a fellow named Shrot. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="301">A: Oh, well that was about the same time when they evacuated us -- us from our -- the place in Polish was named Tartuck. </sentence><sentence id="302">In German, it was called Zagaverker. </sentence><sentence id="303">It all means a f -- a wood -- wood factory, okay? </sentence><sentence id="304">When they expelled us from over there, they put us all - - there was a market, like every small city in Europe, and even the larger cities had marketplaces, and they -- you know, chased us all through the marketplace, put us in rows and so on, and a -- did something the same what they did later on in concentration camp, like making a selection. </sentence><sentence id="305">This one here, this one there, wi -- which meant -- later on we found out, the younger people were left to work in the places that were still available, USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0060 12 and they were producing goods for the German -- for the Germans, and the older ones were moved straight on the trains, and they moved them to Auschwitz and other concentration camps. </sentence><sentence id="306">Okay, well I was among them, and of course, we were lucky somewhat. </sentence><sentence id="307">When they took me and my brother, and -- on one side, they put my parents on the other side, I knew what was happening. </sentence><sentence id="308">I mean, you just -- it was a instinct that told me what was happening. </sentence><sentence id="309">So, when they were running among -- there were hundreds and thousands of people, actually, because there was a great number of people that they send from other cities to our -- to -- to Vearshmeek, because they did it very systematically. </sentence><sentence id="310">Not just come to every city, and try to dig out to -- whatever number of Jews was there. </sentence><sentence id="311">But they concentrated all the Jews from surrounding areas, and villages, and little towns, into one which was little largest -- larger. </sentence><sentence id="312">And then from over there they made the selection and shipped the number of people to -- to a concentration camp, the remaining number they situated in different areas for work. </sentence><sentence id="313">And prior to it, you know, during that selection, I was lucky because somehow -- I-I was very brave when I -- when I was young, I didn't feel like anybody could destroy me. </sentence><sentence id="314">You know, when you -- you are young, you just -- so I grabbed my parents from the lo -- line nearby, and pulled them in front of me, and lucky enough nobody repla -- placed them back in the same place, and we survived for awhile in this camp for -- I think we were there for almost two years. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="330">Q: Can you tell about that attack on the guard? </sentence><sentence id="331">A guard named -- is it Shrot? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="334">A: Shrot, yes. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="336">Q: Can you tell me? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="338"> USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0060 13 </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="339">A: Yes, well you see, when we -- when they -- that was after the -- after they evacuated us, after the time we lived already on -- on a ta -- on the Tartuck, where the -- you know, where we work, after that they decided to evacuate us, and put us in concentration camps. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="340">So they one day, without any warning, without anything, they -- they arrived wi -- with buses, trucks that were covered with -- with canopy or whatever it is, and they just took us. </sentence><sentence id="341">They didn't even allow us to take anything that we wanted, which is a normal reaction of anyone that wants to take their things with them. </sentence><sentence id="342">W -- and packed us on the wagons, and we had no idea where we were going. </sentence><sentence id="343">So -- back -- what they did, they could not take us right away to the -- to the wagon -- to the trains to be send away, so they temporarily, for two, three days, put -- put us in this little area where they had the barracks built, and left us over there. </sentence><sentence id="344">And wh -- we waited for the train. </sentence><sentence id="345">When we got there, they had a big area which was like a yard, you know, and then the barracks were on the side. </sentence><sentence id="346">And when we got there, the area that was supposed to be the yard had two great, long ditches dug on -- like between, you know, six or so yards between each other. </sentence><sentence id="347">And we couldn't understand what it was, but quickly we -- we find out -- found out what it was, cause they told us right away the man should stand on one side of one ditch, the women on the other side of that ditch. </sentence><sentence id="348">And then this man that I was speaking about shouted who was -- he was actually a -- from Ukraine, and -- and they -- in the beginning of the war the Germans solicited the -- the Ukraines and give them -- you know, to -- to belong -- to do the dirty work, you know, and have sort of identifying clothes like a -- to make -- make us understand that they belong to the German army. </sentence><sentence id="349">Well these people did all the dirty </sentence></p><p><sentence id="350">  USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0060 14 work, so they were, at that time, going to be the ones that were going to execute what the Germans told them to do. </sentence><sentence id="351">So, when we were standing on both sides, the German here, this Shrot, started speaking in German, and said, "You have one minute to -- to be -- to say your prayers, and you going to be shot." </sentence><sentence id="352">Just plainly, like that. </sentence><sentence id="353">Naturally, you can just imagine what happens to -- to a person when you hear something like that. </sentence><sentence id="354">We were all like paralyzed. </sentence><sentence id="355">I mean, I -- I couldn't even move. </sentence><sentence id="356">The only thing was that my brain was working. </sentence><sentence id="357">And when I looked at my mother, I -- and I saw her -- her -- her face was white like a sheet of paper, and her heart was -- you c -- you could see it was, you know, beating so hard I could almost hear it. </sentence><sentence id="358">And I guess prompted me to do something that maybe normally I wouldn't do. </sentence><sentence id="359">I was so frightened for her and -- and they were the only ones that I had. </sentence><sentence id="360">So I -- when he finished talking, I simply, without even thinking any more, I jumped out, and he was standing us -- oh, in front of me, in front of the --

bombs. </sentence><sentence id="392">So we -- we knew about it, and we were quite aware of it. </sentence><sentence id="393">So they didn't do anything, and they had searchlights that they stopped using, because they were afraid that they were going to bomb -- bomb us. </sentence><sentence id="394">And later, when the bombing stopped, they turned on the searchlight, and they were going round

had no idea that the people were marched into the barracks at that time. </sentence><sentence id="396">But I was thinking, and I se -- and they were on stilts. </sentence><sentence id="397">So I had

indicate that they were s -- people that came from other places, that they were inmates from the -- from a camp. </sentence><sentence id="405">And as I saw this, I decided I will step out, and -- I couldn't sit there underneath the ba -- the barrack forever. </sentence><sentence id="406">So I stepped out, and as I came out from underneath the barrack, here were stairs, and where I came out of the barrack, there was my father, my mother, my brother, all in tears, and terrified. </sentence><sentence id="407">Because, what happened -- evidently they were communicating at night, and realizing that I -- my body was not in the same place where they shot me. </sentence><sentence id="408">Did I mention about the shooting before? </sentence><sentence id="409">No, I did not, you see, that's what happens when you don't -- don't have a -- a schedule. </sentence><sentence id="410">Anyhow, after they put the people in the barracks, you know, after they marched them there, the guy came over and shot me. </sentence><sentence id="411">And my head was like this. </sentence><sentence id="412">Now you most probably can still see a scar. </sentence><sentence id="413">I can see it.

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="467">Q: And how close a range was he? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="469">A: Well, he was standing over me, that's how close, and -- and he missed it. </sentence><sentence id="470">Because it could have been obvious that when he's going to shoot me, he will shoot me right -- you know, I -- right in my head all -- my temple, and be finished with it, but he did not. </sentence><sentence id="471">Maybe he was scared for his own life because they we -- started bombing. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="475">Q: And was he the only one around at that point? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="477">A: Wh-Who? </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="492"> USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0060 19 me, and hid me. </sentence><sentence id="493">And the Jewish people when they found out -- they also found out that I wasn't there, because they came and asked them where I am, and I was still under the barrack. </sentence><sentence id="494">So they said they didn't know. </sentence><sentence id="495">So they didn't -- so the Jews thought that the Germans took me, that, you know, I was dead and the Germans took me, and wanted to cover up -- because basically what we later found out, that they did not have a order to shoot all the people. </sentence><sentence id="496">And this is what they wanted to do. </sentence><sentence id="497">Without the order they would have shot all of us, have -- has -- ha -- it wasn't for the incident and the situation that I somewhat created not -- not knowing they would have shot all of us. </sentence><sentence id="498">But since the time lapsed, and it got dark, and the bombing started, they were worrying about their own lives, and therefore, all this stopped. </sentence><sentence id="499">And they didn't want to leave us on the grounds, because with a mass of people like that, you never know what they may do. </sentence><sentence id="500">So they were afraid of a riot, that they wouldn't be able to control us. </sentence><sentence id="501">So they put the people in the barracks. </sentence><sentence id="502">And then -- of course, in the morning when I got out from the -- under the barrack, I was shot. </sentence><sentence id="503">My face -- my face was somewhat bloody, but I scraped off the mo -- most of it, because I was curious what it was, and since I had one free hand to be able to move, so I -- I touched it, and I realized that I wasn't hurt badly, and I -- and I am still alive. </sentence><sentence id="504">So when I c-came out, my parents were all in tears, and shock, and then when they realize -- they all realize that I am alive, their first instinct was to -- to get rid of me somewhat. </sentence><sentence id="505">I mean, not that they wanted to kill me or anything like that, but to hide me. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="506">And they decided to hide me under a mattress. </sentence><sentence id="507">It was not a mattress, but it was straw -- to hide me under the straw that -- you know. </sentence><sentence id="508">And the barrack was a long building, on both </sentence></p><p><sentence id="509">  USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0060 20 side were bunkbeds. </sentence><sentence id="510">And here in the

minutes later, or it seemed like a few minutes later, this Shrot came, and he was entering the barrack from wa -- from one end, and walking with a gun in his hand, and screaming, "Wo ist da bestia?" </sentence><sentence id="513">Where is the beast. </sentence><sentence id="514">If you don't produce her right -- immediately, I'm going to shoot everybody else. </sentence><sentence id="515">So I heard it, and I just knew it was bad, and I didn't want anything to happen to anybody else, and my parents and my brother. </sentence><sentence id="516">So I stepped out from it, and I knew that was the end of it, and I just simply decided that I am not going to be scared, that I am going to be proud, and I stepped out, and I said in German, "Here I am." </sentence><sentence id="517">And then he grabbed me. </sentence><sentence id="518">Didn't shoot me. </sentence><sentence id="519">Evidently he had -- he had orders from the German that was in charge of all the barracks, of all the Jews in Vearshmeek. </sentence><sentence id="520">So he definitely had the orders not to shoot me. </sentence><sentence id="521">And so he grabbed me by my hand, pulled me out and the -- the area -- the camp was wired all around with, I think, electric wires, if "m not mistaken. </sentence><sentence id="522">And they -- he pulled me out and took me beyond the wires, you know, and pushed me in -- into a

</sentence><sentence id="525">And the people in con -- in the camp had said okay, this is the end of me because he shot me. </sentence><sentence id="526">Well, that did not happen. </sentence><sentence id="527">A few minutes later, they send over the -- the commander of the whole area, and he came in in his big, shiny boots, and guns, and </sentence></p><p><sentence id="528">  USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0060 21 everything, and he started speaking to me because he couldn't understand what happened to me. </sentence><sentence id="529">He saw a -- a wound right here, and he cou -- he says, "Wh-What happened to you?" </sentence><sentence id="530">So I says I -- and I tried to kind of minimize the whole thing and make it into something else, that -- not that I jumped him, that I wanted to play -- pray for my safety, and -- and he should leave me. </sentence><sentence id="531">As -- so I kind of did not say anything, I said I don't know. </sentence><sentence id="532">Then he went to the back of my head, because he wanted to see if the bullet came out through there. </sentence><sentence id="533">I had a wound over there, but the -- the wound was from the butt of the rifle, you know, where they hit me before he shot me. </sentence><sentence id="534">So he couldn't understand, and he says, "Well, how did the bullet come?" </sentence><sentence id="535">And he spoke to me German. " </sentence><sentence id="536">How did the bullet come here, and then -- and -- and you are still here?" </sentence><sentence id="537">I -- I still told him that I didn't know. </sentence><sentence id="538">But anyhow, at that point, when he finished talking to me, questioning me and so on, he took me out, and of all the things, he took me near the barracks where they had a first aid station, you know, you know, kind of a improvised -- just anything. </sentence><sentence id="539">And he took me over there and had the people clean out -- clean up the wound, and put iodine, whatever they did, and -- and bandage, and that's all. </sentence><sentence id="540">And then they put me in the barracks, okay? </sentence><sentence id="541">That was one phase. </sentence><sentence id="542">And then while I wa -- I was in the barracks, we -- we were waiting, actually, for the -- for the trains to come. </sentence><sentence id="543">Th-The train -- the tra -- railroad tracks were outside the camp, and we were waiting for the trains to come. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="544">Whatever -- what actually happened, since the bombing, some of the tracks were destroyed, and they could not come, so they had to do it the next day. </sentence><sentence id="545">So they came, everybody was gathering around, we ha -- and they thought it was a miracle, you know,    </sentence></p><p><sentence id="546"> USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0060 22 how Jewish people always think of a miracle. </sentence><sentence id="547">I mean, most probably other people, of other religion and so on will -- will kind of associate something like that with a miracle. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="548">So he -- everybody was coming to me. </sentence><sentence id="549">I remember distinctly, now that -- a -- a man -- I mean, to me, he looked like a older man, he must have been in his early thir -- 30's, came to me, and by the way he was asking me questions, what happened and so on, I realized that he most probably is a writer. </sentence><sentence id="550">And ch -- not changing the story, but -- but getting finished with this, after the war I found this man, he lived in Israel. </sentence><sentence id="551">I found a book -- no- not I, but my brother-in-law found it, cause he was working in a -- in -- in a library. </sentence><sentence id="552">He found a book written by a guy named Moshe Porrot. </sentence><sentence id="553">And he was the one that wrote about this incident and everything. </sentence><sentence id="554">Of course, he elaborated on it, and -- and stretched it, and wrote every detail of it. </sentence><sentence id="555">And after the war, when -- when I already had children and everything, my oldest son decided that this book, since it was written after the war, that it was supposed to be registered at the Library of Congress, and so on. </sentence><sentence id="556">And we looked for it. </sentence><sentence id="557">We found the names, we found all kind of things, but we did not find the book. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="558">Anyhow, but it's still there, somewhere, with my name and whatever it is on it. </sentence><sentence id="559">So -- </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="560">Q: I'd like to jump ahead a little bit -- </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="561">A: Sure. </sentence></p></dialogue>
