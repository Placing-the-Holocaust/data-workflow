<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="16">Q: You say that you grew up in the camps, and certainly, when your life was disrupted, you were about five I believe -- and then, you were about ten I believe -- and correct me if I'm wrong, when the last place you were was liberated. </sentence><sentence id="17">How did you grow up, what happened to you, who was the little boy when your life was disrupted, and who was that boy or boy adult when the camps were liberated? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="20">A: Well, we, of course, were already on the run from 1939 on, and I remember very little from that period. </sentence><sentence id="21">I was born in 1934, so in "39 I was five years old. </sentence><sentence id="22">I was a scared little boy, that's all I remember. </sentence><sentence id="23">I remember our crossing the border from Czechoslovakia into Poland and worrying that something would happen to my father and knowing my father and mother were very worried about what was going to happen; being fascinated by some of the new languages I heard -- Yiddish for the Thomas Buergenthal 4 November 28, 1995 Page 4 first time in my life in Poland. </sentence><sentence id="24">Really, I didn't start sort of facing the reality of the war and what it meant, and sort of the reality of trying to survive, until probably 1943, because in the ghetto still, when we survived the first in 1942, when they, when they dissolved the ghetto and sent most of the people to Treblinka. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="33">Q: This is in Kielce? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="35">A: This is in Kielce, in Poland. </sentence><sentence id="36">I was still very much sort of part -- I would do what my parents wanted me to do and I would be the child that did what had to be done. </sentence><sentence id="37">And in "43 I sort of began to be aware that I had to -- even though I was still with my parents -- that I had to do certain things on my own in order to survive. </sentence><sentence id="38">And then, of course, when I was left -- </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="43">Q: Such as? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="45">A: Such as, well, for example, when we were in 1943, we were in a work camp, and when that camp was dissolved, the initial thing was that I had to hide in order not to be seen by the Gestapo because they were taking all of the children away. </sentence><sentence id="46">And then what happened, I actually survived this: they saw me of course, we were all lined up on one of these fields in Kielce, and they start pulling me, and my father pulled me back. </sentence><sentence id="47">And then my father took me to the chief of the Gestapo, who was standing in front of everybody, and said to him, "This is my son." </sentence><sentence id="48">And this man looked at me, and I said to him, in German, "I can work." </sentence><sentence id="49">And, you know, it just came out of me. </sentence><sentence id="50">How do you say it in German? " </sentence><sentence id="51">Ich kann arbeiten"? </sentence><sentence id="52">And his response in German Thomas Buergenthal 5 November 28, 1995 Page 5 was "Na, das wollen wir mal sehen" -- "Let's see" -- and he let me live. </sentence><sentence id="53">This was -- I was the only one of the children from that -- from Kielce who survived that way. </sentence><sentence id="54">There were two others who hid in the house where they took all of the children. </sentence><sentence id="55">And that was sort of the beginning of my awakening to the fact that I was going to have to save my own life. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="70">Q: And in that case, instead of running away or trying not to be noticed, you went right into the belly of the beast. </sentence><sentence id="71">You went right face-to-face with the danger. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="74">A: Well, that, in part, that was really my father's doing, who, who, who had sort of analyzed the Germans and knew that you had to often confront them in certain ways and that they had great, sort of, difficulty with their own propaganda and with the reality. </sentence><sentence id="75">Here was a kid who spoke German the way their own children spoke German, who didn't look as Jewish as they perceived Jews to look from Der Stiirmer, which was the German sort of propaganda newspaper. </sentence><sentence id="76">And suddenly to have this kid talk to them, it personalized it. </sentence><sentence id="77">And I think this was my father's -- he sort of contributed to my doing what I did. </sentence><sentence id="78">He must have said himself, "You have to." </sentence><sentence id="79">Maybe he -- I don't remember, maybe he said, "You have to tell them you can work." </sentence><sentence id="80">It could well be, but it worked. </sentence><sentence id="81">And after that, in Auschwitz again, the first time, when I worked for the Kapo that, the Kapo was somebody my father had known before, because it was a man who had been in the ghetto with us in Kielce and was shipped out of the ghetto to Auschwitz two years before we did. </sentence><sentence id="82">So, by the Thomas Buergenthal 6 November 28, 1995 Page 6 time we came to Auschwitz, he was a Kapo -- quite a brutal one. </sentence><sentence id="83">But he treated his friends well, and he sort of took me in. </sentence><sentence id="84">It was a terrible sort of society, to live. </sentence><sentence id="85">But that helped. </sentence><sentence id="86">I also -- in Kielce still, I worked as an errand boy for the man who ran that work camp, and I must -- I don't know how that came about. </sentence><sentence id="87">But what I remember -- I don't know whether I told it on tape, I probably did -- I used to sit outside his office and he would listen to the radio and I would listen, and would sort of report to my parents on the news because we had no news, of course. </sentence><sentence id="88">So I became the one who tried to memorize all the news that I heard on the German radio, and report it to my father and mother and I suppose through them, to the other people in the camp. </sentence><sentence id="89">I even reported on the fact that Mussolini had been captured and they didn't believe me -- of course they thought this kid is imagining things. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="109">Q: At that point, a young boy, you might have felt angry or even intense hatred for the Germans. </sentence><sentence id="110">What was it like to work for one, one-on-one as an errand boy, and how did you cope with that? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="113">A: You know, I didn't have to cope at all, that's the curious thing. </sentence><sentence id="114">He was a very, he was very nice to me. </sentence><sentence id="115">He never mistreated me. </sentence><sentence id="116">But he was quite brutal. </sentence><sentence id="117">He would beat people if he saw them not working. </sentence><sentence id="118">And so I figured out he would do that and so when he made his inspection tours, I would just really sort of run ahead and make certain motions. </sentence><sentence id="119">He had a hat with a feather and I would motion to people that the feather was coming so everybody started to work, so -- because I had seen him beat Thomas Buergenthal 7 November 28, 1995 Page 7 a lot of people if he caught them not working. </sentence><sentence id="120">But he wasn't, he wasn't, never abused me, never mistreated me. </sentence><sentence id="121">That's strange, you know, as a child I remember he used to have a visit from some officer of the SS who would arrive with a bicycle, and he would hand me the bicycle, to take the bicycle and put it in the bicycle stand. </sentence><sentence id="122">And believe it or not, in all this environment in which we lived, I learned to ride the bike with this SS man's bicycle. </sentence><sentence id="123">You know, a child is a child. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="138">Q: And you weren't afraid to do that that they might come out of the tent and see you playing with the bike? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="140">A: I must say, I thought about it, but then I figured when he told me to take it and as long as I didn't break it, I was all right. </sentence><sentence id="141">You know, the fear factor was not -- the fear factor was one of survival and not of sort of what could happen in between for doing this or doing that. </sentence><sentence id="142">Because I really, when I think back, I was not afraid and not because I'm not a person who's not afraid, but because it just didn't seem there was any reason to be afraid. </sentence><sentence id="143">There were many reasons in the camp to be afraid, but not to these sort of episodes. </sentence><sentence id="144">I was describing to my class -- they asked me the other day -- I remember breaking in with a friend of mine in Auschwitz and in the kitchen of the SS and stealing milk, which was the first milk I had drunk, we had a cup of milk in two years. </sentence><sentence id="145">And if we had been caught we would have been beaten to death, but it sort of: there was the milk and we had to drink it. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="152">Q: Were you ever afraid that you yourself would just arbitrarily get beaten, or perhaps </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="154"> Thomas Buergenthal 8 </sentence></p><p><sentence id="155"> November 28, 1995 </sentence></p><p><sentence id="156"> Page 8 </sentence></p><p><sentence id="157"> be chosen to go into the crematorium? </sentence><sentence id="158">After all, you saw this happen often, every day. </sentence><sentence id="159">Did you imagine that happening to you? </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="160">A: Well, first of all, beaten. </sentence><sentence id="161">You know, one got beaten because one pushed in the food line, and then they swung the stick and I was beaten on my back, but nothing really very serious. </sentence><sentence id="162">No, the fact that one thought, that I thought I would die in there, that was a reality. </sentence><sentence id="163">And it happened quite a number of times, where the risk existed and I knew exactly what was going to happen. </sentence><sentence id="164">As a matter of fact, I was in situations where I thought I was finished, there was no way out. </sentence><sentence id="165">No, that fear, and that fear was tremendous. </sentence><sentence id="166">Until, you know, once I hit a moment when I realized there was nothing more to do, I couldn't escape anymore, and suddenly a tremendous peace came over me, I thought I was going to die. </sentence><sentence id="167">I had done everything possible not to get caught and there was no escape, and I sort of made peace with myself and with death at that point. </sentence><sentence id="168">But it didn't last very long. </sentence><sentence id="169">You know, the survival instinct comes right back. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="180">Q: Let's move on now to the point at liberation, and if you can, just situate us. </sentence><sentence id="181">Where were you, how old were you, and what kind of physical state were you in? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="184">A: I was at liberation, in the concentration camp of Sachsenhausen which is about 20 kilometers outside of Berlin. </sentence><sentence id="185">And by that time I had survived the death march but lost -- I had frostbite, and was operated actually, in an infirmary of Sachsenhausen. </sentence><sentence id="186">They had sort of a hospital set up, because it was one of these model camps, demonstration camps, where they would keep people and could show that they were Thomas Buergenthal 9 November 28, 1995 Page 9 actually treating people well, but at the same time would execute people and do everything else. </sentence><sentence id="187">But it was a model camp, and I was there. </sentence><sentence id="188">I had two toes amputated. </sentence><sentence id="189">And then when the war was coming to a close, the Germans decided to evacuate the camp. </sentence><sentence id="190">But those of us who couldn't really walk very much, and some people were much sicker than I, we were left behind in the hospital. </sentence><sentence id="191">And the assumption was that they were going to come and shoot all of us; this was sort of, we all expected that was going to happen. </sentence><sentence id="192">I was able to move. </sentence><sentence id="193">I had a crutch or a cane or something, so I think I was operated maybe three weeks before, or so. </sentence><sentence id="194">It was strange, after the evacuation of the camp, it was very strange but it was very quiet. </sentence><sentence id="195">And then you begin to hear artillery fire coming closer. </sentence><sentence id="196">And I think I went to sleep, evacuation must have been the day before. </sentence><sentence id="197">The next morning I got up and it was very, very quiet except for the shooting coming closer. </sentence><sentence id="198">I crawled out, went out and looked up and saw in the entrance of the camp, over the entrance on the inside -- they always had a machine gun mounted with SS guards sitting on, and there was nobody there, the machine gun was empty. </sentence><sentence id="199">I came back and told people. </sentence><sentence id="200">Of course, nobody believed that this was happening. </sentence><sentence id="201">And then we just waited and the shooting came closer. </sentence><sentence id="202">Then we began hearing small arms fire and suddenly -- so I think it was in the early afternoon -- we heard the gong, the camp had a big bell in the middle of this field, and a Russian soldier had driven in with a jeep and was ringing the bell saying, "You're free." </sentence><sentence id="203">Thomas Buergenthal 10 November 28, 1995 Page 10 </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="229">Q: In what language? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="231">A: I don't really know. </sentence><sentence id="232">It must have been in Russian, but Russian and Polish is relatively close. </sentence><sentence id="233">And the instructions were that we were free, we could go anyplace we wanted except not this way because that's where the Germans still were, so you go the other way. </sentence><sentence id="234">And the first thing that we did was to storm the place with the SS kept their supplies. </sentence><sentence id="235">And people, of course, these were all people who were quite sick and everybody dragged themselves to the supply place and people began to eat. </sentence><sentence id="236">It was very lucky for me that I couldn't eat. </sentence><sentence id="237">I remember finding a pickle. </sentence><sentence id="238">There was bread and everything else and all I could eat was a pickle. </sentence><sentence id="239">It probably saved my life because a lot of people ate and not having eaten for a long time, just gorged themselves and got quite sick and many of them died. </sentence><sentence id="240">I didn't. </sentence><sentence id="241">I just couldn't swallow. </sentence><sentence id="242">And then sort of a day later, there was a young Pole, must have been in his early 20s and I--we -- decided we were going to leave. </sentence><sentence id="243">So we just went out on the road and started moving, then we were joined by some other people, there were some women, also from -- I don't know where they came, but Polish women. </sentence><sentence id="244">And we -- the houses -- this was the city of where the camp is, Sachsenhausen, is Oranienberg, and we must have been in the area of that, moving away from Berlin. </sentence><sentence id="245">The German houses were standing empty because the Germans had fled, and often times the tables were still set, dirty dishes were sitting, and you could just occupy a house and we just moved from one house to the other, until these Polish soldiers Thomas Buergenthal 11 November 28, 1995 Page 11 came and started talking, they talked to the women, of course. </sentence><sentence id="246">And then they saw me and they said, "Where are you going?" </sentence><sentence id="247">I said that I didn't know where I was going, I was trying to find my parents. </sentence><sentence id="248">And they said, "Well where they would be?" </sentence><sentence id="249">And I said, "They would probably be in Poland," and so they took me with them. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="272">Q: Let's go back a couple steps. </sentence><sentence id="273">I'm curious about what else the Russian said, what was that scene, like when the Russian soldier gonged the bell. </sentence><sentence id="274">Did people come out and stand around, then did you guys hug each other? </sentence><sentence id="275">Was there a feeling that you were really liberated at that point, or did that come a little bit later? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="280">A: You know when I see pictures of people who are liberated by American troops, by British troops, they were liberated. </sentence><sentence id="281">We were none of these scenes as far as I remember. </sentence><sentence id="282">The Russians just told us, "You can go." </sentence><sentence id="283">There was no effort made to help us in any way, to provide any medical services, and there was no hugging. </sentence><sentence id="284">I don't remember, I mean we felt a great sense of relief because we expected to be shot, but none of that -- it was probably too, in retrospect, it was almost too much. </sentence><sentence id="285">It was hard to believe that we were free after all this and that nothing had happened to us. </sentence><sentence id="286">No, I don't remember these scenes of liberation. </sentence><sentence id="287">I really don't remember even realizing that I was liberated until the war was over because everybody started shooting into the air, and it came, sort of, on my birthday. </sentence><sentence id="288">But I didn't have any sense of the tremendous joy that other people must have experienced. </sentence><sentence id="289">I was alone in many ways. </sentence><sentence id="290">I think that if my parents had been there it would have been different. </sentence><sentence id="291">Thomas Buergenthal 12 November 28, 1995 Page 12 </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="306">Q: And when you had hooked up with the young Polish boy and you were moving around in the town outside of Sachsenhausen, did you feel frightened that Germans could come up and recapture you, perhaps? </sentence><sentence id="307">What was the mood like, or were you just sitting back with your feet up on the table in these homes and having a nice time? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="310">A: Well, where we were afraid, of course, was when we were still in the camp because we didn't know what happened to the Germans, whether they would come back and whether it was really true that they had left. </sentence><sentence id="311">But once we were out, I don't remember worrying about it. </sentence><sentence id="312">It seemed that it was over, and the fact that the Germans had just disappeared without a trace, the soldiers, must have had that impact. </sentence><sentence id="313">But I just don't remember that maybe as a child you're liberated, you're free. </sentence><sentence id="314">No, I had no sense that there was any danger from the Germans at that point. </sentence><sentence id="315">Of course, I then ended up, when I was a mascot, in the battle of Berlin, and that was quite -- there was a really almost hand-to-hand combat and there it was quite dangerous. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="322">Q: Tell us about that. </sentence><sentence id="323">First you met some soldiers from the Polish army, tell us about that. </sentence><sentence id="324">How did you meet them and then what happened? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="328">A: Well, they came to one of these houses, and I must say, it's hard for me to sort of remember very clearly, how it came about that they took me with them. </sentence><sentence id="329">But they did. </sentence><sentence id="330">They were members of the First Polish Division, the so-called Kosciusko Thomas Buergenthal 13 November 28, 1995 Page 13 Division,! </sentence><sentence id="331">which had come from Russia. </sentence><sentence id="332">These were people apparently who had been, at least the officers, members of the Polish army in "39 who were then shipped to Siberia. </sentence><sentence id="333">And when the Russians needed troops, they were brought back and given a chance to fight in the Polish army under Russian control. </sentence><sentence id="334">And I, so this was the group and I was in. </sentence><sentence id="335">The soldiers who took me in, they were members of the scout company, so we were sort of the forefront of the division. </sentence><sentence id="336">They took me in. </sentence><sentence id="337">They gave me -- they made me a small uniform and I had shoes. </sentence><sentence id="338">They even gave me a small revolver, another revolver -- a automatic pistol. </sentence><sentence id="339">They had found a circus horse some place, a pony, and -- because much of the army was still horse-drawn. </sentence><sentence id="340">They had supplies of the Russian and Polish army -- was still brought in by horse-drawn carts. </sentence><sentence id="341">There was a lot of horses, and I had my horse and I could keep up with the soldiers, and I had a wonderful time. </sentence><sentence id="342">One of the things I remember doing -- this was a great sort of past time at that point, this shows you how children are children -- shooting at things that I don't know whether people still know what that is -- the electric wires and telegraph on poles are held up, wired around porcelain, white porcelain sort of, what would you call it, cups or -- . </sentence><sentence id="343">The big game was to shoot at those things and shoot them down because, of course -- that was one of the pastimes I engaged in with my Polish soldiers. </sentence><sentence id="344">And also I learned, the one of the people who " The Taduesz Kosciusko Division, a soldiery comprised of Polish patriots under Russian command, appeared in July 1943. </sentence><sentence id="345">Thomas Buergenthal 14 November 28, 1995 Page 14 took care of me was a shoemaker for the company, another one was a tailor. </sentence><sentence id="346">And I think -- I don't know whether I could still make a pair of shoes, but I actually observed how you make shoes and I helped and I probably at one point could have made a pair of shoes from scratch. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="371">Q: So here you are, you're a little boy, probably less than six weeks ago you had been on a death march out of Auschwitz and all of a sudden you're dressed, you have a uniform, and you're riding a miniature pony with Polish army division. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="373">A: It's -- when you think about it, it reads like, sounds like, a novel from Garcia Marquez," but it's true. </sentence><sentence id="374">And it, the strange thing is that the sort of, the absurdity of it, the comic aspect of it never occurred to me as a child. </sentence><sentence id="375">Its -- you know, at the same time, all of this I thought was going to lead to my being reunited with my parents, and I never even thought that this wasn't going to happen, this was all part of a process. </sentence><sentence id="376">In the meantime I could eat and I no longer had to be afraid and I had fun. </sentence><sentence id="377">I had a horse. </sentence><sentence id="378">Actually, on the food, I should tell you that I, since I had no appetite and the Poles were quite concerned that I couldn't eat, they started giving me, at first, a half a spoon of vodka, then a spoon of vodka, and that stimulated my appetite at the point where I could really keep up with them to drinking vodka because it was my medicine. </sentence><sentence id="379">That was sort of the only lingering thing that had survived from the camp. </sentence><sentence id="380">Well, of course, I had -- -my amputation was still--I had to change bandages. </sentence><sentence id="381">I did Thomas Buergenthal 15 November 28, 1995 Page 15 all of that myself. </sentence><sentence id="382">I don't even remember ever being taken to a doctor when I was liberated. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="396">Q: Tell us more about the eating. </sentence><sentence id="397">What could you eat, and how did that gradually change? </sentence><sentence id="398">Was there some food that was more comforting than others, or when you were able to be around larger amounts of food, perhaps with the Poles, the Polish army division, were there some types of foods that you began to really want to have an appetite for? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="402">A: No. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="403"> [end of side one of tape one] Tape 1, Side B </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="404">A: What I remember was the Poles would drink a lot of vodka, eat bread and smoked bacon with it. </sentence><sentence id="405">And that's the sort of food I remember eating--a lot of bread, and bread, of course, I could eat, although I really didn't have much appetite. </sentence><sentence id="406">But with the vodka, I ate and drank whatever they did, and I remember a lot of bacon, that the poles usually drink this with vodka. </sentence><sentence id="407">But there must have been other food, I just don't have any memory. </sentence><sentence id="408">The only thing I remember is that when we stormed that place in Sachsenhausen, still, that all I could eat was a pickle, and I hadn't eaten a pickle for a   Thomas Buergenthal 16 November 28, 1995 Page 16 long, long time. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="417">Q: Did it bother you that you had been deprived of food for so long? </sentence><sentence id="418">You must have fantasized about food or talked about it, and then you could finally eat more freely, and you weren't hungry? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="421">A: No, that never occurred to me. </sentence><sentence id="422">It occurs to me now when I know I shouldn't eat and I have what I -- so now it's much more real. </sentence><sentence id="423">Now so often I think, oh here's all this food that I could eat and as a child I was starving and couldn't eat it and now I'm not allowed to eat it or shouldn't eat it. </sentence><sentence id="424">But no, I didn't, and I think it has a lot to do with having, being a child and taking a lot of these things for granted. </sentence><sentence id="425">This was life and this is what happened. </sentence><sentence id="426">One day you don't have anything to eat and the next day there's suddenly food. </sentence><sentence id="427">But I remember though, for years afterwards, would always think that you should always eat before you did anything of importance because you never knew when you were going to eat again. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="435">Q: Did you find when you were younger, that you ate quickly, as if someone might take the food away from you? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="437">A: That could be because I still eat quickly, probably too quickly. </sentence><sentence id="438">I don't know whether it's related to that or not. </sentence><sentence id="439">There were certain foods that, you know, bread of course, to this day good bread is something that I -- I always use the example that when I hear the word bread in German or Polish, I can smell it. </sentence><sentence id="440">It has sort of an emotion attached to it, whereas the English word for bread is a word that I learned, it's an Thomas Buergenthal 17 November 28, 1995 Page 17 intellectual, is an intellectual concept, but it doesn't have all the emotion tied up with the words chleb,? </sentence><sentence id="441">or the word Brot* in German, which was all of the things that I was deprived of and that I needed the most. </sentence><sentence id="442">The one thing that I thought I would never eat again would be turnips because we used to get turnip soup in Auschwitz, with a little piece of bread which was often the only meal we had. </sentence><sentence id="443">But now I find that even well done turnip quite good. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="454">Q: Can the smell of it or the taste of it, does it bring back memory flashes? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="456">A: Not anymore. </sentence><sentence id="457">But good bread still brings back sort of feeling of how wonderful it is to be able to have this, which I didn't have because we really lived on bread. </sentence><sentence id="458">It was the most important thing, and to this day, I really can't get myself to throw away bread. </sentence><sentence id="459">Stale bread is something that I find all kinds of excuses to let somebody else throw it away. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="464">Q: That's interesting. </sentence><sentence id="465">So instead of resenting or hating the bread because it's all you had, you actually sort of cherish it. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="493">Q: Can you tell us now about being a young boy just liberated from Sachsenhausen and you have hooked up with this group of Polish soldiers? </sentence><sentence id="494">War is not over and you are with them and you go essentially into military situations with them. </sentence><sentence id="495">Tell us about that. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="499">A: Well, the first real military situation I got into was, I helped liberate Berlin. </sentence><sentence id="500">We came into Berlin while the battle for Berlin was still raging and we were camped in the park near where the rocket artillery that the Russians had. </sentence><sentence id="501">We're shooting over at the Germans and the Germans were shooting back. </sentence><sentence id="502">And I slept in an armored car because there was still fighting going on, and as we drove into Berlin, you could see there were Russian soldiers, dead soldiers on one side, Germans on the other. </sentence><sentence id="503">The battle was still raging for about two days. </sentence><sentence id="504">But then of course, the Germans surrendered and we actually took German prisoners at the end of the -- when Berlin fell. </sentence><sentence id="505">But during the battle, you know, people got killed. </sentence><sentence id="506">That was a danger that somebody could get killed. </sentence><sentence id="507">Actually some people from our company who had Thomas Buergenthal 19 November 28, 1995 Page 19 ventured out on the street in the truck, the hand grenade was thrown -- because the Germans were still occupying the houses -- but nothing happened to me. </sentence><sentence id="508">I didn't participate in any of the fighting, I didn't shoot either. </sentence><sentence id="509">But we were counting because these rocket-propelled grenades that the Russians had, the Kosciusko would shoot out, sort of, six or 12 at the same time, and they were supposed to be moving because you can very easily locate them. </sentence><sentence id="510">And we were concerned. </sentence><sentence id="511">I remember the Polish saying that they really should be moving because the Germans could find where they were and then start bombarding us and them. </sentence><sentence id="512">But the Germans, at that point, German artillery was no longer very effective and nothing happened. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="530">Q: Were you frightened at that point and you wished that you had not hooked up with these Polish soldiers? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="532">A: Oh, no, I didn't wish that I hadn't hooked up, but I'm sure I was frightened, naturally, yeah. </sentence><sentence id="533">It's a long time ago, when you think this is in 1945, late April, beginning of May of 1945; it's a long time. </sentence><sentence id="534">But I remember the concerns that we all had about German artillery hitting us. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="538">Q: What was it like for you to see the German soldiers brought into custody, taken prisoners? </sentence><sentence id="539">What were your feelings toward them? </sentence><sentence id="540">Did you feel like you wanted to go up and say something to them about what you had experienced yourself? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="544">A: Well, I was delighted obviously, that they were prisoners of war and we were being guarded. </sentence><sentence id="545">I don't remember, first of all, I don't remember any of the Poles attacking Thomas Buergenthal 20 November 28, 1995 Page 20 any of the German prisoners, and I don't remember having that feeling. </sentence><sentence id="546">I remember having that feeling very much when I came back and I was reunited with my mother in Germany and seeing -- we had a balcony in that town, my mother's home town in Germany, in Gottingen -- and sitting on the balcony on a Sunday and seeing the German families taking a walk and my father hadn't come back. </sentence><sentence id="547">And at that point, you know, the desire of sort of seeing -- when I first came back I would love to mount the machine gun on that balcony and shoot all of them. </sentence><sentence id="548">But if I think back in Berlin of the German prisoners we took, I didn't have that feeling for some strange reason. </sentence><sentence id="549">It may have been too distant or... I remember there were negotiations going on for the surrender of the Germans, and at one point it looked there was some danger because there was a whole forest full of Germans as we were moving back and our company was quite exposed but the Germans wanted to surrender. </sentence><sentence id="550">And these negotiations went on all night and I slept through the whole thing and when I woke up in the morning, most of the German officers had merely negotiated in order to be able to escape. </sentence><sentence id="551">That's also I remember from that episode. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="563">Q: Did you talk at all about what you had just went through or did you plunge yourself into this new life? </sentence><sentence id="564">Did anyone say, "What was it like for you to be in one of these concentration camps?" </sentence><sentence id="565">Was anybody talking to you about that at that point or did you feel a need, a desire to talk about it? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="569">A: No, actually I don't think anybody was talking about it because, of course, these Thomas Buergenthal 21 November 28, 1995 Page 21 people had come out of a Russian concentration camp, they had gone through the entire war, they knew what it was all about. </sentence><sentence id="570">If people talked about anything it would be always to say, "Where are you from? " </sentence><sentence id="571">Where are your parents? " </sentence><sentence id="572">What did you do?" </sentence><sentence id="573">There I always had to be very careful because I didn't want -- first of all, I wasn't sure it was a good idea to say that I was Jewish, and second I didn't think that it was a good idea to say I was born in Czechoslovakia, so they just assumed that I was Polish. </sentence><sentence id="574">And so I sort of structured my own story that I came from Kielce, which was the ghetto where we had been, and that I expected to find my parents back in Kielce. </sentence><sentence id="575">That was sort of the extent of that conversation, but I must say, I don't remember very much of that period. </sentence><sentence id="576">It's strange; I have memories, sort of episodic memory, but not chronological memory. </sentence><sentence id="577">So that I, if you say, "Well what did you do then and what did you do then," it's often that I just simply don't remember. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="590">Q: Actually something you just said raises a question. </sentence><sentence id="591">Did you feel Jewish and if so, how so? </sentence><sentence id="592">I mean, had you been able to in any way affirm your identity as a Jew in this period or were you really too little to have been given that by your parents? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="596">A: No, I felt very much that I was Jewish but it's strange, my family was not a religious family at all. </sentence><sentence id="597">I had no religious education at all. </sentence><sentence id="598">Religion and Judaism became part of survival for me and I think that was part of what my father, my family brought me up. </sentence><sentence id="599">The Germans wanted to kill us because we were Jews and we were going to win this battle with them as Jews and we were going to survive. </sentence><sentence id="600">And so the Judaism that Thomas Buergenthal 22 November 28, 1995 Page 22 was instilled in me was the Judaism that said that we were going to win over the Germans, we're not going to let them kill us and we were going to be proud of the fact that we can survive. </sentence><sentence id="601">I remember my father always saying, "We are going to be alive long after they are six feet under." </sentence><sentence id="602">So in that sense, Judaism, the fact that we were different, was part of the thing that helped us live. </sentence><sentence id="603">That was very strongly instilled in me. </sentence><sentence id="604">But never religious, never from a religious point of view. </sentence><sentence id="605">But my father was very much, very strong as a believer the fact that he was a Jew, but not a religious Jew at all, neither was my mother. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="619">Q: What happens after the Polish army division pulls back from the battle of Berlin? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="621">What happens to you? </sentence><sentence id="622">What is going on at that point? </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="623">A: Well, we pull out of Berlin, eventually we are put on trains, again on trains, end up in an army camp in Poland, in a town called Siedlce, sort of a military garrison where I stay, I don't know really how long, it must have been a few weeks. </sentence><sentence id="624">But one of the Jewish soldiers from that company, who knew that I was Jewish and with whom I spoke, then takes me to a Jewish orphanage in Otwock, near Warsaw, which shows you that I hid my Judaism one way but as far as the Jewish soldier and I were concerned, I knew that I was Jewish and he knew that I was Jewish. </sentence><sentence id="625">And he took me to this orphanage where I stayed for a good year until I found my mother. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="629">Q: Were you sad to be taken away from the army garrison? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="631">A: Oh, in some ways, yes, because I have this sort of wonderful military life. </sentence><sentence id="632">Yes and Thomas Buergenthal 23 November 28, 1995 Page 23 no. </sentence><sentence id="633">I -- again, you know, the strange thing is, is you ask these questions. </sentence><sentence id="634">Part of my life or the way I used to think was that these things happened -- and you didn't spend much time thinking about them, very little introspection about events. </sentence><sentence id="635">You -- like, it's sort of like swimming. </sentence><sentence id="636">You're downstream, this is part of what has to be done. </sentence><sentence id="637">It never occurred to me that I shouldn't leave. </sentence><sentence id="638">He said it was a good idea to go to the orphanage and I went with him. </sentence><sentence id="639">The orphanage was actually, a lot of it was quite nice. </sentence><sentence id="640">Orphanages sound terrible but this one was where we were treated quite well. </sentence><sentence id="641">That point is when I began to think that I would find my parents. </sentence><sentence id="642">Again you know, as a child there was a strong belief that I would find my parents. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="658">Q: Describe arriving at the orphanage. </sentence><sentence id="659">What did it look like? </sentence><sentence id="660">What did you look like? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="664">Were you in your little military uniform at that point? </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="665">A: You know, I should have brought a picture. </sentence><sentence id="666">I still have a picture of my military uniform with this Polish soldier who eventually I think went to Israel. </sentence><sentence id="667">I must have because I had nothing else, so I must have arrived that way. </sentence><sentence id="668">I don't really remember the arrival part but I do remember that I was sort of -- and that made it easier. </sentence><sentence id="669">I was the only one there who had been in the camps. </sentence><sentence id="670">All the other kids had been hidden some place or had come from Russia or some place. </sentence><sentence id="671">So I was sort of an oddity and there was a lot of people asking questions, how was this. </sentence><sentence id="672">And the treatment was wonderful. </sentence><sentence id="673">I was still very thin and underweight and the cook in this place always made sure I would get a whole cupful or a soup bowl of cream so that I could gain Thomas Buergenthal 24 November 28, 1995 Page 24 some weight. </sentence><sentence id="674">I don't think that was such a good idea in retrospect. </sentence><sentence id="675">And eggs, you know, all of the things that I don't remember having. </sentence><sentence id="676">And of course the orphanage was interesting because the orphanage was divided into sort of two types of kids. </sentence><sentence id="677">And, there were the real orphans, and I was considered one of the real orphans, without a mother and a father, and we were the tough kids. </sentence><sentence id="678">Then there were what we considered the weaklings because they had one parent but for some reason they were there. </sentence><sentence id="679">And, I was the youngest of that group and was treated extremely well, had a lot of fun, played games. </sentence><sentence id="680">And again, sort of, unthinking about what the future was going to hold and always believing without really doubting it, questioning it, that sooner or later I would find my parents. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="700">Q: When you describe yourself being in the group of the tough orphans, it sounds like when you were young, when you were ten and just coming out of the concentration camp, there was almost a certain amount of pride, that you had survived and that you could handle yourself in these situations. </sentence><sentence id="701">Almost kind of the feelings of a young man and after all you were still a little boy. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="704">A: No, I think that was very true. </sentence><sentence id="705">I think that was in part because I saw, and because of my parents, I saw the fact that I survived as a victory, that we had won over them. </sentence><sentence id="706">They wanted to kill us and we made it; we didn't give them the joy of killing us. </sentence><sentence id="707">So there was a tremendous sense of satisfaction, that of survival, unlike what one reads now that people supposedly feel bad that they survived and others didn't. </sentence><sentence id="708">We never Thomas Buergenthal 25 November 28, 1995 Page 25 had that feeling and neither did my mother because my mother survived. </sentence><sentence id="709">I mean we felt very bad that, for example, my father didn't survive. </sentence><sentence id="710">He died just shortly before the end of the war. </sentence><sentence id="711">But we never felt that guilty about the fact of surviving, on the contrary. </sentence><sentence id="712">We were, it was a sense of satisfaction that we had survived. </sentence><sentence id="713">Really it was a sense of victory, that we didn't let them kill us. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="727">Q: That's an interesting thought, I'm not sure I've really heard that before. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="729">A: I've never heard it. </sentence><sentence id="730">All I read about is people feeling guilty that they survived. </sentence><sentence id="731">I mean I can understand that, I can understand it in some ways, other ways I can't understand that. </sentence><sentence id="732">If you survive, honestly there's no reason you should feel guilty and we certainly didn't. </sentence><sentence id="733">And really the people that I know from the camps never had that feeling. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="739">Q: You said that you played games at the orphanage. </sentence><sentence id="740">What kind of games, and what was that like for you? </sentence><sentence id="741">After all you'd been working, you'd been an errand boy, you'd been a mascot to an army division. </sentence><sentence id="742">What was that like for you to have your day filled with eating a lot of food and playing? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="747">A: It was wonderful. </sentence><sentence id="748">You know the strange thing is when I think back, here I had my toes amputated and I played soccer. </sentence><sentence id="749">I played a lot of soccer, and I had the great advantage because of my amputation I could also shoot with my left foot, so I was one of the few kids who could shoot left and right. </sentence><sentence id="750">It -- the transition wasn't difficult at all. </sentence><sentence id="751">It was an easy transition. </sentence><sentence id="752">It would have been much harder the other way Thomas Buergenthal 26 November 28, 1995 Page 26 around. </sentence><sentence id="753">That is, I think, an important thing. </sentence><sentence id="754">That I, if you were my age, the post survival period and the adjustment and the survival period was all much easier because in the camp I never thought like other people must have, my parents, how wonderful it was to eat a good meal or anything of that sort. </sentence><sentence id="755">And missing all of the conveniences that one had, I couldn't take it today. </sentence><sentence id="756">I've often thought that I couldn't survive today. </sentence><sentence id="757">But as a child, from my point of view, things got bad but then they got so much better. </sentence><sentence id="758">And, I never thought back that there was any -- it came naturally and I didn't think about it. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="774">Q: How much did people ask you about what your life had been like, for instance, in Auschwitz, and did you have a feeling that they were trying to find out information perhaps for later, for war crime trials or perhaps just to comfort you, to see if you'd experienced any trauma? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="776">A: Well, in the orphanage, since I was the only one there who had been in the camps, the people from newspapers and newsreels would come, and I was sort of a minor celebrity. </sentence><sentence id="777">Whenever people would come to the orphanage I would be trotted out to ask questions. </sentence><sentence id="778">But not because they wanted to comfort me or anything, it was just somebody -- if they wanted to talk about the orphanage, this was an example. </sentence><sentence id="779">Actually, you probably know that there was a book written, a diary in the camp, the man who wrote that diary and the excerpts from the diary, the parts that deal with me, he asked a lot of those questions. </sentence><sentence id="780">And when he describes interviewing me in the Thomas Buergenthal 27 November 28, 1995 Page 27 hospital about Auschwitz, he was struck by the fact that it was all sort of reported in the matter of fact way. </sentence><sentence id="781">I -- it's still like this to this day, I think in part because of my age or maybe I'm just totally insensitive to the experience but not very introspective about it. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="791">Q: You were speaking about the Norwegian Odd Nansen. </sentence><sentence id="792">Actually he described you as a very beautiful young boy--""pre-Raphaelite" is how he described you -- and he said that the only way he saw any anxiety was in your hands and that you had the hands of an old man. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="795">A: And now I do. </sentence><sentence id="796">No -- and he described them as very nervous hands and I suppose they still are probably to some extent. </sentence><sentence id="797">No, he was the only one in the camp that I remember asking me about things. </sentence><sentence id="798">And I was even -- I sort of thought, how strange that somebody would ask me about these things since we were all living it and there was nothing very unusual about it. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="803">Q: And in fact, he was living it also but what struck him was that you were such a little boy and that you might have walked with a canister of gas to the crematorium. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="805">A: Yes, of course, to me that was nothing very unusual or extraordinary, and to him it was very different. </sentence><sentence id="806">He was a wonderful man and one of the few diaries written in the camp on a day-to-day basis. </sentence><sentence id="807">I met him after the war. </sentence><sentence id="808">I found him after the war and we stayed in touch until he died. </sentence><sentence id="809">He actually saved my life in many ways. </sentence><sentence id="810">And I'm still in touch, whenever I'm in Norway, his son and I get together. </sentence><sentence id="811">Actually we were Thomas Buergenthal 28 November 28, 1995 Page 28 together last year. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="822">Q: You say that often you describe things in a matter-of-fact way. </sentence><sentence id="823">I wonder though that kind of being around death all the time -- you've just described a little bit ago about seeing the Russian soldiers and the German soldiers and you must have seen many bodies in the camps. </sentence><sentence id="824">Is that something that became matter of fact for you also? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="828">A: Yes. </sentence><sentence id="829">Without necessarily saying that it was matter-of-fact in a way that you just don't notice it. </sentence><sentence id="830">It was -- the death and seeing death in the camp and seeing people dying could not but affect one in the camp. </sentence><sentence id="831">But again as part of the self-defense mechanism, you tried not to think about it, you tried not to see it. </sentence><sentence id="832">Although, you know, it's strange, I can talk about my experience in the camp, I can write about it. </sentence><sentence id="833">I can't see movies about it. </sentence><sentence id="834">I can't read. </sentence><sentence id="835">A lot of things they affect me tremendously, increasingly so. </sentence><sentence id="836">And I think in part because I must have sort of suppressed a lot of things that come out now. </sentence><sentence id="837">But I'm struck by the fact how much more, how difficult certain things are for me today than they were even 20 years ago. </sentence><sentence id="838">I, when I just even see a snippet of a movie, say Schindler's List, they would show something on television, I would break down. </sentence><sentence id="839">Despite the fact that I give the impression that nothing phases me, that I just simply can't take. </sentence><sentence id="840">For example certain Jewish music, religious music, brings back memories of the camp that are very difficult for me, for example, a ceremony at the Holocaust Museum, to stay without breaking down. </sentence><sentence id="841">End of Tape 1. </sentence><sentence id="842">  Thomas Buergenthal 29 November 28, 1995 Page 29    Thomas Buergenthal 30 November 28, 1995 Page 30 Tape 2, Side A </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="884">Q: Can you tell us what it was like to go back to Kielce, that is, where you were in the work camp and then there was the massacre? </sentence><sentence id="885">That was where you were in the ghetto and then there was the massacre that you survived there. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="888">A: Well, the strange thing is that what we did, my wife and I, decided to sort of go back to my roots and we actually went back to the place where I was born and we drove around. </sentence><sentence id="889">And she would record, she would ask me questions and I would tell her about things. </sentence><sentence id="890">As we were driving into Kielce, I suddenly remembered the address of the house and the street where we were in the ghetto. </sentence><sentence id="891">I hadn't remembered it for Thomas Buergenthal 31 November 28, 1995 Page 31 years, I couldn't remember it. </sentence><sentence id="892">It suddenly came back to me. </sentence><sentence id="893">And we drove into Kielce, and I sort of directed her, and I'm a person who gets lost any place. </sentence><sentence id="894">I get lost in Washington, DC, if I don't see the Washington monument and here I sort of directed her within two blocks of where we were in the ghetto and found the house. </sentence><sentence id="895">The interesting thing is -- you know how children are -- I kept telling her, "It's this big house, I don't know, it must be six or seven stories high." </sentence><sentence id="896">When we got to it, it was a three-story building. </sentence><sentence id="897">It was just as dilapidated, just as terrible as it was when I remembered it. </sentence><sentence id="898">And the faces of the people, there was a tremendous amount of antisemitism in Poland, and in Kielce particularly it was quite bad. </sentence><sentence id="899">We were always afraid that if you tried to escape from the camp you would be handed over to the Germans. </sentence><sentence id="900">The faces of the people and the lack of the fact that there was no monument any place in the ghetto to say this was the ghetto. </sentence><sentence id="901">All I could think about was, I want to get out of here. </sentence><sentence id="902">I just couldn't take it. </sentence><sentence id="903">Thinking that my parents lived in this one room in this house. </sentence><sentence id="904">My mother had just died and I couldn't wait to leave. </sentence><sentence id="905">It was lunchtime and we were going to stop and have lunch, I said, "I don't want to do anything, I just want to get out of this place." </sentence><sentence id="906">I'd spent four years of my life there. </sentence><sentence id="907">But it was exactly, I mean the part of the ghetto, that whole area -- and the lack of any remembering, any effort made to remember that 20,000 people had lived here who had died. </sentence><sentence id="908">I did go -- we did go to a museum. </sentence><sentence id="909">We tried to find a museum and I asked for a book on the Jewish community of Kielce; eventually they found Thomas Buergenthal 32 November 28, 1995 Page 32 something that had been issued, there had been some exhibit I don't know how long ago, but there was nothing in the museum that you could see. </sentence><sentence id="910">This was the city museum of Kielce, and there was nothing about the wartime experience. </sentence><sentence id="911">A book that I eventually got -- it's sort of small little book about the Jewish community which must have been issued during the Communist period. </sentence><sentence id="912">It was shocking to me, well, first the way that nothing had changed, but then it was sort of totally, it's as if all of this that had happened there had no impact on the people and they didn't even want to remember it, whereas it was quite different in Auschwitz. </sentence><sentence id="913">In Auschwitz, I had come in, we went first. </sentence><sentence id="914">I was in Birkenau in the nice camp in Auschwitz, so we went in there first. </sentence><sentence id="915">And I was very concerned how it would go. </sentence><sentence id="916">As we walked in we saw a sign that said, "ARCHIVES," and my wife said, "Why don't you go in and introduce yourself?" </sentence><sentence id="917">I was at this point thinking I should be writing down my experiences. </sentence><sentence id="918">And I said, "No, I want to be a tourist, I don't want to bother with any of that." </sentence><sentence id="919">And she insisted, so she usually prevails. </sentence><sentence id="920">I went in, introduced myself, and they took me to the director and he then introduced me to the archivist, and they were a whole group of people who came in. </sentence><sentence id="921">They were at that point actually working on a study on children in the camp. </sentence><sentence id="922">So they wanted to know, where were you and everything else. </sentence><sentence id="923">And then I had them check my number and find out when J arrived, and they had all of the -- they had the document, they knew the number of people that came with my transport to Auschwitz. </sentence><sentence id="924">Thomas Buergenthal 33 November 28, 1995 Page 33 </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="972"> Auschwitz. </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="973">A: Right. </sentence><sentence id="974">And what happened then as a result of this activity, the whole thing for me became an academic exercise, so then we had a car and they put a guide at my disposal and we went to Birkenau, but it was no longer the Auschwitz. </sentence><sentence id="975">So the transition was made much easier because of all these questions. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="979">Q: I want to go back to the point where you are in the orphanage. </sentence><sentence id="980">Tell us how you were reconnected with your mother and any details that you know that were told to you in retrospect. </sentence><sentence id="981">How was the tracing actually done? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="985">A: That's a wonderful story because my mother believed that I was alive when everybody told her that it couldn't be, but she believed it and she insisted. </sentence><sentence id="986">Matter of fact, my mother walked back -- she was liberated not far from Regensburg -- she walked back to Poland, to Kielce, looking for me. </sentence><sentence id="987">There were people who had -- because she and my father had sort of different weigh stations where they were going to meet after the war. </sentence><sentence id="988">And people there had been in the camp with me and some people had seen me at this point or at that point. </sentence><sentence id="989">They all told her, "He can't be alive, forget it," you know. </sentence><sentence id="990">She insisted. </sentence><sentence id="991">Well, my uncle, who lived here in the United States -- my mother then went back to her hometown in Germany, was very sick. </sentence><sentence id="992">She was sort of three months drugged just to sleep it all off, and got in touch with my uncle and they started the search and so the Jewish agency for Palestine and Thomas Buergenthal 34 November 28, 1995 Page 34 various search bureaus of Red Cross and other things. </sentence><sentence id="993">In the meantime, I was in the orphanage and in the orphanage -- the orphanage was run by Jewish Communists, so-called the Bund party, who wanted Jews to stay in Poland and become good Communists. </sentence><sentence id="994">But the orphanage had been infiltrated by a Zionist organization and one of our counselors was a young woman, a Zionist woman from the Ha-Shomer Ha-Za'ir movement, which is a Zionist labor movement. </sentence><sentence id="995">And they decided that those of us who wanted to go to Palestine then -- this was in 1946 -- we should run away from the orphanage and we would be picked up by the people from that group and then taken to a kibbutz in Poland and then eventually be shipped illegally to Palestine. </sentence><sentence id="996">And so, the procedure was that every week or so, one kid who wanted to go there would run away from the orphanage and would disappear. </sentence><sentence id="997">But we all who wanted to go, put our names, tell them that we wanted to run away, so they made a list with our names. </sentence><sentence id="998">But I was told that since I had been on newsreels, that if I ran away that would really draw attention to the whole thing, so I had to be the last one to run away. </sentence><sentence id="999">But the list with names was sent to Palestine and it was sent to the Jewish agency in Palestine and somebody in the Jewish agency looked at those lists - - this is pre-computers, imagine -- it was written in heaven -- saw a mother looking for her child and a child with the same name on another list. </sentence><sentence id="1000">Notified my uncle in the United States, and then my mother and then eventually they -- an American organization smuggled me out of Poland and Czechoslovakia to the American zone Thomas Buergenthal 35 November 28, 1995 Page 35 in Germany and then to the British zone in Germany where my mother was. </sentence><sentence id="1001">That was in December of 1946, so imagine, I was separated from my mother in 1944. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1025">Q: Do you remember the moment that someone came and told you, "Your mother's alive, she's in this place and we are going to take you to her?" </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1027">A: Well, that was actually very different. </sentence><sentence id="1028">I received a letter in Polish supposedly from my mother, written in handwriting, curious enough I could not really read, but I knew my mother's handwriting, and I knew that my mother didn't write Polish. </sentence><sentence id="1029">And I thought it was a trick because every so often people tried to adopt us from the orphanage so this letter came supposedly from my mother, delighted that she found me and she was going to get me out of there. </sentence><sentence id="1030">And I was sure that wasn't my mother. </sentence><sentence id="1031">It wasn't until I received a letter from my mother in German that I knew it was my mother. </sentence><sentence id="1032">You see, we couldn't talk on the telephone. </sentence><sentence id="1033">None of that existed. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1041">Q: So it was your mother. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1043">A: It was my mother but she had somebody else write the letter in Polish thinking that I had forgotten my German or since it was going to Poland. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1045">Q: And what did that letter say? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1047">A: Well, I really don't remember what it said. </sentence><sentence id="1048">I wish I had kept it. </sentence><sentence id="1049">Actually the letter was written by a man who was in the camp with us who later became my mother's second husband, a wonderful man, a doctor. </sentence><sentence id="1050">The only surviving doctor from -- who then died unfortunately in "48. </sentence><sentence id="1051">But he wrote that letter. </sentence><sentence id="1052">I knew my mother couldn't Thomas Buergenthal 36 November 28, 1995 Page 36 write Polish and we were always, you know, this adoption thing, this is the tough kids in the orphanage didn't want to be adopted. </sentence><sentence id="1053">It really didn't dawn on me until months later. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1064">Q: So the orphanage said, "Fine, his mother is alive." </sentence><sentence id="1065">And now I'd like to know a little more detail about getting smuggled out of Poland and into -- again it seemingly this should have been easy for you to be reunited with your mother but here you are again in these dangerous situations. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1068">A: Well, nothing was easy after the war. </sentence><sentence id="1069">I had no papers for one thing, no passports -- you would have had to have visas and everything else. </sentence><sentence id="1070">The orphanage was very cooperative and the orphanage was also supported by Jewish organizations from the outside, particularly the American Joint Distribution Committee. </sentence><sentence id="1071">So they, sort of through my uncle, started beginning to move this reunion and how to get me to Germany. </sentence><sentence id="1072">What happened was that somebody came and said that they were going to take me to my mother and the orphanage agreed. </sentence><sentence id="1073">I suppose they investigated it, and I went with them. </sentence><sentence id="1074">We had to be smuggled out of Poland, this was in the winter, this was end of November, December 1946. </sentence><sentence id="1075">We crossed over the border into Czechoslovakia, it was freezing and I was very affected because of my frostbite. </sentence><sentence id="1076">We had to walk across the Czech/Polish border, they had bribed the guards, it wasn't dangerous but it was still a sort of, it was an illegal operation. </sentence><sentence id="1077">I then ended up, I was picked up by an American woman working for one of these organizations in Prague, Thomas Buergenthal 37 November 28, 1995 Page 37 taken to a hotel. </sentence><sentence id="1078">I had never been in -- what I remember from this, it's funny how these things stay in your mind. </sentence><sentence id="1079">It was a revolving door and I didn't know how to get into it. </sentence><sentence id="1080">I was just standing there worrying. </sentence><sentence id="1081">She walked through the revolving door and I was supposed to follow her and here I stood, I didn't know how to -- after all this, the revolving door was something I had never seen before. </sentence><sentence id="1082">Well, we stayed in Prague for a few days and then again we took a train but we got out of the train -- there was another group of border smugglers from a Jewish organization called Brichah which took us from the Czech side to a German town called Hiirth in Bavaria; it was the American zone. </sentence><sentence id="1083">Again, trudging through border, walking across with bribed border guards, and ending up in Munich and eventually going on a military train with her from Munich to Gottingen, crossing into the British zone of Germany, and my mother awaiting me -- not in Gottingen, she couldn't wait -- in another town. </sentence><sentence id="1084">Well -- and then you know, then I just couldn't believe it at that point, that's when the realization set in. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1105">Q: So, resume, how did your mother recognize you? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1107">A: I don't know how she recognized me, but I recognized her immediately. </sentence><sentence id="1108">We had only been separated three years. </sentence><sentence id="1109">That was no problem. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1113">Q: Do you remember some of the first things you talked about in those first few moments? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1115">A: Not really, I think it was so overwhelming, you know a lot of crying. </sentence><sentence id="1116">The usual Thomas Buergenthal 38 November 28, 1995 Page 38 thing. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1122">Q: So then your mother took you home. </sentence><sentence id="1123">Had you ever been to where she was living before? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1126">A: No, because actually, even though my grandparent's house still stood, my grandparent's were forced to sell it and my mother lived in an apartment in a nice house in town and life suddenly became normal after all of those years. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1128">Q: And, in a sense, it hadn't been that long since you hadn't seen your mother but in another sense you had become essentially a man who figured out how to make his way in the middle of this war. </sentence><sentence id="1129">How did she react to that? </sentence><sentence id="1130">You must have been very independent by that point, not her little boy anymore. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1134">A: I don't know whether that's true. </sentence><sentence id="1135">I reverted to being her little boy in many ways. </sentence><sentence id="1136">But it's interesting because I spent -- we had to think of school and all of this -- and I had a year, a little more than a year of private tutoring from a retired German teacher, and he said that he couldn't get over the fact that I would be a little child in one sense and a grown man in another when we discussed things and I imagine that was the same with my mother. </sentence><sentence id="1137">Although, with my mother, we discussed -- there was a lot of reminiscing about the camp, you know -- where was this, what happened. </sentence><sentence id="1138">But I was a child, I played, I did everything. </sentence><sentence id="1139">I wasn't at that point -- this was in 1946, 1947 -- how old was I? </sentence><sentence id="1140">14, 13 years old. </sentence><sentence id="1141">I couldn't speak German too well. </sentence><sentence id="1142">Again, this was sort of the interesting part; it took me a while to get back into German because I had Thomas Buergenthal 39 November 28, 1995 Page 39 spoken much more Polish than German, and it took me sort of a month or two to be fluent again in German even though at home we used to speak German and Polish. </sentence><sentence id="1143">I spoke German with my mother and father when we were together and Polish with my father when we were alone. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1157">Q: And so there was a kind of -- let's catch up and what happened to you. </sentence><sentence id="1158">Where you did sort of sit down and just really debrief with each other? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1161">A: Yes. </sentence><sentence id="1162">And things would come back and you would talk about this or that and another thing that is so interesting, people often think that when people get together from a camp, all we'd talk about were all these terrible things that happened. </sentence><sentence id="1163">The truth of the matter is that we often laughed about things in retrospect, about things that happened that were funny, about this or that happened. </sentence><sentence id="1164">So the human spirit -- you couldn't take all this if it were only reminiscences about all the terrible things. </sentence><sentence id="1165">So my wife often sort of marveled about the fact that even in recent years when my mother and I would get together we would talk about these things and talk about them often and remember this funny thing, and remember this. </sentence><sentence id="1166">It wasn't only remembering the terrible things that had happened. </sentence><sentence id="1167">I imagine it was probably when I was little we talked more about those things. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1175">Q: Because after all life does happen. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1177">A: Of course. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1179">Q: At that point what did you know about the fate of your father? </sentence><sentence id="1180">Was it still a mystery, </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="1183"> Thomas Buergenthal 40 </sentence></p><p><sentence id="1184"> November 28, 1995 </sentence></p><p><sentence id="1185"> Page 40 and if you did know anything, how did you know it? </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1186">A: No, at that point my mother already knew that my father had not survived. </sentence><sentence id="1187">It's strange because I had always believed that my father would survive. </sentence><sentence id="1188">It's strange, my mother was not well, my mother had thyroid condition so I assumed that if one or the other of them was going to survive it was going to be my father who was going to survive because he was also, he was very strong and very healthy. </sentence><sentence id="1189">But he was executed three days before the war supposedly ended, in another camp, in Flossenburg, where they executed a lot of people just before the end of the war. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1194">Q: So that was a situation where perhaps the Germans were going to surrender or leave and they just emptied out the camps by killing people? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1196">A: I understand that he was in the group, there were orders given apparently to not let any of the prisoners -- most of the camps fall into -- be liberated. </sentence><sentence id="1197">And where he was the order was executed, in fact. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1200">Q: How did you find that out? </sentence><sentence id="1201">Did people tell you that who were there or did you research it later in life? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1204">A: No, I didn't find it out, my mother at that point already knew. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1206">Q: So was there a point -- then finally you knew about your father -- where you stepped back and took a sort of time to mourn him in any way, you and your mother together? </sentence><sentence id="1207">I'm not sure how. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1210">A: You know it's strange but life was so unordinary if you want, that you didn't mourn Thomas Buergenthal 41 November 28, 1995 Page 41 in the same way. </sentence><sentence id="1211">It was a loss, you know, we lost so many people. </sentence><sentence id="1212">It was a terrible thing that my father hadn't survived. </sentence><sentence id="1213">It was something that I still feel today but mourning wasn't something one did in the way one does for example, if somebody dies and one goes through this period. </sentence><sentence id="1214">It was a reality one simply accepted, added to all the other things that had happened. </sentence><sentence id="1215">But one didn't mourn the way we do in ordinary, everyday life. </sentence><sentence id="1216">That simply didn't happen. </sentence><sentence id="1217">I'm sure when my mother first found out, it must have been extremely difficult. </sentence><sentence id="1218">But by the time I was reunited with my mother I think I -- I don't know when or if ever, on the one hand I always believed I was going to find my parents, but at the same time I must have at some point in the orphanage already concluded that I wouldn't be reunited, that neither of them lived. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1231">Q: When you think back to when you finally got to Germany and you're with your mother, those first few days, and you're looking around and all of a sudden your life is beginning to look a little more normal, do you, I mean, was there one moment when you sort of remember looking around, maybe going to a market with your mother and saying, "Okay, this is pretty normal, my life is normal now?" </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1233">A: No, you know. </sentence><sentence id="1234">I think I assumed that my life had been normal from the very beginning. </sentence><sentence id="1235">The fact that it wasn't normal was part of it being normal, this was all part of the life that I had lived. </sentence><sentence id="1236">I mean you would think that going back to Germany for example, would be difficult. </sentence><sentence id="1237">It was difficult. </sentence><sentence id="1238">It was very difficult initially for my Thomas Buergenthal 42 November 28, 1995 Page 42 mother but this was the only place she really could go back to. </sentence><sentence id="1239">My mother always told the story with a very bad conscious, very guilty, because she was standing on the street corner in her home town and an old lady came up to her and asked her to help her across the street and my mother said, "Nobody helped my mother across the street in this town." </sentence><sentence id="1240">This was right after she came back. </sentence><sentence id="1241">Then for years she would talk about it and say how terrible it was that she had acted that way. </sentence><sentence id="1242">So you know, we had all of those feelings. </sentence><sentence id="1243">But then I went there to school initially but at first the thought to go with these kids whose fathers had killed my father. </sentence><sentence id="1244">But then you realize that these are people you don't know whether they killed your father, most of them probably didn't, and you make friends. </sentence><sentence id="1245">And you find for example, we lived in the house with somebody, who was, a Catholic family that had actually helped the Jews in town, had been in danger themselves. </sentence><sentence id="1246">And so that sort of abstract hatred becomes transformed into the fact that they're human beings regardless of whether they're Germans or not Germans and not every German was guilty. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1264">Q: When you first got there and you had to brush up on your German and you had a German tutor, how did you feel about that? </sentence><sentence id="1265">I mean you were after all learning this language that you must, at that point, you might have associated with the camps and kind of negative things. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1268">A: But remember, it was also the language of my mother. </sentence><sentence id="1269">I've never made that association. </sentence><sentence id="1270">I always had terrible trouble seeing Germans in uniform but not the Thomas Buergenthal 43 November 28, 1995 Page 43 language. </sentence><sentence id="1271">And it wasn't a problem then. </sentence><sentence id="1272">But of course the difficulty was that one did sometimes see types on the street that reminded one of the SS and others, so they probably were. </sentence><sentence id="1273">My mother would every so often look at some woman walking by and say that she must have been a camp guard. </sentence><sentence id="1274">And you know, those memories would invariably come back or people would make some remarks or people would see her number. </sentence><sentence id="1275">She always wore short sleeves and people would say to her, "Don't you think you should have this tattoo removed?" </sentence><sentence id="1276">And she would say, "This is a badge of honor, I would never remove this." </sentence><sentence id="1277">You know, and she had a lot of the -- [end of side one of tape 2] Tape 2, Side B -- lived in Italy, starting I think in 1953 until she died. </sentence><sentence id="1278">Every so often if she would see a German tour guide, she would make some sort of remark but at the same time she was very forgiving in many ways. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1294">Q: Did you ever consider removing your tatoo? </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1485">A: Well, it's interesting you should ask that because I remember the Nuremberg trials only to the extent that I remember the first, almost first English words that I remember was "by hanging," and I remember listening to the radio when they announced the sentences and we were listening to that with sort of joy. </sentence><sentence id="1486">But that's the only thing that I remember of that period. </sentence><sentence id="1487">But I should tell you a story that is interesting connected with occupation forces because we mentioned Mr. Nansen who had written a diary, then a book about me. </sentence><sentence id="1488">I forgot his name when I was liberated from the camp. </sentence><sentence id="1489">I couldn't remember his name. </sentence><sentence id="1490">But when I came back to my mother I kept saying, "There was this wonderful man, this Norwegian who had saved my life and was very nice to me, and his father was very famous and his father's pictures were on even the packages of cookies that he once gave me." </sentence><sentence id="1491">And my mother said, "He must have been some famous cookie manufacturer." </sentence><sentence id="1492">So you know, it was just sort of the way you would treat a kid. </sentence><sentence id="1493">I kept saying, "No, no, this man..." Then, one day in 1948, my mother was reading a newspaper that was for   Thomas Buergenthal 50 November 28, 1995 Page 50 former inmates in the camp and there was a little write-up of a book that had just been published, the diaries of a man, a Norwegian, who had been in Sachsenhausen so my mother said to me "That might be your cookie -- he might know who that man was. </sentence><sentence id="1494">Why don't we write to him and find out?" </sentence><sentence id="1495">So we wrote this letter to him asking whether he might know the man who was so nice to me. </sentence><sentence id="1496">And of course the mail was terrible in those days. </sentence><sentence id="1497">Nothing happened for a while. </sentence><sentence id="1498">Then one day the doorbell rings and there's a big Norwegian military truck outside and the girl who opened the door said, "Yes?" </sentence><sentence id="1499">He said, "Well, we have a package here for the Buergenthal family. </sentence><sentence id="1500">So she said, "Give it to me," and they said, "No, no, no, it's much too heavy, we have to take it in." </sentence><sentence id="1501">So they take a tremendous crate and they bring it up and it's food collected from Norwegian children with a letter from him saying that he's the person and, you know, how delighted he was that I'm alive because he thought that I had died in the camp and as a result that's why the book was dedicated to me, among others, because he thought that I hadn't survived. </sentence><sentence id="1502">Then eventually he came and he actually took me to Norway to spend six weeks in Norway, and had a wonderful time. </sentence><sentence id="1503">But it was, when he learned that I was alive, he announced it in Norway and so the school children began to collect food. </sentence><sentence id="1504">And apparently they collected, there was a lot of chocolate which was rationed at that time in Norway, so it was quite a sacrifice for Norwegian children to give up their chocolate rations so I could have that. </sentence><sentence id="1505">The   Thomas Buergenthal 51 November 28, 1995 Page 51 Scandinavians were just wonderful in the camp. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1537">A: Lused to have nightmares for a while in the camp, but then I found a wonderful way to solve, deal with my nightmares and I never had them again. </sentence><sentence id="1538">Never had them as nightmares. </sentence><sentence id="1539">I had this recurring dream that I was being executed and then in one nightmare when I looked into the barrel of the gun, some flower or grass came out of it and they weren't real bullets. </sentence><sentence id="1540">So every time this nightmare recurred, I had, saw that as nothing to worry about because no bullets are going to come out of this gun and the nightmares were never a problem. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1658">Q: And just to clarify, the boat that you came over on, this was formerly a group of refugees who were given permission to come over and you came as a group? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1660">A: Yes. </sentence><sentence id="1661">Well, what happened was this: there was a sort of -- instead of Ellis Island they had established a camp, the U.S. authorities had established a camp in Bremerhaven in Germany, where people who had different visas to come to the United States as refugees were first brought into these camps, their papers were examined. </sentence><sentence id="1662">And then every few weeks they would have a ship ready and they would take people over on these ships as a refugee ship, and that was one of those ships. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1666">Q: What was your first view of the United States, literally? </sentence><sentence id="1667">Was it of Ellis Island and the Statue of Liberty? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1670">A: No, but it was of the Statue of Liberty. </sentence><sentence id="1671">Because we arrived -- it was really wonderful -- we arrived in the late afternoon and so we couldn't disembark until the next Thomas Buergenthal 55 November 28, 1995 Page 55 morning and so we could see the Statue of Liberty all lit up. </sentence><sentence id="1672">As a matter of fact in the newspaper article that each of us wrote in a different language. </sentence><sentence id="1673">I wrote mine in German. </sentence><sentence id="1674">I noted the lights of the Statue of Liberty and the lights of New York City, which made a tremendous impression on me. </sentence><sentence id="1675">| reflected on Auschwitz and the crematory and the light. </sentence><sentence id="1676">So it was a tremendous moment. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1842">Q: When would you say you began to develop a philosophy of human rights law and that you saw that emerge in your ideals in the kinds of choices you were making and the cases you were bringing? </sentence><sentence id="1843">And what is your philosophy, I suppose? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1846">A: Well you know, I've never brought a human rights case. </sentence><sentence id="1847">I've always thought that I could be much more effective in the human rights area by not being an activist in the sense of being a lawyer filing cases, but an academic who could be perceived to have a legitimacy when he spoke on human rights issue that wasn't driven by political considerations. </sentence><sentence id="1848">It wasn't driven by other considerations and that had no political agenda other than concern for human rights. </sentence><sentence id="1849">And that has been enabled me, 8 United Nations Educational and Cultural Organizations Thomas Buergenthal 61 November 28, 1995 Page 61 in fact, to be on a human rights court and be put in positions of being able, I think, to do a great deal in the human rights area, and to be taken seriously in the human rights area without being viewed as somebody who has a political agenda. </sentence><sentence id="1850">I think it's very important for NGOs? </sentence><sentence id="1851">and activist organizations to do the work that they're doing, but it's also important for people to be seen as committed to human rights and committed to the advancement of human rights who aren't political activists in the field. </sentence><sentence id="1852">And I've always thought that I could do much more by doing that, by staying above the sort of political foray, and that was particularly important in Latin America, where from the beginning if you spoke about human rights you were perceived to be a Communist. </sentence><sentence id="1853">As a matter of fact, I founded the InterAmerican Institute of Human Rights in Costa Rica, precisely in order to legitimate just a discussion of human rights, which when I first came I was involved with Latin America in the late 70s, the discussion of human rights wasn't a legitimate subject, it just became aggressive political discourse between the right and the left. </sentence><sentence id="1854">And so my sense has always been that some of us, at any rate, can contribute much more through teaching and through serving as impartial arbiters in this field. </sentence><sentence id="1855">In the teaching area, I -- my former professor at Harvard and | -- did the first American case book in international human rights. </sentence><sentence id="1856">We established the teaching of international human rights in the American law schools. </sentence><sentence id="1857">And our book came out in 1977 and deg National Governing Organizations Thomas Buergenthal 62 November 28, 1995 Page 62 before then only three of us taught the subject. </sentence><sentence id="1858">It's now taught in almost all American law schools. </sentence><sentence id="1859">And, you know, I have a little book for students on the teaching of -- on international human rights, which actually the subject has suddenly taken on a life of it's own not only in law schools but every place else, which it didn't have when I first started in this field in the late 60s. </sentence><sentence id="1860">Nobody was interested in this field and in the international -- the American Society of International -- didn't even consider human rights to be a subject of international -- so I worked in both of these areas and I thought it was always very important. </sentence><sentence id="1861">Philosophy -- that's the philosophy I suppose. </sentence><sentence id="1862">To my mind the most important thing in this field is not to let yourself be politicized; that's the biggest danger that I see. </sentence><sentence id="1863">People who promote human rights, when they politicize the subject, do a great deal of harm to the victims because they then debilitate themselves in being able to protect victims. </sentence><sentence id="1864">Also I've learned a great deal of patience in this field. </sentence><sentence id="1865">It takes a few lifetimes to be able to achieve anything. </sentence><sentence id="1866">But, you know, the most gratifying thing is to -- it's often occurred to me when I worked in Zepuan (ph) sitting on the case or when investigating human rights violations in El Salvador or now at the UN -- to think that somebody who had survived Auschwitz is given the opportunity to be working in this field now. </sentence><sentence id="1867">It's a wonderful -- it's a gift, it's a blessing when you think about it, you know, that I've been given this opportunity. </sentence><sentence id="1868">It's exciting and that's what sort of makes this all for me. </sentence><sentence id="1869">Every time I sit on something that sort of brings back the memory, it seems to me to Thomas Buergenthal 63 November 28, 1995 Page 63 say that it's almost as if there was something written that I'm supposed to be doing this. </sentence><sentence id="1870">The irony, the poetic justice of my doing this, comes back so often. </sentence><sentence id="1871">It came back particularly in El Salvador where so many things that I saw reminded me of the camps, from the massacres to the executions. </sentence><sentence id="1872">But to think, you know, to think of the cold Polish winters and the tropics of El Salvador, yet the same cruelty, and for me to be able to be involved in this, it boggles the mind in many ways. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1909">Q: I'm not sure most people would make that connection unless they had your experience in the camps, that there was a kind of similar, I guess, brutality going on between treatment of people in the camps and what happened during the worst of the civil war in El Salvador. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1911">A: Well, you know, it struck me long ago when I read Solzhenitsyn!deg books about the gulag, that the unimaginative cruelty, it's always the same. </sentence><sentence id="1912">You know, when you read what happened in the gulags, you say, "Gee, this is exactly what happened in the camps." </sentence><sentence id="1913">And then in El Salvador for example, when the only survivor there described the massacre. </sentence><sentence id="1914">When she began talking, I could have finished the story for her. </sentence><sentence id="1915">I was struck by the fact that I could have continued about what happened. </sentence><sentence id="1916">It's the same, I mean this brutality and the same thing in Bosnia. </sentence><sentence id="1917">There is no -- evil has sort of a monotone to it. </sentence><sentence id="1918">I don't know, that is the thing that always strikes me, that I just can't get over. </sentence><sentence id="1919">Thomas Buergenthal 64 November 28, 1995 Page 64 </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1935">A: The link is probably there and it's not there. </sentence><sentence id="1936">In other words, it doesn't and it shouldn't shape the outcome of the decision. </sentence><sentence id="1937">What it does, it's you have a much better sense of the reality in which an event happened. </sentence><sentence id="1938">It's as if, you know, if I were a judge sitting on a commercial case and I'd been prior to that a lawyer practicing in the commercial law area, I would have a much better sense of dealing with this material than somebody who came out of some other environment. </sentence><sentence id="1939">Well, it's a little the same for me when I deal with a human rights case. </sentence><sentence id="1940">This is a reality. </sentence><sentence id="1941">When I hear somebody describe a certain situation, there is an understanding of what could have happened and also doubts raise when somebody tells you something, you say whenever that doesn't sound right. </sentence><sentence id="1942">And you can make those, you can have those doubts only if you've lived through something similar. </sentence><sentence id="1943">So to that extent there is a connection, and to that extent it's very useful. </sentence><sentence id="1944">But it shouldn't affect your decision- making process. </sentence><sentence id="1945">But of course, there is the empathy that comes out of the experience, is there. </sentence><sentence id="1946">And I think people shouldn't be in human rights if they don't have some empathy for what it is to be subjected to violations. </sentence><sentence id="1947">But I don't know, sometimes you wonder and you say to yourself, you know, something at the UN   Thomas Buergenthal 65 November 28, 1995 Page 65 now where it's different from being on the court. </sentence><sentence id="1948">You sometimes go very fast through a lot of material and you say, "Gee, we have 140 countries, 80 countries from which we can receive reports, individual cases. </sentence><sentence id="1949">Death penalty cases, people on death row for 18 years, things like that. </sentence><sentence id="1950">And you wonder, you know, you sit on this and what in-roads do you really make? </sentence><sentence id="1951">But it's only a very -- I have that in very few moments when the going gets tough. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2005">A: Well, after my bypass operation in "93 I decided -- my kids have been pressing me for a long time -- I decided to begin writing. </sentence><sentence id="2006">I've written about three or four chapters. </sentence><sentence id="2007">But I've come to the conclusion that I need -- I can't do it by myself. </sentence><sentence id="2008">I'm much too much a lawyer when I write. </sentence><sentence id="2009">It doesn't -- I describe things rather than -- and I've actually discussed it with somebody, that she might work with me. </sentence><sentence id="2010">Because what I write sort of comes out wooden in many ways. </sentence><sentence id="2011">And I don't deal -- I'm particularly bad in describing emotions. </sentence><sentence id="2012">But it's obvious that one needs to write it down and things come back that have long been forgotten. </sentence><sentence id="2013">I was struck by the fact that just sitting behind the computer and thinking of a certain event, a lot of things come back, names come back that I thought I'd forgotten and 50 years later suddenly the name of a camp commandant comes back to me, or the name of a street. </sentence><sentence id="2014">That's the wonderful thing about doing that and I'll continue doing that. </sentence><sentence id="2015">The problem is that academic books come in between them, and then other assignments that sort of -- I have about three of four chapters. </sentence><sentence id="2016">And I did write actually in Bethany college, I did write one story and they had a publication. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2050">A: Well, first of all, it should be sort of written down for the family. </sentence><sentence id="2051">What strikes me about this whole thing is that when my kids were little they had no interest at all. </sentence><sentence id="2052">I mean, they sort of knew, and as they got older, they're now in their late 20s and early 30s, they now say, "Write it down." </sentence><sentence id="2053">And they would say, "Well, why didn't you tell me that before?" </sentence><sentence id="2054">You know, this story or that story. </sentence><sentence id="2055">But at the time really when they were young they had no interest whatsoever, at least none that I could perceive. </sentence><sentence id="2056">But now they really are very interested and they want to know this and that. </sentence><sentence id="2057">So that's one reason. </sentence><sentence id="2058">| think the other reason is that these things should not be forgotten and those of us who have survived and who have the ability to recollect and express themselves about that have an obligation to put it down. </sentence><sentence id="2059">It's the kind of thing that if nothing else, hopefully it will have an impact on the future, at least in making people think about how you can prevent those things. </sentence><sentence id="2060">And also, you know, this notion about some of the Holocaust deniers, here is an answer at least that this happened. </sentence><sentence id="2061">The further away we get from it, supposedly, more of this denial is going to come about. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2184">A: Well I speak English and German. </sentence><sentence id="2185">I can get along in Polish and I speak Spanish quite well, really, because I had to work in Spanish. </sentence><sentence id="2186">But I learned Spanish when I first was elected to the court and I learned it by, not formally, I learned it by listening to the interpretation with one ear and to the original in the other. </sentence><sentence id="2187">In the process I lost both my Italian and my French. </sentence><sentence id="2188">I can still get along in French. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2194">Q: Go back to when your sons were little, when they were about five or six or seven, maybe eight. </sentence><sentence id="2195">What were your thoughts? </sentence><sentence id="2196">Would you look at them, they were little boys like you were, did it surprise you the things they did, did it make you think about what you were like, and how much -- probably they were too young then but as they got older, how much did you tell them about what had happened to you, and have you told them everything? </sentence><sentence id="2197">Or does a person who's heard the Holocaust Museum video tape, do they perhaps know a few more details about what you experienced in the camps than they do, at this point? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2202">A: I think if you saw the Holocaust video tape, they might know more than my children. </sentence><sentence id="2203">Although my children might know a lot of other details that they wouldn't know. </sentence><sentence id="2204">Did I tell them? </sentence><sentence id="2205">I suppose on different occasions, different little snippets,   Thomas Buergenthal 72 November 28, 1995 Page 72 particularly when my mother used to come and visit we would reminisce. </sentence><sentence id="2206">But probably not as much either as I could have or as I should have but at the same time you really as a parent, you know, you can't just try to drum things into kids" heads and if they don't want to ask, there's nothing much to tell. </sentence><sentence id="2207">I think their interest is gradual, has really come more recent. </sentence><sentence id="2208">But maybe, you know, I never know, because it may well be that they were afraid to ask, that they thought it would be painful, although it never has been because in our family we always talked about these things. </sentence><sentence id="2209">But maybe they didn't want to ask for a variety of reasons. </sentence><sentence id="2210">They certainly, I don't think, can really imagine what it was and they never really asked that kind of thing. </sentence><sentence id="2211">There was something else you asked me that I've forgotten, the first part. </sentence><sentence id="2212">It will come back. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2227">Q: For instance, have you ever -- </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2229">A: Oh, yes, I remember what you asked me, about when I looked at my children, how I would react. </sentence><sentence id="2230">Well, you know, every so often when children were sort of my age, I would look at them and I would think, could they survive this? </sentence><sentence id="2231">You know, this is the age and look, they are such children and this was the age that I was when this happened. </sentence><sentence id="2232">Then you somehow think, yes, they could have. </sentence><sentence id="2233">When you see street children in Latin America, how street-smart they are and how they survive, you realize kids have that in them. </sentence><sentence id="2234">I've seen this in Brazil, I've seen it in other places, in Guatemala. </sentence><sentence id="2235">These kids have that survival instinct. </sentence><sentence id="2236">But when you look at sort of, our Thomas Buergenthal 73 November 28, 1995 Page 73 children you say, "No, they could never make it." </sentence><sentence id="2237">But the fact is they could. </sentence><sentence id="2238">There's tremendous resilience that children have, some children. </sentence><sentence id="2239">Some children may be more sensitive than others but I think children are blessed with this resilience that enables them to survive better than grown-ups can survive in many situations. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2254">Q: Obviously you lost your childhood in many ways. </sentence><sentence id="2255">Is it something you got back later on? </sentence><sentence id="2256">An example would be, when you're that young you still want to be held a lot. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="2260">Did anybody ever hold you when you were a little boy in the camps or is that something you just lost? </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2261">A: No, nobody held me except my mother and father. </sentence><sentence id="2262">But it's interesting, when I came back when I found my mother, I think the first year I just stuck to her as if, you know, I kissed her all the time. </sentence><sentence id="2263">It was sort of all coming back. </sentence><sentence id="2264">But of course I missed a lot. </sentence><sentence id="2265">At the same time, you know, it's sort of curious but I think -- I did eight years of school in one year of private tutoring and it turns out I have dyslexia which I never realized I had. </sentence><sentence id="2266">One of my children has that problem and he suffered quite a lot because it appeared in first grade and second grade; it was a problem. </sentence><sentence id="2267">I didn't know I had it until he was tested and the doctor tested me and it turned out that my case was just as serious as his but because I started so much later, I just learned how to compensate for it. </sentence><sentence id="2268">So there are a lot of things that, there were also benefits. </sentence><sentence id="2269">Just to think of all the eight years of school one could have skipped without supposedly any great loss of learning. </sentence><sentence id="2270">Although I have always kidded by the fact that I never really Thomas Buergenthal 74 November 28, 1995 Page 74 learned the alphabet properly. </sentence><sentence id="2271">I never learned the ABC and stuff, all of these little things that you learned in grade school I never learned. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2288">A: Yes. </sentence><sentence id="2289">It shows you that it's not that difficult, that it must be that all you have to do is just skip enough classes. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2292">Q: It is amazing, and I thought this about an hour and half ago, how much we're laughing in this discussion. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2294">A: Well, this is what I try to tell you, that those of us who went through it all went through it because we were lucky in everything else. </sentence><sentence id="2295">But also in a sense, and I'm still able to talk about it today, is because we weren't just weighed down by the terribleness of it, that we didn't let it affect our whole life. </sentence><sentence id="2296">One has to be able to laugh about things, get raving mad. </sentence><sentence id="2297">And some things are funny, some things are sad. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2302">Q: Some studies have been done on children of Holocaust survivors and some have characteristics, and one is depression, is that something that has occurred in your family and do you see a link there if it has? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2304">A: Fortunately, not at all, no. </sentence><sentence id="2305">It may be because I have never been very introspective so it hasn't affected my children. </sentence><sentence id="2306">No, not at all. </sentence><sentence id="2307">They are--no, I don't think it has affected them at all, at least not in any negative way that I can think of. </sentence><sentence id="2308">Maybe if the Holocaust survivor's husband and wife -- that might be. </sentence><sentence id="2309">But, you know, my wife was a native-born American who hasn't gone through any of this and I think that Thomas Buergenthal 75 November 28, 1995 Page 75 may make a difference, although I'm not even sure. </sentence><sentence id="2310">I think it depends on the family, it depends on the attitude of people. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2321">Q: What about religion? </sentence><sentence id="2322">When you brought your children up, not just religion, Jewish culture -- how did you convey that to them as they were growing up? </sentence><sentence id="2323">Did you make sort of a specific effort to do that and how so? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2327">A: Well, I wanted the children to grow up Jewish and so they went to Sunday School, they were Bar Mitzvahed, and all of this. </sentence><sentence id="2328">But they were not in a Jewish home in a sense that I'm not religious at all. </sentence><sentence id="2329">I think my children are more religious, at least two of my sons often drag me to a temple on the High Holidays and chide me if I don't go. </sentence><sentence id="2330">I think what I try to do which is sort of natural, that I try to bring them up in the Jewish sense from a cultural point of view, that they should have historical sense of what Judaism means and the contribution of Judaism to culture. </sentence><sentence id="2331">And they shouldn't be ashamed of it, that it's something like any other culture, to be proud of. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2353">Q: How often do you think about being in the camps? </sentence><sentence id="2354">Is that something that happens a lot? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2357">A: No, not really. </sentence><sentence id="2358">It happens only if there was some reason that would bring it out. </sentence><sentence id="2359">Not very much at all, only if there is some sort of specific event that triggers something, but otherwise I don't think about it at all. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2363">Q: Are there sounds that will really bring it out, or something that will just bring back a memory? </sentence><sentence id="2364">We talked earlier about the smell of bread. </sentence><sentence id="2365">What about sounds or smells? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2369">A: Not really, more events. </sentence><sentence id="2370">You know if you read about or if you see, for example, if you see the people behind the barbed wire in Bosnia, that brings it back, those types of things. </sentence><sentence id="2371">But not anymore. </sentence><sentence id="2372">Maybe some things you read about and some German words or something, that might trigger something. </sentence><sentence id="2373">But really probably there be months will go by that I don't think about it at all, it doesn't come back at all. </sentence></p></dialogue>
