</sentence><sentence id="30">And I could hardly walk, or talk, or recognize anything. </sentence><sentence id="31">And after three days, or a week, I don't know exactly, they told us we have to leave that village, because the front is coming on. </sentence><sentence id="32">So we should walk to Lomborg. </sentence><sentence id="33">Lomborg is in Polmarin. </sentence><sentence id="34">And it was not far from Chinno. </sentence><sentence id="35">And as we were walking, I with a little friend of mine holding a hand, we saw two Russian soldiers, and I -- that I will never forget, and a two carriage -- two wheel carriage -- officers, and we asked them to take us to Lomborg, and you know we covered our head with -- with scarves, and we -- they shouldn't notice that we have typhus. </sentence><sentence id="36">And they said, "No, we cannot do it, because we are not allowed to." </sentence><sentence id="37">But they felt so sorry for the two youngsters, that they put us behind,

</sentence><sentence id="39">So, we went out, and the first house we walked in. </sentence><sentence id="40">And all I can remember is everything was empty, except there was a big, big rug, maybe a Persian rug, I don't know, at that time I didn't know from Persian rug, or China rug, or anything else. </sentence><sentence id="41">And in the middle was standing a bottle, with blueberries. </sentence><sentence id="42">And I didn't know it was preserve, or something. </sentence><sentence id="43">There was no water in that house, nothing. </sentence><sentence id="44">And we were still sick, I and that little girl, we had a temperature little bit, and we were -- we were really out. </sentence><sentence id="45">And sh -- she said, "Shall we drink it?" </sentence><sentence id="46">I said, "I am afraid it may be poisoned." </sentence><sentence id="47">Left poison, there's that bottle standing there, there's no water, there's nothing. </sentence><sentence id="48">And then we couldn't stand it any more, and what happened is is we drank, and we ate those blueberries. </sentence><sentence id="49">And at that time I was so   USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0053 4 young, I didn't know nothing. </sentence><sentence id="50">Later on I realized that we got up the next morning, and we felt so much better, that it was fermemented. </sentence><sentence id="51">It was set up for wine, or something, and it helped the temperature. </sentence><sentence id="52">And our temperature dropped. </sentence><sentence id="53">We s -- we went around, and we looked around like scavengers for food, and we found some food, and then I recognized some people from my hometown, and they was already looking -- you know, after two weeks, three weeks, they're grown up people. </sentence><sentence id="54">And they saw me, it was like a lifesaver for them, because the Russians are going on the front to Lomborg, and they were raping the women. </sentence><sentence

they made hia -- chaos. </sentence><sentence id="59">And what happened is -- is that whenever a Russian came in, they took my scarf off my head, and they gave me a bottle with medicine, and they send me out in the front room, and turn on the light, and the Russians, as drunk as they were, they start running, because they know there was typhus in that -- I was over already, but still looked like a musselwoman, you know, sick with the salve on my head. </sentence><sentence id="60">They start running. </sentence><sentence id="61">And this is how I saved six women from being raped by the Russians. </sentence><sentence id="62">Then my hair start growing in a little bit, and I was going down the stairs, and there was a little pond near that apartment, and there wasn't that much water, and anything, and I thought I'1l wash out my -- whatever I have, in that pond. </sentence><sentence id="63">And all of a sudden I looked up, and there were two big, black boots in front of me, and I looked up, and he said to me, in Russian -- at that time I was still speaking Russian. </sentence><sentence id="64"> USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0053 5 He said, "Ateeja dofka." </sentence><sentence

</sentence><sentence id="76">And he says to me he is going on the front, and he is going to write to his father, and his father will la -- his father is a doctor in the army, a big officer, and arrange to pick me up. </sentence><sentence id="77">And I thought to myself, "Let him talk." </sentence><sentence id="78">But -- but the mo -- wonderful thing was about it, for all two weeks he slept in the front room of our apartment, so nobody could get in. </sentence><sentence id="79">And when he left, we went to work in a hospital, to help the Russian soldiers. </sentence><sentence id="80">So we slept there, so nobody could touch us there either. </sentence><sentence id="81">And one day a man came up to me, and he said, "Akeem Marouskas Supporzhnikova?" </sentence><sentence id="82">Am I
