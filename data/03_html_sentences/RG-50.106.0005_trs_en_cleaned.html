<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="601">A: There was a sign above the camp, but you know, I can't remember what it said now. </sentence><sentence id="602">Some of the movies I've seen, there had been different slogans, Arbeit? </sentence><sentence id="603">You know about that. </sentence><sentence id="604">Means what was it. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="639">A: Yes. </sentence><sentence id="640">The other soldiers felt the way I did. </sentence><sentence id="641">And as a matter of fact, now that I think back, I remember one of the other soldiers not being able to stay there. </sentence><sentence id="642">He had to leave immediately. </sentence><sentence id="643">But I did not do that, because I wanted to see as much as I could. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="649">Q: Why? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="651">A: Because I'm Jewish, and I didn't want to, you know, forget what I was seeing. </sentence><sentence id="652">I thought maybe some day in the future, I'll be able to describe this, or I would have to describe it, which I am now doing. </sentence><sentence id="653">Another experience that I had later in our area, area of Southfield, Michigan at the time, is we met a survivor of that camp. </sentence><sentence id="654">He happened to be a jeweler who came to our house to show a small, little charm bracelet that we were trying thinking of getting for our twoyear old daughter at the time. </sentence><sentence id="655">Now, this was over 30 years ago. </sentence><sentence id="656">But when he had heard that I went into the camp and was a liberator, he said you know, I was a survivor of Buchenwald, too. </sentence><sentence id="657">And the only way I survived was I finally cut off some toes in order to get to a hospital. </sentence><sentence id="658">And he was very emotional. </sentence><sentence id="659">We hugged, and he cried. </sentence><sentence id="660">And he said you, you saved us. </sentence><sentence id="661">And this happened, the meeting happened 30, over   30 years ago. </sentence><sentence id="662">And we see each other once in a while, and memories come back, of course. </sentence></p></dialogue>
