<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="26">Q: Okay, thank you. </sentence><sentence id="27">One of the things you mentioned in the video interview was that your grandfather had some poison that you were to have used if things got really unbearable. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="30">A: Mm-hm. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="32">Q: When did you find out about the fact that he had this poison and what were the circumstances? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="34"> USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0034 3 </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="35">A: I do not exactly remember when the subject was brought up. </sentence><sentence id="36">I simply do not remember. </sentence><sentence id="37">It -- It, in all likelihood was mentioned casually. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="41">Q: But it -- it -- it re -- it came up while you were on the run -- while you were -- </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="42">A: Yes, yes, yes. </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="43">Q: Uh-huh. </sentence><sentence id="44">It wasn't later, when -- </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="45">A: No, it was -- it was -- it was while we were on the run. </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="46">Q: Do you remember your reaction to finding out about that? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="48">A: No, I don't remember. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="50">Q: Another thing having to do with the video was your time in the Catholic orphanage. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="52">A: Mm-hm. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="54">Q: And you had said that you weren't really aware of religion at that age, but there were a lot of different experiences with religion, that you had. </sentence><sentence id="55">You had the Catholic orphanage, you-your own religion. </sentence><sentence id="56">Were you aware of -- of your place in any of this? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="60">A: I do not think that I was bothered by it, because during the war, I was about a half a year or eight months, hidden under assumed name in -- in the parish of a Lutheran minister, so that somehow I was used to Christianity, as far as that goes. </sentence><sentence id="61">But, when I was deposited in that orphanage, it was already after liberation -- very shortly after liberation. </sentence><sentence id="62">And my parents made it clear to me that I will be there only a very short time and I can only assume that the nuns were instructed that I'm there only temporarily, for a couple days or weeks. </sentence><sentence id="63">So they have not tried to impose any of their influence upon me. </sentence><sentence id="64">It was like -- like, if you will, to -- to -- to be deposited in a day care center, if you wish. </sentence><sentence id="65">There was one fellow I befriended there, during those few days. </sentence><sentence id="66">He used to -- he spend there a whole war. </sentence><sentence id="67">He was Jewish, but he was not circumcised, so there   USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0034 4 was apparently no way t -- of proving that he was Jewish. </sentence><sentence id="68">But that -- that didn't have any lasting influence upon me. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="79">Q: When the war ended, you were 13. </sentence><sentence id="80">You were in this orphanage? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="83">A: Yes, yes. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="85">Q: And since the video interview stopped at that point -- </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="86">A: Mm-hm. </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="87">Q: -- perhaps we could pick up the chronology and -- and -- </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="88">A: Okay. </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="89">Q: -- talk about that period as the war ended and what was going on in your life. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="91">A: Okay. </sentence><sentence id="92">After some very short time in the orphanage, one of my relatives -- and I don't remember exactly whether it was my sister or my parents, came to pick me up and we came back to Ungarrishbrote or Uerskibrote, the town from which we fled in 1942, to Slovakia. </sentence><sentence id="93">If I remember correctly, in those -- in that period that I was in the orphanage, my parents succeeded having our house returned to us. </sentence><sentence id="94">Because, during the war, our house was occupied by Christians, who were not very pleased, apparently, to vacate the house after the war. </sentence><sentence id="95">Because majority Christians who found themselves into those situations, assumed that the Jews have perished. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="96">That they will be able to stay there forever. </sentence><sentence id="97">So, we returned to our own house. </sentence><sentence id="98">I remember, after few days or weeks, I joined the Boy Scouts. </sentence><sentence id="99">I had got -- got a nasty infection on my foot and had to be operated on and had to be transported for the operation to Ungarishradish or Werskaradishka, which had a hospital. </sentence><sentence id="100">And the only doctor in Ungarishbrote who was available, said that because the war has ended such a short while earlier, they didn't had any ether -- anesthesia, to put me to sleep. </sentence><sentence id="101">So I had to go to Ungarishradish for operation. </sentence><sentence id="102">I stayed there a couple of days. </sentence><sentence id="103">My father, in the meantime, traveled throughout the Czechoslovakia. </sentence><sentence id="104">Mainly --    </sentence></p><p><sentence id="105"> USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0034 5 his dental office was confiscated by the Nazis. </sentence><sentence id="106">And the provisional Czech government wanted to return it to him, but of course, the original equipment, God knows where it disappeared. </sentence><sentence id="107">So, the government has said that they will give him a dental equipment left by fleeing Germans. </sentence><sentence id="108">So he can choose any dental office that he wants to, with one condition, that the office will stay in that city in which it is. </sentence><sentence id="109">And the Czech government promised to find for us an apartment in that city. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="110">So, from what I understand, my father looked over about five or six dental offices and has selected one in the city of Zenime or Zenoimal, which is about one hour by train away from Vienna, in southern Moravia. </sentence><sentence id="111">And in, I think September of "45, we have moved. </sentence><sentence id="112">Correction, it must have been later. </sentence><sentence id="113">October or November, we have moved to Zenoimal. </sentence><sentence id="114">And while in Uerskibrote, I started getting private tutoring lessons, because I was still at a compulsory school age. </sentence><sentence id="115">And the debate was with the school board, whether I should be admitted to a class according to my chronological age or placed in a class according to my academic knowledge. </sentence><sentence id="116">And until that issue was resolved -- because the local school board didn't had any instructions how to proceed. </sentence><sentence id="117">So, in the meantime, I was having a private tutor, so I think that during the summer of "45, I was spending it with a tutor. </sentence><sentence id="118">And in September, I started school. </sentence><sentence id="119">In the meantime, the ruling was that I had to attend classes according to my chronological age. </sentence><sentence id="120">So, of course, I was -- I was totally unprepared, after four years -- five years being out of school. </sentence><sentence id="121">So I -- I always had very poor grades as a result. </sentence><sentence id="122">And then my father selected the dental office in Zenoimal, so we have moved to Zenoimal. </sentence><sentence id="123">I remember the travel throughout the Czech Republic by train was an ordeal, because th-the cars were not only filthy and dirty, but all the windows were broken. </sentence><sentence id="124">And it was -- the trains were running, God knows how. </sentence><sentence id="125">So Zenoimal -- the city of Zenoimal, I think at that time, it -- it must have had a population of about 20,000, was heavily scarred from Germans fleeing to Austria. </sentence><sentence id="126">There were several burn out tanks left over in the city. </sentence><sentence id="127">A great part of the city </sentence></p><p><sentence id="128"> USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0034 6 was in ruins. </sentence><sentence id="129">And almost all the windows in Zenoimal were broken, because allies were bombing Vienna. </sentence><sentence id="130">And Vienna Noiseshtatel, which had apparently German ammunition factories, and from the vibration of the bombs, the glass of the windows simply broke. </sentence><sentence id="131">So, then I stayed in Zenoimal, I think til about 1947. </sentence><sentence id="132">Yes, in May of 1947, I finished my compulsory educational requirements, which at that time, were nine grades. </sentence><sentence id="133">I did not qualify for high school, simply because of academic deficiencies. </sentence><sentence id="134">And the fact that I was Jewish and suffered from a lack of education was not taken into account. </sentence><sentence id="135">And in 1947, the problem was asked, okay, what do I do now? </sentence><sentence id="136">The city of 20,000 people did not have many opportunities for young people. </sentence><sentence id="137">There were a couple openings in various trades. </sentence><sentence id="138">In the Czech economy at that time, usually somebody who selected a trade went into apprenticeship status for next three years. </sentence><sentence id="139">So, there were openings if you wanted to become a barber or a painter or a sales clerk. </sentence><sentence id="140">All those trades are -- required three years apprenticeship. </sentence><sentence id="141">But somehow it came to my attention that a textile factory was looking for apprenticeship connected with bort and learning classes. </sentence><sentence id="142">So, the whole picture came -- began to look like a two year long apprenticeship, with half a day of practical work in a textile factory and half a day of classroom work. </sentence><sentence id="143">I succeeded, with my father's help, to enter the program and left home to a small village in which there was a textile factory. </sentence><sentence id="144">I-It used to be owned by Jews. </sentence><sentence id="145">And I started as an apprentice in -- in that factory and I believe that the program was the first year. </sentence><sentence id="146">We were to rotate in the textile factory, from department to department and the second year you should have selected a department, which would become your specialty. </sentence><sentence id="147">So I finished the first year, but even during the first year, I still had physical problems, because I was extremely weak as a result of the war. </sentence><sentence id="148">Furthermore, I never felt quite home, because I was the only Jewish apprentice in our class of about 60. </sentence><sentence id="149">So I was sort of a curiosity. </sentence><sentence id="150">And I finished, I think, first half of the second year, when my parents suggested that -- by that time, it was 1948. </sentence><sentence id="151">The </sentence></p><p><sentence id="152">   USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0034 7 Communists already took over the government of Czechoslovakia when my parents came to me with the question whether I would be willing to emigrate to Israel. </sentence><sentence id="153">Do you have any -- </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="154">Q: Yes, that's a good point to go back and -- and ask you questions about that period. </sentence><sentence id="155">Did -- Did you feel, because you were behind in your schooling, did -- did that make you feel -- a-and your experience was different from others in the village, I -- I assume, so wh -- did you feel alienated or -- or set apart from -- from your -- your classmates? </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="156">A: 1-- I do not think that I felt alienated from my classmates, maybe because all of them were on the nine year track, rather than on the 12 year track. </sentence><sentence id="157">And simply, they were too young to have had first hand experience with the Nazis or Jews, because they grew up under normal conditions, with the exception of -- of -- of the war years. </sentence><sentence id="158">But in Zenoimal, a great percentage of the students in the nine -- in -- in -- in the lower grades, commuted from neighboring villages. </sentence><sentence id="159">And they were sons of farmers, who basically didn't feel the war in the same fashion like people who were living in the cities. </sentence><sentence id="160">Because in the -- in the outlying areas, you know, the Nazis didn't had such a tight control like over the population of -- of -- of larger cities. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="166">Q: Mm-hm. </sentence><sentence id="167">Who were most of -- who were your friends? </sentence><sentence id="168">Did you make close friend during that period? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="172">A: I made some friends, simply because -- I got to tell you something, I was not tremendously interested in catching up with my academic deficiencies, simply because I didn't had a -- a specific goal in mind. </sentence><sentence id="173">While I was going to school in Zenoimal, it never occurred to me, "Gosh, in -- in a year or two I will be finished, what do I do then?" </sentence><sentence id="174">It -- It never occurred to me. </sentence><sentence id="175">I -- during the war, because of my being locked up always in -- in rooms, I had tremendous energy, which first had to be satisfied. </sentence><sentence id="176">And, as a result, I played soccer. </sentence><sentence id="177">I was very good at soccer. </sentence><sentence id="178">Although, because of my physical -- being physically weak, I didn't -- I wasn't able to run for a    USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0034 8 long time. </sentence><sentence id="179">But still, 1 was a very good soccer player in my own group of youngsters. </sentence><sentence id="180">So, most of the time, I tried to catch up on the physical activities, which I missed during the war, rather than on the emotional side. </sentence><sentence id="181">The physical deficiencies came to me more naturally than the academic development. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="192">Q: What were some of the physical ailments? </sentence><sentence id="193">You said you were weak -- </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="194">A: [had, several times, very bad ear infection. </sentence><sentence id="195">You see, in those days, although penicillin was all ready -- after the war, was already invented, but it was question of availability. </sentence><sentence id="196">So that was -- that was problem number one. </sentence><sentence id="197">Then, when, during your formative years, you are continuously locked up, your body does not get the opportunity to develop physically. </sentence><sentence id="198">And consequently, I -- I was weak, physically and undernourished. </sentence><sentence id="199">So all that, first of all, I had to catch up with. </sentence><sentence id="200">I don't know what I ever caught up. </sentence><sentence id="201">Basically, I will tell you something, I think that I caught up with most of the deficiencies, but I was always out of sync. </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="202">Q: Did you talk with your -- your mates and -- and your schoolmates and friends about your experience during the Holocaust -- during the war? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="204">A: No. </sentence><sentence id="205">Nobody was particularly interested in it. </sentence><sentence id="206">At one time one of my teachers suggested that I write a book. </sentence><sentence id="207">But, you know, coming to a 13 year old boy with a task, why don't you write a book about your experiences, didn't -- didn't sit with me quite, quite well. </sentence><sentence id="208">I didn't see any purpose for it, you know. </sentence><sentence id="209">Because it's -- it's completely different than looking at it in hindsight, 50 years, you know. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="216">Q: You would think that s -- that some of your friends would -- would be curious or -- or perhaps you would be wanting to tell them because there was an adventure about -- I mean, there was partly an adventure. </sentence><sentence id="217">I mean it ma-may not have felt that way to you, but if I were a classmate and    </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="220"> USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0034 9 Thad a friend who'd -- who had done what you did during the war, I might be curious about hearing -- hearing about it. </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="221">A: I don't think -- I don't think that the issue was ever -- ever raised. </sentence><sentence id="222">You know, okay, I'm -- I'm -- you are right, had it happened now. </sentence><sentence id="223">But don't forget, you have to project yourself to those days. </sentence><sentence id="224">Czechoslovakia, for example, looking in hindsight, had only small number of newspapers that were all published in the capital city of Prague. </sentence><sentence id="225">I don't remember ever seeing a local newspaper. </sentence><sentence id="226">Television didn't exist. </sentence><sentence id="227">Radio -- those people who could afford a radio, Czechoslovakia had only two or three radio stations which had three or four times a day news, the news were mostly of international nature. </sentence><sentence id="228">So that news penetrated very, very slowly at -- int - - to the population. </sentence><sentence id="229">Usually news that was of local importance appeared on a bulletin board. </sentence><sentence id="230">Every city had, on -- in the major streets, had big bulletin boards, where some officials used to paste announcements. </sentence><sentence id="231">But otherwise, you simply didn't know what is happening, unless you heard it over the radio, or if you knew a foreign language, to listen to Radio Vienna or -- or -- or some adjacent city, listening to the news that way. </sentence><sentence id="232">So that people didn't know exactly, what was happening -- what happened in the past. </sentence><sentence id="233">And I do not think that people were all that curious to find out somebody else's experiences. </sentence><sentence id="234">Maybe -- Maybe -- Maybe people -- don't forget that Christians in -- in those days, after the war, felt guilty. </sentence><sentence id="235">Because the Judaism in -- in -- in -- in -- in Czechoslovakia, the anti-Semitism was more of a religious character. </sentence><sentence id="236">We Jews were not so much despised by the Czechs because we were wealthy or -- or -- or -- or more successful, but whenever the word Jew was thrown into my face, it was always labeled, you Christ killer. </sentence><sentence id="237">So, you know -- and that was after the war against the law. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="255">Q: So, saying that was against the law? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="257">   USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0034 10 </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="258">A: Yes, against the Czech law, to point out that -- that expression. </sentence><sentence id="259">There was absolutely nothing forbidding to -- to be very antagonistic toward Gypsies, but the Jews were sheltered, as far as that goes. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="262">Q: Did -- Did you experience any blatant anti-Semitism during those years that you were [indecipherable] </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="263">A: After the war. </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="264">Q: After the war? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="266">A: To be very honest with you, no. </sentence><sentence id="267">If there was, it was well hidden. </sentence><sentence id="268">It was not -- not -- not obvious to me. </sentence><sentence id="269">Furthermore, I -- I think I was not even looking for it. </sentence><sentence id="270">I have not -- not memory that I have experienced anything of that sort. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="276">Q: Did you have Jewish friends? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="278">A: Zenoimal had very, very small Jewish population. </sentence><sentence id="279">I -- I -- I think that there were about half a dozen Jewish families in -- in all of Zenoimal. </sentence><sentence id="280">No, I don't remember any -- I don't remember nobody my own age bracket. </sentence><sentence id="281">There were a couple Jewish families, but these people very much older. </sentence><sentence id="282">They were more my parents age. </sentence><sentence id="283">And then I was -- I had no particular reason to seek out Jews. </sentence><sentence id="284">I felt very comfortably with Christian friends. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="292">Q: That's a pretty difficult age, adol -- End of Tape One, Side A Beginning Tape One, Side B </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="293">Q: That's a pretty difficult age, adolescence, for anybody. </sentence><sentence id="294">Given that what you had gone through from ages, what, nine to 13? </sentence><sentence id="295">Was your adolescence -- do you remember it as being a happy time? </sentence><sentence id="296">A -- A difficult time? </sentence><sentence id="297">Or -- Or -- Or fairly normal? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="303">   USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0034 11 </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="304">A: 1-- I -- I don't -- I cannot recall my feelings, but I didn't see anything extremely difficult in it. </sentence><sentence id="305">It was more of a physical discomfort. </sentence><sentence id="306">And simply I -- I think that we all were resigned to our fate. </sentence><sentence id="307">I did not know of the alternatives. </sentence><sentence id="308">Somehow it was made clear to me that complaining will not help, that we simply have to wait out end of the war. </sentence><sentence id="309">And I recognized that fact and tried to make -- not fight it. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="316">Q: What was your relationship with your parents during the period from the end of the war to the time you went to Israel? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="318">A: That was -- that was a little bit strange. </sentence><sentence id="319">My father and my mother had frequent fights, but I never knew exactly the nature of the fights, because they were all done in my absence. </sentence><sentence id="320">You know, children, if they're left out -- whenever something very serious took place, the children were sent out of the room, or parents waited for the children, while they were in school or outside, to -- to settle their differences. </sentence><sentence id="321">So there was a tension between my parents, but the tension was also caused, to a great deal, by my sister, who was no longer living with us. </sentence><sentence id="322">She was eight years older than I and she was trying to find her own way, recognizing that the c-city of Zenoimal d-does not have many opportunities to offer her. </sentence><sentence id="323">Furthermore, she was already marriage age, so she was living in -- in Prague and later on in Burno, in Brinn, working as a secretary -- steno for some firms. </sentence><sentence id="324">So there were also tensions caused because of her. </sentence><sentence id="325">But overall, the time after the war was not -- before I left for Israel, was not entirely smooth. </sentence><sentence id="326">And only later, when I came to Israel, I realized why. </sentence><sentence id="327">But by then, I was already thousands of miles away, not being in the position to influence the situation one way or the other. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="338">Q: And what was it that you realized at that point? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="340">A: Okay. </sentence><sentence id="341">Now, I have to go a little bit back to talk about the last days prior to departure to Israel. </sentence><sentence id="342">Ido not know whether, in retrospect -- I have to mention that after leaving for Israel, I have    USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0034 12 never seen my parents again. </sentence><sentence id="343">Consequently, I cannot ask them for details of those days. </sentence><sentence id="344">But, my father arranged for me to go to -- to emigrate to Israel with a group of youngsters my age. </sentence><sentence id="345">I have met with part of that group. </sentence><sentence id="346">Neither one of -- of the group was from Zenoimal, they all were dispersed throughout Czechoslovakia, but these individuals were already together a year or two in preparation for pioneering life in Israel. </sentence><sentence id="347">So, I was attached to that group. </sentence><sentence id="348">And that group belonged to a very left oriented political party. </sentence><sentence id="349">It was almost Communism. </sentence><sentence id="350">That -- the group had aimed to emigrate to Israel and supplement membership of a kibbutz -- very left oriented kibbutz. </sentence><sentence id="351">And I felt extremely uncomfortable after arriving in Israel, in that kibbutz type surrounding. </sentence><sentence id="352">Because, I was exposed to the Communist propaganda in 1948 and I was able to realize that the Russians were extremely anti-Semitic. </sentence><sentence id="353">So, I began to realize that I fled Communism of Czechoslovakia, just to come into a different form of Communism in Israel. </sentence><sentence id="354">But it -- it -- it was not initiated in my mind by -- so much by politics, but by various actions of that group, to which I supposedly had to conform to their way of life. </sentence><sentence id="355">For example, all the personal clothes -- clothing were taken away. </sentence><sentence id="356">They were all arranged in a group type -- communal type bank. </sentence><sentence id="357">You got clothing, two sets a week, depending on your size. </sentence><sentence id="358">You didn't know whose clothing you are wearing. </sentence><sentence id="359">Meals were given in a mess hall. </sentence><sentence id="360">Every morning you have to look at your schedule where you were attached to work that day. </sentence><sentence id="361">So I became extremely bitter, fleeing from Communism in Czechoslovakia, facing myself with Israeli

</sentence><sentence id="472">And that labor camp that was laying that pipeline, was on the edge of the desert Negev, about two hours by car from Tel Aviv. </sentence><sentence id="473">And that village that I was obligated to, was on the border of Jordan and Israel, where this was deeper, in the southern part of Israel. </sentence><sentence id="474">And in the labor camp -- it was a regular labor camp with the barracks made of wood. </sentence><sentence id="475">Every morning you exit to work on the pipeline and in the evening you return. </sentence><sentence id="476">There was a mess hall. </sentence><sentence id="477">You were paid regularly -- a regular salary according to classification of your particular work. </sentence><sentence id="478">And there I stayed for about a year, I think. </sentence><sentence id="479">In the meantime -- now I began to realize what was happening back in Czechoslovakia. </sentence><sentence id="480">A radio announced the trials took place -- I don't know whether you are familiar with that, in -- in the 50's, quite few ministers of the Czech Republic were sentence to be hanged. </sentence><sentence id="481">You know, these were out of made -- made up trials, accusing them of being spies for the US And Stalin was simply out of his mind by -- by -- the Communist regime was very, very tight in Czechoslovakia. </sentence><sentence id="482">Then one day, I received letter that my mother committed suicide, and now I have to go back again. </sentence><sentence id="483">Some place and some times, during the war, when we were hiding in the mountains, in the bunker, two fellows, young fellows, came to the bunker and I don't know until this day how did they found us, suggesting that we should return, that they actually will help us across the border, back to Protecterat. </sentence><sentence id="484">Because Protecterat, by that time, was cleared of Jews. </sentence><sentence id="485">And if we will be in hiding in Protecterat, the Germans will have no reason to look for us, because all the Jews were already sent to concentration camps. </sentence><sentence id="486">So I don't know the fine points, where we were to hide on the other side, but they were guiding us from the bunker, across the border, back to Protecterat, when we were to rest in a tourist resort, which was exactly on the border. </sentence><sentence id="487">And as we approached the tourist resort, subtly we heard barking of dogs. </sentence><sentence id="488">And that usually was a bad sign. </sentence><sentence id="489">So these two guys told us to wait, that they will go and take a look USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0034 16 why the dogs are barking and they simply never came back. </sentence><sentence id="490">So, we returned to the bunker. </sentence><sentence id="491">And now events took place as I said before, normal. </sentence><sentence id="492">We waited out the war without knowing what happened to these two guys. </sentence><sentence id="493">After the war, we were called as witnesses to court. </sentence><sentence id="494">These two boys were supposedly caught in that resort by the Germans and forced to collaborate. </sentence><sentence id="495">I don't know exactly what that meant -- these were young fellows, in -- in their early 20's -- what was actually meant by collaborations, but in the early years, after the war, there were criminal cases by the hundreds, throughout the whole Czechoslovakia, against various collaborants with the Nazis. </sentence><sentence id="496">That took place long before the Communists took over Czech Republic. </sentence><sentence id="497">And we were called witn -- to be -- be witnesses on behalf of these two fellows. </sentence><sentence id="498">And I do not remember exactly what sentence did these two boys got or whether they were liberated. </sentence><sentence id="499">Unfortunately that did not end there. </sentence><sentence id="500">In 1948, while I was in the textile school, I started having feeling that not everything is okay at home, but I was unable to put my finger on it. </sentence><sentence id="501">Namely, every month, I came for

or what -- what -- what was nature of their conflict. </sentence><sentence id="503">So, sometimes -- and I don't know exactly what time period, was I able to begin to put things together. </sentence><sentence id="504">I suspect that the first time I got some form of picture in 1965, when I visited Czechoslovakia back for the first time. </sentence><sentence id="505">The following thing has developed. </sentence><sentence id="506">These two boys joined a -- became member of a club, American - Czechoslovak friendship. </sentence><sentence id="507">And when Communists took over Czechoslovakia, they began to arrest all the members of this club. </sentence><sentence id="508">And the two fellows approached my mother, because we lived so near Austrian border, whether she can help them to escape to Austria. </sentence><sentence id="509">And it was a whole group of Czech patriots in Zenoimal, who were involved in helping to escape -- various people. </sentence><sentence id="510">There was custom officials involved in it. </sentence><sentence id="511">Postal officials involved in it. </sentence><sentence id="512">They smuggled people on trucks USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0034 17 that went across the border to de-de-deliver packages. </sentence><sentence id="513">So people were hiding behind the packages. </sentence><sentence id="514">But nevertheless, the Secret Police got wind of it and arrested the whole group of people, including my mother, and put them on trial. </sentence><sentence id="515">And I still have at home, documents of the trial, the whole protocol. </sentence><sentence id="516">I do not remember when -- how long the trial took place -- for how long, but my mother was freed, simply because she claimed that she wanted to -- to repay the boys their goodness that they helped us to -- tried to help us during the war. </sentence><sentence id="517">She was freed. </sentence><sentence id="518">But the Secret Czech Police tried to convert my mother into a snitch to spy on others. </sentence><sentence id="519">My mother was imprisoned for about half a year. </sentence><sentence id="520">And in 1952 or "53, out of desperation, she jumped out of the window of the police station. </sentence><sentence id="521">And that -- what I got in a letter notice while I was in that labor camp in Israel, building the pipeline, I got a letter from my sister. </sentence><sentence id="522">So, as time went by, bits and piece of -- of the pieces began to -- to make sense what was happening. </sentence><sentence id="523">And even though my parents send me to Israel, they promised that they will join me in the next transport. </sentence><sentence id="524">And looking at it back now, I think there are two versions -- two possibilities. </sentence><sentence id="525">The Czech government began to realize that it is letting too many medical doctors out of Czechoslovakia and they are weakening their own economy. </sentence><sentence id="526">So they stopped issuing emigration permits to medical doctors. </sentence><sentence id="527">That is one possibility. </sentence><sentence id="528">The other possibility is that my mother was
