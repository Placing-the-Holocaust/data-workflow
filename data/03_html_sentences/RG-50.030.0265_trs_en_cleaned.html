<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="78">Q: What was it like as children together in your household? </sentence><sentence id="79">How do you remember it? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="82">A: Well, one of my most wonderful memories are those days. </sentence><sentence id="83">And one of my saddest memories is that day when Hitler finally came to power. </sentence><sentence id="84">We didn't have televisions, but we had the radios. </sentence><sentence id="85">And everywhere, even in the streets, they blared out the Hitler music. </sentence><sentence id="86">And I remember very well my father. </sentence><sentence id="87">He assembled us that same night in 1933. </sentence><sentence id="88">And he said, "Look now, you see what has happened. </sentence><sentence id="89">And I want you to know that in our home, nothing will change. </sentence><sentence id="90">We will have the same values. </sentence><sentence id="91">We believe the same thing. </sentence><sentence id="92">We will be the same as we always are." </sentence><sentence id="93">But, he said, "We've got to be extremely careful now because we are known." </sentence><sentence id="94">My father was a very known educator in Hamburg. </sentence><sentence id="95">And he said, "You must learn to be quiet, not to shout "Heil Hitler", but to be quiet on the outside because this is the only hope we can survive this." </sentence><sentence id="96">And true enough, the next morning several of his SS (ph) men came to our house early in the morning. </sentence><sentence id="97">They wish to come early so that they knew you were there. </sentence><sentence id="98">They asked for my father. </sentence><sentence id="99">But my father at that time already had a rather advanced case of Parkinson's disease, which really was a blessing because they couldn't transport him and they would have had all kinds of things to get him out there. </sentence><sentence id="100">And since my father was a rather known man, a rather known educator in Germany, they were a little bit afraid to begin this, to rock the boat too much. </sentence><sentence id="101">So, they left him alone. </sentence><sentence id="102">And I can almost say since and very soon afterwards, he died. </sentence><sentence id="103">So, he was spared. </sentence><sentence id="104">But the very same day after that happened, that the Nazis came to our house, I remember too well my father got us all together -- us four children and a mother. </sentence><sentence id="105">And he said, "Now you see what has happened, what is happening. </sentence><sentence id="106">But in our home everything will be the same. </sentence><sentence id="107">On the contrary, for now on we will be much more together than we ever been before. </sentence><sentence id="108">And I urge you not to be afraid." </sentence><sentence id="109">I remember that today. " </sentence><sentence id="110">Don't be afraid." </sentence><sentence id="111">We were afraid. </sentence><sentence id="112">Because known as my parents were in that community, we were really very much a target of being arrested. </sentence><sentence id="113">And the only reason that my father was not arrested because they came... At that time he was already so far advanced in his disease that they just let him alone and said, "Well, he's dying anyway. </sentence><sentence id="114">He's gone." </sentence><sentence id="115">So, that was the beginning. </sentence><sentence id="116">And I will tell you from there on, we really were about the closest knit family you ever have seen or ever have experienced. </sentence><sentence id="117">Because we lived in our own home. </sentence><sentence id="118">We had our values as we always had. </sentence><sentence id="119">We could be open with each other. </sentence><sentence id="120">And very soon we got a tiny little radio. </sentence><sentence id="121">You see, many, many years ago, you didn't have all these wonderful television and radios. </sentence><sentence id="122">You got a tiny little radio. </sentence><sentence id="123">We never were very interested in radio, but for now on we always start to turn. </sentence><sentence id="124">Do you know what we were looking for?Finally, one day we found it. </sentence><sentence id="125">The radio from London. </sentence><sentence id="126">That was... </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="175">Q: From London? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="177">A: From London, yes. </sentence><sentence id="178">We lived in Hamburg. </sentence><sentence id="179">From London. </sentence><sentence id="180">Finally we got a voice from freedom. </sentence><sentence id="181">And from there on really morning, noon and night, whenever we had a spare minute, we listened to that radio which gave us the truth. </sentence><sentence id="182">I never forget that because it was almost an obsession. </sentence><sentence id="183">Don't ask me for television because we didn't have it at that time. </sentence><sentence id="184">We had only very tiny little radio. </sentence><sentence id="185">So, it was not all terrible grief because somehow this brought us together. </sentence><sentence id="186">And our Jewish friends -- and we had quite a few Jewish friends -- we'd gather together. </sentence><sentence id="187">Not anymore in the daytime. </sentence><sentence id="188">We came to them in the dark, after night. </sentence><sentence id="189">Or they came to us in the dark of the night. </sentence><sentence id="190">And very soon, of course, things got very dangerous. </sentence><sentence id="191">I mean, Hitler was very smart. </sentence><sentence id="192">He had a way of finding the elite and try to decapitate them. </sentence><sentence id="193">It's an old system of any dictator. </sentence><sentence id="194">If you do that, of course, the rest will go. </sentence><sentence id="195">And, so, the arrest came at night. </sentence><sentence id="196">And I must tell you that my father not only was a very known educator, but he had also written the books about the literature (ph) and was really known all over Germany. </sentence><sentence id="197">And the Nazis knew that he was quite ill already, so they let him be. </sentence><sentence id="198">But I remember one day an SS (ph) man coming to us and he said, "Just remember you better be very quiet because you are observed." </sentence><sentence id="199">And that we felt very much. </sentence><sentence id="200">But now, none of us has ever been arrested. </sentence><sentence id="201">So, we were very fortunate that way. </sentence><sentence id="202">And now, so, it was very difficult so far because what they did indirectly they tried to harm us. </sentence><sentence id="203">We didn't have too much money. </sentence><sentence id="204">To study in Germany was very expensive. </sentence><sentence id="205">This was really a question of having money. </sentence><sentence id="206">And what they did is they simply cut out all the assistance, which otherwise gifted children and people who didn't have all the means to study, all this was cut away from us. </sentence><sentence id="207">Because they said, "Well, you are not Nazi. </sentence><sentence id="208">You're not in the Party. </sentence><sentence id="209">If you show us good will, we will help us." </sentence><sentence id="210">And that good will did not come forth. </sentence><sentence id="211">So, from there on really our house was more or less like a beehive. </sentence><sentence id="212">From morning to night -- and that started about in "34 -- we had children from all kind of schools whom we tutored. </sentence><sentence id="213">And this really could get the money for our daily living. </sentence><sentence id="214">Because the very same day when Hitler came to power, three SR (ph) men came through the house of my father and was to the office -- the office school -- and said "this is it", and led him out. </sentence><sentence id="215">It was a tremendous fortune that they didn't arrest him. </sentence><sentence id="216">We understood why they didn't do it. </sentence><sentence id="217">My father was a very known educator all over Germany because he had written quite a number of books. </sentence><sentence id="218">And to begin this, they went rather lightly on it, of the very prominent people. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="262">Q: Was he a known anti-Nazi? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="264">A: He was a known Democrat. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="266">Q: Social Democrat? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="268">A: Yeah -- No, he was the Democratic Party. </sentence><sentence id="269">He was a very religious man. </sentence><sentence id="270">My mother was a very known Social Democrat. </sentence><sentence id="271">My father always called her his left wife, you know?(laughter) He was more . . . </sentence><sentence id="272">I think he was a thinker. </sentence><sentence id="273">He was a philosopher. </sentence><sentence id="274">A man who really stood for political and this kind of thing. </sentence><sentence id="275">He was an ethicist, I would say. </sentence><sentence id="276">A man we admired greatly. </sentence><sentence id="277">The good this was first he was invited out of school. </sentence><sentence id="278">That had to be expected because they all knew where he stood. </sentence><sentence id="279">But the good thing that he wasn't arrested was that he, at that time, already had Parkinson's disease and was really rather ill. </sentence><sentence id="280">So, they left him alone. </sentence><sentence id="281">They even came one day and they said, "Well, at this point, we will leave you alone because you are rather known in the community" -- over Germany, really, his name -- "But we warn you. </sentence><sentence id="282">We warn you." </sentence><sentence id="283">With that they left. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="301">Q: Dr. Zassenhaus, you had an incident in school, in high school . . . </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="303">A: Yes, yes. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="305">Q: ... when the Nazis took over. </sentence><sentence id="306">Could you talk about that? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="309">A: Very soon after Hitler came to power, the new order was passed. </sentence><sentence id="310">For now on, whenever a teacher entered the class at the end of six times every day -- different teachers - we had all to race and then we had to throw our right arm in the air and shout as loud as we could, "Heil Hitler". </sentence><sentence id="311">Now don't forget, I was at that time about 15 or 16 years old. </sentence><sentence id="312">I immediately said, "That I can't do." </sentence><sentence id="313">And I came home and told my parents about the new order. </sentence><sentence id="314">I was very disturbed about it. </sentence><sentence id="315">I'd look at the faces and hope that they would give me some advice. </sentence><sentence id="316">I remember so very much my father said, "What will you do?" </sentence><sentence id="317">I said, "I will not do it." </sentence><sentence id="318">And he said, "Well, are you aware of the consequences?" </sentence><sentence id="319">And my mother said to me: "Hiltgunt, this is something you must decide for yourself." </sentence><sentence id="320">I never forgot that. </sentence><sentence id="321">And I looked at her, because somehow I hoped she would give me some advice. </sentence><sentence id="322">So, the next morning before I left, they asked me both, "What have you decided?" </sentence><sentence id="323">And I started to cry. </sentence><sentence id="324">I said, "Tell me." </sentence><sentence id="325">My father said very quietly, "You must decide this for yourself." </sentence><sentence id="326">It was one of the days which were very decisive in my life. </sentence><sentence id="327">| remember I come into school. </sentence><sentence id="328">I was on the last bench in school in my classroom. </sentence><sentence id="329">All the girls knew about me. </sentence><sentence id="330">They knew because not -- I was not very important, but my father was rather known. </sentence><sentence id="331">Everybody knew where he stood. </sentence><sentence id="332">And know since the order had been passed. </sentence><sentence id="333">Whenever the teacher would enter, we would have to raise our right arm and shout, "Heil Hitler." </sentence><sentence id="334">And so the teacher comes in. </sentence><sentence id="335">I stood there, my arms glued at my sides. </sentence><sentence id="336">She beckoned me to her and she said, "Now as of tomorrow you will say "Heil Hitler" and you will raise your right arm. </sentence><sentence id="337">I give you 24 hours to think about it." </sentence><sentence id="338">That was one of the most upsetting days. </sentence><sentence id="339">I came home. </sentence><sentence id="340">I told my parents. </sentence><sentence id="341">I asked them, "What am I to do? </sentence><sentence id="342">What shall I do?" </sentence><sentence id="343">I never forgot the answer. </sentence><sentence id="344">My mother said, "You must decide for yourself." </sentence><sentence id="345">In the evening, I remember my father came to my bedside and he said, "Are you aware that whatever you do might be the end of your education?" </sentence><sentence id="346">I spent a sleepless night. </sentence><sentence id="347">I've never forgotten it. </sentence><sentence id="348">I still remember it as it was today. </sentence><sentence id="349">The next day I come to school. </sentence><sentence id="350">All the students in my classroom they're very eager now they all knew about it. </sentence><sentence id="351">My father being so known, they wanted to what is she going to do. </sentence><sentence id="352">I remember as today, it was a beautiful day in Spring. </sentence><sentence id="353">The windows were open. </sentence><sentence id="354">Everything was so beautiful outside and inside. </sentence><sentence id="355">There was not a decision to make. </sentence><sentence id="356">And don't forget, I was just a very young person, probably very immature. </sentence><sentence id="357">The teacher comes in. </sentence><sentence id="358">All the heads, arms up. </sentence><sentence id="359">The heads all turn to me, what will she do? </sentence><sentence id="360">In my desperation, I raised my left arm and I put it right through the open window until the glass broke. </sentence><sentence id="361">There was a general scream: "What has she done?" </sentence><sentence id="362">Blood poured from my arm. </sentence><sentence id="363">I was rushed to the hospital. </sentence><sentence id="364">That was the end of that story. </sentence><sentence id="365">And I must tell you, nobody ever looked into my direction. </sentence><sentence id="366">They just left me alone. </sentence><sentence id="367">Somehow, and as today after so many years, I think maybe it was very foolish. </sentence><sentence id="368">But somehow for me it was the beginning of the way I had to go. </sentence><sentence id="369">So many times now I think about it. </sentence><sentence id="370">Why did I do it? </sentence><sentence id="371">Why not just go along with that little? </sentence><sentence id="372">But, no, in retrospect I feel that was the decisive moment. </sentence><sentence id="373">I had to do what I later would do. </sentence><sentence id="374">The interesting thing is for now on, from then on, never anybody looked into my direction. </sentence><sentence id="375">They just let me do as odd ball (ph). </sentence><sentence id="376">They said hear no nothing, see no nothing. </sentence><sentence id="377">Since then, I passed my examination. </sentence><sentence id="378">They let me go to school so that I could study later on. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="451">Q: Why do you think they .. . </sentence><sentence id="452">Is it because of . . .? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="455">A: Certainly not for me. </sentence><sentence id="456">I think it was because of the reputation of my father. </sentence><sentence id="457">He was himself a very know educator in Germany. </sentence><sentence id="458">He had written books. </sentence><sentence id="459">Books which are still studied and learned about, learned from. </sentence><sentence id="460">And so I think it was really more a silent gist -- hear no nothing, see no nothing. </sentence><sentence id="461">So, they let me through. </sentence><sentence id="462">I passed my examination -- the only way I could to enter university. </sentence><sentence id="463">However, my feelings, the feelings of my family, were exactly the same. </sentence><sentence id="464">I had the feeling I could not live any more in Germany. </sentence><sentence id="465">I would not be happy there any more. </sentence><sentence id="466">I just couldn't wait any more. </sentence><sentence id="467">So, what I decided is that I one day said I have somewhere to go that is next to me. </sentence><sentence id="468">And next to Hamburg was really Denmark. </sentence><sentence id="469">Not far away. </sentence><sentence id="470">About five hours away. </sentence><sentence id="471">This is where I went. </sentence><sentence id="472">This is how I started to get interested in the Scandinavian languages. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="492">Q: And that was the summer after high school? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="494">A: The summer after high . .. </sentence><sentence id="495">When after I had my examination, it was really finished. </sentence><sentence id="496">So, that began the idea why shouldn't I study Scandinavian languages. </sentence><sentence id="497">Yes, and that is what I did. </sentence><sentence id="498">And that took off. </sentence><sentence id="499">Of course, at the time I had all my examination, my degree. </sentence><sentence id="500">And the amazing thing is now in retrospective, maybe really there is somebody higher than me who leads us to what we have to do. </sentence><sentence id="501">Because it was an outrageous idea to study Scandinavian languages. </sentence><sentence id="502">It's very rare, and really not much you could do with it. </sentence><sentence id="503">And my parents always asked me, "Is it really what you want to do? </sentence><sentence id="504">What will you really do with it?" </sentence><sentence id="505">Somehow I felt .. . [ </sentence><sentence id="506">had been there on a visit that was a visit that was a free country. </sentence><sentence id="507">I liked that country. </sentence><sentence id="508">There was no Hitler. </sentence><sentence id="509">So, here comes the war. </sentence><sentence id="510">Here come all the arrests of the Scandinavian people because Germany invaded Scandinavia, as you know. </sentence><sentence id="511">And, of course, the old principal of Hitler prevailed. </sentence><sentence id="512">He always arrested the elite of the country to decapitate the country. </sentence><sentence id="513">That was a very cheap little trick to do, which it somehow always paralyzed people. </sentence><sentence id="514">So this elite now came to . . . </sentence><sentence id="515">I'm jumping now. </sentence><sentence id="516">I come now from "33 to the war -- to "39. </sentence><sentence id="517">And as soon as he invaded Scandinavia, the same thing. </sentence><sentence id="518">He goes to the elite. </sentence><sentence id="519">Spiritual (ph) elite was arrested. </sentence><sentence id="520">Anybody who resisted Hitler, they were arrested. </sentence><sentence id="521">And now they had the problem. </sentence><sentence id="522">They got them, brought them to concentration camps where people simply were murdered. </sentence><sentence id="523">As you know, as we all know here. </sentence><sentence id="524">But they such overflow, and also there was one good thing for the Norwegian and Danish. </sentence><sentence id="525">They were non-Jews. </sentence><sentence id="526">This idea of Hitler -- northern (ph) -- this idea. </sentence><sentence id="527">So, somehow that saved them from coming there in the concentration camp and being killed. </sentence><sentence id="528">They were sent to the prisons. </sentence><sentence id="529">The German prisons were no fun either, I can assure you. </sentence><sentence id="530">But yet they starved there. </sentence><sentence id="531">They were ill. </sentence><sentence id="532">But they were not murdered. </sentence><sentence id="533">And now these things where I come in. </sentence><sentence id="534">They needed now for these prisons somebody who spoke the Scandinavian languages. </sentence><sentence id="535">And here comes the mystery of life. </sentence><sentence id="536">Believe it or not I was the only person in Germany who had the necessary academic degrees for this. </sentence><sentence id="537">That I could work at the prisons. </sentence><sentence id="538">Supervise them, send out the mail (ph), send out anything, any outside connection they might have. </sentence><sentence id="539">Why would they be sent there in the first place?Why was no one killed? </sentence><sentence id="540">See, there was. </sentence><sentence id="541">In the prisons, you didn't just kill people. </sentence><sentence id="542">That was in the concentration camps. </sentence><sentence id="543">So, they needed to do the academic way. </sentence><sentence id="544">And Hitler himself had to agree that I was the person, because I was the only one who had all the academic examinations in it. </sentence><sentence id="545">That was very important for that kind of position. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="600">Q: And was your being a woman an issue? </sentence></p></dialogue>

So, this started the work which now then followed in the four years. </sentence><sentence id="1007">I was very happy to say that I did it my way. </sentence><sentence id="1008">I did it frankly in a way that my two pastors were sometimes very angry and felt I took too many chances. </sentence><sentence id="1009">They said one day very angry, "We can't go along with it any more. </sentence><sentence id="1010">You do too much. </sentence><sentence id="1011">First you lose your head and what happens then?" </sentence><sentence id="1012">They were, of course, I could understand, they were afraid for their life. </sentence><sentence id="1013">I never forgot that moment. </sentence><sentence id="1014">I looked at the two of them and I said: "You know, I must tell you. </sentence><sentence id="1015">I would rather lose my head than my heart." </sentence><sentence id="1016">And so that's a tune (ph) for there on. </sentence><sentence id="1017">I'm happy to say that they will not die, that maybe soon I can say at that time I did all that was necessary and what could be done. </sentence><sentence id="1018">It still makes me very, very happy. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1372">A: Of course, little by little also the medicine. </sentence><sentence id="1373">There was no medicine, certainly not for the prisons. </sentence><sentence id="1374">I began to collect medicine. </sentence><sentence id="1375">I had our own doctor. </sentence><sentence id="1376">Our own physician was a man, a very right-winged German, very -- how should I say --patalotic (ph), and yet he was a human being. </sentence><sentence id="1377">I mean, I could see what the Nazis did, he felt. </sentence><sentence id="1378">You see, there was still a little different being a patalotic(ph) German, but being a Nazi. </sentence><sentence id="1379">There was a little bit difference. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1482">Q: Did you see the prisoners one by one, or did a group come in and see you? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1484">A: I tried to do it by groups because, see, in Hamburg I had 800 prisoners. </sentence><sentence id="1485">In order to cover as many people as possible, I always tried to have four, five, six people at the same time. </sentence><sentence id="1486">See, there is a miracle of the human heart. </sentence><sentence id="1487">The miracle. </sentence><sentence id="1488">I call it the miracle. </sentence><sentence id="1489">None of these people ever revealed me. </sentence><sentence id="1490">See, if only one of them had said something -- one of the prisoners -- they would have had some. </sentence><sentence id="1491">They would have gotten more bread. </sentence><sentence id="1492">They would have gotten some things, some reward. </sentence><sentence id="1493">None of them. </sentence><sentence id="1494">See, and that in a time when I believed in the human heart was almost nothing anymore, that restored my belief. </sentence><sentence id="1495">That these people in the greatest need they were, they knew exactly why I did it and they knew that this had to go on. </sentence><sentence id="1496">Of course, don't forget these people were not criminals. </sentence><sentence id="1497">These people were the elite of Scandinavia who had been arrested solely for the reason that they had been brave enough to try to lift Hitler's regime. </sentence><sentence id="1498">But I will say still people who were starving, who .. . </sentence><sentence id="1499">hopefully you've never starved. </sentence><sentence id="1500">People who really starve -- I had learned that in my own life -- it takes a tremendous ethical way of being and thinking. </sentence><sentence id="1501">That you don't almost do anything just for a piece of bread. </sentence><sentence id="1502">I learned that in my life how difficult it is -- what starvation really means. </sentence><sentence id="1503">So I will say this experience with my prisoners, my 800 prisoners, which little by little I had to deal with, that nobody ever revealed on me. </sentence><sentence id="1504">Why I'm sure that particular prisoner who would have done that would have been emptied the water (ph). </sentence><sentence id="1505">That have really restored my belief in the human being. </sentence><sentence id="1506">A belief which had been always distorted by the Nazis and by the things I had to fear in my life. </sentence><sentence id="1507">And whenever I have moments where I'm still sad about the human heart and what people can do, I think of that. </sentence><sentence id="1508">I think that was for me the greatest reward. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1694">Q: Dr. Zassenhaus, can you describe your family life with your brothers and your parents and how they raised you, and with what values they raised you? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1696">A: Yes. </sentence><sentence id="1697">I must tell you that my father had studied religious literature and history. </sentence><sentence id="1698">He was an educator and very soon became the head of a rather prestigious school in Hamburg, in Germany, where he also taught a little bit. </sentence><sentence id="1699">He taught mostly ethics and literature. </sentence><sentence id="1700">My mother was a free spirit, which you can see in those days this was very unusual. </sentence><sentence id="1701">Already with age 15, she moved into another city because she came from a very small city, where she was a the first woman in Germany took her full education, her full degree in school, which was very unusual at that time. </sentence><sentence id="1702">Fortunately, she met there the head of that school and fell in love with him. </sentence><sentence id="1703">And that became my father. </sentence><sentence id="1704">So they married. </sentence><sentence id="1705">She never went to the university, which she actually had wanted to do. </sentence><sentence id="1706">Don't forget, it was a different time. </sentence><sentence id="1707">My father very soon was called to Hamburg to a very prestigious school there where he became the head. </sentence><sentence id="1708">Not only that, he also taught history and religion, and wrote the history of Germany, which became a very important book and it's still read in the universities in schools in Germany. </sentence><sentence id="1709">So that was a background I had. </sentence><sentence id="1710">I would say the ideas of Hitler were as far from our family as the moon. </sentence><sentence id="1711">And I remember so very well the very day, the 30th of January, when suddenly now through all the loud speakers -- televisions we didn't have at that time. </sentence><sentence id="1712">Loudspeakers came "the Fuhrer has the power. </sentence><sentence id="1713">Adolf Hitler has come to power." </sentence><sentence id="1714">It was to us almost as somebody shook us and said "the whole house is on fire". </sentence><sentence id="1715">We didn't know. </sentence><sentence id="1716">Especially we were four children. </sentence><sentence id="1717">I had three brothers, all one year apart, and I was the young sister. </sentence><sentence id="1718">When my brother studied at the university, I was still going to school. </sentence><sentence id="1719">I remember as it had been today, although it was, I think, 200 years ago. </sentence><sentence id="1720">Our parents assembled us all together at the table and my father said, "From now on, things will be different. </sentence><sentence id="1721">Everything has changed." </sentence><sentence id="1722">And my mother added, "But one thing remains the same. </sentence><sentence id="1723">In our house, everything will be same. </sentence><sentence id="1724">We will be now one family who totally stands together. </sentence><sentence id="1725">But this house has to become a fortress. </sentence><sentence id="1726">Whatever you say outside, it has to be mainly in silence because somehow we have to try to survive." </sentence><sentence id="1727">And very well the next day we found out what she meant with it. </sentence><sentence id="1728">I woke up to a total dark room, although it was a light day. </sentence><sentence id="1729">I could not know what had happened. </sentence><sentence id="1730">I saw at the windows and a hush through the whole house. </sentence><sentence id="1731">And I saw all our windows were sealed with swastikas, with paper, and darkened by that. </sentence><sentence id="1732">Because my father was a rather known educator in Germany who had written books about education and so they wanted to show us now what had happened. </sentence><sentence id="1733">And if we didn't know, my father, of course, immediately was without a job. </sentence><sentence id="1734">He was the head of the school. </sentence><sentence id="1735">At that time, he was already quite ill. </sentence><sentence id="1736">He had Parkinson's disease in a rather progressed shape already. </sentence><sentence id="1737">And I think that really saved his life. </sentence><sentence id="1738">He was so well-known a person that to begin with, the Nazis more or less tried to tread lightly. </sentence><sentence id="1739">And so they let him be at home and let him die in peace. </sentence><sentence id="1740">A couple of months later, he was dead. </sentence><sentence id="1741">And now here my mother was with four children. </sentence><sentence id="1742">I was the youngest. </sentence><sentence id="1743">I was about 16 or 17 years old. </sentence><sentence id="1744">I remember my first school day. </sentence><sentence id="1745">The teacher, a wonderful teacher whom I adored, she taught us history. </sentence><sentence id="1746">She came into our class. </sentence><sentence id="1747">She was very pale. </sentence><sentence id="1748">That is what I noticed immediately. </sentence><sentence id="1749">And she said, "Well girls, I must tell you from now on everything will be different. </sentence><sentence id="1750">And the first thing I will tell you from now on whenever a teacher enters the class, you all have to get up. </sentence><sentence id="1751">You have to raise your right arm and have to shout as loud as possible "Heil Hitler". </sentence><sentence id="1752">That's the way it will be." </sentence><sentence id="1753">I knew her well enough. </sentence><sentence id="1754">I saw the tears in her eyes. </sentence><sentence id="1755">I was disturbed by it. </sentence><sentence id="1756">Why would she even tell us that? </sentence><sentence id="1757">How could she tell us? </sentence><sentence id="1758">I came home. </sentence><sentence id="1759">I was very upset. </sentence><sentence id="1760">I told my parents. </sentence><sentence id="1761">I saw they became very silent. </sentence><sentence id="1762">And somewhat later, they came to meant they said, "Well, what will you do?" </sentence><sentence id="1763">And I said, "Well, what am I to do? </sentence><sentence id="1764">What do you think I should do? </sentence><sentence id="1765">Give me advice. </sentence><sentence id="1766">I cannot raise my right arm. </sentence><sentence id="1767">I will not do this kind of thing." </sentence><sentence id="1768">And they said, "Well, I think we will all think about it somehow." </sentence><sentence id="1769">And so the next morning before I went to school, they came again to meant they said, "Now what have you decided?" </sentence><sentence id="1770">And I said, with tears in my eyes, "What do you think I should do?" </sentence><sentence id="1771">I was desperate. </sentence><sentence id="1772">It was probably one of the really most desperate days of my life, because my father looked very seriously at me and he said, "Hiltgunt, you must decide for yourself." </sentence><sentence id="1773">Totally in that moment, it was the first time that I really felt very alone. </sentence><sentence id="1774">So, I come to school and I had my place at the window. </sentence><sentence id="1775">It was a wonderful day in spring. </sentence><sentence id="1776">That was about when this order had been passed. </sentence><sentence id="1777">Simply for now on should all raise our and place our arm "hail Hitler". </sentence><sentence id="1778">The teacher enters the classroom, the windows were open. </sentence><sentence id="1779">Now all these girls stood straight, raising their right arm. </sentence><sentence id="1780">Curious as they were and as much as these little girls were, they knew where I stood. </sentence><sentence id="1781">The heads all were bent to me. </sentence><sentence id="1782">What will she do? </sentence><sentence id="1783">And in my

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2325">A: I remember the mob, the screaming people. </sentence><sentence id="2326">People I had known as neighbors who suddenly were screaming and raiding Jewish homes. </sentence><sentence id="2327">You could do anything that you wanted. </sentence><sentence id="2328">Anything, just kicked in the windows. </sentence><sentence id="2329">There was nothing. </sentence><sentence id="2330">The Jewish people were arrested, of course, as much as they were there. </sentence><sentence id="2331">My mother was very instrumental of getting Jewish people passports, passbook, whatever. </sentence><sentence id="2332">Whatever worked. </sentence><sentence id="2333">She did wonderful things at that time. </sentence><sentence id="2334">And she was away sometimes for days. </sentence><sentence id="2335">When she came home we would ask her. </sentence><sentence id="2336">She would say, "Please don't ask me." </sentence><sentence id="2337">Because the less we knew, the better for us. </sentence><sentence id="2338">And the less again she knew of my work later on, the better for her. </sentence><sentence id="2339">So, we never talked much with each other because bear in mind the Gestapo had methods which aren't known here. </sentence><sentence id="2340">Methods of torture where not anybody could have. . </sentence><sentence id="2341">.I mean, it was simply humanly impossible. </sentence><sentence id="2342">So, more or less, they could find out everything they wanted once they had you. </sentence><sentence id="2343">So the best thing was really not knowing. </sentence><sentence id="2344">And those dreaded years where we all got very silent, because silence was the best thing. </sentence><sentence id="2345">I knew my mother was often away for days. </sentence><sentence id="2346">I did not ask any question. </sentence><sentence id="2347">Then little by little when all the arrests came and the war came, then when the Germans invaded Norway and Denmark, I had already my exams at that time. </sentence><sentence id="2348">Then I was asked to take totally control over them. </sentence><sentence id="2349">That was one of the highlights of my life. </sentence><sentence id="2350">I thought, "My God, here is a chance. </sentence><sentence id="2351">I can really do something." </sentence><sentence id="2352">But, again, it also meant that I had to become very silent. </sentence><sentence id="2353">Because under torture nobody was holding up. </sentence><sentence id="2354">So, it meant that more or less I had to remove myself from my friends, from my mother as much as I could, so nobody knew what I was doing. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2390">A: Under torture, you can get everything out, everything out. </sentence><sentence id="2391">I learned that from experience. </sentence><sentence id="2392">There is nothing so the main thing was silence, and doing what you felt yourself was necessary, but not involving anybody else because I felt really what I did myself I had to respond. </sentence><sentence id="2393">I would have to be punished myself. </sentence><sentence id="2394">But to involve anybody else was extremely dangerous. </sentence><sentence id="2395">And also the more other people knew, the more danger for you. </sentence><sentence id="2396">Believe me, this country, you see, it's very hard for you to envision. </sentence><sentence id="2397">Under torture, nobody holds up. </sentence><sentence id="2398">Once you are tortured, there is nothing which can hold up. </sentence><sentence id="2399">I knew if I would be discovered. </sentence><sentence id="2400">I didn't even know what my mother was doing, because I knew she did a lot of things. </sentence><sentence id="2401">I didn't even want to know it, because not knowing meant really gracious that you couldn't even invent anything because you wouldn't know. </sentence><sentence id="2402">You have never had the system in this country. </sentence><sentence id="2403">How fortunate you are. </sentence><sentence id="2404">It's very hard for you to envision. </sentence><sentence id="2405">But under the pressure of the Gestapo, nobody could hold up. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2422">Q: Were you ever questioned by the Gestapo? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2424">A: Yes. </sentence><sentence id="2425">I was several times. </sentence><sentence id="2426">I think two or three times I was summoned by the Gestapo. </sentence><sentence id="2427">The interesting thing was we had two systems in Germany. </sentence><sentence id="2428">The one that was the, the legal system, which was the old Germany, and the system you have here. </sentence><sentence id="2429">And I was hired by the legal system to supervise all activities of the political Scandinavian prisoners. </sentence><sentence id="2430">But on the other side was the Gestapo who knew no law and no order. </sentence><sentence id="2431">And they, of course, could do with you what you wanted. </sentence><sentence id="2432">So here was the interesting thing. </sentence><sentence id="2433">I was appointed by the Minister of Justice of the old legal order to take over the total supervision in the prisons. </sentence><sentence id="2434">But, on the other hand, I had the Gestapo who were looking for that woman. </sentence><sentence id="2435">Why would she have such a... waiting for that moment where they could tug(ph) me and clearly give me what was due me according to them. </sentence><sentence id="2436">That was a very interesting relationship. </sentence><sentence id="2437">It's very hard for you people to understand. </sentence><sentence id="2438">So I walked a very thin path. </sentence><sentence id="2439">I had all my credentials there from the highest Minister of Justice from Berlin. </sentence><sentence id="2440">Whenever the Gestapo started to answer, I showed this and said, "Look here, you have to answer these people." </sentence><sentence id="2441">And that was this little double game I led that's really practically saved my life. </sentence><sentence id="2442">That gave me that authority because the interesting thing was again in the prisons there were also very sharp laws. </sentence><sentence id="2443">And I knew these people were practically my prisoners but practically starving to death. </sentence><sentence id="2444">So I said we have to do something. </sentence><sentence id="2445">And I put in the luggage heavy with bread, with medication, mainly vitamins. </sentence><sentence id="2446">I mean, things which we either concentrated which could keep them up. </sentence><sentence id="2447">They did not dare to open my luggage because I again was a very high authority appointed by Berlin. </sentence><sentence id="2448">You see, it's funny how for people here in America don't understand. </sentence><sentence id="2449">It's worked very much by authority and since I had been appointed by high authority, they did not dare examine what I was taking in. </sentence><sentence id="2450">Why I was doing these things because they were afraid of me. </sentence><sentence id="2451">This other world(ph), such a system as we had in Germany, the Nazi system, which is a system which other countries could have too, which is always a potential. </sentence><sentence id="2452">It works on the fear. </sentence><sentence id="2453">The one fears the other. </sentence><sentence id="2454">And he who can instill the most fear will have the upper top. </sentence><sentence id="2455">So my whole policy in dealing with the authorities was to have continuously referred to my connections in Berlin. </sentence><sentence id="2456">And the connections in Berlin had certain for them like Hitler, didn't quite know what they should make of me. </sentence><sentence id="2457">There was another thing they couldn't understand. </sentence><sentence id="2458">They couldn't understand that I was a academic, that I had all the essential examinations for that particular examination exactly understood. </sentence><sentence id="2459">But why oh why would they appoint a woman? </sentence><sentence id="2460">And I was only a woman. </sentence><sentence id="2461">That was very hard to understand, especially for these high Nazi officials. </sentence><sentence id="2462">And so, little by little, a saga developed. </sentence><sentence id="2463">Somehow she must have very high connections to Berlin. ( </sentence><sentence id="2464">laughter) And since I very often said Berlin doesn't like this.(laughter) I had to play my game because not only did I have to save my beloved prisoners but also my own life, the life of my siblings at stake. </sentence><sentence id="2465">If I had really been found out, it would have been tragic, you know? </sentence></p></dialogue>

The greatest insult I still had when my Scandinavian people tried to stop and tell me I was a hero. </sentence><sentence id="2514">I said, "Please don't say that I'm a hero. </sentence><sentence id="2515">I was ever afraid of the next . . . </sentence><sentence id="2516">there's nothing, no hero in me." </sentence><sentence id="2517">But I felt I had to go my way. </sentence><sentence id="2518">That is what I had decided even to the point of this: I would have been killed or hanged. </sentence><sentence id="2519">I think I had to go my way. </sentence><sentence id="2520">When you're very young, I think you can make that kind of decision. </sentence><sentence id="2521">And I must tell you, if such a situation would arise again today, I think I would be able to act the same way. </sentence><sentence id="2522">Thank heaven it has never . . . </sentence><sentence id="2523">that was one of the reasons I came to this country. </sentence><sentence id="2524">I needed, after all this was over and I had survived, I needed to forget. </sentence><sentence id="2525">You see, when everything was over, Scandinavia was so good to me. </sentence><sentence id="2526">You have no idea. </sentence><sentence id="2527">They treated me, I mean I can almost start to cry. </sentence><sentence id="2528">There never was anybody treated better. </sentence><sentence id="2529">They came to me. </sentence><sentence id="2530">The very first moment they came, they sent food. </sentence><sentence id="2531">They then finally invited me to Scandinavia. </sentence><sentence id="2532">I could study. </sentence><sentence id="2533">I could finish my medicine. </sentence><sentence id="2534">There was not a thing they didn't do for me. </sentence><sentence id="2535">And I will never forget that. </sentence><sentence id="2536">The gratitude was overwhelming. </sentence><sentence id="2537">But still when all is said and done and I had passed my examinations, the one thing that had never left me - my memories. </sentence><sentence id="2538">This what was so totally destroyed. </sentence><sentence id="2539">Because I loved Germany. </sentence><sentence id="2540">I loved my country just as you love your country. </sentence><sentence id="2541">And I haven't seen it for years and years. </sentence><sentence id="2542">This total destruction of all I had loved, of the spirit of good, of all these things which was for me Germany. </sentence><sentence id="2543">Somehow I had to try to forget. </sentence><sentence id="2544">I felt Scandinavia was too close to it all. </sentence><sentence id="2545">So after the war I had my examinations there, I studied medicine there. </sentence><sentence id="2546">They were extremely good to me. </sentence><sentence id="2547">And they said, "Now you will stay with us." </sentence><sentence id="2548">Instead, I think, I have to leave. </sentence><sentence id="2549">I have to go where I can forget what happened. </sentence><sentence id="2550">First, they couldn't quite understand that. </sentence><sentence id="2551">But they said, "You have to ." </sentence><sentence id="2552">But they forgave me and they finally said, "If that's what you must do, we will bless you and we will wish you our good wishes." </sentence><sentence id="2553">And I can assure you even today after so many years, if somebody comes from Scandinavia, they will always come to me. </sentence><sentence id="2554">They will not only come to Washington, they come to me. </sentence><sentence id="2555">And that maybe has been even a greater reward for me than all the wonderful kinds of decorations they after bestowed on me. </sentence><sentence id="2556">This gratitude, this remembrance, this love. </sentence><sentence id="2557">That will forever be in my heart. </sentence><sentence id="2558">I'm very grateful for that. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2607">Q: Tell me about -- you and your mother were baking loaves for bread and you were taking them into the prisons? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2609">A: Yes. </sentence><sentence id="2610">That was what I did because it's hard for you to imagine because even in this prison system here in America, it certainly is not very comfortable because I have been visiting prisons here. </sentence><sentence id="2611">But certainly they get fed and, I mean, it's absolutely according to schedule and all this. </sentence><sentence id="2612">But there, it was really was so very little. </sentence><sentence id="2613">starved out. </sentence><sentence id="2614">I mean, they got rations. </sentence><sentence id="2615">It's hard for you to imagine. </sentence><sentence id="2616">Of course, don't forget you only hear about the people who survived. </sentence><sentence id="2617">You know, of course, of the2,000,000 of people who died. </sentence><sentence id="2618">And not only Jewish people, but many, many of our political prisoners from wherever. </sentence><sentence id="2619">Simply overstaffed finally, but there was a certain order in prison still. </sentence><sentence id="2620">It was a minimum. </sentence><sentence id="2621">A minimum of rationing, but it was so that they just could get by if they were strong. </sentence><sentence id="2622">So the young ones survived. </sentence><sentence id="2623">The older ones it was more difficult. </sentence><sentence id="2624">And so what I felt I had to do when I was appointed from Berlin to this special situation, to supervise the visits my Scandinavian political prisoners got, I felt not only do I have to supervise there my way, that's not enough. </sentence><sentence id="2625">But I have also to give them help as much as I could. </sentence><sentence id="2626">And so I had a wonderful idea. </sentence><sentence id="2627">Everybody in Germany was afraid of the air raids and that they would lose everything. </sentence><sentence id="2628">So, I had two very heavy pieces of luggage. </sentence><sentence id="2629">And each time when I went into the prison or into these camps, I filled my luggage with bread, with vitamins, with anything possible to give them nourishment. </sentence><sentence id="2630">And I locked them in and that they never ask you to open it. </sentence><sentence id="2631">They couldn't because there again was the idea a very high position. </sentence><sentence id="2632">I was appointed directly by Berlin. </sentence><sentence id="2633">So whenever they even made a little ask what have you there, I showed them my thing and they said, "Well, but all the luggage. </sentence><sentence id="2634">Why don't you leave it here? </sentence><sentence id="2635">We can keep it here." </sentence><sentence id="2636">I said, "Oh no, that goes right with me because if we are bombed, I will have my luggage. </sentence><sentence id="2637">That is the last thing I have." </sentence><sentence id="2638">And they never dared. </sentence><sentence id="2639">And that is never anybody dared to say, "open the luggage." </sentence><sentence id="2640">Because one opening they would have known what was in it, all these things for the prisoners. </sentence><sentence id="2641">Why did they not dare it? </sentence><sentence id="2642">Because I really had a very high position. </sentence><sentence id="2643">I was above them. </sentence><sentence id="2644">I came more or less as if you think your controller comes to control what you're doing. </sentence><sentence id="2645">So, that was really the tremendous blessing I had. </sentence><sentence id="2646">So isn't this awful how the one fooled the other? </sentence><sentence id="2647">That was the whole game the Gestapo played. </sentence><sentence id="2648">To some extent, they were afraid of me. </sentence><sentence id="2649">I was, of course, very much afraid of them. ( </sentence><sentence id="2650">laughter) But if you knew how to play it, somehow you could really give them help. </sentence><sentence id="2651">What kind of help could I give? </sentence><sentence id="2652">You see, these prisoners were... It's very hard for you even to envision that. </sentence><sentence id="2653">They were at an absolute zero. </sentence><sentence id="2654">But they mostly needed . . . </sentence><sentence id="2655">they needed, of course, nourishment. </sentence><sentence id="2656">They needed medication. </sentence><sentence id="2657">Now, it was nice to carry in bread. </sentence><sentence id="2658">I tried to carry that in. </sentence><sentence id="2659">But that was so little. </sentence><sentence id="2660">What they mainly needed were vitamins, I mean, just to give them the most basic. </sentence><sentence id="2661">Somehow to keep them alive. </sentence><sentence id="2662">And, see, that's what I had in my luggage. </sentence><sentence id="2663">I had two rather heavy pieces of luggage which I had to carry myself because the Norwegian and Danish priests, I could very well understand it, that they could not do this because that was really my risk. </sentence><sentence id="2664">And so I had to carry them myself. </sentence><sentence id="2665">And also by carrying them in myself, since I had this rather high position directly appointed by Berlin, anybody who would ever had dared to say, "open your luggage", and there was a good possibility, I would have said, "Look here, you don't know who your talking with." </sentence><sentence id="2666">And would have uttered a few names off. </sentence><sentence id="2667">The whole system of Nazism, which I think you have found out and understood, is that the one feared the other. </sentence><sentence id="2668">And if you worked on the fear, based on the fear the other had for you, then you somehow could get away. </sentence><sentence id="2669">At least you took a very good chance to do it. </sentence><sentence id="2670">That was really my whole work, and somehow I could do it. </sentence><sentence id="2671">You see, what took place already, very much the prison systems all used different . . . </sentence><sentence id="2672">different prisons. </sentence><sentence id="2673">You see, I went from prison to the other. </sentence><sentence id="2674">How in the world could a woman get such a high job?Because I was only a woman. </sentence><sentence id="2675">In Nazi Germany, the woman was really just there to give children. </sentence><sentence id="2676">That already somehow made them a little bit suspicious. </sentence><sentence id="2677">There must be something special with her if she would get this permission from Berlin. </sentence><sentence id="2678">So, that was already a very good thing. </sentence><sentence id="2679">And so they tried to stay as much as possible out of it. </sentence><sentence id="2680">And at least if they would have said, "open your luggage", which they usually would have done, I would immediately said, "Do you realize who I am?" </sentence><sentence id="2681">That would have been the end of that. </sentence><sentence id="2682">So, the whole system of Nazi, which I think is hard; it's very difficult to understand here is that the one intimidates the other. </sentence><sentence id="2683">It was a system of intimidation. </sentence><sentence id="2684">That is what I had to pay. </sentence><sentence id="2685">It worked very much with me. </sentence><sentence id="2686">Because the good thing was I was a woman and they always felt ifa woman really would get . . . </sentence><sentence id="2687">that's such a hard thing, then she must be something special. </sentence><sentence id="2688">You see, it is a system that the one is fearful of the other. </sentence><sentence id="2689">Because I was just afraid of them, of course.

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2776">Q: Dr. Zassenhaus, when you first had the job censoring letters, they gave you letters from ghettos from Poland, isn't that right? </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2780">Q: Were those the first letters that you were .. .? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2782">A: Those were some of the very first letters. </sentence><sentence id="2783">You see, I was in the censored system because due to by my language ability. </sentence><sentence id="2784">You see, I had also studied English. </sentence><sentence id="2785">It was very by circumstance. </sentence><sentence id="2786">It's all about education. </sentence><sentence id="2787">Scandinavian language, English language, French. </sentence><sentence id="2788">So, they could use me for all these things. </sentence><sentence id="2789">That was how it all started. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2798">Q: But was this a shock to you? </sentence><sentence id="2799">Had you known about the ghettos in Poland? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2802">A: Yes. </sentence><sentence id="2803">I knew that because, see, we had for years and years every night we listened to the English . </sentence><sentence id="2804">We knew about it. </sentence><sentence id="2805">Oh, yes, we were totally aware of whatever the English people knew. </sentence><sentence id="2806">The BBC we knew. </sentence><sentence id="2807">Because night by night we heard that. </sentence><sentence id="2808">Yes, we were fully aware of it. </sentence></p></dialogue>
