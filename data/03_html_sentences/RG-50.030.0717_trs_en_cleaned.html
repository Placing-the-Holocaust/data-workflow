<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="199">A: After I graduated, I went to work for the Commercial Appeal. </sentence><sentence id="200">I was a reporter. </sentence><sentence id="201">And I had this crazy notion that someone was going to discover me and take me to New York, and it happened six months later. </sentence><sentence id="202">And the circumstances of it were that Congress had   passed a selective service bill in August of 1940, and that set off a very large construction program, particularly so in the south/southwest, and I got the story that the war department was going to build a large shellloading plant, ammunition plant, about 85 miles from Memphis. </sentence><sentence id="203">I met the contractor representatives early on, established a good relationship with them, and it was apparent from day one there was going to be a major labor problem, and the problem was that a union shop contractor was hired to build the biggest project that had ever happened in the state of Tennessee in a nonunion area, and they were going to have to negotiate some way that these nonunion people could work at this on this construction job. </sentence><sentence id="204">And the head of the the owner of the engineering and building company that built it, the company that had headquarters in New York and Cleveland, was a very farsighted individual, and he knew that this was going to be a major story because it was the first time in the war construction program that this situation had been encountered, and this was going to be the paradigm of projects of that kind, and he asked me if I could get a leave of absence from the paper to help him through this crisis they were going to have, and he asked me how (Interruption in proceedings.) </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="212">Q: So this is a continuation of a United States Holocaust Memorial Museum interview with Harold Burson. </sentence><sentence id="213">So we were just talking very briefly about your move to New York to work for a construction firm. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="238">A: Yeah. </sentence><sentence id="239">Well, I I figured it would make use I've always considered that my basic skill is writing, and so I felt that I would, very frankly, make more money if I did it as a public relations person than as a news person. </sentence><sentence id="240">I wasn't really very purist on that issue. </sentence><sentence id="241">And he said, "The best way for you to learn our business is to travel with me for awhile," so I traveled with this man for two </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="242">Q: He was the CEO of the company? </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="243">A: He was the owner of the company. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="353">Q: I see. </sentence><sentence id="354">So you were a writer for the news shows? </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="445">A: Well, the direction I got was we want a straightforward account of what went on in the courtroom. </sentence><sentence id="446">And your audiences, you have two principal audiences. </sentence><sentence id="447">One were the million or so American soldiers who were still in Europe; the other was Englishspeaking Germans. </sentence><sentence id="448">And one of the reasons for that was that there were surveys of where people Germans got their news and credibility were done, and the American Forces Network was the most credible news source in Germany for several years after the war, and the reason for it is, is the Germans felt that the Americans would not lie to their own troops. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="579">And I remember the morning after, Tom Dodd, who was Jackson's chief of staff, later became senator from Connecticut, I just happened to pass him going into the courtroom, and he said, "You were pretty rough on the chief last night." </sentence><sentence id="580">And I said to him, "Didn't you think he deserved it?" </sentence><sentence id="581">And he just but what happened was what Jackson's problem was, that he didn't know enough of the history, and he would ask a question, and Goering would usually find something wrong with his question, he got some of the facts mixed up, and, you know, he did not do well. </sentence><sentence id="582">He did well in I wasn't there, but I read his testimony I read his closing speech was a good speech, he did very well, and I understand he wrote most of the stuff himself, but but Jackson himself, you know, was the architect of the whole show. </sentence><sentence id="583">He was the one who really pushed it in the direction that it went. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="589">Q: Did did you ever have an opportunity as a reporter to meet privately with any of the prosecutors, you know, for a briefing for them to explain what you were going to see or was your only interaction seeing what happened in the courtroom itself? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="591">A: Mainly what happened in the courtroom, because, again, Jackson did not encourage his staff to talk to the medi </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="592">A: </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="593">Q: Did any of the other prosecutors? </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="594">A: 1 I don't know what happened, you know, with the French or the British. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="598">A: Oh, yeah, right, yeah. </sentence><sentence id="599">It was it was happening, you know, and almost every day I'd there were very few days when I had trouble figuring out what am I going to lead with. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="602">Q: It was interesting reading a few of your scripts how detailed they were. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="604">A: Yeah. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="606">Q: These were these were not just wire service stories. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="612">A: Yeah. </sentence><sentence id="613">And I I took copious notes, and I when I got the assignment, you know, I started reading about I went over to the International Herald Tribune , and I just went back to the thirties, some of the big events that happened, like Kristallnacht, and some of the earlier reporting on concentration camps, and so, you know, I I tried to prepare myself as much as possible. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="616">Q: Allright. </sentence><sentence id="617">Now, did you were you surprised by the extent of the Nazi depravity? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="620">Because you mentioned you had sort of a general sense of what had happened, but the details were quite astonishing. </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="621">A: Yeah. </sentence><sentence id="622">Well, they you know, the the first time that the pictures of the concentration camps were shown was Nuremberg, and, you know, it was horrendous, you know, and the whole courtroom, you know, you could just hear the gasps, you know, and it really it was really the magnitude. </sentence><sentence id="623">You know, we knew they did these things. </sentence><sentence id="624">The the other point that about the trial itself and the fairness of it, the Germans convicted themselves because of their documentation. </sentence><sentence id="625">And I'll give you an example of that. </sentence><sentence id="626">When Goering was being questioned by MaxwellFife, MaxwellFife said, "What is the first duty of a prisoner of war?" </sentence><sentence id="627">And Goering said, "To escape." </sentence><sentence id="628">And the Luftwaffe, Goering had had responsibility for running the prison camps for all captured Air Force people. </sentence><sentence id="629">They didn't go into the general Army pool of prisoners of war. </sentence><sentence id="630">They were in they called them Luft stalags. </sentence><sentence id="631">And Goering said, "To escape." </sentence><sentence id="632">And he said pulled out a document, and he said, "Do you know have you ever visited this Luft Stalag," whatever the name of it was, and Goering said he was there once or twice. </sentence><sentence id="633">And he said, "Have you ever heard the names," and he read four English pilots; and Goering said, "No, I never heard of them." </sentence><sentence id="634">He said, "Well, were you aware that they tried to escape and were captured and brought back?" </sentence><sentence id="635">And Goering said, "I don't know anything about that." </sentence><sentence id="636">And he said then they like three months later escaped again, and they were brought back, and he said, "Would it surprise you if I told you that they were executed?" </sentence><sentence id="637">And Goering said and he said, "What would you have done if you knew that?" </sentence><sentence id="638">And he said, "I would have reprimanded those who were responsible for doing it." </sentence><sentence id="639">And he pulls out this letter, and it is asking for </sentence></p><p><sentence id="640"> permission to execute them, and Goering not only says "okay," or the equivalent, but he says, "This will show the others what will happen to them if they try to escape." </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="641">Q: You watched this in the courtroom as it unfolded? </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="642">A: Yeah. </sentence><sentence id="643">And Goering was just crestfallen. </sentence><sentence id="644">That's the only time that he really was just didn't know what to say. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="648">Q: Did you recall at all being struck by the Soviet judge or the Soviet prosecutors? </sentence><sentence id="649">Do you recall what kind of role they played? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="652">A: Very neutral. </sentence><sentence id="653">They you know, they were there along just for the ride, and they you know, I don't think they took it really seriously. </sentence><sentence id="654">The the most I got in contact with, at the castle where we stayed, they had converted one of the rooms into a very nice little bar, and in the evenings it was the bar was pretty well full, and there was one Russian who was a jolly sort of a guy, didn't speak any English at all, but he was fascinated by the different kinds of glasses that different drinks came in, and so he would line up everything from Cointreau to Tom Collins practically, like six or eight glasses, ten glasses. </sentence><sentence id="655">And Russians, you know, didn't have any money, and drinks were like 20 cents, so the Americans, you know, would toss money into the pot, and he would drink all these drinks, and he did it night after night. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="660">Q: This is one of the prosecutors? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="662">A: No, no, no. </sentence><sentence id="663">This was one of the news men. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="666">Q: One of the news men. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="668">A: One of the news men. </sentence><sentence id="669">Yeah, one of the news men, yeah, yeah. </sentence><sentence id="670">But, you know, most of them couldn't speak English. </sentence><sentence id="671">There were a couple of them who could, but they were very circumspect. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="676">Q: Put yourself back at this time. </sentence><sentence id="677">Did you feel like you were watching a process that was fair, that seemed like you know, it may not have been perfect justice, but that rough justice was being done at the time? </sentence><sentence id="678">What was your feeling at the time? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="682">A: It was as close as you could come when the winner tries the loser. </sentence><sentence id="683">And one of the questions that we asked Jackson was, "Why do you say that they are being given a fair trial?" </sentence><sentence id="684">And he went into great detail and says, you know, "We let them choose their own lawyers, and so if they wanted a Nazi for a lawyer, we approved that. </sentence><sentence id="685">We paid the lawyers. </sentence><sentence id="686">We gave them a place to work and fitted it out for them. </sentence><sentence id="687">We gave them copies of all the documents before we introduced them." </sentence><sentence id="688">You know, they did whatever they possibly could. </sentence><sentence id="689">And, also, the the judge Judge they could object, and a lot of times the objections were sustained. </sentence><sentence id="690">So | think it came as close as you could get to, you know, AngloSaxon type justice. </sentence><sentence id="691">And the other thing about it that I think speaks in favor of </sentence></p><p><sentence id="692"> what of a fair trial is there was a good deal of variation in the sentences. </sentence><sentence id="693">You know, there was 11, I think, of the 20 </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="694">Q: And some were acquitted, too? </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="695">A: Huh? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="697">Q: And some were acquitted, too? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="699">A: Three were acquitted. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="701">Q: Right. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="703">A: Three were acquitted. </sentence><sentence id="704">One of them should never have been tried, Fritzsche, who was Goebbels" he was like the fourth ranked guy under Goebbels, but but there was none of the rest of them were left, so he he got it. </sentence><sentence id="705">And so they and the judges, you know, saw that, you know, he was not really part of the group, so he was only about 38 years old, too, I think. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="709">Q: Tell us, by the way, speaking of media people, Streicher was obviously convicted and later hung. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="711">A: Hung, yeah. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="713">Q: What were your impressions of Streicher? </sentence><sentence id="714">He comes across as a thug. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="717">A: Oh, a slob. </sentence><sentence id="718">You know, just an uncouth individual. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="721">Q: But did it seem to you that he was on trial, too, even though he was, you know, a you know, a publisher, he wasn't actually a part of the Nazi apparatus? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="723">A: You know, he had very little power, practically no power, as far as running the country is concerned, but but I think I think it was great symbolism to to include him, because he was so, you know you know, back during that period there was hardly a week or two or three weeks that you didn't read about Streicher in the American press as to remarks that he had made or things that he had done, antiSemitic stuff, you know. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="725">Q: So he was really conditioning the public for </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="726">A: Yeah, yeah. </sentence><sentence id="727">And so I I would assume that Streicher was there more for public relations purposes than the fact that he was one of the perpetrators of starting the war or even what he did during the war, you know. </sentence><sentence id="728">He but </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="729">Q: Do you were you at all censored by your by your bosses or did they let you pretty much write what you want? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="731">A: You know, as I've gotten older, the greatest surprise that I think as I've thought over this thing, and particularly the way the information policy of the Army is now, is that literally no one read my script before it went on the air. </sentence><sentence id="732">I read it, and I showed it to my announcer, and every now and then they would say, you know, you are tangling me up in the stuff and could I make the changes, but and and no I never got a negative comment from any of my chain of command. </sentence><sentence id="733">In fact, the only time I ever heard from them was when I got the Jackson thing. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="738">Q: When you really kind of explained how Jackson had messed up? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="740">A: No, no, no, no. </sentence><sentence id="741">When when we got the interview. </sentence><sentence id="742">It was a </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="743">Q: Oh, you had a oneonone interview with Justice Jackson? </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="744">A: Oh, yeah. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="746">Q: Okay. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="761">A: Well, Jackson at the beginning made a statement that he didn't want to make a circus out of this, and that he didn't want any second guessing on each day's testimony, so he, in effect, you know, admonished his own staff, and he said he would give no interviews until the trial was over. </sentence><sentence id="762">I knew his press secretary or got to know him, Gordon Dean, and I said you know, I tried to get through that, and he said, "No, the boss doesn't want to do it. </sentence><sentence id="763">He is afraid if he does something with you, that will break the line." </sentence><sentence id="764">And one night I got the idea that the approach should be that he owes it to the soldiers who are still there to tell them what he is trying to do, and I told called my went up to see my friend and told him, and and he went and told Jackson what my argument was, and he says, you know, they are talking about people who fought this war who some of them, many of them injured, all of them lost friends, and then Jackson agreed, but he wanted the questions submitted in advance. </sentence><sentence id="765">And he did not change and he didn't change the questions either. </sentence><sentence id="766">He </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="767">Q: Do you recall the most do you recall any of the most interesting comments he made that stuck with you? </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="768">A: Well, I guess the most quotable thing was that, "These people are being tried not because they lost the war, but because they started the war." </sentence><sentence id="769">And it was the interview was more scholarly than sensational. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="772">Q: But was it the only interview that Jackson gave during the trial? </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="847">Q: Let me just think of one or two other questions. </sentence><sentence id="848">One thing about your reports is that they are really written in a very plain way, not a lot of highfalutin language. </sentence><sentence id="849">It felt to me you were almost trying to talk to the GI. </sentence></p></dialogue>
