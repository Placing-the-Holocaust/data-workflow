<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3">Q: Would you tell me your full name please? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="5">A: My name is Pierre Sauvage. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="7">Q: And where and when were you born? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="9">A: I was born on March 25, 1944, near Le Chambon-sur-Lignon, France. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="11">Q: Uh, would you tell me about your parents and how they came to be uh near Le Chambon? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="13">A: Well, my parents, uh... </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="15">Q: Their names first. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="17">A: My parents, Leo Sauvage and uh Barbara Sauvage--whose maiden name is [Sucholosky (ph)]--were in Paris when France fell. </sentence><sentence id="18">My mother being a Polish Jew from Bialystok; my father being a French Jew from Lorraine in eastern France. </sentence><sentence id="19">And uh they went to Marseille at the fall of France--it's [in the] south of France--and from there to Le Chambon in the fall of 1943. </sentence><sentence id="20">My mother being pregnant at the time with me, and uh that is where I had the good fortune to be born. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="25">Q: Uh what were the circumstances, do you know, of their getting to Le Chambon? </sentence><sentence id="26">How did they reach it? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="29">A: Uh in their case they uh heard about Le Chambon from a friend, who suggested it to my father. </sentence><sentence id="30">My father had a particularly uh hard task, because not only did he have to find a place where they would be safe--my mother being particularly vulnerable as a foreign Jew. </sentence><sentence id="31">And, of course, the French were focusing uh much of their collaborative efforts in terms of turning over Jews on the foreign Jews. </sentence><sentence id="32">So my mother was particularly vulnerable. </sentence><sentence id="33">Uh, but in addition she had a problem pregnancy; and apparently the only chance she had of bringing the baby safely into the world was if she had as much peace and quiet and food as possible, which is a bit of a tall order for Nazi-occupied Europe. </sentence><sentence id="34">Uh, and this friend uh suggested Le Chambon. </sentence><sentence id="35">He...he knew the place; and my father went there and found a room to rent, and uh went back to uh get my mother. </sentence><sentence id="36">And they came on a little steam engine train that uh brought many Jews there, as we know. </sentence><sentence id="37">And uh...uh it was uh singularly fortunate, because I'll uh...I'll also mention that uh the doctor who took care of my mother in Le Chambon was exactly for me the right doctor in the right place. </sentence><sentence id="38">Not only did he happen to be a whiz of a doctor who had trained under Albert Schweitzer in Africa, dealing with all sorts of problems and apparently had a reputation as a bit of a medical genius, but in addition he was a a committed Christian--one of the first uh of the area to be committed to non-violent resis...resistance against the Nazis--and had a special stake in my mother's situation and this baby that she wanted to bring into the world. </sentence><sentence id="39">I don't think that uh she would have gotten better medical attention if I had been born in the most modern American facility today. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="51">Q: So you were, or your mother was, brought to this town in the apartment. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="53">Where...where...the room that your parents rented, uh from whom did they rent it? </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="54">A: They rented it from a peasant couple in a uh little hamlet which is a part of Le Chambon called La Fayolle (ph). </sentence><sentence id="55">| Uh, I was known as the baby that used to wake up the neighborhood early in the morning. </sentence><sentence id="56">Uh, they uh...uh, well as I mentioned in my film, "Weapons of the Spirit," I...I...my parents didn't remain in touch, actually, with the farmers who rented that room. </sentence><sentence id="57">But I tracked them down. </sentence><sentence id="58">And the widow of the farmer who did rent the room is in my film. </sentence><sentence id="59">Uh... </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="66">Q: OK. </sentence><sentence id="67">Where...where did your parents go after that? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="70">A: They went to uh Saint-Etienne for a year--which is not far from Le Chambon--where my father was a journalist. </sentence><sentence id="71">My father was already a journalist. </sentence><sentence id="72">He had been a journalist before the war. </sentence><sentence id="73">And then to Paris. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="78">Q: Let's stay a minute [in] Saint-Etienne for that year. </sentence><sentence id="79">Uh, they were in Le Chambon, in the area of Le Chambon, for how long? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="82">A: They were there from the fall of 1943 "til the end of the war. </sentence><sentence id="83">I don't know exactly when they leave, come to think of it... when they left, come to think of it. </sentence><sentence id="84">But it...I think it was around uh August of "44. </sentence><sentence id="85">Something like that. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="90">Q: You talk, obviously, a lot about this in your film. </sentence><sentence id="91">Uh, but for the purposes of this interview, would you tell me more about the people with whom your parents came in contact, as they </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="94">  told it to you? </sentence><sentence id="95">You were, of course, an infant. </sentence><sentence id="96">And did they know your parents were Jewish, and what that meant? </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="97">A: (Pause) I've got to go about it... It's complicated, because there...there are presuppositions in the question that I have to actually address. </sentence><sentence id="98">That's the uh... I was not raised with stories about Le Chambon. </sentence><sentence id="99">Uh, I was uh not raised with stories about the war, with stories about the Holocaust. </sentence><sentence id="100">I was raised by parents who wanted to put all that behind them. </sentence><sentence id="101">So, much of what I've come to know about Le Chambon--although I've since spoken quite a bit about my parents, and I've gotten certainly information that is relevant. </sentence><sentence id="102">Uh, but it's not uh...a lot of my information is really information that I got as an adult, uh talking to people. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="109">Q: OK. </sentence><sentence id="110">Then we'll do this, as it were, at the end of the interview rather than at the beginning. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="113">And let's talk about uh... And we'll talk about Le Chambon, as such, at the end. </sentence><sentence id="114">Uh tell me where your parents went. </sentence><sentence id="115">They went to Paris, you said. </sentence><sentence id="116">Uh, what did they do there and for how long were they there? </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="117">A: Well, they were there "til uh after the war. </sentence><sentence id="118">They were "til 1948, when they came to New York. </sentence><sentence id="119">Uh, my father, among other things, edited a uh intellectual weekly called "[La Rue (ph)]," which was uh quite prominent, had very prestigious uh writers--uh, including uh Sartre, Camus, and Raymond [Quenot (ph)]--and people like that contributed articles to it. </sentence><sentence id="120">But uh it was a very difficult time to launch a...a publication and there were all sorts of restrictions, including paper restrictions. </sentence><sentence id="121">And uh ultimately it had to fold after about ten or twelve issues. </sentence><sentence id="122">And uh my father uh had to find work; and ultimately he decided to go to America, and went to New York where he shortly thereafter became the correspondent of  Le Figaro--a French daily--which he was for twenty-five years. </sentence><sentence id="123">Uh, [he was] also writing a number of books and also uh contributing to a number of other publications. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="132">Q: Going back to Paris, uh by the time you left Paris or were about to leave Paris, you would be four years--or close to it. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="134">A: Yes, yes. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="136">Q: Do you remember anything about Paris as a child? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="138">A: Oh, I think I have a few uh memories that must go back to that time. </sentence><sentence id="139">But I'm really stunned by how much difficulty I have remembering much of my childhood; and I think that probably has a lot to do with the fact that I was raised with memory being uh bad. </sentence><sentence id="140">Uh, I was discouraged from...from remembering. </sentence><sentence id="141">I was discouraged from asking questions. </sentence><sentence id="142">And I think that's tampered with my ability to remember. </sentence><sentence id="143">And maybe that's what's given me a...a compelling need to...to document precisely, because I don't trust memory. </sentence><sentence id="144">Or maybe even to tell stories such as I do. </sentence><sentence id="145">Uh, so I remember uh startling little. </sentence><sentence id="146">In fact, the most startling thing I...I've thought about sometimes is that uh--particularly I have a two and a half year old daughter now--and...and is that I realize I was four when I came to America, and I cannot until then... Obviously, I did not speak English. </sentence><sentence id="147">And I cannot remember ever... cannot remember the experience of having been in a foreign land and not speaking the language. </sentence><sentence id="148">I have absolutely no recollection of it. </sentence><sentence id="149">And that, to me--and...and I can't imagine that that wasn't a traumatic experience, and I cannot connect with it. </sentence><sentence id="150">I cannot remember it. </sentence><sentence id="151">And I realize that four is already not, you know, it's not a baby anymore. </sentence><sentence id="152">So uh I...1 do view myself as a...as a product of a uh...of a traumatized childhood. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="168">Q: Well, let's talk about that, and talk more about that. </sentence><sentence id="169">Uh, when you came to New York, uh what do you remember about those yearly, early years and in New York? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="172">A: Very little. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="174">Q: Opposed to what you were told? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="176">A: Very little. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="178">Q: Very little? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="180">A: Very little, very little. </sentence><sentence id="181">Uh, as I get older I remember more, of course. </sentence><sentence id="182">But uh I...uh I think that the fact that uh my parents withheld from me vital information as to my identity-- as to who they were, as to why we were there, as to uh why they were who they were--uh really uh confused all my...all normal relationships with the world. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="186">Q: Who did you believe your parents were? </sentence><sentence id="187">How did... They were in New York. </sentence><sentence id="188">You were with them. </sentence><sentence id="189">You had no memory of before. </sentence><sentence id="190">Did you believe you were Americans? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="196">A: No. </sentence><sentence id="197">I knew that uh... No. </sentence><sentence id="198">In fact, I was raised very French. </sentence><sentence id="199">Uh, the uh...1...1 now believe that part of the reason I was raised so French was that it was a way of obliterating the Jewish. </sentence><sentence id="200">Uh, I went to a French school. </sentence><sentence id="201">We spoke French at home; although I shouldn't  overstate that, because there was also my...my mother. </sentence><sentence id="202">Even though she was originally from Poland had a great love of France. </sentence><sentence id="203">By the way, she spoke French uh impeccably; and that had something to do with her survival during the war, too. </sentence><sentence id="204">She was able successfully to impersonate a Frenchwoman. </sentence><sentence id="205">I have uh come from a family with great linguistic skills. </sentence><sentence id="206">Uh, my sister later became an actress in Mexico, uh playing Mexicans on the screen, you know. </sentence><sentence id="207">And as anyone who knows about acting knows, there's nothing more difficult than that. </sentence><sentence id="208">So it's...it's like, it's funny how you see these things follow through. </sentence><sentence id="209">Uh no, but we...I didn't...I knew we weren't Americans. </sentence><sentence id="210">I knew that we were...we were uh... In fact, interestingly, uh although I wasn't uh...I didn't know I was Jewish, we...I always knew we were different. </sentence><sentence id="211">We were foreign. </sentence><sentence id="212">It's almost a way in which my parents prepared me to...to then absorb the truth. </sentence><sentence id="213">If they had been people who completely assimilated, I certainly would have been a different person. </sentence><sentence id="214">They never did. </sentence><sentence id="215">Uh, just by remaining French, by remaining different, by not even being immigrants...my parents, I...they never really identified them[selves] as immigrants. </sentence><sentence id="216">I always had the feeling in the back of my mind that one day we would go back to France. </sentence><sentence id="217">My father was a correspondent. </sentence><sentence id="218">You know, that this was not necessarily, you know, the...the final move. </sentence><sentence id="219">I never viewed them as like part of the, you know, immigrant flow into America. </sentence><sentence id="220">Uh, very strange. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="247">Q: What about religion? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="249">A: Uh, no religion. </sentence><sentence id="250">Uh I remember we...uh I was what might be called a "nothing." </sentence><sentence id="251">In other words, when I'd ask my parents, "What...what are we?," </sentence><sentence id="252">they'd say, "We're nothing." </sentence><sentence id="253">And then they would move on; try to, you know, dismiss...dismiss the question. </sentence><sentence id="254">Uh, not long ago my sister mentioned, by the way, that she was not the only "nothing" in her class. </sentence><sentence id="255">Uh, you know, there...there are people who...who find themselves in... in that situation. </sentence><sentence id="256">Uh, but no. </sentence><sentence id="257"> We were not...we were not Christians. </sentence><sentence id="258">I never assumed that, although it was confusing. </sentence><sentence id="259">I guess I assumed that uh... (Pause) I guess I must have assumed that we were uh, you know, originally Christian; but my father was violently anti-religious, as was my mother, in fact. </sentence><sentence id="260">And uh that meant nothing. </sentence><sentence id="261">I mean, there was nothing Christian about us. </sentence><sentence id="262">Uh we were nothing. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="277">Q: How did it feel to be a nothing, to be of no religion and no place ? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="279">A: Well, at the time uh I thought that was fine; or I...I thought ...I thought that was fine. </sentence><sentence id="280">Uh, I've come to feel very differently about that. </sentence><sentence id="281">But that's uh...I uh, you know, people often uh ask me--since I've mentioned the fact that I only learned I was Jewish when I was eighteen-- uh, "How did it...2" And what happened is that my parents sat me down and told me. </sentence><sentence id="282">I was about to go off to Paris to study, and uh was going to be staying with a cousin of mine, uh who happens to be a survivor of Auschwitz. </sentence><sentence id="283">To compound the irony, a rather prominent gentlemen at that, Samuel [Pisar (ph)]. </sentence><sentence id="284">And uh people will sometimes say, "Well, was it a real shock?" </sentence><sentence id="285">You know, "How did you react?" </sentence><sentence id="286">And L..they're surprised that it --I don't even remember exactly how I reacted. </sentence><sentence id="287">And basically the information never really got through to me, but the facts got through to me. </sentence><sentence id="288">But when you are raised with taboos, the taboos are so internalized that you don't fully absorb the information even when it is given to you. </sentence><sentence id="289">You...your...your filtering mechanisms keep working. </sentence><sentence id="290">Not only was I in the course of...of maintaining this...this lie about who we were, part of what that entailed is that I was completely cut off from almost all of my family. </sentence><sentence id="291">Uh, it was a great...except for a few members who joined in this conspiracy of not, of keeping the secret from the children. </sentence><sentence id="292">Uh, but uh it's still stunning to me to realize that my mother had aunts and uncles in...in New York whom I never knew, because they couldn't be counted on to maintain the secret of our  being Jewish. </sentence><sentence id="293">And now as I reconnect with those family members, I still...there's a part of me that finds it very difficult to absorb their identities and their names. </sentence><sentence id="294">It's like I...I'm...I still feel this is information I'm not supposed to have, and I have to fight to to have it. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="312">Q: When did you start... Let's keep going with this. </sentence><sentence id="313">When... when you went uh to your...your relative uh Samuel [Pisar (ph)], what was that like? </sentence><sentence id="314">Did the information become a little more internalized for you? </sentence><sentence id="315">What happened? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="320">A: No, it really didn't. </sentence><sentence id="321">It really didn't. </sentence><sentence id="322">It took a long time. </sentence><sentence id="323">And uh I was in Paris ten years, and I had no interest in...in any of this. </sentence><sentence id="324">Uh..-uh Sam at the time was uh uh...(pause) like many survivors, uh concerned with building his life; and he's an ambitious man. </sentence><sentence id="325">And focusing on...on that, uh although he would he would tell me stories. </sentence><sentence id="326">I think the...the main effect of that was he...he...he... Although he doesn't really remember it, uh he...he did tell me stories about the camps and about his experiences. </sentence><sentence id="327">And uh they had a profound effect on me. </sentence><sentence id="328">Uh but I still didn't really...1 couldn't even...I'm not sure I could define what it was. </sentence><sentence id="329">L...I still...No, I didn't uh...uh I had no Jewish identity when I was in Paris. </sentence><sentence id="330">None. </sentence><sentence id="331">Uh, and no Jewish involvements. </sentence><sentence id="332">And uh...uh L...that really only started... The key influence in my life, in that respect, was my wife--whom I married uh not long after | moved to Los Angeles in 1971-- who's a uh Los Angeles native, uh uh very Jewish if one can speak in those terms, and very comfortable being Jewish. </sentence><sentence id="333">And uh who worked on me for years and years and years. </sentence><sentence id="334">And uh...and then the most decisive influence of all was ultimately having children and realizing that I wanted them to have a very secure and comfortable sense of identity. </sentence><sentence id="335">And uh we uh...my wife wanted to send our son to a Reform day school, which is where he goes now and where he thrives. </sentence><sentence id="336">And uh that has had an influence on me as well. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="355">Q: As you began to discover your own identity and who you were, did you discuss this with your parents? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="357">A: Yes, we...we had uh a number of discussions uh over the years. </sentence><sentence id="358">Uh, this was a very difficult subject for my father. </sentence><sentence id="359">My father died in uh October of 1988, not long before my film on Le Chambon--"Weapons of the Spirit"--was released. </sentence><sentence id="360">Although he did see it uh before he died, and the whole process that I was involved in was a very difficult one for him and a very scary one for him. </sentence><sentence id="361">Uh, after all, he had built his whole public persona on not being Jewish. </sentence><sentence id="362">And uh...and as a journalist this was, you know, sort of a compounded irony. </sentence><sentence id="363">Not only was he a journalist, he was a good journalist; and he was also a crusader for truth and had been all his life. </sentence><sentence id="364">Uh, with this one big lie in his life. </sentence><sentence id="365">And here he had bred, as these things sometimes happen; this increasingly public Jew - not only a Jew, but somebody who was even insistent on being quite public about it. </sentence><sentence id="366">And uh I'll never forget one day uh in the early "80's, uh and I had this French film director who was visiting in L[os] A[ngeles] and we had dinner or whatever. </sentence><sentence id="367">And I talked about myself, and just coincidentally he went to New York shortly thereafter and he met my father. </sentence><sentence id="368">And uh in a phone conversation the following Sunday, my father said, "Why did you say that I..."--that my father--"was Jewish?" </sentence><sentence id="369">I thought, "What...what was he talking about?" </sentence><sentence id="370">And I said, "I... didn't talk about...I don't even remember talking about you." </sentence><sentence id="371">And then he said, "Well, I met this director. </sentence><sentence id="372">And he mentioned...". </sentence><sentence id="373">And then I realized I had talked about myself; but talking about myself exposed my father. </sentence><sentence id="374">And I'll never forget that conversation. </sentence><sentence id="375">This was my...my dilemma, and it was in fact my dilemma in making the film - to preserve their privacy, their right to have some control over how they led their lives, which I basically believe was my obligation. </sentence><sentence id="376">At  the same time, not to allow that to cripple my own ability to lead my own life and uh pass a healthy heritage on to my children. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="398">Q: It was quite a balancing act. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="400">A: Yes. </sentence><sentence id="401">It was it was a very difficult balancing act. </sentence><sentence id="402">Now the film itself was very much uh...Interestingly, the film was very much negotiated with my parents. </sentence><sentence id="403">They asked me to take out certain things. </sentence><sentence id="404">Which I did; including things that I thought it was wrong to take out. </sentence><sentence id="405">Uh, I'll mention one. </sentence><sentence id="406">Uh (pause) I'll start again on that one. </sentence><sentence id="407">Uh the film was...the film was </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="417">Q: Let's hold it one second, if we could... (Technical Conversation) OK. </sentence><sentence id="418">Fine. </sentence><sentence id="419">Let's pick up with it. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="423">A: The film was uh negotiated with my parents. </sentence><sentence id="424">They uh, for instance, asked me to take out certain things. </sentence><sentence id="425">My mother...in particular, my mother asked me to take out very specific things. </sentence><sentence id="426">And I remember she asked me to take out three things. </sentence><sentence id="427">And I thought about it; and I ended up...ended up taking out all three. </sentence><sentence id="428">And they hurt. </sentence><sentence id="429">And they hurt on various levels. </sentence><sentence id="430">I'll mention one, because it was interesting the sort of dilemma I was facing. </sentence><sentence id="431">Uh in the film, I initially...I...I referred to my mother losing much of her family, and I show a photograph of my mother surrounded by her family. </sentence><sentence id="432">And originally I had named all the dead relatives. </sentence><sentence id="433">And my mother asked me to take out the names. </sentence><sentence id="434">And I really thought that was, I mean, the greatest honor I could do to these people was to name them, to give them that identity--my grandmother, Feige Sucholosky. </sentence><sentence id="435">But I just decided, in that instance, that uh my respect for my mother would take precedence. </sentence><sentence id="436">And I did. </sentence><sentence id="437">I took out the names. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="453">Q: Since this is not a commercial film but will be a scholarly film, would you like to tell us the names of your mother's relatives who died, to preserve their memory? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="455">A: Well, the...the...the...the...the key ones that uh that I allude to are my grandmother, Feige Sucholosky, my uh... (Pause) You know, it's...it's amazing. </sentence><sentence id="456">I really don't normally freeze in any sort of interview situation, and I've done it a number of them. </sentence><sentence id="457">And I realize it's absolutely no coincidence that even though I have gone over those names so often, that there's a part of me that like shuts off because I'm...I'm not supposed to...to do it in some way. </sentence><sentence id="458">Uh but yes, my...my uncle, Memel (ph) Sucholosky; my mother's sister... How can I, how can I not, how can I freeze on her...on her name? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="463">Q: It's OK. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="465">A: Amazing. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="467">Q: It's OK. </sentence><sentence id="468">You have been trained since childhood not to remember. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="471">A: Yes. </sentence><sentence id="472">Amazing how effective uh those things are. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="475">Q: Let's go on. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="477">A: Uh huh. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="479">Q: We can come back to this later. </sentence><sentence id="480">Uh, can you tell me... You've talked a good bit about the relations with your family. </sentence><sentence id="481">I have one more question about your parents, and then we'll leave that phase. </sentence><sentence id="482">Have you managed through all this to remain close to your parents, or has it separated you in some way? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="487">A: There were tense moments with my father, as I was developing into a person different from what he had anticipated. </sentence><sentence id="488">Uh my father ended up liking the film quite a bit, which is really in a...in a way the strongest endorsement of the film I ever had. </sentence><sentence id="489">Because with his mind-set, uh for him to say that the film was, you know, basically correct, I thought, "My God, it really must be pretty...pretty correct." </sentence><sentence id="490">Uh, he used to argue, though, that uh the film--and he's the only person who's ever said this to me, which is sort of funny. </sentence><sentence id="491">But he always argued that the film would have been better if I had left myself completely out of it. </sentence><sentence id="492">Uh, but uh hard to say. </sentence><sentence id="493">We ...we never broke relations ever. </sentence><sentence id="494">We would have regular Sunday conversations. </sentence><sentence id="495">Uh, I don't... Let me put it this way. </sentence><sentence id="496">I hope that I will have a closer relationship with my own children than I had with my parents. </sentence><sentence id="497">I think that uh people are punished for their sins. </sentence><sentence id="498">I think the way they raised me was wrong. </sentence><sentence id="499">And I think it impaired our ability to bond. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="513">Q: Let's go back a little bit. </sentence><sentence id="514">I think that should sit a bit. </sentence><sentence id="515">And go back to a young man growing up in New York. </sentence><sentence id="516">Uh, along the way--uh, again, for the record--I'd like to know a little bit more about the kind of schooling you had in New York, and what you did as a young man. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="521">What was your family life like? </sentence><sentence id="522">Let's start with school and friends. </sentence><sentence id="523">It's easier. </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="524">A: I'll tell you, the most striking thing about...about my childhood friends is that I realized a few years ago that of my closest friends when I was a young child, uh a high percentage uh were if not children of Holocaust survivors-- although there were...there were...there were  some... In fact, my closest friend for a number of years was. </sentence><sentence id="525">Uh, at least uh related [to the Holocaust] in the sense that some of them, their parents had come like in the "30's. </sentence><sentence id="526">And often those people don't identify as survivors, because they came earlier, even though they still lost a lot of their relatives. </sentence><sentence id="527">And often the effects are not efficiently...uh, sufficiently acknowledged as still being Holocaust-related effects. </sentence><sentence id="528">Certainly, in terms of the children. </sentence><sentence id="529">Children almost never identify as children of Holocaust survivors, if their parents came in the mid-"30's. </sentence><sentence id="530">Although often they have a lot more in common with children of survivors than they realize. </sentence><sentence id="531">And this ...this is all the more striking since I didn't...not only did I not know I was the parents...the child...the child of Holocaust survivors, I didn't even know I was Jewish. </sentence><sentence id="532">So it's funny that it was with these people that the relationships uh developed. </sentence><sentence id="533">But I... think that's just a measure of the inescapable commonalities that...that were there even though the labels, you know, weren't there. </sentence><sentence id="534">It wasn't relationships based on labels. </sentence><sentence id="535">It was relationships based on, uh I guess, similar attitudes or similar things in common. </sentence><sentence id="536">Uh, I identify very strongly with uh second generation children of survivors. </sentence><sentence id="537">I have been intermittently active in such groups. </sentence><sentence id="538">Uh I think uh I have learned a lot from uh other children of survivors, even though my parents" case was different in many respects. </sentence><sentence id="539">And, of course, I use "survivor"--"Holocaust survivor"--in the broadest sense, which encompasses people who weren't in... My parents were never in camps. </sentence><sentence id="540">But they were in hiding, they were in fear, they lost family. </sentence><sentence id="541">And I find that they...the result of those...those times have uh set in motion a certain number of things that uh we children of survivors have in common. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="561">Q: Such as...? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="563">A: Uh, well, some strengths, some weaknesses. </sentence><sentence id="564">And uh I think uh what I am most insistent on- -in fact, I've been quite incendiary about it at times--is that uh we need to find our own way towards those memories, our own paths, uh fully respectful of the experience of our parents. </sentence><sentence id="565">Uh, needing to learn from it, needing to hear them, needing to hear that testimony as much as everybo...everybody needs to hear that testimony; but at the same time, not to be...feel dwarfed by it, to acknowledge our own childhood hurts, to realize that in some respects uh we have been victims of the Holocaust in our own right, victims of the effect of the Holocaust through our parents, and uh sometimes our parents have not been able to acknowledge. </sentence><sentence id="566">This was too painful to them, that such hurts occurred; and that often they-- unwillingly, unwittingly, simply because they went through the experience that they went through--were the cause of some of this...this pain. </sentence><sentence id="567">Children of survivors need to acknowledge that pain, need to acknowledge that need to...to form their own identities. </sentence><sentence id="568">Uh and that does involve, if they're interested in psychology, I I believe nothing is more important than to be able to get in touch with your...your childhood pains and acknowledge its existence and identify it. </sentence><sentence id="569">And that is the only way it will not be passed on to your own children. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="577">Q: In doing that, in attempting to reach yourself, as it were, you have, among other things, chosen to become a Jew. </sentence><sentence id="578">How did you actually... You talked about your wife. </sentence><sentence id="579">But how...how does...how did that process develop, and how has that interact[ed] with your parents? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="583">A: The question of my Jewish identity is such an...my Jewish identity is such an evolving one that it really changes; not only from year to year, but probably from month to month. </sentence><sentence id="584">And I have no idea what exactly that identity will be uh five years from now. </sentence><sentence id="585">Whether it will be a    very pronounced one, or whether I will decide enough of this and this really doesn't matter to me that much. </sentence><sentence id="586">L...[ really don't...I really don't know. </sentence><sentence id="587">I know that uh I felt a need to have an identity, that the only identity that it made sense for me to have was the identity of my ancestors. </sentence><sentence id="588">Uh, and that I have indeed become increasingly comfortable with it, that I realize that a lot of who I am is indeed uh wrapped up in...in Judaism and uh its influences on my family. </sentence><sentence id="589">You know, the influence...the influences exist whether they're identified or not. </sentence><sentence id="590">The fact that my parents uh never acknowledged being Jewish doesn't mean they weren't, in very fundamental ways, very Jewish. </sentence><sentence id="591">Uh, and uh and that influence was probably there. </sentence><sentence id="592">Uh, but uh... (Pause) You know, it's interesting how these things work. </sentence><sentence id="593">I think the people of Le Chambon made me more Jewish. </sentence><sentence id="594">They... First of all, I came to believe that at bottom, when you've cut through all the specifics of why they did what they did or all the conjecture--one can do all the factors that come into this--uh at bottom everything flowed from their own inescapable sense of their own identity. </sentence><sentence id="595">Their own sense of comfort at being who they were, at having no questions about who they were. </sentence><sentence id="596">And everything flowed, almost inescapably, incredibly naturally and very spontaneously, from that. </sentence><sentence id="597">That sense of identity. </sentence><sentence id="598">And if one derived strength from that, that rootedness, uh well then I had to try to aspire-- particularly as a parent, and wanting to be able to raise strong children--had to aspire to a similar rootedness and had to find my roots. </sentence><sentence id="599">And my roots were in being a Jew, so that was the only way to go. </sentence><sentence id="600">In addition, when I was making "Weapons of the Spirit," I realized that the way in which the film would be most effective would be if it was a Jewish film in praise of a group of Christians. </sentence><sentence id="601">It couldn't be a...a neutered film...wouldn't go anywhere. </sentence><sentence id="602">And that forced me to ...to absorb and understand as much as I could, to...to really be as Jewish as I could be in the making of that film. </sentence><sentence id="603">But that it's...it had to mirror, in a way, the...the reunion that took place in Le Chambon between Jews and Christians, that it had to emb...embody it. </sentence><sentence id="604">As best as I could, as ignorant as I am still about so much of Judaism, it had to be uh Jewish. </sentence><sentence id="605"> And I'm very touched, by the way, when uh orthodox Jews are responsive to the film, as indeed the few who have spoken to me have been. </sentence><sentence id="606">Uh, that means a lot to me. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="632">Q: How do your parents react to your being Jewish, openly and publicly Jewish? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="634">A: My father was very uncomfortable with it. </sentence><sentence id="635">My mother, particularly since my father passed away, has uh really jettisoned a lot of the past taboos. </sentence><sentence id="636">In fact, she's probably made changes faster than I've been able to accept her changes. </sentence><sentence id="637">Uh, that often happens that way. </sentence><sentence id="638">Uh, I'm almost locked into my image of her; and she probably is far readier to change than than I am ready to accept her changes. </sentence><sentence id="639">So she really, I I must say, now is...is...seems to be quite comfortable with all of this uh...and uh loves the film. </sentence><sentence id="640">Has a tape of it which she looks at periodically, and uh very, very supportive and uh uh uh...and uh apparently quite comfortable with all of it. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="648">Q: You had mentioned... And now let's move more to the film itself. </sentence><sentence id="649">Uh, you had mentioned that there were three segments that you had left out. </sentence><sentence id="650">You had described one. </sentence><sentence id="651">Can you describe the other two? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="656">A: It's funny. </sentence><sentence id="657">Somebody asked me that a while back. </sentence><sentence id="658">And L...I was afraid when I mentioned that that you were going to ask me that question, because uh I tried to remember what the three were the other day and I couldn't. </sentence><sentence id="659">I remembered two of them, and I was missing a third. </sentence><sentence id="660">I...1 know I'm going to be able to to... One was the names of the...of my dead relatives. </sentence><sentence id="661">The other one was the uh place they were from--Bialystok, Poland. </sentence><sentence id="662">Uh, the original narration said my mother's family in...in Bialystok; and...and...and I took out  Bialystok because I was asked to. </sentence><sentence id="663">And it's the third request that, at this point, I cannot remember. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="673">Q: Uh, let's talk a bit now about the making of...of "Weapons of the Spirit.". </sentence><sentence id="674">What kind...when you started to...to uh do the personal interviews, can you tell me something about the people who...who would have been the most important? </sentence><sentence id="675">Uh, certainly to your parents, even if they didn't want to talk about it. </sentence><sentence id="676">Uh, for instance, uh Magda Trocme, who comes across in the film as this wonderfully determined woman. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="681">A: She's an extraordinary woman. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="683">Q: Can you describe your relationship with her, and what she is like now, in her old age? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="685">A: It's funny. </sentence><sentence id="686">I'm just moved thinking about Magda. </sentence><sentence id="687">I love her. </sentence><sentence id="688">I love her. </sentence><sentence id="689">Uh, she is an extraordinary woman, extraordinary woman. </sentence><sentence id="690">Uh... (Pause) If I may, I'm...I'm tempted to...to interject real quickly that we really live in a sexist society, uh one form of which is to discount often the...the female influence. </sentence><sentence id="691">You know, when it comes to rescue in particular, when it comes to rescuers, uh I'm convinced that women played a far more important role than men. </sentence><sentence id="692">It was often the woman who would be literally at the door if somebody knocked on it. </sentence><sentence id="693">It was in...often into it in the mother's home, you know. </sentence><sentence id="694">When the story of Le Chambon is told, you know, one tends to focus--when...when it's talking about leadership-- on Pastor Trocme, who was an extraordinary figure whom I...L..1 admire inordinately. </sentence><sentence id="695">A brilliant, brilliant man. </sentence><sentence id="696">Uh, but really, that...that combination of Pastor Trocme and Magda  Trocme was an extraordinary combination. </sentence><sentence id="697">She is the most direct, uh efficient, uh focused person I have ever known. </sentence><sentence id="698">Uh, she uh... (Pause) She cuts through to things. </sentence><sentence id="699">Uh, im...immediately. </sentence><sentence id="700">She is an extraordinary, extraordinary, extraordinarily practical person. </sentence><sentence id="701">Uh, she really... You know, Trocme--Pastor Trocme--was a...a thinker. </sentence><sentence id="702">Uh, some of that thinking ended up producing tremendous results; and he would...he did things. </sentence><sentence id="703">But uh Magda Trocme is truly a...a doer. </sentence><sentence id="704">You know, "What do you need now? </sentence><sentence id="705">What has to be done now?" </sentence><sentence id="706">You know, "How are you going to solve that problem?" </sentence><sentence id="707">It...it.... All practical. </sentence><sentence id="708">And uh L...L..I really sort of absorbed from her the sense in which that is what is most important in any given situation, in any situation of crisis. </sentence><sentence id="709">Don't make a big deal about it. </sentence><sentence id="710">Just, you know, figure out, you know, what needs to be done and do it. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="738">Q: And that came through in the film. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="740">A: She is...she is a...a uh...she is a...a extraordinary woman. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="742">Q: In the film, one of the things that you do is to develop an understanding that events took place not only in Le Chambon but in all the surrounding hamlets. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="744">A: Yes. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="746">Q: Can you talk about some of the people that you interviewed uh in those hamlets that did some rather special things? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="748">A: You know it's a very important point, a very important point. </sentence><sentence id="749">And I'm particularly interested in addressing it, even for history; because, in a way, I may be culpable of having uh  obscured things even in...in the film. </sentence><sentence id="750">You know, films are not footnoted. </sentence><sentence id="751">Uh, they...they have to be somewhat linear - the form has certain requirements. </sentence><sentence id="752">And to be sure, Le Chambon was the centerpiece of what occurred. </sentence><sentence id="753">It was where Pastor Trocme and Assistant Pastor [Edouard] Theis and Magda Trocme were at the heart of what did occur. </sentence><sentence id="754">Uh, and the railway station was in Le Chambon. </sentence><sentence id="755">But really what...when it's talking about ...and you talk to Jews who were in the area, they are talking about the area. </sentence><sentence id="756">They are talking about "Le Plateau"!. </sentence><sentence id="757">They are talking about all the surrounding hamlets, and indeed some of the neighboring villages. </sentence><sentence id="758">Uh, what happened is symbols get created, and Le Chambon is the symbol. </sentence><sentence id="759">Le Chambon inescapably will be the symbol. </sentence><sentence id="760">But I hope that soon enough we will be able, having absorbed the symbol--the symbol having become sufficiently familiar to us-- we will then be able to realize and acknowledge that it is merely a symbol. </sentence><sentence id="761">And, in fact, it's a symbol for the area. </sentence><sentence id="762">And in Le Chambon itself, there is very much that concern. </sentence><sentence id="763">Le Chambon itself doesn't want it to appear that it is trumpeting itself in any way, particularly Le Chambon versus Le Mazet or versus Fay. </sentence><sentence id="764">You know, there were pastors in all those areas who were actively involved in what went on. </sentence><sentence id="765">Uh, and for posterity it is certainly, it is crucially important that that point be made. </sentence><sentence id="766">In fact, it amazes me the point is made in the film... You know, it...it...it..1 thought it was made quite strongly in the film, about that surrounding area was involved. </sentence><sentence id="767">And it almost amazed me how uh every reviewer ignores that and says Le Chambon, and talks, you know. </sentence><sentence id="768">And I say five thousand Christians in the area, but it it often becomes the five thousand villagers of Le Chambon. </sentence><sentence id="769">People have great difficulty focusing on what, to them, are details. </sentence><sentence id="770">Uh, but certainly for history [it] is important to...to underscore. </sentence><sentence id="771">Yes, it was...it was the area. " </sentence><sentence id="772">The area surrounding Le Chambon. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="799">Q: Do you remember individuals? </sentence><sentence id="800">Your camera does, but what I would like is, can you talk about one or two individuals in different towns, for this purpose? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="803">A: Well, I met people from...from all over the area. </sentence><sentence id="804">I don't...I don't really think of them in terms of uh... L...I mainly...I found no differences, you know. </sentence><sentence id="805">The people in...in Le Mazet, uh which is the sister village to...to Le Chambon... Uh, which by the way, Le Mazet was even more densely Protestant than Le Chambon, if that is possible. </sentence><sentence id="806">Uh, Le Chambon may have had...I don't know, maybe roughly ten percent of Catholics. </sentence><sentence id="807">I don't know if that figure is exactly accurate. </sentence><sentence id="808">Uh, Le Mazet was almost, | pre...I imagine ninety-nine percent, you know, Protestant. </sentence><sentence id="809">And there were Jews hidden throughout uh Le Mazet. </sentence><sentence id="810">Uh, but when I think of individuals, it's hard for me to...to think of in...in particular places. </sentence><sentence id="811">I...I really think of some of the people... Well, probably, the people in Le Chambon that I probably feel closest to, besides uh...besides the Trocme family, uh are uh Henri et Anne Heritier (ph), who play a very imp...very important role in the film, uh who open and close the film, but who...who also... And played a very important role in the life of the village, uh although nobody knew it at the time; because they were harboring the young Jew who was the forger for the village. </sentence><sentence id="812">And that was a key component in what went on there. </sentence><sentence id="813">People--Jews-- needed false...false ID's. </sentence><sentence id="814">Uh, but they played an important role in my life, because my parents had a very surprisingly close relationship with Heritiers. </sentence><sentence id="815">They did not have a close relationship with the peasants with whom they were staying. </sentence><sentence id="816">Uh, and didn't...maintained no contact with ...with them. </sentence><sentence id="817">Whereas the Heritiers, they did maintain a contact. </sentence><sentence id="818">When I went back to Le Chambon in the "60's with my parents, which I did, uh we visited the Heritiers and uh said hello to them. </sentence><sentence id="819">And my...my parents always thought the Heritiers were the the salt of the earth. </sentence><sentence id="820">They always felt that way about them. </sentence><sentence id="821">And uh...and the Heritiers's daughter, as I mentioned in the film, Eva uh had taken care of me as a baby. </sentence><sentence id="822">And uh I am  convinced, by the way, now more and more as I uh pursue my interests in psychology and...and realize the extent to which we are shaped...shaped by early influences, uh that uh in...in...on some deep level, I was probably uh very much influenced by the Heritiers as a baby and as an infant. </sentence><sentence id="823">Uh I was actually uh left with the Heritiers for a certain period of time when my parents were busy. </sentence><sentence id="824">And Eva, when my parents were in Saint-Etienne--a near-by town--they...Eva took me back to Le Chambon. </sentence><sentence id="825">And I stayed with her and her parents, you know, for a period of time. </sentence><sentence id="826">In the film, Madame Heritier... (TECHNICAL CONVERSATION) </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="853">Q: OK. </sentence><sentence id="854">You were saying that you had been left with them for significant periods of time while your parents were working in Saint-Etienne. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="857">A: That's right. </sentence><sentence id="858">That's right. </sentence><sentence id="859">I was actually uh... Eva Heritier, who was the Heritiers" daughter, who was uh...went with my parents when they went to Saint-Etienne. </sentence><sentence id="860">My mother asked to take Eva with her to help her out, which was a big deal for the Heritiers. </sentence><sentence id="861">Their daughter going to the big city. </sentence><sentence id="862">And they trusted. </sentence><sentence id="863">It's an interesting symbolism of that actually, because they...they trusted my parents to take their daughter away with them to...to the big city. </sentence><sentence id="864">Trust ends up going both ways. </sentence><sentence id="865">Uh, but at one point, Eva took me back to... to Le Chambon. </sentence><sentence id="866">Uh, just her alone. </sentence><sentence id="867">And I stayed with her parents and with her. </sentence><sentence id="868">And in "Weapons of the Spirit," Madame Heritier mentions the fact that that's where I learned to walk. </sentence><sentence id="869">Apparently, my first steps were taken under their auspices. </sentence><sentence id="870">And, you know, it was very moving to me when she ...she mentioned that. </sentence><sentence id="871">I...L..1 don't know. </sentence><sentence id="872">L..I can't help  wondering whether there isn't something faintly symbolic about that, that somehow uh...Well, that's where I started to walk. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="891">Q: I suspect there's something symbolic, indeed. </sentence><sentence id="892">Uh, you just said something very interesting. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="895">You said that in the 1960's you went back with your parents. </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="896">A: Yes. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="898">Q: But your parents had raised you... </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="900">A: Right. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="902">Q: ..uh not to be a Jew, and not to know your background. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="904">A: Yes. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="906">Q: Tell me how that visit in the "60's came about, and what your parents told you. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="908">A: That visit was a part of my uh period in the desert, so to speak, uh where I...1 was a traumatized young man who didn't know anything. </sentence><sentence id="909">So that is...it's enshrouded in the same sort of uh mystery that much of my early life is. </sentence><sentence id="910">I...1..and I remember very little about it. </sentence><sentence id="911">All I knew was that we were going back to the uh town where my parents happened to be. </sentence><sentence id="912">I didn't know why they were there. </sentence><sentence id="913">I didn't ask. </sentence><sentence id="914">I had been taught not to ask questions. </sentence><sentence id="915">I was a very good, dutiful child, who didn't ask questions. </sentence><sentence id="916">Uh, and uh I was brought to the  hospital where my...I was born. </sentence><sentence id="917">And we visited the Heritiers, and uh... But none of this had any context, and uh really influenced me; except that it may have without my realizing it. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="929">Q: How old were at that time? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="931">A: I'm not sure of the exact date. </sentence><sentence id="932">I think it was probably around "65, "66. </sentence><sentence id="933">So I was twenty uh...twenty-one, twenty-two. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="937">Q: And your parents never told you more than that you were going to visit a place they had been... </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="943">Q: Not that people rescued them, or none of that? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="945">A: No. </sentence><sentence id="946">Of course, interestingly, uh it shows how taboos linger on long after they've been ostensibly lifted. </sentence><sentence id="947">This was a time when I already knew I was Jewish and they were Jewish. </sentence><sentence id="948">But it was nevertheless a time when I still didn't push, didn't... My parents, probably at that time they...they had imparted the information, but they didn't want it to matter to me. </sentence><sentence id="949">They still didn't want me to ask questions. </sentence><sentence id="950">They still didn't want to... So I...L..1 still never asked questions. </sentence><sentence id="951">Uh, "How did you survive? </sentence><sentence id="952">Where...?2" You know. </sentence><sentence id="953">And uh, you know, I didn't uh...and I didn't realize the...the extent of what had happened in...in Le Chambon there. </sentence><sentence id="954">So uh I...I really don't remember that...that visit very well. </sentence><sentence id="955">Uh, I remember...I remember so much better, and I will share with you, uh a visit uh...the first visit that I made to the Heritiers uh as I was uh emerging from my taboos and was uh... I went with my wife in in  the early "80's, and we knocked on the door. </sentence><sentence id="956">You know, in a small village you don't always call ahead. </sentence><sentence id="957">You know, you just drop by. </sentence><sentence id="958">And we did. </sentence><sentence id="959">And I introduced Barbara, my wife, to...to the Heritiers. </sentence><sentence id="960">And uh Madame Heritier immediately left and went into another room, and came back with this beautiful framed photograph of me as a baby. </sentence><sentence id="961">And it's something I will never remember. </sentence><sentence id="962">It was so touching that she had that photograph, and that she knew immediately, you know, where it was. </sentence><sentence id="963">That it had been in some very accessible place that she could bring it out so quickly. </sentence><sentence id="964">And uh uh...I uh...I do feel a very, very, very special bond with...with those people and with that community. </sentence><sentence id="965">Free association here, but L...I just thought of. </sentence><sentence id="966">I've never mentioned this, really. </sentence><sentence id="967">But a line that will be forever with me which was so typically Chambonais, in a way. </sentence><sentence id="968">Another wonderful woman who was in the film was Madame Bareau (ph), who was a very old woman even then when I interviewed her. </sentence><sentence id="969">And uh in fact, the problem I had as the filmmaker was pinning her down and to sit for the interview, because she was always running around. </sentence><sentence id="970">And as she would describe it, she was always running around visiting the old people. </sentence><sentence id="971">Uh, and she being uh already 89. </sentence><sentence id="972">Uh, but I remember I had borrowed all her...her photographs; and all these people entrusted me with all their photographs, and even their childhood photographs. </sentence><sentence id="973">Which is .... They really trusted me. </sentence><sentence id="974">And I remember..J'll never forget uh going to her house to return her photographs, and she opened the door. </sentence><sentence id="975">And I was thanking her, and she was anxious to say something to me. </sentence><sentence id="976">And uh she interrupted me, and she said, "You know, I was talking to Madame Caritienne (ph)..."--another person. </sentence><sentence id="977">And she said, "I just wanted you to know that we both agreed it would have been a shame if you hadn't been born. </sentence><sentence id="978">"--"S'aurait domage que vous ne soyez ne." </sentence><sentence id="979">And I've thought about line so often. </sentence><sentence id="980">It...it's so typically Chambonais, in away. </sentence><sentence id="981">Because, of course, it would be a shame if...if anybody wasn't born. </sentence><sentence id="982">But it was both very, very personal and very, very broad. </sentence><sentence id="983">I still don't even know what the line means. </sentence><sentence id="984">All I know is uh it sparked me, it's part of me. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1026">Q: What would you like to add for the purposes of this film we have done ? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1028">A: Well, I'd like to say something about righteous Christians, such as the people of Le Chambon, to which I am increasingly devoting part of my life. </sentence><sentence id="1029">And perhaps particularly this: as we come to attach more importance to them, and we are doing that, we must not fall into a trap. </sentence><sentence id="1030">The old trap used to be to dismiss them, to ignore them, to consider that all this was so uh...they were so few in number that they're not important. </sentence><sentence id="1031">Because they were few in number. </sentence><sentence id="1032">And, of course, they were few in number. </sentence><sentence id="1033">But that's precisely what makes them important. </sentence><sentence id="1034">Uh, and that somehow focusing on them will whitewash that period, that somehow it will make...give the world an excuse to feel better about itself. </sentence><sentence id="1035">Well, that's not the way it works. </sentence><sentence id="1036">On the contrary, they make us accountable. </sentence><sentence id="1037">They prove that it was possible to care. </sentence><sentence id="1038">And that is what is necessary. </sentence><sentence id="1039">If we hand on only a memory of...of...of bitterness and hopelessness, then the world is off the hook. </sentence><sentence id="1040">If the world ends up thinking that it is not possible to combat evil, that it is not possible to stand up, then...then it's off the hook. </sentence><sentence id="1041">Then it's not possible to do anything. </sentence><sentence id="1042">So that that...all those things we will quickly come to understand. </sentence><sentence id="1043">But the...the...the trap is that we not, in focusing on them, start idealizing them. </sentence><sentence id="1044">That we not put them on pedestals. </sentence><sentence id="1045">That we not make heros of them. </sentence><sentence id="1046">Of course, they appear to us unusual because they weren't many and there's something inescapably moving about them. </sentence><sentence id="1047">But it is crucial that we take their word for it, that what they did came naturally to them. </sentence><sentence id="1048">It was normal. </sentence><sentence id="1049">It was no big deal. </sentence><sentence id="1050">That these people are no different from us. </sentence><sentence id="1051">That what they did is...we are capable of doing. </sentence><sentence id="1052">Uh, that uh they acted out of emotions and attitudes that were not heroic, larger than life uh...you know, emotions;  but just very small normal emotions. </sentence><sentence id="1053">Uh, there were...there were hero-types also during the Holocaust. </sentence><sentence id="1054">There were people like Raoul Wallenberg or Andre Trocme. </sentence><sentence id="1055">These were people who had a...a compelling need to make their mark, to...to.... These were heros. </sentence><sentence id="1056">Most rescuers of Jews during the Holocaust were not that sort. </sentence><sentence id="1057">They were very ordinary people, who simply responded appropriately to the challenge that they faced. </sentence><sentence id="1058">And they are the most relevant to us. </sentence><sentence id="1059">Very few of us are going to be Raoul Wallenbergs. </sentence><sentence id="1060">All of us, every day, are faced with choices that involve recognizing that there is a need to help, uh a need not to turn away, a need to realize that we are responsible for something that is going on around us. </sentence><sentence id="1061">That we can influence positively. </sentence><sentence id="1062">And we need to know--in a way, in the most selfish...for the most selfish reasons--that responding to that need will make us feel good, will make us feel uh peaceful, happy, uh will prolong our lives. </sentence><sentence id="1063">Uh to care about other people is fundamentally to care about yourself. </sentence><sentence id="1064">And that is part of what I hope uh people will derive from contact with...through museums, through books, through films, will derive from learning about the righteous gentiles of the Holocaust. </sentence><sentence id="1065">And the righteous Jews of the Holocaust. </sentence><sentence id="1066">Because they existed, too. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="1109"> TECHNICAL CONVERSATION </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1111">Q: OK. </sentence><sentence id="1112">One of the questions I'd like to ask is...does concern making "Weapons of the Spirit." </sentence><sentence id="1113">Uh, can you tell us why you made it? </sentence><sentence id="1114">How you came about to make it? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1119">A: I think it is no coincidence that somebody who was raised to forget ended up making a documentary record of what happened in Le Chambon. </sentence><sentence id="1120">I think that uh maybe people who    are raised with stories all their lives sometimes take them for granted. </sentence><sentence id="1121">Uh, people who trust their memory often have maybe less of a need to document. </sentence><sentence id="1122">Because I have such a precarious memory, because it's such a challenge for me to...to...to remember things, I only feel secure if it's in some way recorded. </sentence><sentence id="1123">To me, it only exists when it's recorded. </sentence><sentence id="1124">And uh I think that may have been a big part of this compulsive need to document uh the story of Le Chambon and--forgive me for saying so, but--to really document it as accurately as I possibly could. </sentence><sentence id="1125">You cannot footnote a film, but I love history. </sentence><sentence id="1126">Uh, I love academic research. [... </sentence><sentence id="1127">1 really wanted this to be as uh accurate as it possibly could be; bearing in mind that any film has to have a dramatic flow, even a documentary. </sentence><sentence id="1128">So, you know, you...you tell; but at the same time--and that was part of the reason that it took so long and was such a challenge, in terms of putting it together--to both respect the history, respect all the details, have every detail right, and yet not have it be boring. </sentence><sentence id="1129">Which was my primary obligation as a filmmaker. </sentence><sentence id="1130">It had to...the film had to work. </sentence><sentence id="1131">I think that uh my traumatized upbringing probably had a lot to do with my need to tell the story, and probably had a lot to do...certainly had a lot to do with the effect that the people of Le Chambon had on me. </sentence><sentence id="1132">Uh, you know, the amazing thing to me, as I've come to reflect on this a little bit, about the influence of the story of Le Chambon on my life is that it really uh...it happened twice. </sentence><sentence id="1133">It happened at my birth; but it happened when I was an adult and I came back there and met these people again, and was so heavily influenced by them that it really changed my life. </sentence><sentence id="1134">And I really feel that they rescued me twice. </sentence><sentence id="1135">And perhaps it is that second form of rescue-- the rescue of me as a lost, rootless, depressed adult--that gives "Weapons of the Spirit" something of a universal message. </sentence><sentence id="1136">Because I do believe that many of us, even though my case may have been exteme, that many of us do have a need for positive stories to hold on to. </sentence><sentence id="1137">Legitimate, real realistic sources of hope. </sentence><sentence id="1138">And that I had that need. </sentence><sentence id="1139">And... and the film--     the making of the film and the film itself--responded to that need. </sentence><sentence id="1140">And maybe that it's how to give the story whatever universal ramifications it may have. </sentence></p></dialogue>
