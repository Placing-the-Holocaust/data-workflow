<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="94">Q: How did it affect you as a little girl? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="96">A: I was...I was all right as long as I was with my family because during this time my parents got in touch with a former teacher and they -- the teacher organized a little class of children to come to his house and study in exchange for almost anything like some food or clothing for his family. </sentence><sentence id="97">Of course, it was forbidden, and I enjoyed going there. </sentence><sentence id="98">We started off with 10 children, and little by little, the group got smaller as the children died from hunger or were caught and killed. </sentence><sentence id="99">I never knew what happened, just that they didn't show. </sentence><sentence id="100">But this happened: One day when I was on my way to, to the teacher, Professor Rozycki -- oh, we used to come separately so that the Germans or nobody would see that we're forming a group, so each one came within a few minutes of each other, and one day I was on my way and a few blocks away somebody stopped me and said, "Are you going to Professor Rezycki?" </sentence><sentence id="101">and I didn't answer. </sentence><sentence id="102">And they said, "Don't go there." </sentence><sentence id="103">So I didn't go there, and I waited and it became clear that that very morning the Germans came, raided his house, killed all the males in the family. </sentence><sentence id="104">Even his father-in- law, who was in a wheelchair, was thrown out of the window. </sentence><sentence id="105">I don't remember how I got home, but I think that this was the, the time when my life, when I started realizing as a young girl what -- that something is happening. </sentence><sentence id="106">I looked around and people were on the street covered with papers, bodies, near bodies, were crying for bread. </sentence><sentence id="107">I was always fed, so I don't remember crying for food, although hunger was a constant companion. </sentence><sentence id="108">But the, the view of the bodies covered with paper, the swollen bodies, was bad. </sentence><sentence id="109">I had more time to look around and see it. </sentence><sentence id="110">When I was busy in school, I was busy. </sentence><sentence id="111">We had classes the whole day and then homework, and it kept us busy. </sentence><sentence id="112">But then when this was gone, I could see -- look around me, and I could see everything. </sentence><sentence id="113">I lost my friends to hunger. </sentence><sentence id="114">I, I saw people -- bodies -- being taken away in a little carriage, hand carriage, and there was nothing that I could do for anybody, nothing. </sentence><sentence id="115">There was a former teacher, Pani? </sentence><sentence id="116">Kaminska, who was our music teacher in school and she tried to form a, a choir under those circumstances. </sentence><sentence id="117">It was unbelievable how our people tried to keep up the spirit, and how people know that when you're learning, when you're "doing," you can, you can withstand hardship. </sentence><sentence id="118">May be easier or may be, may be harder, but it enables you to continue. </sentence><sentence id="119">You don't get necessarily wrapped up in yourself, in your hunger, in you- your being cold, or whatever. </sentence><sentence id="120">And we tried very hard, but it became impossible. </sentence><sentence id="121">It became impossible. </sentence><sentence id="122">Very soon thereafter we got orders to move: all Jews have to move into certain streets or rather remove themselves from certain streets in, in Warsaw, and there were some streets that were we were allowed to move to and we had to move. </sentence><sentence id="123">We were allowed to -- my parents had a store right across the street from our apartment, so in order to move fast like we were ordered many -- much of our belongings were put in the store and little by little we would carry to the new so-called apartment. </sentence><sentence id="124">And one day before we knew it, we woke up and the gates of the ghetto were closed, everybody trapped. </sentence><sentence id="125">And I didn't realize it then but I did realize that there were so many people walking in. </sentence><sentence id="126">Now I know that it was because we were squeezed into a smaller area and also there were people brought in from other places into Warsaw ghetto, and therefore there were so many people and so many hungry and dead and cold people and there was nothing that anybody can do. </sentence><sentence id="127">Now the Germans daily would go out and catch people in the street, take them to what they called the Umschlagplatz*, put them in trains and send them out. </sentence><sentence id="128">As a matter of fact, at the beginning, one of my aunts who had a husband and a son a year older than I was when they saw the advertising that the, the Germans put out that anybody who comes on his own to that Umschlagplatz will be treated well and sent to a camp for the duration of the war. </sentence><sentence id="129">My aunt packed for them their belongings and -- like bags -- and she got them there without knowing where they were going. </sentence><sentence id="130">Never saw them again and after a while we started hearing that that those people are not being sent to work. </sentence><sentence id="131">And you know, nobody wanted to believe. </sentence><sentence id="132">People were...started jumping off trains if they could. </sentence><sentence id="133">Whether they get shot or not, they tried. </sentence><sentence id="134">And more and more we started hearing that that people are being brought to camps and never heard from afterwards. </sentence><sentence id="135">To me, it was unbelievable. </sentence><sentence id="136">Nobody told me anything, but I could hear the adults talking among themselves. </sentence><sentence id="137">So it became worse and worse and then after they caught everybody in the streets, they started clearing out building by building. </sentence><sentence id="138">They made unannounced visits and called everybody to come down and be marched away. </sentence><sentence id="139">They also organized some factories. </sentence><sentence id="140">I remember I -- I was in one. </sentence><sentence id="141">I always looked older than I was and somehow my aunt, my aunt, my uncle, they took me along and I worked. </sentence><sentence id="142">This was after they took my parents away. </sentence><sentence id="143">&gt; Mrs. (Polish). </sentence><sentence id="144">3 The deportation area that separated the ghetto from surrounding Poland (German). </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="195">Q: Back up a little bit and tell us what happened to your parents. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="197">A: Well, my parents...my parents perished separately. </sentence><sentence id="198">They -- when the Germans organized factories, everybody had to register and go to work, which they did, but then one day they marched off everybody from the factory and that's how my father got caught. </sentence><sentence id="199">He went to work, never came back. </sentence><sentence id="200">The whole group was marched to Umschlagplatz and sent away. </sentence><sentence id="201">My mom, she went out one morning to see if she could exchange some clothes for some food for the family and she got caught on the street and sent to Umschlagplatz. </sentence><sentence id="202">Never saw her again. </sentence><sentence id="203">Now, my older sister -- we, we then had to move again twice after, after that. </sentence><sentence id="204">And at that time, my older sister and I, we went with, with my grandmother, my aunt, and my aunt's little boy. </sentence><sentence id="205">We were living in Muranowska, and one day when the Germans came in to look for us, we had, we had hiding places. </sentence><sentence id="206">We had -- well, I have to go back and describe the hiding place. </sentence><sentence id="207">In this building, like in many buildings in Warsaw, the outside walls are very thick and there was no refrigeration at that time, so usually underneath a window there would be a little cabinet that served as a refrigerator. </sentence><sentence id="208">The buildings were made of stone and therefore keeping things cool and the walls are very wide. </sentence><sentence id="209">We were, we were in such a building and at the time my grandmother, my aunt and her little boy would sit right underneath in the, in the little cabinet underneath the window, and I put a chair in front of it so nobody notices there is a door. </sentence><sentence id="210">Then there was a folding bed that folded up to look like a table with a mattress inside and my sister went inside, and I folded the bed and I threw something over it so that she cannot be noticed. </sentence><sentence id="211">And I went -- I was supposed to go upstairs to the attic and hide in the attic, but by the time all that was done there was no time to go to the attic, so I went to the little bathroom which had a shelf. </sentence><sentence id="212">Where I sit now across was a shelf, up high, and on the wall that they had a ladder standing there for whatever reason. </sentence><sentence id="213">I jumped on top of the shelf in the bathroom and there was the bulb, the light. </sentence><sentence id="214">I quietly unscrewed the bulb and I made sure that my clothes don't show down and I sat there quietly. </sentence><sentence id="215">Well, the Germans came in and they found my sister....So that's how I lost my parents and my sister. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="235">Q: What did you do when the Germans left? </sentence><sentence id="236">They had taken your sister? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="239">A: Yes. </sentence><sentence id="240">We, we heard some shots and, and, see, my aunt and my grandmother could see through a little ventilator that was in the wall, but they didn't tell me anything, but I heard from neighbors that they have shot my sister, but I don't know for sure. </sentence><sentence id="241">Over the years I've been trying to find her. </sentence><sentence id="242">You know, just, just the possibility...right? </sentence><sentence id="243">Nobody told me for sure. </sentence><sentence id="244">So that's how I lost them. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="251">Q: What happened after that incident? </sentence><sentence id="252">Where did you go? </sentence><sentence id="253">What did you do? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="257">A: Well, I had, I had, I have an uncle who was married and -- to a Polish lady, and she was with him in the ghetto all the time. </sentence><sentence id="258">They lost a son to, to illness and my other uncle together with his brother decided -- and my aunt -- they decided that something has to be done and we have to leave, so they went out and they found an apartment somewhere, very inexpensive with one bedroom and, first, her husband, my aunt's husband, my uncle, came out to live in that apartment. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="262">Q: Excuse me -- you're saying they found an apartment outside the ghetto. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="266">Q: How -- can you explain how did they find it? </sentence><sentence id="267">They were not allowed to go out. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="270">A: Well, they smuggled themselves out with a group of people that was going to work, to labor. </sentence><sentence id="271">There were factories -- there were places where, outside of the ghetto, where Jews were marched to every morning and brought back to the ghetto every night, and they worked there, and you could apparently -- I wouldn't know how, but apparently you could. </sentence><sentence id="272">I heard that you could sometimes find either a nice or a greedy soldier who was watching and for some money would let somebody out. </sentence><sentence id="273">I haven't witnessed it that but just heard. </sentence><sentence id="274">I know that my uncle would go out with a group of people. </sentence><sentence id="275">They were going to, to a factory that used to belong to a family person like a cousin or of, of the family's who had a factory of, of electric chandeliers, and the Germans took it over, and I think that they kept him as a manager or something, or as a foreman, and groups were coming in to work. </sentence><sentence id="276">They probably switched their chandeliers. </sentence><sentence id="277">They didn't do chandeliers, only did other things in there, but it was still something. </sentence><sentence id="278">So the groups were coming in and out and he could go out, smuggle himself out and then two brothers and one brother's wife. </sentence><sentence id="279">My uncle Janek with his wife Zosia; my uncle Mietek, who was single, and my Aunt Zosia had brothers there who apparently helped them find an apartment and it was all in Aunt Zosia's name. </sentence><sentence id="280">That's why it was a small apartment, and they made a double wall over there. </sentence><sentence id="281">In the little bedroom they made a double wall and that's where later on my grandmother went out this way into that apartment. </sentence><sentence id="282">My uncle came to pick them up, and then my aunt went, and...with a baby, little Jakov, who was born in May of "39 just before the war started. </sentence><sentence id="283">And little by little, whoever was left -- my grandmother, my aunt, my other aunt, two uncles, and I was left and my Aunt Tecia, the one who sent her husband and son on the on the trip, well, she was a nurse and a very good nurse, and my uncle came to take her out, and she refused to go. </sentence><sentence id="284">Apparently, she knew there were rumors, must have been rumors about the, the revol- the revolt, and as a nurse she wanted to be there and besides by that time she realized that her husband and son are dead, so she did not want to leave. </sentence><sentence id="285">Anyway, it was decided that I go out, so my uncle took me out. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="302">Q: Can you describe to me what Warsaw was like at that point? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="304">A: Oh, when, when I left the Warsaw ghetto, there were still some buildings there staying, standing. </sentence><sentence id="305">The, the ghetto was, was -- there was very few people -- not, not more people. </sentence><sentence id="306">Most people were either in the factories or gone from the factories, and on the street you didn't see anybody. </sentence><sentence id="307">You couldn't. </sentence><sentence id="308">When, when I left Warsaw a year later to go to camp, that's when Warsaw looked terrible, all burned out. </sentence><sentence id="309">But when I left ghetto it was still standing and the revolt started and after it was finished, I took a -- when I was outside I was able to, to ride in a tram, tramway around the walls and I saw it burning, and I saw the airplane coming and bombing it, and I saw it all burning, and I couldn't even shed a tear. </sentence><sentence id="310">You become so strong. </sentence><sentence id="311">I never thought about it, but you become so strong. </sentence><sentence id="312">The, the survival -- the urge to survive becomes number one priority, and I just looked at it and my thought was that I mustn't cry because other people will see me. </sentence><sentence id="313">Unreal, but true. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="324">Q: Let us go back. </sentence><sentence id="325">Now you're still in the Warsaw ghetto. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="399">A: Oh, we didn't, we didn't stay there too long. </sentence><sentence id="400">As I said I felt safe but it was not very safe because in a very little time, soon after we got there, after the curfew there was a knock on the door and some agents came in. </sentence><sentence id="401">They spoke Polish. </sentence><sentence id="402">They must have been German agents that knew Polish. </sentence><sentence id="403">You know, there were some people there they call themselves Volksdeutche,* but they, they spoke Polish very well. </sentence><sentence id="404">I don't know who they were. </sentence><sentence id="405">They were civilians, but I remember they wore boots, high boots. </sentence><sentence id="406">They came in and they looked and they found a little trap door and they got us all out. </sentence><sentence id="407">Oh, yeah. </sentence><sentence id="408">So, it wasn't that safe as I thought. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1108">Q: Can you tell me a little more about what Ravensbruek was like? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1110">A: Ravensbruek was a very huge camp and there were inmates from many, many nations. </sentence><sentence id="1111">In the short stay I could notice truck-fulls of bodies -- how skinny, just bones and skin, bodies, dead bodies. </sentence><sentence id="1112">They had, they had a place where they hung people. </sentence><sentence id="1113">I did not witness any, any hangings but they, they had a place and I could see the trucks going back and forth with bodies here and bodies there. </sentence><sentence id="1114">We did not do much over there. </sentence><sentence id="1115">We were then transported to another camp. </sentence><sentence id="1116">And that was in a forest and it was a smaller camp, and we were building this railroad tracks for, for a narrow or a short distance train. </sentence><sentence id="1117">It was very cold. </sentence><sentence id="1118">We were marched every morning, after what we call Apell? </sentence><sentence id="1119">time. </sentence><sentence id="1120">We were marched to work. </sentence><sentence id="1121">Were putting the, the railroad tracks and the ties and while we were doing that, while we were marching, we were guarded by SS people, men and women with dogs and when we got there they would, we would make a fire so they could stay and keep warm while we were working and worked. </sentence><sentence id="1122">Towards the evenings, we were coming back and we would get watery soup, or water, whatever. </sentence><sentence id="1123">In that camp was really bad. </sentence><sentence id="1124">deg Roll call (German). </sentence><sentence id="1125">The, the, the SS men and the SS women, they were beating everybody they could see and the, the terrain was wet. </sentence><sentence id="1126">They would put people face down and, and just stomp on them and beat them. </sentence><sentence id="1127">I saw once thing like that. </sentence><sentence id="1128">After this railroad thing, one day I was transferred to another barr- to a barrack where they had a factory and they told me they are parts for airplanes, but all I saw was little screws or little small items that you had to punch holes in and they told us how to do it, so | immediately asked if my mother could come, too. </sentence><sentence id="1129">It was really not safe to do that, but I did and they said, "Yes," so Pepi and I were brought, worked in that factory and she was working there testing. </sentence><sentence id="1130">You have to test if they are good or bad, and most of them were bad, really, but we had to, we had to produce something because the foreman tried to be nice to, to us, not to beat us or anything, and we all tried to back him up and he had some quota to fulfill. </sentence><sentence id="1131">If there is so and so much bad output, then he would be punished, so I remember Pepi was telling me that she was checking and she was saying, "Make good ones, make bad ones, whatever." </sentence><sentence id="1132">And we worked there 12 hours a day. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1162">Q: You pretended that Pepi was your mother? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1164">A: Yes, yes. </sentence><sentence id="1165">It so happened that during all this time that I met Pepi, she tried to protect me and I tried to protect her. </sentence><sentence id="1166">She lost her own child and apparently she felt she wanted to help. </sentence><sentence id="1167">She, she was an outstanding person. </sentence><sentence id="1168">To describe her, I probably couldn't. </sentence><sentence id="1169">That's how good she was, and for everybody to everybody -- to humanity. </sentence><sentence id="1170">On my side, she, she had dark hair, brown eyes, and she looked Jewish. </sentence><sentence id="1171">I don't know what it means to look Jewish but that's what the stereotype is, look Jewish. </sentence><sentence id="1172">On the other hand, I didn't very much. </sentence><sentence id="1173">And I felt that in this respect if I say she's my mother, she will gain from it. </sentence><sentence id="1174">I could have made a mistake. </sentence><sentence id="1175">I don't know. </sentence><sentence id="1176">I think this was behind my thinking and it worked somehow. </sentence><sentence id="1177">So we were there, and, and being together with somebody you care for was excellent. </sentence><sentence id="1178">At the evening, Pepi would teach me history, math, and she would talk to me about her husband, who might be alive. </sentence><sentence id="1179">By the way, she found him after the war. </sentence><sentence id="1180">He survived, yes. </sentence><sentence id="1181">And Pepi was teaching me a lot. </sentence><sentence id="1182">We, we didn't have a piece of paper or a pencil, but she would teach me a French song or geography, explaining things. </sentence><sentence id="1183">It helped a lot. </sentence><sentence id="1184">It helped a lot. </sentence><sentence id="1185">I, I felt real good, and when you when you feel good, you're with somebody, you care for somebody, it makes you feel good; and Pepi cared for everybody, Pepi cared for everybody. </sentence><sentence id="1186">One day I saw Pepi doesn't eat her portion of bread and I said, "What you -- ?" </sentence><sentence id="1187">She says, "I was hungry. </sentence><sentence id="1188">I ate already." </sentence><sentence id="1189">No she didn't. </sentence><sentence id="1190">There was a Pani Arova who was very, very sick. </sentence><sentence id="1191">A wife of a Polish major who we knew from Zoliborz, where we worked in the restaurant. </sentence><sentence id="1192">I think she lived in the same apart- building. </sentence><sentence id="1193">Pepi found her and since she was elderly, Pepi gave her her portion of bread, but she wouldn't tell me about it, and sure enough when I found out I said, "Then we'll share mine," and she said "No, you're a young child. </sentence><sentence id="1194">You have to survive." </sentence><sentence id="1195">I mean, I had problems with, with this that she would give away everything to everybody. </sentence><sentence id="1196">She was just fantastic. </sentence><sentence id="1197">What a human being. </sentence><sentence id="1198">I'm not the only one who, who gained by her being around, who gained so much of everything, of understanding, of love, of helping others. </sentence><sentence id="1199">She was just fantastic. </sentence><sentence id="1200">So then we were in the camp and we heard some rumors that the war is coming closer. </sentence><sentence id="1201">But we didn't know anything. </sentence><sentence id="1202">This foreman apparently he also felt that Pepi was a nice and a good person, a worthwhile. </sentence><sentence id="1203">He somehow let her know that things are going better for us. </sentence><sentence id="1204">In other words, things are not going so good for the Germans, and at one time he gave her a piece of paper and a pencil so that she could teach me something. </sentence><sentence id="1205">She wanted to teach me something to write and, and he, he did that, but we had to give it back right away, so we knew that something is, is happening, but we didn't know what. </sentence><sentence id="1206">And, and the hope was really making us imagine better things, so one day -- it must have been again in March or April, in March, I think, March of "45 -- they put us in trains and they sent us to so-called "Free work." </sentence><sentence id="1207">Each one was assigned to some deserving German family or on a farm to work and this, Pepi and I we were assigned to two villages not far from each other in the northern part of Germany near Rostock. </sentence><sentence id="1208">I was in Ktlingsborn, and she was in Bornhagen. </sentence><sentence id="1209">And we were there until May, I think, 5. </sentence><sentence id="1210">We were liberated by the Russians, who didn't believe that we did not cooperate with the Germans. </sentence><sentence id="1211">It, it was hard for them to understand because we were working here on, for a family or for a farmer so they, they just didn't believe that about a month or six weeks ago we were taken out of, of concentration camps and, and put there for whatever reason, I don't know. </sentence><sentence id="1212">And that's where we, we were liberated. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1267">A: Well, Pepi made out. </sentence><sentence id="1268">Pepi made out little, called a little -- a travel document, in Russian, and she put some stamps, different colors rubber stamps that mean nothing in German or whatever, whatever she could find in the farmer's, in the farmer's place and the, the Russian that occupied the farm that she was, they stayed there. </sentence><sentence id="1269">They made it a headquarters, and in a couple of days I came running to her because where I was, was terrible, so I stayed with her and she made out those papers and she told the Russians that we want to go back home. </sentence><sentence id="1270">One of them, quite an intelligent fellow, he says, "Well, why don't you go to Russia. </sentence><sentence id="1271">Your daughter will go to school and, and you'll be fine and I'll write to my commandant to, to arrange for you." </sentence><sentence id="1272">So Pepi asked me, "Do you want to go to Russia?" </sentence><sentence id="1273">I said, "No. </sentence><sentence id="1274">I, I want to go home and see if I can find somebody alive." </sentence><sentence id="1275">So she, she said, "We'll have to think about it, want to see who is alive." </sentence><sentence id="1276">And they said "Oh, you can find out from there, too. </sentence><sentence id="1277">Just go to Russia." </sentence><sentence id="1278">Anyway, Pepi got some kind of a carriage that took us, horse and buggy, that took us out and with those papers that she prepared, we got ourselves to Berlin. </sentence><sentence id="1279">And when we got to Berlin there was a a Jewish office on Rikostrasse (ph), a Jewish office where there were DPs, and we went there to register to, to say that, "We're alive, we're here, and what next?" </sentence><sentence id="1280">And the funniest thing happened: when I when I was interviewed by the interviewer on Rikostrasse in Berlin, he didn't want to believe that that I was Jewish. [ </sentence><sentence id="1281">had problems convincing him, but I could prove it. </sentence><sentence id="1282">I could prove it with the names and, and what little I knew. </sentence><sentence id="1283">It was, the names of my family and, and we had a conversa- a lengthy conversation "til, "til he believed me. </sentence><sentence id="1284">And we stayed in Berlin for a while. </sentence><sentence id="1285">That was another chapter that was very heartbreaking, however, nobody was getting killed and that was the good part. </sentence><sentence id="1286">And the Allies brought some food and some clothing and people were looking for each other. </sentence><sentence id="1287">It was just like drunk with freedom. </sentence><sentence id="1288">Everybody was drunk with freedom but looking, "Who...who is alive? </sentence><sentence id="1289">What do we do?" </sentence><sentence id="1290">But this was the good part of it. </sentence><sentence id="1291">The bad part of it is that I didn't find anybody when I tried to go back. </sentence><sentence id="1292">Tried to go back and, and didn't find anybody. </sentence><sentence id="1293">That was bad. </sentence><sentence id="1294">Later on I found my father's brother in England with his family. </sentence><sentence id="1295">I found my youngest uncle in Israel who went there before the war as a khalutz,!deg and then I found that my Aunt Esther and her husband who was in Russia survived, and then they found little Jacek, and they came to Israel as a family. </sentence><sentence id="1296">And that was something out of this world. </sentence></p></dialogue>
