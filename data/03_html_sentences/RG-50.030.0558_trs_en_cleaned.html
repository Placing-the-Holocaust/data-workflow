born, but that's what is in my birth certificate. </sentence><sentence id="9">My family was in hiding. </sentence><sentence id="10">Year 1943 was the worst year for Jews, ever, in Poland. </sentence><sentence id="11">Until today I don't understand how my mom could afford to get pregnant, you know, during such a horrible time. </sentence><sentence id="12">But anyhow, she had the baby in hiding. </sentence><sentence id="13">Most of my family was hiding in the -- the -- in the barn. </sentence><sentence id="14">The family lived in a small village. </sentence><sentence id="15">We had a little bit of land, couple houses, nothing big. </sentence><sentence id="16">But enough, big enough to be hated by all Polish neighbors. </sentence><sentence id="17">So my family, which means my grandmother, my grandpa, and bunch of cousins, they were hiding in the barn -- paying, of course, huge money for it. </sentence><sentence id="18">And my mom had me that summer, I don't know where, and with help of midwife. </sentence><sentence id="19">Well, the midwife, she was Polish, and she didn't want to have a Jew -- Jewish baby, you know, for longer than few hours. </sentence><sentence id="20">So   ontectnetonancedjusetneey for tarher biormatoerabouttfisotecion she kept me actually one day after I was born. </sentence><sentence id="21">And then my mom, you know, after delivery, she was sick, not able to -- to do nothing. </sentence><sentence id="22">So my two uncles, my mom's brothers, they came to pick me up. </sentence><sentence id="23">It is very important to understand that I was one day -- one day old. </sentence><sentence id="24">My -- my mom was the only daughter, and she had four brothers. </sentence><sentence id="25">Two of them, they took me from that midwife, to the place that the family was hiding. </sentence><sentence id="26">And I was crying and crying and crying. </sentence><sentence id="27">By the way, I just learned this all few years ago. </sentence><sentence id="28">I had no idea what happened to me. </sentence><sentence id="29">But my uncle who -- who was about to die, finally he felt that he needs to tell me something. </sentence><sentence id="30">So that's how I learned, you know. </sentence><sentence id="31">Today I am 65, and I was probably about 60 when the -- you know, I learned what happened to me. </sentence><sentence id="32">So anyhow, I was crying, I was screaming. </sentence><sentence id="33">Probably I was hungry, I was wet. </sentence><sentence id="34">And all those people hiding there were scared that, you know, they gonna be killed because of me. </sentence><sentence id="35">So my grandma, according to my uncle, my grandma decided that I cannot be with them. </sentence><sentence id="36">She came up with an idea that she" Il -- they will put me on -- on the ground where people walk by a lot, and somebody will see a crying baby and will take the baby. </sentence><sentence id="37">That's what she was hoping. </sentence><sentence id="38">Well, nothing like this happened. </sentence><sentence id="39">They put me on that frozen ground. </sentence><sentence id="40">It -- you know, the beginning of April in Poland -- I don't even think it was April, cause the -- there is no certain date, you know, that's -- probably it was in March, because it was very, bitterly cold. </sentence><sentence id="41">So they put me, you know, on that cold ground, you know, and they were looking through, you know, sort of the hole in the wall, looking at me what's gonna happen. </sentence><sentence id="42">And people were walking -- were walking by, and nobody   stopped. </sentence><sentence id="43">Nobody stopped. </sentence><sentence id="44">I was screaming like crazy, they were crying. </sentence><sentence id="45">Finally, after I don't know how many hours, my grandma said no, I -- I cannot do this. </sentence><sentence id="46">She decided, you know, to take me back and when night came, my two uncles took me -- still, you know, screaming, to the house of the lady, very simple woman, who was apparently mentally sick and nobody talked with her. </sentence><sentence id="47">People were scared of her. </sentence><sentence id="48">So she was without of contact with -- with anybody. </sentence><sentence id="49">And her house was on the -- on the skirt of that village. </sentence><sentence id="50">They took me there, cause they thought, she's alone, maybe she will take the baby. </sentence><sentence id="51">So one year old baby -- I mean, one day old baby -- this is very important and that's why I repeat it, you know, they put me on her steps. </sentence><sentence id="52">I was screaming. </sentence><sentence id="53">She opened the door, she saw the baby, she took me in. </sentence><sentence id="54">So this was 43.I was in her house until "45. </sentence><sentence id="55">No idea how -- how -- what happened during this time. </sentence><sentence id="56">I might suspect that when I was crying, she was beating me up, because, you know, she was scared, too. </sentence><sentence id="57">So, actually -- okay, of course, there was no milk. </sentence><sentence id="58">I was feeding, you know, with potatoes and water. </sentence><sentence id="59">I don't know how this happened that I survived. </sentence><sentence id="60">It's -- I've talked to the doctors, they say they never heard about such a thing. </sentence><sentence id="61">But anyhow, what happened during these two years, my mom, of course -- my father was in a forest, hiding there. </sentence><sentence id="62">And my mom was very depressed. </sentence><sentence id="63">She was 19.She lost her baby, which she never touched. </sentence><sentence id="64">She didn't have parents and family. </sentence><sentence id="65">So she, one day she decided to go where they were hiding to see her mom and her dad. </sentence><sentence id="66">And the people who in the meantime took over our houses, our land, these people saw d---her going there. </sentence><sentence id="67">And they let know to the police -- Polish police, which was   ontectnetonancedjusetneey for tarher biormatoerabouttfisotecion working very close with Gestapo, and th-the Germans came, killed almost everybody immediately. </sentence><sentence id="68">My two uncles, they were not there, they were hiding in the fields. </sentence><sentence id="69">So my mom, apparently that they -- they didn't kill her at once, but she was hurt badly. </sentence><sentence id="70">And a few years ago, I went there. </sentence><sentence id="71">I was told not to by many people, because the people living there, they remember the family. </sentence><sentence id="72">They stole everything which belongs to us, and I was told it's dangerous to -- even to be around, especially that I look hundred percent like my dad, so I am very easy to recognize. </sentence><sentence id="73">But I did, I go, I did go there. </sentence><sentence id="74">And I saw -- I met li--a lady who was -- I was just asking million questions, you know, and just between one sentence and the other, she told me about my family. </sentence><sentence id="75">I couldn't believe my ears, but I -- I didn't even ask about the family. </sentence><sentence id="76">But she started to say, oh, we've had the Jews, you know, here. </sentence><sentence id="77">There were parents and five kids, you know. </sentence><sentence id="78">There was one -- one girl and four brothers. </sentence><sentence id="79">And that girl, she had a baby that's -- the lady is telling me, you know, I am standing in front of her. </sentence><sentence id="80">And -- and she says, but that baby for sure didn't survive, she says. </sentence><sentence id="81">And she says, I will never forget the scene the day they killed all -- all that family, you know, hiding there. </sentence><sentence id="82">And she was not killed immediately, but she was hurt badly. </sentence><sentence id="83">And she had the long hair. </sentence><sentence id="84">They grabbed her, you know, for the hair, and they were dragging her through the main street of that village to the nearest forest. </sentence><sentence id="85">And they then -- she was killed there. </sentence><sentence id="86">And that woman tells me, you know, I -- this --I--I can see like today, you know, that blood, you know, behind this woman. </sentence><sentence id="87">She had no idea who she talking to, and I had a dilemma, you know. </sentence><sentence id="88">I -- I wasn't sure -- I mean,   ontectreferannetaushariarg tr hither btrmedortabeat fielder that was no time to think it over, but I-- you know, I wanted to do something
