<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="23">A: The name of the village was Ringendorf. </sentence><sentence id="24">In spite of the fact that it was so small that it didn't even fit on the -- doesn't appear on most maps, it had a Jewish community. </sentence><sentence id="25">It had a synagogue which, of course, was destroyed during the war. </sentence><sentence id="26">And I -- the house in which I was born is in shambles, but it's still there. </sentence><sentence id="27">My family moved to Strasbourg in -- when I was three years old. </sentence><sentence id="28">My father was a sheep raiser, a very unusual kind of a profession for -- occupation for a Jew. </sentence><sentence id="29">His father, whom I never knew, was a butcher. </sentence><sentence id="30">They're all family of Jewish butchers, but he broke out of there, "though he had barely, probably, a sixth grade education, and he became one of the most prominent sheep-breeders in the east. </sentence><sentence id="31">So I grew up in Strasbourg, which was a vibrant, vibrant and dynamic, Jewish community. </sentence><sentence id="32">I have a brother -- I should say, I had a brother, because he died some 14 years ago after loosing his son in the Yom Kippur War in Israel. </sentence><sentence id="33">My brother was just a year younger than myself, and both of us were very active in, in the Jewish youth movement, which were the Jewish scouting movement, Les Eclaireurs Israelites de France. </sentence><sentence id="34">Les "EIF," as we called them. </sentence><sentence id="35">And I'm going to refer to them many times in this hour to come. </sentence><sentence id="36">I also got a very solid Jewish education there -- very unusual for girls my age. </sentence><sentence id="37">I went to Talmud Torah all through my high school, and was very active in things Jewish. </sentence><sentence id="38">And particularly, as I said, in the Jewish youth movement, the scouts, where I was a leader and had leadership training. </sentence><sentence id="39">I went into the lycee," like all kids my age. </sentence><sentence id="40">I got a good classical education, I suppose. </sentence><sentence id="41">In those days, it was the typical classical education: studying Latin and Greek and philosophy, whatever. </sentence><sentence id="42">But when I finished high school and got my baccalaureate in 1938, I wanted to become a physicist. </sentence><sentence id="43">But somehow I was talked out of it, because the writing was on the wall, and somehow was told that was not a thing to do for a Jewish girl, and that it would be better in -- to go into something more practical. </sentence><sentence id="44">And so I went into early childhood education, and I'm stuck. </sentence><sentence id="45">I mean, I never moved away from that. </sentence><sentence id="46">So I got one year of training, and that's all." </sentence><sentence id="47">The Israeli Scouts of France (French). </sentence><sentence id="48">&gt; French grammar or high school, funded by the State (French). </sentence><sentence id="49"> But already in 1938, while the Munich Agreements and the debates were going on, my parents sent me to safety with my grandmother -- then very close to 80. </sentence><sentence id="50">And I went somewhere in the south of France with her for just a short period. </sentence><sentence id="51">Then things calmed down again and I went back to Strasbourg. </sentence><sentence id="52">And we stayed in Strasbourg. </sentence><sentence id="53">By 19 -- by the end of the summer 1939, of course, we knew war was coming. </sentence><sentence id="54">And again, I was shipped to the center of France with my grandmother. </sentence><sentence id="55">I was eighteen years old. </sentence><sentence id="56">But the safety of my grandmother was utmost. </sentence><sentence id="57">That was my ma -- paternal grandmother, lived with us. </sentence><sentence id="58">And I was sent down south to take care of her. </sentence><sentence id="59">In the meanwhile, Strasbourg, which was the most -- considered the most exposed city of France in spite of the Maginot Line -- was completely evacuated. </sentence><sentence id="60">All the population of Strasbourg was evacuated and sent down to the to the Perigeaux, to the Department of the Dordogne. </sentence><sentence id="61">But somehow, because my parents had their own private means, they did not join the flow of refugees going down south and they went near Nancy, where they rented a house. </sentence><sentence id="62">Now, here I am south with my grandmother and -- when things settled down. </sentence><sentence id="63">But because you had relatives, somehow it was they were able to get in touch with me. </sentence><sentence id="64">And so I returned to Blamont, where my parents were living, with my grandmother. </sentence><sentence id="65">And there we were waiting for the war to finish. </sentence><sentence id="66">We had just with us whatever we needed. </sentence><sentence id="67">And when the winter came, we needed some more clothes. </sentence><sentence id="68">And I remember to this day, going with a "safe- conduct" -- that what you call it? </sentence><sentence id="69">A "sauf-conduit. </sentence><sentence id="70">"(r) And we went into Strasbourg, my brother and I. It was a ghost town with just cats and dogs in there, and we got some winter clothes and went back to Blamont. </sentence><sentence id="71">In the meanwhile, I took a job in Paris, in, in a private school, to -- because I had had some training in early childhood education. </sentence><sentence id="72">And I worked there, while the bombs, the bombings were starting, and taught in the shelters, and so forth and so on. </sentence><sentence id="73">But that lasted a very short period, because my mother took sick, and I returned to Blamont in the spring of 1940, just in time for the invasion. </sentence><sentence id="74">And so we were in -- | think the invasion is four -- the fifth or sixth of May 1940. </sentence><sentence id="75">My very religious family had prepared everything for Shabbat, and the first time in their life, they had to take to the road on the Shabbat. </sentence><sentence id="76">And here we were, loading as much as we could in a car and taking off direction unknown, because the Germans were -- had crossed over. </sentence><sentence id="77">Coming through Belgium, Holland, and crossing over. </sentence><sentence id="78">And we were very close to the border, so we left. </sentence><sentence id="79">As a matter of fact, a neighbor of ours had a car. </sentence><sentence id="80">Was a crippled lady and her daughter. </sentence><sentence id="81">And nobody to drive the car. </sentence><sentence id="82">And I had had two lessons in driving, so I took the wheel, and followed my brother with...

And they were placed in families throughout Alsace. </sentence><sentence id="126">And Andree was already the person to take care of them, and to, to see to their safety. </sentence><sentence id="127">How she got in touch with me, I will never know because unfortunately she died a few years ago, before I ever really cleared this up. </sentence><sentence id="128">But she said they -- I was needed in one of the camps, and explained the situation. </sentence><sentence id="129">And this is the first time I knew about camps. </sentence><sentence id="130">And to this day, it's a great guilt that I carry, that I didn't know about these camps. </sentence><sentence id="131">But I packed and I left. </sentence><sentence id="132">Not very much support from my family. </sentence><sentence id="133">I was very distressed because my mother was not terribly well, had taken very hardly all these changes in leaving Strasbourg. </sentence><sentence id="134">But I left. </sentence><sentence id="135">Of " Soldiers of the Police Militia (French). </sentence><sentence id="136">&gt; The correct name of this bureau is: Commisariat General aux Questions Juives [Commission for Jewish Affairs] (French). </sentence><sentence id="137"> course, there were plenty of people on the farm. </sentence><sentence id="138">And I, and I just packed my things, and I went to Rivesaltes. </sentence><sentence id="139">Now, I don't know if you want me to go into any explanation as to what Rivesaltes was. </sentence><sentence id="140">I'm sure you know about Rivesaltes, but I didn't know. </sentence><sentence id="141">And I went there, and became a resident -- a worker for OSE.deg At that time, OSE had -- of course, Madame Salomon sent them over to there -- another worker, Vivette, and a doctor, Doctor Malkin. </sentence><sentence id="142">And then there were other organizations that, like the OSE, had resident workers there. </sentence><sentence id="143">There was the Unitarians, the Quakers, the CIMADE," and a number of other rescue agencies -- Secours Suisse,(r) particularly. </sentence><sentence id="144">The Swiss Relief Agen... I'm not sure exactly what it was called. </sentence><sentence id="145">And the primary job of these agencies was to help improve the conditions of the people there, because the camps hygienic and physical conditions were beyond descriptions. </sentence><sentence id="146">The camp was situated in an area where what I remember mostly is the wind blowing -- this hot wind called "La Tramontane,"" which, the people being so weak from malnutrition, they just rolled along with the wind. </sentence><sentence id="147">They couldn't, they couldn't walk in the wind. </sentence><sentence id="148">Now, in the camp there was still some Spanish refugees from the Franco wars, and in the camps were all the Jews that had been deported from Rhineland, from areas along the Rhine, on the -- in Germany. </sentence><sentence id="149">Some of them had already been in Gurs, another very infamous camp in the southwest of France, and transferred to Rivesaltes. </sentence><sentence id="150">After a year of internment, they were in very weakened condition already. </sentence><sentence id="151">Because, although as I understand it the food that was provided was according to the Geneva Convention, but much of it disappeared on the black market. </sentence><sentence id="152">In addition to which, there wasn't much food, period, in France. </sentence><sentence id="153">And one of the jobs of OSE, which was originally actually a medical social agency, was to provide extra rations for the people. </sentence><sentence id="154">So that became one of the important tasks of OSE, to distribute whatever it could. </sentence><sentence id="155">Some day it was milk from the Secours Suisse. </sentence><sentence id="156">Sometimes it was dates. </sentence><sentence id="157">Sometimes it was a handful of olives. </sentence><sentence id="158">And always a little bread that we had to divide. </sentence><sentence id="159">I shall never forget entering into the barracks and dividing the breads in eight pieces. </sentence><sentence id="160">And how can you make them exactly equal? </sentence><sentence id="161">So we put numbers of them, so that it was like a, a lottery for people to get the piece of bread. </sentence><sentence id="162">So that no one would be slighted, because fights would erupt around the size of a piece of bread. </sentence><sentence id="163">I remember handing a man in the barrack a piece of bread and his just falling back. </sentence><sentence id="164">And he was dead. </sentence><sentence id="165">That was the condition of the adults. </sentence><sentence id="166">And, of course, the men lived in their own barracks, and the women in their own. </sentence><sentence id="167">deg Oeuvre de Secours aux Enfants [Organization for Children's Rescue] (French). </sentence><sentence id="168">7 Comite d'Inter-Mouvement aupres des Evacues [Committee of Inside-Movement related to Evacuants] (French). * </sentence><sentence id="169">Swiss Rescue (French). </sentence><sentence id="170">deg North wind; Tramontana (French). </sentence><sentence id="171"> And the children, we tried to keep them in special il6t'deg where we kept the children, and tried to provide as much as we could for them in terms of extras. </sentence><sentence id="172">A lot of little activities, and so on. </sentence><sentence id="173">My -- but the particular purpose for my going to Rivesaltes was to take care of the children. </sentence><sentence id="174">Not so much the administrative work to which I'm going to come a little bit later. </sentence><sentence id="175">Oh, I did food rationing, this food ration distribution; but I took care of the children. </sentence><sentence id="176">I remember the first Saturday afternoon, Shabbat afternoon, we gathered. </sentence><sentence id="177">I had two hundred and eighty kids for one Oneg Shabbat."" </sentence><sentence id="178">And I've been trying to do something in one, one big barrack. </sentence><sentence id="179">But there were wonderful people among the internees. </sentence><sentence id="180">There were some people who -- whose moral fiber was just such that they wanted to do something for the others. </sentence><sentence id="181">So there were teachers, there were rabbis, there were people who, who lent a hand. </sentence><sentence id="182">And we tried to provide whatever we could and -- with nothing. </sentence><sentence id="183">Singing, dancing --whatever we could. </sentence><sentence id="184">I also created some groups of girl scouts. </sentence><sentence id="185">I mean, girl scouts in a camp! </sentence><sentence id="186">It sounds ridiculous when I think of it today, but that's all I knew in, in, in activities. </sentence><sentence id="187">So I created girl scouts. </sentence><sentence id="188">But when I have the pictures to show you later, I had -- we organized activities. </sentence><sentence id="189">In the meanwhile, OSE proceeded to get the liberation from the camp of the children under 16.And some over 16 as well, because you could just work around that a little bit. </sentence><sentence id="190">The procedure is well-known today. </sentence><sentence id="191">I think that the way it was done it was that you could get the permissions through some very cooperating officials in the Department de Herault, where Perpignan was -- no -- in Herault. </sentence><sentence id="192">Not in Perpignan, in a neighboring Department. </sentence><sentence id="193">To get the children into residence there. </sentence><sentence id="194">And once they were there we could of course disperse them into the very number of children's home that existed, that OSE had set up in the south of France after having transferred the children from the children's homes around Paris. </sentence><sentence id="195">Because -- all right, I have to back-track a little bit there. </sentence><sentence id="196">OSE had already set children's home up around Paris in the late "30s for children who had come from Germany. </sentence><sentence id="197">In fact, I had been offered a job in one of these homes and instead went to work in Paris. </sentence><sentence id="198">So we had all these children's home existing there, and it was a an administrative procedure in trying to get these children out. </sentence><sentence id="199">But it was not only that. </sentence><sentence id="200">It was it was persuading the parents to let the children go. </sentence><sentence id="201">Mind you, at that time we had not -- deportations had not started yet there. </sentence><sentence id="202">They were still -- we are still in the early part of 1942 now. </sentence><sentence id="203">Yeah, we're still in the early part of 1942, and the deportations haven't started. </sentence><sentence id="204">But there were rumors of shipping the people off to labor camps or resettlement camps. </sentence><sentence id="205">Far from us was any kind of idea of what -- where they were really sent. </sentence><sentence id="206">But OSE had had the foresight, through some people like Andree Salomon and a doctor, Joseph Weill, to think of saving the children and getting them out. </sentence><sentence id="207">And at numerous occasion, I had opportunity to convoy children out or to take children out. </sentence><sentence id="208">I remember one particular group that sticks in my mind of all of it. </sentence><sentence id="209">We had a small group -- but sizeable enough -- of Down's Syndrome children in the camp. </sentence><sentence id="210">Very young, small Down's Sy -- and there was a place for them in Bergerac, in the Dordogne, and here we are on the Rivesaltes. </sentence><sentence id="211">I mean, had to cross all the "deg Small islands, figuratively (French). " </sentence><sentence id="212">Sabbath entertainment, rejoicing, and reception (Hebrew). </sentence><sentence id="213"> south of France. </sentence><sentence id="214">And I took these children by train to Bergerac. </sentence><sentence id="215">There must have been five, six of them. </sentence><sentence id="216">These children had actually learned to walk in the camp, had never known how to take steps. </sentence><sentence id="217">And we get to the station, and they didn't know how to go down or up stairs because they had just never experienced this. </sentence><sentence id="218">In addition to which, they were -- had Down's Syndrome. </sentence><sentence id="219">But that's the one convoy I remember, of all of them. </sentence><sentence id="220">I'm not sure exactly why, but I remember this one more than anything else. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="422">Q: What was that trip like? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="424">A: I only remember that, that -- the steps. </sentence><sentence id="425">What it was on the train, I really don't remember. </sentence><sentence id="426">I know I got them to safety in Bergerac. </sentence><sentence id="427">What happened to them afterwards, I don't know, but we got them out. </sentence><sentence id="428">What I do remember very vividly is the deportations starting. </sentence><sentence id="429">And that was in August, I think, of August of "42. </sentence><sentence id="430">It was again a matter of sending people in work camps -- to work camps, or to resettlement camps. </sentence><sentence id="431">I think we should have known that that wasn't quite it, because they were rounding up. </sentence><sentence id="432">I can see this elderly woman on crutches, and I can see the young people and I can see the sick -- all being called out on this enormous empty space in the camp of Rivesaltes and crossing the line over as their name was called. </sentence><sentence id="433">I also remember this very dignified young Rabbi, who would not hurry this woman on crutches, and walking over that empty space. </sentence><sentence id="434">Now, I was very young. </sentence><sentence id="435">And I had learned a lot about humanity while I was in this camp. </sentence><sentence id="436">I learned a lot. [ </sentence><sentence id="437">remember one woman, and to this day I remember her name. </sentence><sentence id="438">Do you want her name? </sentence><sentence id="439">She was Madame Grynszpan. </sentence><sentence id="440">In fact, she was an aunt of the young Grynszpan who, who started things in Kristallnacht because he killed the attache in Paris. </sentence><sentence id="441">And she was always -- in spite of the horrible conditions there, she managed to have a neat scarf on her head and lipstick on. </sentence><sentence id="442">And she says, "The day you are going to see me without my makeup, you know, that's the end for me." </sentence><sentence id="443">I know she escaped, because I -- one day I saw her on the train station in Rivesaltes. </sentence><sentence id="444">And, of course, I made no effort to acknowledge that I recognized her, because she had escaped, and so I know she escaped. </sentence><sentence id="445">So I -- one thing is that I had -- I learned so much from the, the, the dignity and some of the attitude of the people who were living under these horrible conditions. </sentence><sentence id="446">I was, I was very young, and, and it made a tremendous impression on me. </sentence><sentence id="447">I remember these first convoys. </sentence><sentence id="448">The train came to Rivesaltes, to the tracks there, and people were boarded. </sentence><sentence id="449">Now, I do not remember cattle trains. </sentence><sentence id="450">These were regular trains. </sentence><sentence id="451">But what I remember mostly, too, was during that period there were categories of people that could be deported and some who couldn't. </sentence><sentence id="452">There were still categories, because -- gosh, how naive we were -- and thought that it was going to continue. </sentence><sentence id="453">If you had been fighting in World War II on the Allied or some -- or in World War I, I should say that. </sentence><sentence id="454">If you had been born one, one parent, there were categories who were non-Jewish. </sentence><sentence id="455">Or if you had resided for that long in Paris. </sentence><sentence id="456">So we scrambled for certificate from concierge to demonstrate that he had -- so and so had lived in Paris for that period of time. </sentence><sentence id="457">We scrambled for all kinds of documents, sometimes falsifying them somewhat. </sentence><sentence id="458">And I remember, three of us -- I don't remember who the third one was. </sentence><sentence id="459">But I know was Jacqueline Levy, with whom I've discussed this very recently. </sentence><sentence id="460">We had all of a sudden, people were all in the trains. </sentence><sentence id="461">And we hadn't -- we had these papers to get twenty people out of, of the train. </sentence><sentence id="462">And we went through the train and got these 20 or 21 or 22 people  out of the camp, because we had these wonderful papers. </sentence><sentence id="463">What we didn't know is that there was a quota for that train. </sentence><sentence id="464">And while we scrambled to get twenty people out, twenty other people were rounded up without -- regardless of their status, and were just added to the train. </sentence><sentence id="465">When I discuss -- I remember discussing this in Paris a few years back with Jacqueline, and she said she shared exactly what I felt. </sentence><sentence id="466">She said when she found that out it was a nightmare to realize that the defensive people actually were replacing these people in, you know, in, in the train that we so miraculously saved. </sentence><sentence id="467">Nobody was saved, finally. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="512">Q: How did you choose the people to save? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="514">A: Be--because we had the papers. </sentence><sentence id="515">We, we didn't choose anybody. </sentence><sentence id="516">We managed to, to put together a, a record for these people, enough papers to fit the categories. </sentence><sentence id="517">We didn't choose anybody. </sentence><sentence id="518">I mean, the papers came through. </sentence><sentence id="519">This certificate and that certificate, and this document. </sentence><sentence id="520">And we had sufficient documents for these select twenty people. </sentence><sentence id="521">So we didn't choose them. </sentence><sentence id="522">We -- oh, gosh, no. </sentence><sentence id="523">Nobody played God. </sentence><sentence id="524">But that's what -- that's how we got them out of the train, only we were not realizing that actually twenty-odd people would be added to the quota. </sentence><sentence id="525">Can I stop? </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="552">A: Well, during this -- starting in -- as I said, starting in, I think, in August, through September and through the end of the year, deportations continued because round-ups of Jews. </sentence><sentence id="553">First it was the foreign-born Jews. </sentence><sentence id="554">Then it was different -- other categories of Jews. </sentence><sentence id="555">And then it was Jews, period, that were rounded-up. </sentence><sentence id="556">And Rivesaltes became the center from which they were sent off to destination unknown. </sentence><sentence id="557">But in the meanwhile, we continued to try to get out as many children as possible through the legal means. </sentence><sentence id="558">And when the legal means didn't work. </sentence><sentence id="559">Because we felt a sense of urgency, sometimes we stood watch at the gates when the trucks came loaded with Jews into the camp, to try to separate the children from the families right then and there so that we could get them in the special barracks for the children and work on their liberation right away. </sentence><sentence id="560">I mean, in retrospect, to ask the parents who were so bewildered coming into the camp and to separate from their children. </sentence><sentence id="561">And we had them in, in, in the special barracks, where the children worried about their parents, where they saved food for their parents, where they matured so quickly. </sentence><sentence id="562">They, they -- sort of there was a, a reversal, as they worrying about their parents just like a parent would worry about a child. </sentence><sentence id="563">And we became also very aware that in the meanwhile -- for a very hypocritical reason of family  reunion -- the French police were -- was going back to the to the homes, the children's homes, to get the children back into the camps for family reunion purposes. </sentence><sentence id="564">So we had to try to avoid that as well. </sentence><sentence id="565">Both in the homes, which was impossible when they rounded up the kids, but when they came back into the camps. </sentence><sentence id="566">And some, of course, were deported with their parents. </sentence><sentence id="567">Some under 16, and definitely the over 16 as well. </sentence><sentence id="568">By the end -- I forget exactly the date -- when the invasion of North Africa came about by the Allies -- all of France was occupied. </sentence><sentence id="569">And I remember the Germans coming down south. </sentence><sentence id="570">In fact, coming there had been no Germans in Rivesaltes. </sentence><sentence id="571">This was strictly Vichy government. </sentence><sentence id="572">But when the south of France was occupied, the Germans came in as well, and then the round-ups started harder and harder. </sentence><sentence id="573">And I remember one particular one on Simchat Torah. " </sentence><sentence id="574">&gt; And on Simchat Torah, the very religious Jews, about to be put into the trucks and from the trucks into the into the trains, were dancing to rejoice with the Torah -- which they didn't have. </sentence><sentence id="575">But this was still a holiday that we're celebrating. </sentence><sentence id="576">And truckloads of Jews were coming in from Belgium and from Holland, and from all over. </sentence><sentence id="577">And rounded up all over. </sentence><sentence id="578">And among them, some French-born Jews. </sentence><sentence id="579">It was just absolutely, at this point, a very -- I imagine they were French Jews; I'm not quite sure. </sentence><sentence id="580">But anyway, they were rounded-up, coming into the camp. </sentence><sentence id="581">In the meanwhile, we continued to get the children out. </sentence><sentence id="582">And one of the one of the girls from my group of teenagers, who was liberated from the camp and then placed very briefly with the scouts, was eventually placed into my family to help my parents at the farm. </sentence><sentence id="583">She is still living today in Israel, and is my sister-in-law. </sentence><sentence id="584">She married my brother. </sentence><sentence id="585">This is a girl who was born in France of Polish parents, and the parents never bothered to acquire the French nationality. </sentence><sentence id="586">So when the war came, they were all put into Rivesaltes: her two parents, her two brothers. </sentence><sentence id="587">The father was deported right away into forced labor, which means he was sent to his death. </sentence><sentence id="588">The older brother joined the Maquis"(r) -- the French underground -- and was killed under such horrible condition that I have never found out the details. </sentence><sentence id="589">The younger brother was placed by OSE, by one of our network workers; and is living still in Israel. </sentence><sentence id="590">And Rachel living with my family. </sentence><sentence id="591">And her mother survived -- also helped by OSE. </sentence><sentence id="592">She just died a year ago in Israel. </sentence><sentence id="593">So by the end of 1942, there remained but about five hundred people in Rivesaltes. </sentence><sentence id="594">And all the kids had been -- whatever kids we could liberate, we had sent into various camps to the various children's homes, I'm sorry. </sentence><sentence id="595">And, of course, also into the youth facilities of the Jewish scouts, because they had facilities for over-16s. </sentence><sentence id="596">And, of course, we had to lie about the ages; and, of course, we had to get them out. </sentence><sentence id="597">See, by then we still had not directly worked in an underground or in illegal kind of way; except that when the pressure came, we tried to help kids escape as much as quickly as we can. </sentence><sentence id="598">I remember always wearing a cape. </sentence><sentence id="599">Girl scouts had capes in those days, khaki capes. </sentence><sentence id="600">And you could get a baby under your arms, you know. </sentence><sentence id="601">And you could walk out of the camp with children. </sentence><sentence id="602">The Secours Suisse smuggled @ Rejoicing of the Torah (Hebrew). </sentence><sentence id="603">8 Anti-Nazi military partisans, associated with other groups in the French Resistance. </sentence><sentence id="604"> a truck into the camp, and we smuggled children out of the camp under milk cans. </sentence><sentence id="605">And we there are many different stories to tell as how kids came out, and the one I remember mostly is the one having children on the -- actually, literally, in my arms under my cape. </sentence><sentence id="606">But I don't remember what happened afterwards. </sentence><sentence id="607">We handed them over to another network. </sentence><sentence id="608">Each one of us did only one piece of the work. </sentence><sentence id="609">The camp was closed in November or December 1942, and whoever was left was sent to Gurs. </sentence><sentence id="610">By that time, I had contracted a horrible jaundice because of the living conditions there at the camp because we social workers didn't have any more better hygienic conditions than the internees, "though I had an individual room. </sentence><sentence id="611">We had one barrack where all the workers had an individual room. </sentence><sentence id="612">But we had no toilet facilities. </sentence><sentence id="613">And we had one bucket that each one of us took turns having in our own room. </sentence><sentence id="614">We also had bed bugs infesting everything. </sentence><sentence id="615">And though my parents occasionally sent me some food, it was run over with worms by the time I got it. </sentence><sentence id="616">But we scraped it off and we ate it anyway, because it was food. </sentence><sentence id="617">And if I ever want to look again in a, in a -- what are they called?Rutabagas, Rutabagas. </sentence><sentence id="618">Never in my life again ever, anyway. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="701">Q: Right. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="703">A: Because I was an accepted French citizen, although Jewish, in the camp. </sentence><sentence id="704">You know, people have asked me, "Did it ?" </sentence><sentence id="705">The same kind of question. </sentence><sentence id="706">First of all, you're young. </sentence><sentence id="707">And when you're young, you feel sort of invulnerable and you really don't think beyond what you have to do. </sentence><sentence id="708">And I think my the other workers were my age. </sentence><sentence id="709">It was it was sort of a natural thing to do. </sentence><sentence id="710">There was a job to be done. </sentence><sentence id="711">It was a natural thing. </sentence><sentence id="712">I don't know. </sentence><sentence id="713">It just I don't think I really thought much of the risk. </sentence><sentence id="714">It was very interesting; you ask me about risk. </sentence><sentence id="715">The camp command the commandant of the camp was a police commissar of the neighborhood in which I had lived in Strasbourg. </sentence><sentence id="716">And he knew my father. </sentence><sentence id="717">I'll talk about him again later. </sentence><sentence id="718">There is a connection there. </sentence><sentence id="719">These people took on jobs which, if, if they had refused to take on these jobs, if more people had refused to do these kinds of things, maybe, maybe just maybe, things would not have worked out the way they did. </sentence><sentence id="720">For us, I don't know. </sentence><sentence id="721">I guess for me the risk I took -- occasional trips to the farm, occasionally. </sentence><sentence id="722">Taking a train to go back to the farm was no excursion. </sentence><sentence id="723">On the trains There were so few trains. </sentence><sentence id="724">I usually traveled with a knapsack. </sentence><sentence id="725">And you tried to get your knapsack through a window; and you climbed through a window, and you stood up all night in the hall. </sentence><sentence id="726">Or I remember standing up all night in the toilets. </sentence><sentence id="727">You know, we were -- there were so few trains, and so little means of transportation. </sentence><sentence id="728">So I did occasionally go back and see my family. </sentence><sentence id="729">I don't not often, but I, I did. </sentence><sentence id="730">What I did, actually, when the camp was closed, I had to go back to my family because I was sick. </sentence><sentence id="731">I was  0 -- and actually, I went to Gurs. </sentence><sentence id="732">And but I -- by Gurs, by that time, they would not let any new workers come into Gurs. </sentence><sentence id="733">And I remember meeting Dr. Joseph Weill in a train, and he says, "You better take care of your -- " I was yellow from here, from the top of my head to the bottom. </sentence><sentence id="734">And I really had to take a rest. </sentence><sentence id="735">So I did go back to the farm just to recover from that. </sentence><sentence id="736">From that jaundice or hepatitis, or whatever you'd call it. </sentence><sentence id="737">And when, when I was healthy enough again, then I went to work in one of the children's homes. </sentence><sentence id="738">Because I couldn't get into Gurs, and here were all these children's homes. </sentence><sentence id="739">And I had the background in education early childhood education. </sentence><sentence id="740">So I took a job as the chief educator, for OSE again, near Limoges. </sentence><sentence id="741">And my family wasn't far. </sentence><sentence id="742">The farm wasn't far from Limoges, in Poulouzat. </sentence><sentence id="743">The Director was Monsieur Job, who later became one of the administrator of OSE, who's still alive in Paris, whom I still correspond with, whom I still see when I'm in Paris. </sentence><sentence id="744">And here we were, taking care of the children whom we had gotten out of the camp. </sentence><sentence id="745">This was a home that catered to maybe 50 children of all ages. </sentence><sentence id="746">And we tried to make the children as live as normal a life as possible -- "normal" in quotation marks. </sentence><sentence id="747">Again, the food situation was terrible. </sentence><sentence id="748">I remember sorting out rice in which mice had gotten. </sentence><sentence id="749">And taking out the, the rice doo. </sentence><sentence id="750">Is that what you call it?

class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1287">A: On regular intervals, I guess, I had to go to Limoges, which was really the headquarters of this area. </sentence><sentence id="1288">And I remember some of the workers there having to do with papers, or having to do with whatever instructions we had about our network, our children. </sentence><sentence id="1289">And I remember walking with this other worker in Limoges, in the city. </sentence><sentence id="1290">And treating ourselves to some of  6 these coupon-free pastries. </sentence><sentence id="1291">We had to -- we could go into a pastry shop, and they had made some pastry out of some God knows what ersatz stuff. </sentence><sentence id="1292">And coming out of it, and a young man coming to us, and saying, "Follow me." </sentence><sentence id="1293">And opening the big book he had under his arm, which was not a book but something that hid a box with a revolver in it. </sentence><sentence id="1294">The -- it was clear that they were not after me as well as after Charlotte. </sentence><sentence id="1295">Charlotte was living in -- she looked very Jewish, by the way. </sentence><sentence id="1296">She was very "typee." </sentence><sentence id="1297">And they suspected her to be part of the Resistance. </sentence><sentence id="1298">And he marched us with this gun under his arm to her apartment. </sentence><sentence id="1299">And there, ransacked her apartment, looking for I'm not sure what. </sentence><sentence id="1300">But I had sewn in the lining of my pocket some seals, to make false papers. </sentence><sentence id="1301">You know, of city halls and town halls, and dates and stuff. </sentence><sentence id="1302">I also had, on cigarette paper, the coded list of my children, because -- I didn't mention this earlier. </sentence><sentence id="1303">OSE had a list of the children with their real names and their false names, with copies in Geneva. </sentence><sentence id="1304">Not one identity was ever lost. </sentence><sentence id="1305">Some children were lost, unfortunately. </sentence><sentence id="1306">But no identity ever got lost. </sentence><sentence

</sentence><sentence id="1310">And here I was, watching calmly as they were ransacking Charlotte's apartment, and trying finding a way of getting at least rid of this incrim-- incriminating documents I had on me. </sentence><sentence id="1311">So I asked to go to the bathroom. </sentence><sentence id="1312">And what I know how to do was to act as a very innocent little girl. </sentence><sentence

came back into the room clear of all this incriminating stuff. </sentence><sentence id="1317">I knew that, you know, we'd get some other seals and we'd get the lists. </sentence><sentence id="1318">They were saved somewhere else. </sentence><sentence id="1319">Legend has it already that I swallowed the cigarette papers. </sentence><sentence id="1320">But I'm sure I didn't.

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1389">Q: How did you help her? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1391">A: I don't -- we didn't. </sentence><sentence id="1392">I wasn't part of that. </sentence><sentence id="1393">The resident workers in Limoges managed. </sentence><sentence id="1394">I don't know how they did it. </sentence><sentence id="1395">I haven't the slightest idea. </sentence><sentence id="1396">I was very anxious to retrieve my knapsack, which had a lot of incriminating papers in it. </sentence><sentence id="1397">And so I got in touch with another worker, who first went to where my knapsack was parked -- I don't remember where -- and got out all the stuff that was in there that would have been incriminating. </sentence><sentence id="1398">And then I got my knapsack back, and then I went back on bicycle 75 miles to Chateauroux. </sentence><sentence id="1399">Now, just a few  7 years ago in Paris, I met a woman who, when we're introduced to each other, says, "Oh, I know who you are. </sentence><sentence id="1400">You spent the night. </sentence><sentence id="1401">You were arrested in my room." </sentence><sentence id="1402">I don't remember. </sentence><sentence id="1403">I have absolutely no memory of it. </sentence><sentence id="1404">She remembered the incident. </sentence><sentence id="1405">She remembers Charlotte, and how she and Paulette and another young woman rescued Charlotte. </sentence><sentence id="1406">I don't know how. </sentence><sentence id="1407">I don't know how. </sentence><sentence id="1408">But for me, I was anxious to get out of Limoges with my cleansed knapsack. </sentence><sentence id="1409">I remember this as a straight route to Limoges. </sentence><sentence id="1410">And I took it a few years back, and it was the rollercoast-- the worst rollercoaster road. </sentence><sentence id="1411">And my husband said to me, "This is a straight road?" </sentence><sentence id="1412">In my memory, this was a straight road. </sentence><sentence id="1413">So I came back to Chateauroux. </sentence><sentence id="1414">And no sooner did I get to my room that my landlady says, "Your friends from Limoges came to see you, and you were not home." </sentence><sentence id="1415">Needless to say that I spent no time in Chateauroux, and took my bicycle and went on to Bourges, where I had somebody else. </sentence><sentence id="1416">But you see, it wasn't always bicycle. </sentence><sentence id="1417">Whenever we could, we took a train and put the bicycle in the luggage compartment. </sentence><sentence id="1418">And we went as far as we could on the train, on where the Maquis had blown up the tracks, we had to get out. </sentence><sentence id="1419">We were always rejoicing when the tracks were blown up. </sentence><sentence id="1420">So we took the bike, and we went a little bit further. </sentence><sentence id="1421">So that way, we, we traveled. </sentence><sentence id="1422">So I went to Bourges. </sentence><sentence id="1423">And I even remember getting a horse and buggy part of the way, putting the bicycle in the back, and getting there until things calmed down until my friends from Limoges were, were sure that I was somewhat safe. </sentence><sentence id="1424">There's another crazy incident that I do remember, is that I had mentioned earlier that the head of the camp of Rivesaltes was the Commissar de Police from Strasbourg. </sentence><sentence id="1425">He ended up being the Commissar de Police of Chateauroux, where I was doing underground work. </sentence><sentence id="1426">And I did something which today seems absolutely crazy to me. </sentence><sentence id="1427">I went to him. </sentence><sentence id="1428">And I told him, "I know you know who I am." </sentence><sentence id="1429">But I told him that I was working under a false name, and what I was doing. </sentence><sentence id="1430">And I was expecting him to leave me alone. </sentence><sentence id="1431">In retrospect, it sounds absolutely totally crazy. </sentence><sentence id="1432">But he never bothered me. </sentence><sentence id="1433">It so happened that after the war as soon as the war was over, and when you know, when they sought out the collaborators, he came to me begging for some kind of, you know, "See what I did for you?!" </sentence><sentence id="1434">But at that time I went to my superiors at OSE, who says, "He doesn't deserve any, any kind of consideration because if he hadn't been the, the commandant of the camp of Rivesaltes and he hadn't accepted that job, it would have been, you know, more to his credit." </sentence><sentence id="1435">So, but this is the -- so but this is the -- so you asked me earlier, "How did it feel?" </sentence><sentence id="1436">I got a sense of invulnerability. </sentence><sentence id="1437">Of -- I had to do a job; and you do it with some kind of daring. </sentence><sentence id="1438">And you, you feel I could wear these uniforms of Red Cross, or doing and, and just pretend and do anything. </sentence><sentence id="1439">And I didn't feel it was anything terribly unusual, because I saw all my peers doing it. </sentence><sentence id="1440">All my peers from the youth movement did the same kind of work, whether it was in the in the escape, the routes to Spain or to, to Switzerland -- or whether it was in the in the Maquis. </sentence><sentence id="1441">Whatever. </sentence><sentence id="1442">We did it because that was the thing to do. </sentence><sentence id="1443">That brings us pretty much to almost the end of the war -- no. [ </sentence><sentence id="1444">remember D-Day -- June 6th, 1944. </sentence><sentence id="1445">I thought it was all over. </sentence><sentence id="1446">It wasn't over by far. </sentence><sentence id="1447">And I put my the gold little flag on my bicycle, but very quickly put it back in. </sentence><sentence id="1448">You see, I had lived as really with these two ladies, who took me for a very good Catholic girl. </sentence><sentence id="1449">In fact, I had a rosary, and I had went to church every Sunday morning in  8 the back of the church. </sentence><sentence id="1450">But anyway, it was too early to really tell them. </sentence><sentence id="1451">I was I was just exploding with telling the truth, but we couldn't because as the in, you know, as the Allies had landed, that didn't mean at all that France was liberated. </sentence><sentence id="1452">And then the fierce battling went on -- the bombings. </sentence><sentence id="1453">I was part of the Red Cross emergency teams, where we went when there were bombings, picking people out from under the rubble. </sentence><sentence id="1454">This was just a civil service of a some job that I didn't do as part of my underground work or anything. </sentence><sentence id="1455">It was just a community work. </sentence><sentence id="1456">And that went on. </sentence><sentence id="1457">And as reprisals, very nearby was this horrible incident of Oradour-sur-Glane, where the Germans locked up the whole population in a church and put fire to the church. </sentence><sentence id="1458">This was non-Jews as well as Jews. </sentence><sentence id="1459">I mean, it had nothing to do -- they had just to do with the psychology of an army that was losing the war and went and arresting more Jews and more kids that came our way. </sentence><sentence id="1460">But don't ask me the details of how it happened. </sentence><sentence id="1461">I know it happened. </sentence><sentence id="1462">I know we did it. </sentence><sentence id="1463">I know I did it, but I don't remember the details. </sentence><sentence id="1464">I don't remember. </sentence><sentence id="1465">More kids coming, and I know we placed more kids. </sentence><sentence id="1466">It was just a frenzy of, of, of needs at that time, until finally the war was over. </sentence><sentence id="1467">I, I know this was a, a very hectic period. </sentence><sentence id="1468">I remember -- one more thing is this team of, of Jewish girls celebrating Passover that spring, in the basement. </sentence><sentence id="1469">And one of us watching, standing guard at the door, just like Marrano-type kind of celebration. </sentence><sentence id="1470">These, some of these little details come up once in a while. </sentence><sentence id="1471">But I have mulled over and over and with great guilt, really, as to why I don't remember individual children and individual stories. </sentence><sentence id="1472">With very few exceptions, I don't. </sentence><sentence id="1473">My sister-in-law, those of my cousins. </sentence><sentence id="1474">And the only explanation I can come up with is that the fear of getting attached or the inability to get attached to individuals, for fear of loss, for fear of getting too close. </sentence><sentence id="1475">And so that I do not remember individual stories, with the few exceptions that I gave you. </sentence><sentence id="1476">Also is I left the United -- I left France in 1946, after filling a couple of years very briefly. </sentence><sentence id="1477">And I had one urge and that is to put everything I cut even loose from the people I worked with during the war. </sentence><sentence id="1478">I never spoke French to my children, never talked about any of that story. </sentence><sentence id="1479">It was all something to put behind me. </sentence><sentence id="1480">And it's not until about 10, 12 years ago or so that I became part of, of those of us who feel a responsibility of, of telling our individual stories. </sentence><sentence id="1481">When the war was over in our in my area, Limoges and Chateauroux, in the fall of 19-- oh, just before the High Holy Days in 1944, when I remember getting my cousins out of that convent, and I remember getting anyway, I just went there and got them and put them on God knows what trucks. </sentence><sentence id="1482">And from one stage to the other, and got them back to the farm. </sentence><sentence id="1483">Because that my, my parents and uncles and aunts were the only living relatives they had, having lost both parents, and leaving them with my family but with very little time to, to spend there. </sentence><sentence id="1484">Because OSE immediately asked me to reopen one of their homes, and I reopened the first home in Montintin, in the center of France. </sentence><sentence id="1485">It was a big old chateau which had been a children's home before, but it was closed during all this clandestine period. </sentence><sentence id="1486">And it was populated by rats and by filth. </sentence><sentence id="1487">And we cleaned the rats. </sentence><sentence id="1488">To today, I stand on a chair if I  9 see a mouse. </sentence><sentence id="1489">In those days, we put traps in, and we caught one rat after another, and we cleansed it. </sentence><sentence id="1490">And it was the most exhilarating kind of experience. </sentence><sentence id="1491">And we got as quickly as we could the children out of the religious institutions, of the Catholic institutions. </sentence><sentence id="1492">And we had no idea yet as to what had happened to their parents, of course, because it wouldn't be until the spring of the following year when the Allies would reach the death camps that we really had the reality of what had happened. </sentence><sentence id="1493">So we did the best we could to create as quickly as we could a real happy Jewish atmosphere for those children. </sentence><sentence id="1494">With nothing. </sentence><sentence id="1495">With whatever we could. </sentence><sentence id="1496">We had staff survive -- survivors. </sentence><sentence id="1497">I remember particularly one couple from Holland who had survived. </sentence><sentence id="1498">And I had really a desire to do something in my field, and that is, create a home for pre-school children. </sentence><sentence id="1499">Because pre-school is, was and has always been -- and continues to be -- my area of interest. </sentence><sentence id="1500">And OSE then replaced, replaced me at Montintin. </sentence><sentence id="1501">And I went to Paris; and with another girl, actually, who had worked in Rivesaltes -- but not for OSE, but for the Unitarians. </sentence><sentence id="1502">Jacqueline and I -- who had the same training under the auspices of OSE -- we set up a wonderful model home for pre-school age children. </sentence><sentence id="1503">Later on, when I read Anna Freud on war and children and infants without family, I realized we really copied -- we copies...no, we didn't copy it. </sentence><sentence id="1504">We initiated the same model. </sentence><sentence id="1505">And these children had survived in hiding -- but not only children who had survived in hiding. </sentence><sentence id="1506">Children who were entrusted to us by parents who couldn't handle them. </sentence><sentence id="1507">They had survived themselves, but they were alone. </sentence><sentence id="1508">And for a period of time, we had these children. </sentence><sentence id="1509">But it was also a training school for early childhood educators. </sentence><sentence id="1510">Actually, my diploma was in Montessori education. </sentence><sentence id="1511">So we set up a Montessori program in, in the -- in a chateau near Paris, which, by coincidence, happens to be the one where I had taught in a private school before the war. </sentence><sentence id="1512">It was a beautiful place, surrounded by ground. </sentence><sentence id="1513">And there I stayed until -- this was "45 -- and all the do-gooders from the United States came over. </sentence><sentence id="1514">Oh, the most wonderful thing I got is a pair of army shoes. </sentence><sentence id="1515">A WAAC" gave me some shoes. </sentence><sentence id="1516">That was wonderful! </sentence><sentence id="1517">And they brought us candy, and they brought us all kinds of stuff. </sentence><sentence id="1518">But the important thing is that I was asked whether I would want to come to the States to continue my training, to go back to France and continue on with my work. </sentence><sentence id="1519">To tell you the truth, I would have gone blind-folded to the moon. </sentence><sentence id="1520">I would have gone anywhere. </sentence><sentence id="1521">This was it. </sentence><sentence id="1522">Was I was ready for a change. </sentence><sentence id="1523">And why me? </sentence><sentence id="1524">Why not Jacqueline? </sentence><sentence id="1525">Jacqueline didn't know English. </sentence><sentence id="1526">She was just as qualified, but I knew English. </sentence><sentence id="1527">This was a scholarship offered by the National Council of Jewish Women, who had set up a program of scholarships to give additional training for people who had worked under these circumstances; in, in Europe, not just in France. </sentence><sentence id="1528">And would return to their countries to continue to improve the situation. </sentence><sentence id="1529">So I had a very hard time. </sentence><sentence id="1530">It's Georges Garel, who actually was wrote paper upon letters upon letters to get me a place on a boat, and I came on a warship in 1946. </sentence><sentence id="1531">And the Council of Jewish Women sent me to Tulane University. </sentence><sentence id="1532">And for one year, but extended my scholarship for a second year, which I completed in Cleveland, and got my Master's Degree in social work. </sentence><sentence id="1533">But in the meanwhile, I had met my future husband. </sentence><sentence id="1534">But I did return to degdeg Women's Army Corps (WAC after 1978). </sentence><sentence id="1535"> 0 France before we got married, and worked for the Joint Distribution Committee. </sentence><sentence id="1536">And there I am worked in -- really, at that time, the local agencies who had all these children's homes and all these children had to reassess the needs of these children. </sentence><sentence id="1537">And I did survey upon survey of facilities -- not just OSE of various children's homes -- to assess their need and to see what else could be done with the children. </sentence><sentence id="1538">And I also set up L'Association des Travailleurs Juives"". </sentence><sentence id="1539">I started with training workers in the various homes, with my newly acquired wisdom in social work. </sentence><sentence id="1540">And I started this program going, going through the JDC.And my commitment was for at least two years, but I was itching to get back and to the States. </sentence><sentence id="1541">And after a year, I came back to the States. </sentence><sentence id="1542">And that's the end of the story, I guess. </sentence><sentence id="1543">I continued in social work for the rest of my life. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1698">Q: What -- tell us a little bit, if you would, about your adjustment to the United States. </sentence><sentence id="1699">What had that year been like when you were here, and what was it like when you returned? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1702">A: Well, when I originally came -- there's two stages there. </sentence><sentence id="1703">It's interesting. </sentence><sentence id="1704">When I went to Tulane University I found this to be a dilemma, which was far below what I was used to in my own work and in my own experience. </sentence><sentence id="1705">And I didn't feel -- besides, I really had no intention of getting a degree. </sentence><sentence id="1706">It was just a year to be exposed to things here. </sentence><sentence id="1707">So I didn't work very hard. </sentence><sentence id="1708">I was asked to talk about my war experience, and I found it very strange. </sentence><sentence id="1709">Why talk about my war experience? </sentence><sentence id="1710">Everybody else had done it. </sentence><sentence id="1711">And why did I have to talk about it?And yet I did because I was their first student. </sentence><sentence id="1712">And I went to their triennial conventions, and I talked about it. </sentence><sentence id="1713">I don't know what I said and how I told the story then. </sentence><sentence id="1714">There was a lot of publicity. </sentence><sentence id="1715">And it bothered me for two reasons. </sentence><sentence id="1716">One, because as I said, it seemed so natural to have done that. </sentence><sentence id="1717">I didn't see what was the big fuss, the heroism about it. </sentence><sentence id="1718">Everybody did it, in my mind. </sentence><sentence id="1719">And the other thing is, is the thought of all the children we didn't save. </sentence><sentence id="1720">And how can you sort of make it this beautiful story? </sentence><sentence id="1721">There was just one other thing is that there were there was a program of Ship-a-Box the Council of Jewish Women had. </sentence><sentence id="1722">And I accepted to talk, provided they sent packages overseas. </sentence><sentence id="1723">And that was one of the, you know, redeeming features of my talking. </sentence><sentence id="1724">When I transferred to Case Western -- no. </sentence><sentence id="1725">It wasn't Case Western, it was Western Reserve University. </sentence><sentence id="1726">I got a somewhat different experience. </sentence><sentence id="1727">And yet, I remember my supervisor, or my faculty advisor, never asking me what my experience had been or what, what my expertise. </sentence><sentence id="1728">I mean, after all, I had left 1 was By then, I was 26 years old. </sentence><sentence id="1729">I was not a kid fresh out of high school. </sentence><sentence id="1730">I mean, this was graduate school because I got credit for all my work I had done. </sentence><sentence id="1731">And I didn't find the academic work any difficult at all. </sentence><sentence id="1732">I didn't find -- what surprised me very much is the true and false kind of multiple choice kinds of things, because I'm not used -- I wasn't used to that kind of thing. </sentence><sentence id="1733">And there was a naivete about people. </sentence><sentence id="1734">I had a sense that they didn't know what life was what real life was about. </sentence><sentence id="1735">It was all textbook kind of stuff. </sentence><sentence id="1736">Until I finally got one supervisor who asked me about -- not about my work during the war, but about my concepts about working with people and children. </sentence><sentence id="1737">And I said, "Finally, somebody feels that we know something there, too." </sentence><sentence id="1738">You * The Association of Jewish Workers (French). </sentence><sentence id="1739"> 1 know, it's not just in the United States that they have invented social work, or that we -- to me, it was much too theoretical and so unhum-- it was right and wrong, and there was no nuances. </sentence><sentence id="1740">There were I fought tremendously with my faculty advisor about one particular area. </sentence><sentence id="1741">Social workers were being trained to work in children's homes in the United States, and I did my field work at Bellfaire in Cleveland, which was one of the top-notch child-care agencies. </sentence><sentence id="1742">They were training the social workers who saw the child one hour a week. </sentence><sentence id="1743">To me, it made much more sense to do it the way we did it in France, and that is, train the house parents who worked with the children on 24 hours a day basis. </sentence><sentence id="1744">And I couldn't understand. </sentence><sentence id="1745">We would train people in France who lived with the children, who were with them all the time. </sentence><sentence id="1746">But we're training a therpa-- a social worker therapist, who saw the child one hour a week. </sentence><sentence id="1747">And that didn't make sense to me. </sentence><sentence id="1748">Does that answer your question? </sentence><sentence id="1749">And but more, I think one of the reasons I was just thinking of something. </sentence><sentence id="1750">One of the reasons I clamed up, too, is that there was such a lack of comprehension as to what really happened. </sentence><sentence id="1751">The questions sometimes were so -- excuse me, but -- stupid. </sentence><sentence id="1752">And it's hard to talk about it. </sentence><sentence id="1753">It still happens today. </sentence><sentence id="1754">I'll give you an example. </sentence><sentence id="1755">Very recently, in Chapel Hill, I was asked to talk to a junior high school. </sentence><sentence id="1756">A very sweet young teacher had her class read The Diary of Anne Frank. </sentence><sentence id="1757">And could I -- she got my names through the Jewish Federation, because I'm very active in the community there. </sentence><sentence id="1758">And could I come and talk about my own experience? </sentence><sentence id="1759">And I did, at what I hoped it would be junior high school level -- which is not particularly my forte, but I tried to tailor it to, to them. </sentence><sentence id="1760">And especially ask questions. </sentence><sentence id="1761">And the kids were wonderful. </sentence><sentence id="1762">They really had some very pertinent questions. </sentence><sentence id="1763">The teacher, when I recalled the incident of being arrested and, and Charlotte being put into prison, said, "But on what basis did they arrest her?" </sentence><sentence id="1764">And you know I mean, there's this you feel like screaming! </sentence><sentence id="1765">And, and in front of the kids, I didn't want to tell the teacher what kind of question is that. </sentence><sentence id="1766">I said, "This is war. </sentence><sentence id="1767">This is you know, you don't have to have any reason." </sentence><sentence id="1768">And so on. </sentence><sentence id="1769">So in retrospect, I think, also this was one of the reasons maybe I didn't talk about it. </sentence><sentence id="1770">The other thing is, in Cleveland we really had -- there were some people there was a whole a group of German Jews who had left Germany. </sentence><sentence id="1771">That's how I met my husband. </sentence><sentence id="1772">He's, he's from Germany. </sentence><sentence id="1773">He has a whole other saga to tell, but which he wouldn't tell, because he cannot talk about it. </sentence><sentence id="1774">But there was a group of what I called people with European background, and as one didn't need to talk about this. </sentence><sentence id="1775">This was really my circle. </sentence><sentence id="1776">One of my very close friends was from Italy. </sentence><sentence id="1777">My husband's friends were from Germany. </sentence><sentence id="1778">And you didn't have to dwell on these things. </sentence><sentence id="1779">It was part of what you brought with you to your daily living. </sentence><sentence id="1780">And, and I realized, when I started talking about it in Syracuse -- it all started when the Council of Jewish Women in Syracuse had a workshop for teachers in the public school to teach the Holocaust, to introduce the teaching, whatever that means, teaching the Holocaust. </sentence><sentence id="1781">And I participated in this workshop. </sentence><sentence id="1782">And I became aware, and I began to accept, to recount some of that. </sentence><sentence id="1783">Again there was, you know, when I say "Rivesaltes" to most my, my close friends or the people who come from Europe or come from France, it immediately evokes something. </sentence><sentence id="1784">But then I have to go into the detail as to what Rivesaltes, why Rivesaltes, where Rivesaltes, how Rivesaltes. </sentence><sentence id="1785">And it's difficult, and there is this lack of background to do it. </sentence><sentence id="1786">It's interesting. </sentence><sentence id="1787"> 2 When I went to France, well, it just so happened that my husband was transferred to France from "83 to "86. </sentence><sentence id="1788">So I retired from my -- I was teaching at Upstate Medical Center by then, in the pediatric residency program. </sentence><sentence id="1789">And I left. </sentence><sentence id="1790">I retired. </sentence><sentence id="1791">And my clinical practice as well. </sentence><sentence id="1792">So here I was having all this time, and I reconnected with people that I hadn't seen, with people I had worked with in the camps, and so forth and so on. </sentence><sentence id="1793">And we put together our selected memories. </sentence><sentence id="1794">And it was wonderful. </sentence><sentence id="1795">And I was asked by a group I became active in WIZO" -- which is the equivalent of Hadassah -- which I had never done, because I had never had time for this kind of thing. </sentence><sentence id="1796">But I was very happy to create an educational program for them, and a program of activities; and I was asked to talk about my war experience. </sentence><sentence id="1797">It surprised me. </sentence><sentence id="1798">But then I realized there's a new generation. </sentence><sentence id="1799">And they were mostly Jews from North Africa, because the Sephardic community is so much bigger in France today than it's ever been. </sentence><sentence id="1800">And these Jews had all been coming in the "S0s -- after the war -- and they didn't know. </sentence><sentence id="1801">Yet, at the same time, there was a physical closeness being there in Europe. </sentence><sentence id="1802">And when I said "Rivesaltes," or when I say and name any place, there is some response, which made it easier for me to talk there. </sentence><sentence id="1803">And even to talk here. </sentence><sentence id="1804">And that, that's a reality. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1911">A: Yes. </sentence><sentence id="1912">I'll probably think about it tonight. </sentence><sentence id="1913">I, I want to add that I always find it very difficult to do this, to give these talks in the first person. </sentence><sentence id="1914">And yet I know I've got to do it, because that's the only way people will I've had more people who have heard me talk in Chapel Hill recently relate to exp-- pieces of experience. </sentence><sentence id="1915">Each one comes away with another little piece, not the whole. </sentence><sentence id="1916">And I think it's important, because I can -- personally, I cannot relate to anything that's fictionalized about the sho'ah,"* the television series on the sho" ah, or anything that's fictionalized in books or in the media, I just can't even watch. </sentence><sentence id="1917">To me, it's not the real stuff. </sentence><sentence id="1918">And so, I suppose that by my talking and sharing it with others, it's the real stuff. </sentence><sentence id="1919">And maybe something remains for them. </sentence><sentence id="1920">I feel that responsibility. </sentence><sentence id="1921">I really do. </sentence></p></dialogue>
