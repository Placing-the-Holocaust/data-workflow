<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="143">Q: Having all of a sudden this thought or goal, was there anything different about being a Jewish American athlete than just being another great athlete? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="145">A: In my high school years and my junior high school years, there was nothing different about being a Jewish high school athlete certainly not in New York City. </sentence><sentence id="146">I'd competed against everyone. </sentence><sentence id="147">And uh I felt no different than other athletes in school. </sentence><sentence id="148">It was only in my uh freshman year at Syracuse University that I became aware of the fact that I might have been a little bit different when at my first training table meal as a freshman, I asked uh at lunch, the very first meal, please pass the lamb chops, and everyone laughed at the table, because they weren't lamb chops. </sentence><sentence id="149">They were pork chops. </sentence><sentence id="150">So I realized then I was a little bit different than most of the other guys on the football squad. </sentence><sentence id="151">4 This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="152">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="153"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection 5 </sentence></p></dialogue>
