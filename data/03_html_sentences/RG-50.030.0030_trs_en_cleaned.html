<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1335">A: There is...there is a short story I want to tell you. </sentence><sentence id="1336">When I was a young girl...and because being a only daughter, my father took me to a famous rabbi, who came to the city, to be blessed. </sentence><sentence id="1337">When he blessed and put his hands over my head, he says "This girl has a special mission in her life. </sentence><sentence id="1338">She is chosen, and she is going to save hundreds and hundreds of Jewish sisters and brothers. </sentence><sentence id="1339">And that's what her life will be." </sentence><sentence id="1340">My father came home, told my mother. </sentence><sentence id="1341">They said, "What? </sentence><sentence id="1342">Seven year old girl, what he is talking about?" </sentence><sentence id="1343">Um, but naturally I didn't know about it. </sentence><sentence id="1344">Only before I went away, so my mother told me. </sentence><sentence id="1345">Imagine, when you've been...the rabbi told that I don't know why he was telling it. </sentence><sentence id="1346">And um my sister said, "Probably that's what you are doing for Zionism. </sentence><sentence id="1347">That's what it is." </sentence><sentence id="1348">But when I was in camp, I felt something that's...
