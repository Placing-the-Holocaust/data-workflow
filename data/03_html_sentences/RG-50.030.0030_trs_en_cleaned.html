<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1318">A: There is...there is a short story I want to tell you. </sentence><sentence id="1319">When I was a young girl...and because being a only daughter, my father took me to a famous rabbi, who came to the city, to be blessed. </sentence><sentence id="1320">When he blessed and put his hands over my head, he says "This girl has a special mission in her life. </sentence><sentence id="1321">She is chosen, and she is going to save hundreds and hundreds of Jewish sisters and brothers. </sentence><sentence id="1322">And that's what her life will be." </sentence><sentence id="1323">My father came home, told my mother. </sentence><sentence id="1324">They said, "What? </sentence><sentence id="1325">Seven year old girl, what he is talking about?" </sentence><sentence id="1326">Um, but naturally I didn't know about it. </sentence><sentence id="1327">Only before I went away, so my mother told me. </sentence><sentence id="1328">Imagine, when you've been...the rabbi told that I don't know why he was telling it. </sentence><sentence id="1329">And um my sister said, "Probably that's what you are doing for Zionism. </sentence><sentence id="1330">That's what it is." </sentence><sentence id="1331">But when I was in camp, I felt something that's... Often I opened my mouth, and I say things and I do things, like...it's not me. </sentence><sentence id="1332">Like... don't believe in...in...in unnatural or something. </sentence><sentence id="1333">But it was like that. </sentence><sentence id="1334">Because I undertook to save um my friends, and...and implanted in them to do that, too. </sentence><sentence id="1335">So I thought, "Is it me doing that, or is something in me what is doing it?" </sentence><sentence id="1336">So I just show you one sample. </sentence><sentence id="1337">You see, because the girls was wearing one dress and it was in rain or in shine, so they used the blanket what they have to cover up. </sentence><sentence id="1338">And they tore it up to put it around their chest or wherever. </sentence><sentence id="1339">So they took all the girls who been in charge to a room they called sauna, where they usually had once in a while um shower. </sentence><sentence id="1340">And they put a big table there. </sentence><sentence id="1341">And all the commanders of the camp from all over were sitting there. </sentence><sentence id="1342">And they invited all... Invited! ( </sentence><sentence id="1343">Laughter) I am talking invited! </sentence><sentence id="1344">All the...all the woman in charge there, even the charge--it wasn't that we wanted to be in charge. </sentence><sentence id="1345">They pressed us in the charge. </sentence><sentence id="1346">And they...they said, "You know what the women are doing? </sentence><sentence id="1347">They are sabotage!And you... They are tearing the... the German property. </sentence><sentence id="1348">And you are there not to prevent them. </sentence><sentence id="1349">So you know what the punishment is for that? </sentence><sentence id="1350">The punishment for that you are going to go, all of you, to the gas chambers." </sentence><sentence id="1351">Suddenly, something pushed me. </sentence><sentence id="1352">And I stopped...I made a step forwards, announce my number--because that was...we been only number--and I said to him, to the commanders, I said, "I'm not wondering that they are doing that, because every human being "til he's alive is trying to make his miserable life a little bit less miserable. </sentence><sentence id="1353">If you...if you would be in the same position, you would be doing the same thing. </sentence><sentence id="1354">And if you would give us new clothing after such a long time which they are wearing that one um dress--which from rain and shine it's going to pieces--you would do the same thing." </sentence><sentence id="1355">So, he started to scream at me. </sentence><sentence id="1356">He said, "You are a...a [chuke (ph)], a nasty [chuke (ph)]. </sentence><sentence id="1357">How dare you talking to me like that!?" </sentence><sentence id="1358">And that is expression "frech," which I can't um translate. </sentence><sentence id="1359">It's...you know, who has a big mouth [Ger: "insolent, sassy, cheeky"]. </sentence><sentence id="1360">They call it "frech." </sentence><sentence id="1361">So, and he screamed at me. </sentence><sentence id="1362">So I thought...and the girls in the back, they pulled me back. </sentence><sentence id="1363">"Magda, don't do it. </sentence><sentence id="1364">Don't do it." </sentence><sentence id="1365">But L..and, and I tell myself and...and I said what I wanted to say. </sentence><sentence id="1366">And to my surprise, one of the biggest sadists--which I didn't know he is such a sadist, I...I found it out much later--he got up, and he said, "Listen. </sentence><sentence id="1367">She's not only a like big- mouth [chuke (ph)]. </sentence><sentence id="1368">She has something in her head. </sentence><sentence id="1369">She's right. </sentence><sentence id="1370">We have to give them new clothing." </sentence><sentence id="1371">Next day...and they discharged us, and the whole camp got new dresses. </sentence><sentence id="1372">So, I not only saved us three hundred, but saved the camp. </sentence><sentence id="1373">Because they got a little bit warmer and...dresses. </sentence><sentence id="1374">And this is what we did, what we helped each other. </sentence><sentence id="1375">There is another case. </sentence><sentence id="1376">One day, I was watching that the SS man came to select the girls--"left" and "right.". </sentence><sentence id="1377">And who was "left," she had to go to the gas chambers. </sentence><sentence id="1378">And there was present a girl...with the SS man was a um girl present which was Report Schreiberin. </sentence><sentence id="1379">She was the one who wrote the reports. </sentence><sentence id="1380">And she had to make the...all the numbers who will go to the gas chambers. </sentence><sentence id="1381">I was passing by; and I observed that she's writing something. </sentence><sentence id="1382">And then she looks left and right. </sentence><sentence id="1383">And she doesn't see any SS man; and she sends the girls back to the barrack. </sentence><sentence id="1384">And so she saved about three hundred girls from immediate death. </sentence><sentence id="1385">How long they will be alive, this nobody could guarantee. </sentence><sentence id="1386">But she did it. </sentence><sentence id="1387">And I saw many times she did it. </sentence><sentence id="1388">And I had...didn't have even the opportunity to ask how you do it. </sentence><sentence id="1389">But I met her after forty-five years, two years ago, in Prague. </sentence><sentence id="1390">I went to visit her. </sentence><sentence id="1391">And she told...and I ask her, "Tell me, [Gatka (ph)], how did you do it? </sentence><sentence id="1392">I watched you writing, and then you send them back." </sentence><sentence id="1393">She said, "Listen. </sentence><sentence id="1394">We had to do something, because this was no...no end what they did to us. </sentence><sentence id="1395">So I took from the [cart-a-take (ph)] the dead numbers, of the dead. </sentence><sentence id="1396">And I pretend that I am writing. </sentence><sentence id="1397">And nobody saw. </sentence><sentence id="1398">And I send them, because the SS didn't check it later.". </sentence><sentence id="1399">Because anyway so many other was going; so they didn't check if those three hundreds are in it or not. </sentence><sentence id="1400">And that's what she did many times. </sentence><sentence id="1401">There was another um how the girls, they had only one way to help each other or to survive. </sentence><sentence id="1402">By own help; we didn't have anybody to help us. </sentence><sentence id="1403">We been helpless young girls to thrown in such unbelievable situation, which I don't know Dante couldn't um couldn't find out such situation what we been in. </sentence><sentence id="1404">Sick and fighting with every minute. </sentence><sentence id="1405">Because one minute you been alive, the next minute you been dead. </sentence><sentence id="1406">So one more occasion, I tell you: that I was working in a charge, like um a little helper there. </sentence><sentence id="1407">And we had to put the whole barrack on, because a doctor--by the name [King (ph)], and she...her name is Anna, she lives in Australia--and um they had to select the woman out. </sentence><sentence id="1408">But she gave me a hint, while he was turned around, that "I am going to talk to him, and you girls try to pull the girls in. </sentence><sentence id="1409">They should run in the barrack." </sentence><sentence id="1410">So she turned facing him from the front, and she started to talk to him. </sentence><sentence id="1411">She was very...a very clever representative woman. </sentence><sentence id="1412">And she was telling him all different stories; and while the stories she was telling him, I was telling the girls to run, run, run, run back to the barrack. </sentence><sentence id="1413">One--which is remarkable and I never forget, because I didn't overhear all what she was telling him because I was concentrating more girls to go in--so she said, "You know..." And she named the...the... how far he was Oberscharsturmfthrer, or whatever. </sentence><sentence id="1414">You know, he was in... How many...he had on. </sentence><sentence id="1415">And she said, "You know who is ...who is responsible for all the war?" </sentence><sentence id="1416">And he was surprised, and said, "Who?" </sentence><sentence id="1417">And she said, "The bicyclists and the Jews." </sentence><sentence id="1418">And he said, "But why the bicyclists?" </sentence><sentence id="1419">And she said, "Why the Jews?" </sentence><sentence id="1420">You know, and he was laughing, "Ha, ha, ha." </sentence><sentence id="1421">You know, it's a big joke. </sentence><sentence id="1422">And meantime, the selection was over and the camp was saved. </sentence><sentence id="1423">You see, that's how we could do. </sentence><sentence id="1424">There was no other way. </sentence><sentence id="1425">Just by tricking and being courageous. </sentence><sentence id="1426">And our motto was: "We are just going once through the chimney, sooner or later. </sentence><sentence id="1427">But "til we arrive, we have to help each other." </sentence><sentence id="1428">And that's how we helped each other. </sentence><sentence id="1429">And often there was cases, like ... Like I told you, people were sick, you tried to help them. </sentence><sentence id="1430">You had tried to steal some medicine and give them. </sentence><sentence id="1431">But then I myself fell into it; because being always in touch with those sick people, I also got typhoid. </sentence><sentence id="1432">High fever. </sentence><sentence id="1433">My tongue was like the... Did you ever see a chicken stomach from inside, when you open it, how rough it is? </sentence><sentence id="1434">So rough was my tongue. </sentence><sentence id="1435">I had high temperature. </sentence><sentence id="1436">I couldn't eat. </sentence><sentence id="1437">And my    stomach, I had to run. </sentence><sentence id="1438">And no medicaments. </sentence><sentence id="1439">The only thing what I wanted is tomato. </sentence><sentence id="1440">Where to got tomato? </sentence><sentence id="1441">But then a group of girls was working for the Germans--they call it Rajsko,deg in a garden. </sentence><sentence id="1442">And endangering her life, she brought a tomato in under her dress. </sentence><sentence id="1443">Because we been so flat anyway. </sentence><sentence id="1444">So you didn't... And she brought a tomato, and with that I rubbed my tongue. </sentence><sentence id="1445">And then what I was asking, it was lemonade. </sentence><sentence id="1446">Where to get lemonade?But one girl was working in the SS canteen, for the SS. </sentence><sentence id="1447">She was... And so the girls told her, "Can you steal a bottle?" </sentence><sentence id="1448">She said, "I can't, but I will. </sentence><sentence id="1449">If they catch me, I know I'll go to the gas chambers. </sentence><sentence id="1450">But maybe, if I'm lucky, I...I save her." </sentence><sentence id="1451">So she did. </sentence><sentence id="1452">And she managed to steal a bottle, and she brought it and I was drinking that. </sentence><sentence id="1453">Another girl, she said, "I can't give her any medication. </sentence><sentence id="1454">But I can steal some tablets to strengthen her heart. </sentence><sentence id="1455">That's all what I can give." </sentence><sentence id="1456">So that's what was. </sentence><sentence id="1457">And the other thing was because I became blind, and I became bli...deaf and I couldn't walk. </sentence><sentence id="1458">So how can I... </sentence></p></dialogue>

One of the girls who didn't know, she said, "Magda, you handle always people like... like they would be in the kindergarten. </sentence><sentence id="1793">Like you would be a kindergarten teacher." </sentence><sentence id="1794">I didn't tell anybody I am. </sentence><sentence id="1795">But I tried to help them. </sentence><sentence id="1796">I tried to talk to them, and encourage them. </sentence><sentence id="1797">When what happened one day, you know, they selected people and they didn't send them straight away to the gas chamber. </sentence><sentence id="1798">They collected them in one of the barracks, which was Number 25. </sentence><sentence id="1799">And when it was full--and also outside the barrack, because it was a big fence built around them. </sentence><sentence id="1800">Because from beginning, it wasn't a fence and some girls they run through the fence. </sentence><sentence id="1801">Even it was um like nails on the top, but somehow they run through. </sentence><sentence id="1802">Because they wasn't really so bad, so they run through. </sentence><sentence id="1803">So they made a fence all over. </sentence><sentence id="1804">So now they let also on the floor sitting those girls awaiting "til the trucks will come. </sentence><sentence id="1805">And it was hot and no water, and their face was swollen up. </sentence><sentence id="1806">And it was just...their their eyes was....it was just two spots and a nose. </sentence><sentence id="1807">And it is... it is... I tell you, the heart was breaking. </sentence><sentence id="1808">And I was...I, I saw it. </sentence><sentence id="1809">So I volunteered. </sentence><sentence id="1810">I said, "Let me go in." </sentence><sentence id="1811">I asked. " </sentence><sentence id="1812">I am going to to give them water." </sentence><sentence id="1813">They said, "Are you crazy? </sentence><sentence id="1814">If SS man sees you, you go!" " </sentence><sentence id="1815">So I go with them. </sentence><sentence id="1816">But I can't see those people suffer before the last minutes, being so swollen and and dying for a...for a drop of water, in that terrible heat without having anything on their head or protecting." </sentence><sentence id="1817">So I took, you know, a dish and a cup; and I went from one to one. </sentence><sentence id="1818">And I said to myself, "If I die with them, I die. </sentence><sentence id="1819">But I can't...can't see it. </sentence><sentence id="1820">At least, the last moment." </sentence><sentence id="1821">They been so grateful. </sentence><sentence id="1822">They knew they are going to die, but they said, "At least we have a little water." </sentence><sentence id="1823">And you know, the selection was done in a terrible way. </sentence><sentence id="1824">Like sometimes it was a sickness which is not even a sickness. </sentence><sentence id="1825">It is just like a scratching. </sentence><sentence id="1826">You call it "kretze," you know? </sentence><sentence id="1827">It was also an implanted thing. </sentence><sentence id="1828">But they knew about it. </sentence><sentence id="1829">So they let the woman undress totally naked; and when somebody had a little mark of scratch, in they went to the gas chambers. </sentence><sentence id="1830">Then later, I...1 became a block oldest. </sentence><sentence id="1831">And in every barrack, there was a SS man responsible for that barrack. </sentence><sentence id="1832">And he had the right every day to make selection himself. </sentence><sentence id="1833">Even so that many people went to work, but some was staying home because either they didn't needed them or they was not well; so they was at home. </sentence><sentence id="1834">And that SS man made the selection again. </sentence><sentence id="1835">So I said, "How could I stand by and see him selecting the people, my own friends and bro...and sisters?" </sentence><sentence id="1836">So I arranged the girls so that in the front and in the back was a strong girl, and everywhere; and in the middle was the weaker ones. </sentence><sentence id="1837">And I pushed the girls together. " </sentence><sentence id="1838">Cause usually you had to stand so that you can go through, here and there, and here and there. </sentence><sentence id="1839">And he said, "Do you think I don't know why you're pushing the girls so much in together? </sentence><sentence id="1840">So I couldn't walk through, I shouldn't see that they are sick or weak woman which I have to send to crematorium." </sentence><sentence id="1841">And I said, "Yes, that's why I did it. </sentence><sentence id="1842">But I'm going to tell you something. </sentence><sentence id="1843">They are not so sick that a few days at home wouldn't...they wouldn't recover. </sentence><sentence id="1844">They just need a little rest."

( </sentence><sentence id="1848">Pause - drinking water) I want to do something good for Germany." " </sentence><sentence id="1849">What you mean, "good"?" ( </sentence><sentence id="1850">Pause) I said, "You know how many um shoes are lying around, and how many dresses are discarded everywhere? </sentence><sentence id="1851">Lying around in heaps, and not...nothing happen to them. </sentence><sentence id="1852">And those can be recycled." " </sentence><sentence id="1853">What you mean, "recycled"?" </sentence><sentence id="1854">I said, "Washed and dried. </sentence><sentence id="1855">And those girls can do it. </sentence><sentence id="1856">All the shoes," I said, "could be gathered and washed and dried and band together. </sentence><sentence id="1857">And while they are doing that, they will recover." " </sentence><sentence id="1858">Where are they going to do it?" </sentence><sentence id="1859">I said, "In the back in the barrack, there is a wash room. </sentence><sentence id="1860">And they can wash there. </sentence><sentence id="1861">I will look after them. </sentence><sentence id="1862">I will get some string where they will dry the clothes, and they will dry the shoes. </sentence><sentence id="1863">And it's recycled, you can use it again. </sentence><sentence id="1864">And the good things, you can send to Germany. </sentence><sentence id="1865">That's a...a service, isn't it? </sentence><sentence id="1866">Give me that chance!" </sentence><sentence id="1867">And he says, "Have it. </sentence><sentence id="1868">If you want to bother with that, go on. </sentence><sentence id="1869">Bother." </sentence><sentence id="1870">I said, "Thank you." </sentence><sentence id="1871">And I established that, that they was in the back doing what I said. </sentence><sentence id="1872">And I tried to...you call it "organize" food. </sentence><sentence id="1873">I said to the girls, the... Next to the kitchen, it was um onions and potatoes. </sentence><sentence id="1874">And woman was peeling it; and there was a    fence clo...around it. </sentence><sentence id="1875">Not Jewish girls do that, because it was too good for Jewish girls. </sentence><sentence id="1876">Jewish girls would survive there. </sentence><sentence id="1877">So they gave it to the Polish girls. </sentence><sentence id="1878">But you know, one way or another, you make a eye contact; and when nobody sees... So we told them, "Throw some potatoes close to the fence. </sentence><sentence id="1879">And in the evening when nobody's there and the SS man is out, so we will pull that before...between the fence out, the onions and the potatoes. </sentence><sentence id="1880">And we will in this way help each other." </sentence><sentence id="1881">And some of the girls could do miracles. </sentence><sentence id="1882">They could cook from...from nothing. </sentence><sentence id="1883">From nothing. </sentence><sentence id="1884">They could um peel the potatoes; and they found some dish and they made holes in it and they (laughter) mashed it up. </sentence><sentence id="1885">And then they, somewhere from the kitchen--also from...from Polish girl--they got flour. </sentence><sentence id="1886">And they mixed it up and they boiled it. </sentence><sentence id="1887">And it was food. </sentence><sentence id="1888">Additional food. </sentence><sentence id="1889">So you see, little things like that made a difference in helping, somehow. </sentence><sentence id="1890">And some girls who worked outside and digging the potatoes out, sometimes... Again, it was dangerous. </sentence><sentence id="1891">If they catch you with one onion, one potato: death. </sentence><sentence id="1892">But they did it. </sentence><sentence id="1893">They brought the potatoes. </sentence><sentence id="1894">Everyone brought one potato or two, and so they helped somehow. </sentence><sentence id="1895">How long, nobody had a guarantee; because came the selection was so often happening. </sentence><sentence id="1896">So often. </sentence><sentence id="1897">Some...and if...if it wasn't...if it wasn't then, they punished you this way or the other way, or...or beat you up. </sentence><sentence id="1898">I tell you a sample. </sentence><sentence id="1899">A nice girl-- she was blond and blue eyes--and she was working. </sentence><sentence id="1900">SS man came to her.

" </sentence><sentence id="2828">Cause you can't help by the thousands. </sentence><sentence id="2829">Somebody...[, I didn't look nice or whatever." </sentence><sentence id="2830">So she said, "Look, this is not that the SS wants you. </sentence><sentence id="2831">But the underground wants you; because they know that you will try the best to save people, as many as you can. </sentence><sentence id="2832">And if there another woman comes there which is a sadist, she will have the pleasure to do it. </sentence><sentence id="2833">So there is no way. </sentence><sentence id="2834">They choose you. </sentence><sentence id="2835">The underground choose you. </sentence><sentence id="2836">You have to take. </sentence><sentence id="2837">And it's up to you how you will manage." </sentence><sentence id="2838">What can I do? </sentence><sentence id="2839">So they took me to the camp. </sentence><sentence id="2840">And the Lagerkommandant, Kramer!"--which was a man of six foot six, with hands like that--he said, "Here you will be Lageraltest.". </sentence><sentence id="2841">And I looked in. </sentence><sentence id="2842">There was empty barracks, nothing in it. </sentence><sentence id="2843">Not bed, no straw sack, no blankets, nothing. </sentence><sentence id="2844">And I said...clapped my feet and announced my number, and I said, "Lagerfiihrer, please. </sentence><sentence id="2845">Here you want me to be, that next day or the Thursday you can call all the woman "Jewish swines." </sentence><sentence id="2846">Because they're...where can they...they will sleep on top of each other, and they probably won't be able to go to the toilet and they will make on each other!" </sentence><sentence id="2847">So I said, "Why don't you send them straight away to the gas chambers?" </sentence><sentence id="2848">And I said...and he said, "Why you worrying so much about the other people?Worry about yourself, that you take care of yourself!" </sentence><sentence id="2849">And I...but wonder of wonders...Now I tell you, I don't know who was talking from my mouth. </sentence><sentence id="2850">I said again, that ceremony...I said, "If you, in reverse, would be in charge and you will be a Lager oldest; and the prisoners " SS Hauptsturmfihrer Josef Kramer was Kommandant of Birkenau from May 1944, when the Hungarian Jews began arriving, until December 1944, when he was transferred to KL Bergen- Belsen by Rudolf Hess. </sentence><sentence id="2851">   would be your fellow Germans and you wouldn't help them, I would call you "Coward." </sentence><sentence id="2852">And I said it. </sentence><sentence id="2853">I said, "My goodness! </sentence><sentence id="2854">Magda, are you crazy? </sentence><sentence id="2855">Whom you talking? </sentence><sentence id="2856">This is the commander who whenever somebody he doesn't even like or who is just in his way, he grabs it by his neck, squeezes it a minute, throws them like a doll. </sentence><sentence id="2857">And he is killed. </sentence><sentence id="2858">And you telling him what is?" </sentence><sentence id="2859">But I stood straight, and I said, "Be strong, and don't move from this space." </sentence><sentence id="2860">And he looked at me, and he saw I am not shaking. </sentence><sentence id="2861">I am not crying. </sentence><sentence id="2862">I am not begging. </sentence><sentence id="2863">He says, "You know what? </sentence><sentence id="2864">You are right. </sentence><sentence id="2865">Tomorrow you will have what you want." </sentence><sentence id="2866">So I said, "I want beds. </sentence><sentence id="2867">I want straw sacks. </sentence><sentence id="2868">I want blankets. </sentence><sentence id="2869">I want um a utencils to eat; and I want spoons."

There was water for in case there will be fire; so it was from that it would be taken, the water. " </sentence><sentence id="2890">Around that water," I said, "you are going to jump. </sentence><sentence id="2891">Because you are here for helping, not for making yourself comfortable. </sentence><sentence id="2892">You saw me running from morning "til evening to the camp Birkenau. </sentence><sentence id="2893">You saw my feet um swollen like that. </sentence><sentence id="2894">You look at my face, how it's swollen. </sentence><sentence id="2895">You I picked and choose, and I took you out from maybe you wouldn't be alive. </sentence><sentence id="2896">So you do your duty. </sentence><sentence id="2897">And now this was a punishment. </sentence><sentence id="2898">I know you are my friends, and I know you will be angry at me. </sentence><sentence id="2899">But you will remember, because it's still better like a SS man would come in and something is not in order." </sentence><sentence id="2900">So that was it. </sentence><sentence id="2901">But this why I said I was so strict on my own friends. </sentence><sentence id="2902">But one girl um who who was a...she could write poems, she got a paper and she wrote a long poem about me, to me. </sentence><sentence id="2903">That, you know, she appreciates that she knows what I am doing and it was wrong for them to be negligence, a little bit. </sentence><sentence id="2904">But, you know, persons is like that--if he can make himself the life easier, he is. </sentence><sentence id="2905">But not with me. </sentence><sentence id="2906">So one day Commander Kramer came...

" </sentence><sentence id="2949">Fifty people?" </sentence><sentence id="2950">And I said, "Yes. </sentence><sentence id="2951">Fifty people or nothing." </sentence><sentence id="2952">So he said, "Have them!" </sentence><sentence id="2953">So quickly I said to the runner, "Bring the fifty people in the fifth...by the five, five, five..." Whichever, whoever was the first fifty; and we went to the place that all the clothing was done. </sentence><sentence id="2954">I never been there before. </sentence><sentence id="2955">I was standing outside. </sentence><sentence id="2956">And I left the message through that they should prepare little...um it looked like...

" </sentence><sentence id="3031">I am going to shoot your hand with the ring up!" </sentence><sentence id="3032">And I said, "I am in your charge. </sentence><sentence id="3033">Whatever you want, you can do. </sentence><sentence id="3034">I am just a bloody Jewess." </sentence><sentence id="3035">He looks at me and said, "Ah!" </sentence><sentence id="3036">He said, "Ah, get away!" </sentence><sentence id="3037">And he put the revolver back. </sentence><sentence id="3038">And all that, Grese saw. </sentence><sentence id="3039">So, you know, these are the unbelievable believable thing. </sentence><sentence id="3040">So now about Grese: like I told you, she became Lagerfiihrerin in our camp. </sentence><sentence id="3041">And our contact was still the old contact. </sentence><sentence id="3042">When I became there in the camp, I gathered all the doctors from the camp, they should come to me. </sentence><sentence id="3043">And I said to..., "Now Iam going to divide you. </sentence><sentence id="3044">In every barrack will be how many you are, two or three." </sentence><sentence id="3045">I can't remember, but minimum two. " </sentence><sentence id="3046">And you are watching, and you are going to help those people. </sentence><sentence id="3047">I am going to try to get some medicines, whatever. </sentence><sentence id="3048">We can't do miracles, but whatever. </sentence><sentence id="3049">But you watch; and especially watch the mostly for an epidemic." </sentence><sentence id="3050">And they said, "And what we are going to do?" </sentence><sentence id="3051">So I said, "What I am afraid is scarlet fever. </sentence><sentence id="3052">And what you doing with them, straight away came...come to me and tell me about it. </sentence><sentence id="3053">And that person who has that, put in the..." Back of barracks was a room which supposed to be a washroom, but they didn't finish it. " </sentence><sentence id="3054">So that will be the quarantine." </sentence><sentence id="3055">So, suddenly, all the doctors came that "We found two," "We found three." " </sentence><sentence id="3056">But now how to...we are to do with the counting?," </sentence><sentence id="3057">asked me the girls. </sentence><sentence id="3058">So I said, "Leave it to me." </sentence><sentence id="3059">So it was summer...hot. </sentence><sentence id="3060">Hot!The sun was incredible shining, you know? </sentence><sentence id="3061">Like I said, if it was as Satan...Satan was there in this place, in...in Birkenau. </sentence><sentence id="3062">So I approached Grese; and I said, "Irma, look. </sentence><sentence id="3063">Why should you run around in this hot weather and do the counting? </sentence><sentence id="3064">I am going to do the counting for you, and you be comfortable. </sentence><sentence id="3065">Sit down here in this room. </sentence><sentence id="3066">And the report writer, and I will announce her and she will count it up. </sentence><sentence id="3067">And when it's all right, then you..." "You are right." </sentence><sentence id="3068">But she said, "And what will do the Lagerkommandant in from the camp to mine camp?" </sentence><sentence id="3069">And I said, "Are you Lager um Fiihrer of this camp?" </sentence><sentence id="3070">She said, "Yeah." " </sentence><sentence id="3071">Then you do what pleases you the best. </sentence><sentence id="3072">And she has nothing to say in your camp." </sentence><sentence id="3073">And she sat down. </sentence><sentence id="3074">And I sent the runners down, and they put the legs down on the bed, you know? </sentence><sentence id="3075">So it was easy to count. </sentence><sentence id="3076">And they counted, you know, like this. </sentence><sentence id="3077">They didn't go out, because then it would be missing. </sentence><sentence id="3078">So nobody knew about it. </sentence><sentence id="3079">And nobody should know about it. </sentence><sentence id="3080">It was kept secretly. </sentence><sentence id="3081">And so I did the counting for six weeks, "til the scarlet fever is over. </sentence><sentence id="3082">The worst part is six weeks. </sentence><sentence id="3083">I did the counting, and Grese agreed with me. </sentence><sentence id="3084">And it was always the counting right, so she didn't have any excuse. </sentence><sentence id="3085">And that we saved thirty thousand people. </sentence><sentence id="3086">Why I am saying     that, because there was a little camp across or across the road. </sentence><sentence id="3087">They called that camp "Mexico." </sentence><sentence id="3088">It was B...zwei...drei, three. " </sentence><sentence id="3089">2 And there the scarlet broke out, and there wasn't so prepared. </sentence><sentence id="3090">And eight thousand five hundred--healthy or not healthy--all went to the gas chamber. </sentence><sentence id="3091">So that's what it is what I am saying. </sentence><sentence id="3092">That you could be in function which was not very pleasant--because always a Damocles [NB: Sword of Damocles] was hanging over your head--but you had the chance to save people. </sentence><sentence id="3093">I saved the people some other way, too. </sentence><sentence id="3094">Mengele came to select and often I had to be present. </sentence><sentence id="3095">And he did it in the most unbelievable way. </sentence><sentence id="3096">He was whistling the Donau Waltz. </sentence><sentence id="3097">And he said (humming a bar of the Blue Danube Waltz), that means that went to the left.

Because Eichmann was here. </sentence><sentence id="4006">Not I was the one who dictated the...the running of world. </sentence><sentence id="4007">Eichmann did. </sentence><sentence id="4008">Anyway, so the Lager finished abruptly; and Kramer came for me and he said, "Now, come with me. </sentence><sentence id="4009">I am going to take you and you are going to work hard." </sentence><sentence id="4010">I said, "Like all others." " </sentence><sentence id="4011">No, you are going to work harder." </sentence><sentence id="4012">So I said, "This is my fate. </sentence><sentence id="4013">I am going to work." </sentence><sentence id="4014">And imagine, he took me to the kitchen, and-- the lager kitchen--and he announced to the SS woman um...um Schultz... No, I don't say the name because maybe it comes back. </sentence><sentence id="4015">And he said, "Here I bring you a new kapo of the kitchen. </sentence><sentence id="4016">She will be in charge." </sentence><sentence id="4017">And she said, "Fine." </sentence><sentence id="4018">Franz. </sentence><sentence id="4019">Did I said Franz before?Franz. </sentence><sentence id="4020">Because we called her "Franzka." </sentence><sentence id="4021">Franzka. </sentence><sentence id="4022">And um she had a sister there, too. </sentence><sentence id="4023">She was working somewhere else. </sentence><sentence id="4024">And um I knew that there is a kapo, a German woman, who is a lesbian friend--you know, because you knew those things--of a Lageraltester. </sentence><sentence id="4025">A German woman with a red triangle. </sentence><sentence id="4026">And I said, "If I take the position of her lesbian friend, how she will handle the other woman? </sentence><sentence id="4027">Because she will be mad; and mad on...on innocent people." </sentence><sentence id="4028">So I said to her, Franz... said, "Listen, I am not good in those things. </sentence><sentence id="4029">I wouldn't even know how to manage those things. </sentence><sentence id="4030">She is doing a very good job." </sentence><sentence id="4031">But I said, "I would rather do the counting out, the Lager office work. </sentence><sentence id="4032">I'm good in that. </sentence><sentence id="4033">I will count on the food. </sentence><sentence id="4034">How much, so many." </sentence><sentence id="4035">So she said, "But what will the Lagerkommandant Kramer says?" </sentence><sentence id="4036">I said, "He will be satisfied." </sentence><sentence id="4037">Like he would tell me, you know. </sentence><sentence id="4038">I said, "He will be satisfied." </sentence><sentence id="4039">So, in this case, he said, "Go and do the counting." </sentence><sentence id="4040">And I was in the counting; and another woman who used to be in the kitchen in the C, she was suddenly here and she didn't have what to do. </sentence><sentence id="4041">She said, "Can you help me somehow?" </sentence><sentence id="4042">So I said to Franz, to this SS woman Franz, "Listen. </sentence><sentence id="4043">There is so much work. </sentence><sentence id="4044">It's two camps to handle and a little bit too much for me. </sentence><sentence id="4045">Could I have another help?" " </sentence><sentence id="4046">Ah, have how many you need!" " </sentence><sentence id="4047">No," I said, "one will do. </sentence><sentence id="4048">And now I can count wonderful." </sentence><sentence id="4049">People didn't know why they suddenly got double portions. ( </sentence><sentence id="4050">Laughter) Because I counted so many. </sentence><sentence id="4051">But it didn't last long. </sentence><sentence id="4052">With me, it never lasted. </sentence><sentence id="4053">I felt very comfortable there. </sentence><sentence id="4054">You know, we...we did the counting, and...and I was happy to know that people are happy. </sentence><sentence id="4055">Suddenly, they called my number to the front. </sentence><sentence id="4056">When you call the number to the front, that meant that you are going to the Politisch [NB: the Politisch Abteilung] and probably did something terrible, and they are going to kill you. </sentence><sentence id="4057">All the girls said goodbye. </sentence><sentence id="4058">They kissed me, hugged me. </sentence><sentence id="4059">And I went to the front; and here again Kramer with his black car. </sentence><sentence id="4060">And he said, "Sit in the car." </sentence><sentence id="4061">I sat in the car. </sentence><sentence id="4062">So now, he said, "Tell me what did you..." It's a German expression: "ausgefressen" [Trans: "chewed out" or "finished"; colloquialism] Which means, "what did you do wrong?" </sentence><sentence id="4063">What is special, more than wrong. </sentence><sentence id="4064">And I said, "I did always to the best of the people and the running of the camp." </sentence><sentence id="4065">And he repeated it hundred times, and hundred times I said the same thing. </sentence><sentence id="4066">And now when we went to...in the car, so if he would go straight then that means he would take me to the crematorium. </sentence><sentence id="4067">Suddenly, I see that he wents in. </sentence><sentence id="4068">And that was again to the Camp C, where I was. </sentence><sentence id="4069">Why I was afraid that when he said that "What did you do wrong," because I still had the letters which I didn't have time to deliver. </sentence><sentence id="4070">And I thought they found the letters, and now the punishment will be gas chambers. </sentence><sentence id="4071">But no...because he said, "Step out. [ </sentence><sentence id="4072">Ranken (ph)]."" </sentence><sentence id="4073">And he said once more, "What did you ausgefressen?" </sentence><sentence id="4074">And I said, "I did to everything to the best of the camp and the people." " </sentence><sentence id="4075">Is that so?" " </sentence><sentence id="4076">Yes, that's so." " </sentence><sentence id="4077">So here you will be Lageraltester again, but you will have a Weberei." </sentence><sentence id="4078">That means, a Weaving     [Room]. </sentence><sentence id="4079">They...they will be weavers in the camp. </sentence><sentence id="4080">So I became again Lageraltester. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="4313">A: Yeah. </sentence><sentence id="4314">As I mentioned it before, I was um returned by Kommandant um Kramer to Lager C.And there was a Weberei. </sentence><sentence id="4315">We been for a while there. </sentence><sentence id="4316">And in another Lager, in another camp next to us a... It was emptied the camp. </sentence><sentence id="4317">And there was a Lagerfiihrerin, her...her name Danz, was her... And she was a terrible brutal woman. </sentence><sentence id="4318">But the camp was emptied. </sentence><sentence id="4319">And also the girls, whom she was working with, um was free. </sentence><sentence id="4320">So she thought she will put me down, and she will put the other girls on and herself. </sentence><sentence id="4321">And she is push...and she pushes Grese out, too. </sentence><sentence id="4322">So, yah. </sentence><sentence id="4323">She came to the camp; and she says, "Magda, you are not Lageriltester anymore." </sentence><sentence id="4324">And she was watching me what I will say, I will beg for it. </sentence><sentence id="4325">But I said, "That's alright." </sentence><sentence id="4326">So she said I will be um somewhere in a barrack. </sentence><sentence id="4327">I accepted it. </sentence><sentence id="4328">And the other girls came on, with her together. </sentence><sentence id="4329">But she was even more brutal than...than Grese; because she was running like crazy all over the camp with the whip, and whipping left and right. </sentence><sentence id="4330">I was very sorry that is happening, but I had no way to stop her from it. </sentence><sentence id="4331">But there was a German um prisoner, and who was really a...with a black triangle which he was a thief sometime. </sentence><sentence id="4332">But he was sitting many years there. </sentence><sentence id="4333">And he was saying there to a young girl, who he sometimes he rested in...in her barrack; because it was the last barrack on the camp, and he used to come with the kommando there. </sentence><sentence id="4334">And he had different privileges, so he asked if he could rest there. </sentence><sentence id="4335">And he told to that girl, "I will fix her! </sentence><sentence id="4336">Madga is coming back, and that's it!" </sentence><sentence id="4337">So it was really lasting three days. </sentence><sentence id="4338">And after three days, I was back. </sentence><sentence id="4339">Back again in the...like...like Lageraltester. </sentence><sentence id="4340">But it didn't last um very long, because it was coming already close to the march of January 18th [1945], when the death march started. </sentence><sentence id="4341">But...and may I...?Before I go with the death march, I have a few interesting things which I forgot. </sentence><sentence id="4342">First of all, in Lager C--the first time--it was in one...in two barracks was concentrated all the young girls who was from fourteen "til about seventeen. </sentence><sentence id="4343">And in one of the barracks--and Mengele who couldn't, you know, stand such beautiful girls, Jewish girls, being there. </sentence><sentence id="4344">So just when one of the barracks was emptied, either part went on transport or the other part into the crematoria, he asked to transfer all the barrack from one block to Block 3. </sentence><sentence id="4345">And there, at night, they supposed to come for them to be gassed. </sentence><sentence id="4346">He put there, in the front of the barrack, a post man. </sentence><sentence id="4347">Not a post man--a SS man who was...he didn't have a big...a big function, you know?Just a ordinary man, who should um be there on watch. </sentence><sentence id="4348">When I heard what happening, so I went together with the report uh writer of mine. </sentence><sentence id="4349">And I said, "What can we do to save those children? </sentence><sentence id="4350">After all, from no reason whatsoever, from there one day or "nother they should be gassed. </sentence><sentence id="4351">This is our future, if there will be a world. </sentence><sentence id="4352">We need that generation!" </sentence><sentence id="4353">So I said, "You know what? </sentence><sentence id="4354">We are going to approach this man. </sentence><sentence id="4355">And we will have a little chat with him." </sentence><sentence id="4356">Because it was already after the "appell," the counting; and in the camp was no other SS man but him. </sentence><sentence id="4357">So I started to talk with him. </sentence><sentence id="4358">And I said, "How are you" and so so. </sentence><sentence id="4359">And he told me that he is going...tomorrow morning he is going to the Siberia, to the front. </sentence><sentence id="4360">I came with the news together, and said "Oh, here is our chance. </sentence><sentence id="4361">We have to do something." </sentence><sentence id="4362">So she    said, "What?" " </sentence><sentence id="4363">We have to get somewhere a bottle of schnapps and make him drunk." </sentence><sentence id="4364">So we found a bottle of schnapps. </sentence><sentence id="4365">Matter of fact, at that girl's place where the German with the black triangle used to rest. </sentence><sentence id="4366">And he left a bottle, so next day he should drink. </sentence><sentence id="4367">We...we searched all the barracks "til we came to that barrack, and there we find. </sentence><sentence id="4368">So I said, "Gerda, .." She was...that was her name. "... </sentence><sentence id="4369">Go there with a cup and tell him, "Have a little um drink. </sentence><sentence id="4370">Tomorrow you are going to the front. </sentence><sentence id="4371">Be a little bit merry." </sentence><sentence id="4372">So he had a little drink. </sentence><sentence id="4373">After a while, I went and offered him a little drink. </sentence><sentence id="4374">Again, Gerda. </sentence><sentence id="4375">The fourth time, I gave him the whole bottle. </sentence><sentence id="4376">I said, "Look, be merry! </sentence><sentence id="4377">What...you know what happens. </sentence><sentence id="4378">Forget the world." </sentence><sentence id="4379">He was already a little bit tipsy, so he didn't need much. </sentence><sentence id="4380">And when he drank the bottle, he fell asleep. </sentence><sentence id="4381">You know, he slammed down and fell asleep. </sentence><sentence id="4382">I said, "Gerda, that's our oppor...opportunity." </sentence><sentence id="4383">I went to the back of the barrack--which I told you there supposed to be like a wash room, but wasn't. </sentence><sentence id="4384">I knocked on the door. </sentence><sentence id="4385">They opened the door, and I said, "Shhhh..." And I put the girls down in the five, about hundred a time. </sentence><sentence id="4386">And then I just went, and I put the girls in every barrack. </sentence><sentence id="4387">I said, "You have hundred girls more tomorrow on your counting, and don't say anything." </sentence><sentence id="4388">And so by the hundred I took them, and I divided them all over the camp. </sentence><sentence id="4389">And we left. </sentence><sentence id="4390">When everybody was divided, we just left the barrack, closed the door; and we went to bed. " </sentence><sentence id="4391">Til today, we didn't know how it is possible that nobody was claiming the girls and nobody claimed anything. </sentence><sentence id="4392">If they killed the man, or they sent him to the Siberia anyway. </sentence><sentence id="4393">What happened, we don't know. </sentence><sentence id="4394">But one thing I know: that in this way, we saved the eight hundred girls. </sentence><sentence id="4395">And the eight hundred girl... Yah, just with that thinking how can we overcome and play out at Mengele. </sentence><sentence id="4396">Because I was so mad at him that he did it. </sentence><sentence id="4397">Anyway, but um later it was very interesting that... Um now I have to jump ahead. </sentence><sentence id="4398">On that death march when we been already um going towards Malchow,"" but I will come back to it. </sentence><sentence id="4399">So an SS man, in a orderly manner, approached me. </sentence><sentence id="4400">And I don't know from what reason he asked me, "What are you from profession?" </sentence><sentence id="4401">I said, "My goodness me!" </sentence><sentence id="4402">I said, "We are going to Malchow. </sentence><sentence id="4403">What do I need to have profession?" " </sentence><sentence id="4404">No, no. </sentence><sentence id="4405">I need, because I have forty young girls here. </sentence><sentence id="4406">And I want you to be in charge of the forty girls." </sentence><sentence id="4407">And that was a part of those forty girls. </sentence><sentence id="4408">Where the other girls are, I don't know; but I just recently heard that they are still... A few of them, I don't know where else or how many, are living in Israel. </sentence><sentence id="4409">So this is the one thing which I thought I will mention; because it was not such a easy thing. </sentence><sentence id="4410">How when we went to sleep "til we woke up, we thought, "My goodness!If they found out..." But they didn't, thanks heavens. </sentence><sentence id="4411">Then (cough) the other thing which I forgot. </sentence><sentence id="4412">In Birkenau, one um day I was called again to the front. </sentence><sentence id="4413">Always called to the front. </sentence><sentence id="4414">And the Lagerkommandant said to me that a Russian um village is coming here as an exchange for the Russian...for the German generals. " </sentence><sentence id="4415">And we found in the papers that you are a kindergarten teacher, so you will take over this whole um Russian village except the the woman between eighteen "til thirty-five. </sentence><sentence id="4416">The rest--the little babies, the pregnant woman, the whole, the old ones--belongs... Um, you will take them over." </sentence><sentence id="4417">So I again open my mouth; and I said, "In this case, if I have to take over Russian village who has to be exchanged for Russian general, so I want." </sentence><sentence id="4418">And I put conditions. </sentence><sentence id="4419">I said, "I want them to be bathed daily. </sentence><sentence id="4420">I want them to have not to stand on the app...on the counting. </sentence><sentence id="4421">I want to pick um sixteen girls 4 Subcamp of Ravensbriick, located near Mecklenburg. </sentence><sentence id="4422"> out from the Russian woman to be my helpers. </sentence><sentence id="4423">I don't want to them to stand "appell." </sentence><sentence id="4424">And I want them to get the food of the German SS." </sentence><sentence id="4425">You know, I was waiting; and I was thinking, "Madga, you crazy?! </sentence><sentence id="4426">What you are...(laughter) What you are asking? </sentence><sentence id="4427">Who are you to demand?" </sentence><sentence id="4428">And he said, "OK. </sentence><sentence id="4429">You get it." </sentence><sentence id="4430">And so I got the Germa...the Russian village, with the little babies to the old woman. </sentence><sentence id="4431">And, naturally, didn't take them long to find out that the...how the other people lived and how they lived. </sentence><sentence id="4432">So they um...really, they admired me; carried me around, took me to the...to the room. </sentence><sentence id="4433">And they said they will take me to batushka (ph)] Stalin. </sentence><sentence id="4434">They take me to Russia to show me to Stalin. </sentence><sentence id="4435">Thanks very much. </sentence><sentence id="4436">I didn't know then (laughter)... I didn't know what Stalin is, anyway. </sentence><sentence id="4437">And so they stayed with me, and they was very grateful. </sentence><sentence id="4438">One thing, which is a cruel thing of the Germans; that one day they gathered all the children from about um four or six, and they send them to Germany. </sentence><sentence id="4439">And matter of fact, Grese, you see--who always was telling me things... She said, "You know where they going? </sentence><sentence id="4440">They are going to Germany, and they will be um...they will be given away to um the farmers, who hasn't got children, for adoption. </sentence><sentence id="4441">In a few years, they won't even know they are Russians. </sentence><sentence id="4442">And they, the parents, will have a new genera...new children." </sentence><sentence id="4443">Anyway, and um also anoth...another occasion, Grese told me, "You know why we are putting Jewish woman in charge? </sentence><sentence id="4444">With all the strength which you wouldn't want to, I know. </sentence><sentence id="4445">But imagine, if the war will be over and the Germans are losing, so they won't...they won't remember the SS. </sentence><sentence id="4446">But they ..._ Because they don't see them so often. </sentence><sentence id="4447">But they will remember those girls with whom they been everyday, and who had such a hard position, when they are so hungry, thirsty and tired. </sentence><sentence id="4448">And now comes a woman in charge; and maybe she raises her voice or demanding. </sentence><sentence id="4449">Her, they will remember! </sentence><sentence id="4450">And that's what we want. </sentence><sentence id="4451">We want to be unknown. </sentence><sentence id="4452">If we either um not succeed, but we do succeed." </sentence><sentence id="4453">I tell you, she said. </sentence><sentence id="4454">Anyway, this was the other thing. </sentence><sentence id="4455">And now um coming back, um... So that was the Russians. </sentence><sentence id="4456">| really did...um we went to [bombard (ph)], and they had a beautiful food. </sentence><sentence id="4457">And imagine, the whole camp was saying, "Magda is crazy! </sentence><sentence id="4458">What she is doing, nobody can do that like her! </sentence><sentence id="4459">Demanded Russians should get the SS food, for the SS man!" </sentence><sentence id="4460">But anyway...Then we went on the march, which you heard it so many times displayed. </sentence><sentence id="4461">So I'm not going to details, only... </sentence></p></dialogue>

So he didn't pick a big factory, or big shop or whatever. </sentence><sentence id="5317">He picked a little...in a little town. </sentence><sentence id="5318">On the end of the town, a little house which used to here have a woman whose husband was working and she was doing the repairs and meantime she was selling something. </sentence><sentence id="5319">A little...

This time, in Czechoslovakia, they made, you know, from feathers a  little...like um feather [bed] and this is like--like I said--like a wurst, and here it gets over and you have to attach things. </sentence><sentence id="5342">And the baby is inside; and here is lace around. </sentence><sentence id="5343">And when Maya was born, so baby...Bela made it up and brought in. </sentence><sentence id="5344">And there was a woman who didn't have that thing, and she liked it very much. </sentence><sentence id="5345">So Bela said, because he was so happy, he will make [for] her. </sentence><sentence id="5346">But then it come to pay, because he didn't have it for nothing. </sentence><sentence id="5347">So worked out that her husband is a very high um in this business to checking everything; and...so he didn't want to pay. </sentence><sentence id="5348">And when Bela demanded he should pay, so he send a committee and they gave us a punishment. </sentence><sentence id="5349">A financial big punishment. </sentence><sentence id="5350">Imagine! </sentence><sentence id="5351">I said, "Bela, you see how it happens. </sentence><sentence id="5352">When you're good and good-hearted, somebody--not that he doesn't say thank you because you made it for his child. </sentence><sentence id="5353">He makes us all our saving and our hard work went on...on it." </sentence><sentence id="5354">And here we been, and somebody on top of it was jealous because we brought all the customers there. </sentence><sentence id="5355">He wanted that shop. </sentence><sentence id="5356">So they took away the shop. </sentence><sentence id="5357">So then I went again to Prague to demand that what happened, and with no reason they took it away. </sentence><sentence id="5358">So we gave another shop. </sentence><sentence id="5359">But now was the question that they wanted...it came a change, and they wanted Bela to be a member of the Communist Party. </sentence><sentence id="5360">He didn't want to be. </sentence><sentence id="5361">So they closed him out from the party, without being in the party. </sentence><sentence id="5362">And they said...again they take all the business away, because if he is not a member... So I said, "What you mean?" </sentence><sentence id="5363">They said, "You can have it, if you divorce him." </sentence><sentence id="5364">So again...so we had a lot of bad luck like that. </sentence><sentence id="5365">The fate wanted to see how much I can endure. </sentence><sentence id="5366">And naturally then we got another little...
