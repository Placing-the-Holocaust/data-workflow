</sentence><sentence id="356">And they say, "Why was it a better time?" </sentence><sentence id="357">And I said, "I still was surrounded with my family, which was pretty lot. </sentence><sentence id="358">Many uncles, many aunts, many cousins, grandparents, were dead at that time--that lived in villages around our area, and in the city of Vilna. </sentence><sentence id="359">But my immediate family was still there." </sentence><sentence id="360">I tell you, really, I'm sitting here and trying to think of certain things to share with you. </sentence><sentence id="361">I think I forgot to tell you like in 1942 we had a hanging in the ghetto. </sentence><sentence id="362">A man was hung because he was caught at the gate with some bread and a few eggs. </sentence><sentence id="363">Somebody said he had a few cigarettes on him, somebody said he didn't. </sentence><sentence id="364">But documented incident, because as you went out to work all through the year there were kind Lithuanian people, too. </sentence><sentence id="365">I really wants to share that and admire these people that wanted to give you a little bread for you to eat and wanted to give a little type of other food also to take back to the ghetto for your family. </sentence><sentence id="366">But it's worthwhile talking about it because as you come back from work they frisked you bodily to make sure you are not smuggling in ammunition or food. </sentence><sentence id="367">Many guards were bribed. </sentence><sentence id="368">Many, many guards, you know especially Lithuanian guards, you would bribe them with a fur coat or whatever so if nobody was around they looked the other way and let you bring in that food, so we had a little more food to eat. </sentence><sentence id="369">But if let's say German Commission or another guard came that wasn't bribed, they came quickly and they grabbed the people, they beat them terrible. </sentence><sentence id="370">But that one incident this man's name was Mussevitsky, Batsalom Mussevitsky, he was a young man, he had a wife and a child in the ghetto. </sentence><sentence id="371">He was caught with that few eggs or half a loaf of bread but very little, maybe he had a few cigarettes, I really don't know. </sentence><sentence id="372">He was taken to the Gestapo jail. </sentence><sentence id="373">The Jewish Community Council was called and they were told they are holding a big criminal, the Jews have to learn a lesson, no food is in the ghetto. </sentence><sentence id="374">The following Sunday a gallow was to be built in the ghetto. </sentence><sentence id="375">What was a gallow in the ghetto? </sentence><sentence id="376">A table, some stick hammered to the table going this way like an L, upside-down L, a cord This is a

the henchmen, Jewish men. </sentence><sentence id="380">How they were picked, I don't know. </sentence><sentence id="381">They ordered that we have to provide these henchmen. </sentence><sentence id="382">We all had to gather in this place and I remember very well a dozen SS men with guns outstretched like this went in with this one criminal that wanted to bring a little food for his child, you know. </sentence><sentence id="383">People say why didn't he run away, many times people say why didn't he run away. </sentence><sentence id="384">I said three hijackers hijack a plane or a boat with hundreds of people, three guns against hundreds of people and they are in control. </sentence><sentence id="385">Imagine dozens of guns in control of one prisoner. </sentence><sentence id="386">Well, this man was marched in like this. </sentence><sentence id="387">He walked over to the table. </sentence><sentence id="388">He said to the two men "Thou shalt not kill," you know in Yiddish, "I will do it myself." </sentence><sentence id="389">He hopped on the table, on the chair, they did not even have a chance like you know in some places they tie their hands back or they put a cover on their face. </sentence><sentence id="390">Nothing. </sentence><sentence id="391">He hopped, he put a string of his own, the loop you know over his, the noose, whatever it's called, over his neck, and to the assassin, the Gestapo, he said you are not going to win a war by killing me" and somebody pushed or he pushed a chair from under his feet and I remember his body dangling like this. </sentence><sentence id="392">I remember it so. </sentence><sentence id="393">Linda, it was terrible times. </sentence><sentence id="394">You know, I always try to control myself, not to be too emotional because otherwise if I get too emotional, I cannot bring the message. </sentence><sentence id="395">You know, you know, this what people have to think about. </sentence><sentence id="396">I say over, I say this man resisted the Germans, I always say there is a spiritual resistance. </sentence><sentence id="397">If you didn't fight back, if you didn't punch it or whatever, I say we live the extra day we resisted them. </sentence><sentence id="398">They wanted us dead. </sentence><sentence id="399">In the ghettos there was sign, "Yiden"--Jews--"Don't despair. </sentence><sentence

November 5, 1942, when I went with my group to go out to work -- we saw outside of the ghetto trucks, trucks covered with canvas, we were told we cannot go to work. </sentence><sentence id="414">I remember running back to my room. </sentence><sentence id="415">My mother put two dresses on me one dress on top of another. </sentence><sentence id="416">You see people said maybe they don't let you

whatever, I don't remember exactly, maybe 20 minutes, it was a short time, the Jewish police were running through the ghettos saying a mistake was made in the order, all the working people should leave the ghetto. </sentence><sentence id="419">Chaos. </sentence><sentence id="420">People did not know what's better. </sentence><sentence id="421">Some people said it's better to hide in that Malina, in the hiding place -- Malina was called the hiding place during those times, a Malina -- some people said it's better to go to work. </sentence><sentence id="422">The Jewish police ran through and said whoever can go out to work -- we had marvelous people that were Jewish police in my city. </sentence><sentence id="423">You won't hear not one had word about the leadership and the Jewish police in Siauliai after a certain point because after a certain point them to cover other people that the Germans appointed, they brought them from the outside, it was different. </sentence><sentence id="424">But as long as we had our own people from our home town it was good. </sentence><sentence id="425">So they said it's better to go to work. </sentence><sentence id="426">I remember leaving that day for work but all day long we wondered. </sentence><sentence id="427">What were the trucks doing near the ghetto. </sentence><sentence id="428">At one point in that hospital we worked with a german, he was from a building commander that was called Ortek (ph) and he was a civilian and he was pretty nice man, he gave us sometime a little bread but he had nothing to do with the security or taking care of the Jews. </sentence><sentence id="429">His job was building whatever. </sentence><sentence id="430">So we asked this man to go near the ghetto and see what's happening.

away from the ghetto, Linda, we heard cries, such cries I hope nobody will hear. </sentence><sentence id="436">What happened in the ghetto of Siauliai, Lithuania on November 5, 1943, SS and Gestapo with the help of Ukranians, Ukranians that left the Russians and joined the evil cause so many of them just came -- so many of them just came and joined to kill Jewish people, it was terrible time -- they went into the ghetto, they found every hiding place, they went in, they broke every dish, every pillow, made every single person come to the gate near that place where you gathered for work, all the children, all the elderly, all the sick, all the babies that were born illegally in the ghetto. </sentence><sentence id="437">You see, they told us we were not allowed to be pregnant but women got pregnant. </sentence><sentence id="438">They stayed in their little room in the Ghetto. </sentence><sentence id="439">If they were caught in the selection, then they were caught, but if they were not caught they had their baby in the ghetto. </sentence><sentence id="440">But on that day not one child was spared. </sentence><sentence id="441">At the gate a selection to the right and to the left, a thousand children. </sentence><sentence id="442">Five hundred elderly and sick and a few hundred healthy and strong, including two men from our Jewish Community Council because these two men said to them "Where are you taking these children?" </sentence><sentence id="443">They said "To a better camp, you are welcome to come and check it out" and they put them on the trucks too. </sentence><sentence id="444">We did not know then where they were taken to. </sentence><sentence id="445">We honestly believed that they were taken to another camp where they have children. </sentence><sentence id="446">They said these children need supervision, you all go to work, we will take care of them. </sentence><sentence id="447">After the war we found out they were taken to Auschwitz where they were gassed and cremated, they did not even keep them there one day. </sentence><sentence id="448">The Rabbis told me that I have to keep Yarzeit on that day that my father was taken. </sentence><sentence id="449">My father was taken with that truck. </sentence><sentence id="450">My father was 47 years old. </sentence><sentence id="451">He was among the nice Healthy, strong,

</sentence><sentence id="463">We were a lucky family, just my father was taken. </sentence><sentence id="464">Can you me saying a lucky family after they killed my father but we were a lucky family because on that day every family lost dear ones. </sentence><sentence id="465">Not just one, two, four, six, eight people of a family went on that terrible day. </sentence><sentence id="466">So the life was terrible after that, it was just terrible. </sentence><sentence id="467">They were trying -- I don't remember exactly details -- they were trying, I mean the Germans, the SS, the Gestapo, make some internment camps where they thought the workers could work separately. </sentence><sentence id="468">They thought they would get rid of the ghetto completely. </sentence><sentence id="469">Then they thought they still need some people that should stay. </sentence><sentence id="470">There was a factory that was making the shoes, a factory that was making some brushes. </sentence><sentence id="471">So they left some people in those workshops for a little bit longer but us in June of 1944, they took us to a railroad station for deportation to Germany. </sentence><sentence id="472">We had to walk about 10 kilometers to this specific railroad because in our city bombs fell already. </sentence><sentence id="473">The last few days that we were in the ghetto Russian bombs fell in our city of Siaulai. </sentence><sentence id="474">We were so glad to see the bombs but quite a few fell in the ghetto too and quite a few people died and at that point we said already maybe they are luckier that they died of a Russian bomb than what was happening. </sentence><sentence id="475">So we were taken to this railroad by foot, we had to walk. </sentence><sentence id="476">I remember that walk very well because my mother at that time had an injury in her leg and she walked on the railroad and she had injured her knees and she couldn't walk to well and they said whoever cannot walk, whoever is sick or weak should stay and some trucks will bring them to the railroad station, and my mother, like a pool, stood in that group saying -- they couldn't see the injury, it was so tight, it was covered -- she said "I cannot walk, I would like to go on this truck" and a German said to her, "What do you think, run, you are still young, go to work," you know he saved her life because we never saw the rest of the people that were on the trucks. </sentence><sentence id="477">We were told after the This is a verbatim transcript of spoken

them. </sentence><sentence id="480">Us, they put into cattle cars for a journey to concentration camp by the name of Stutthof. </sentence><sentence id="481">I'm going to tell you exactly about the ride. </sentence><sentence id="482">We were in there -- they didn't count you know. </sentence><sentence id="483">As we came to the train, it said capacity, how many cows or horses you can have in that train, but they didn't say capacity, how many people. </sentence><sentence id="484">They shoved you in like pushed you and pushed you. </sentence><sentence id="485">They said stoop down, they didn't say stretch out, you know like this and with your knees just up and you try to take a little bit more room and people say "Let me in, if I stay outside they will shoot me." </sentence><sentence id="486">So people really squeezed in to let other people in. </sentence><sentence id="487">It was so crowded. </sentence><sentence id="488">I remember having my feet over my mother, my brother on top to stretch out. </sentence><sentence id="489">A bucket in the comer for sanitation purposes. </sentence><sentence id="490">We each have a little package. </sentence><sentence id="491">They said take along your valuables and a little food that you had still in your ghetto room and some water. </sentence><sentence id="492">In my ghetto we had plenty water because we were on the outskirts of the city where there were wells so we had no problem with water. </sentence><sentence id="493">In the ghetto, the only good part that was in our ghetto of Siaulai we could keep clean because there was plenty of water and we had enough water to drink. </sentence><sentence id="494">So as we went to those railroad station, you know nobody had thermoses like here, you had an open dish or some dish you used to go to the store to buy some milk in a little container that you filled with water and you took. </sentence><sentence id="495">Let's say you were a family -- we were, thank God, four of a family still alive, my two brothers, my mother and myself, but in that railroad was just one brother, my mother and myself. </sentence><sentence id="496">As we were getting on the train we saw my brother said to us, "Don't get excited, your brother is not dead, he escaped." </sentence><sentence id="497">He told my mother that some nice Lithuanian man that we knew said to him, "If you have opportunity somehow to escape, do so, and don't come to my house, come in the forest, there is a smokehouse and go into that smokehouse. </sentence><sentence id="498">Every night I will put out some food for you and you go let's say 10 feet or 15 feet and get that food but if they catch you, you snuck in, don't tell them I let you in." </sentence><sentence id="499">How This is a verbatim

taken from the ghetto, instead of going out to the ghetto, he went back into the factory where he worked and since it was a Saturday he crawled in one of the machinery and on Sunday when the factory was closed, that's when he got out. </sentence><sentence id="502">But we did not know at that point, just he told my mother. </sentence><sentence id="503">He didn't want even me to know or my brother to know that he has this opportunity. </sentence><sentence id="504">Look, in that train, in that thing we were three already of the family, we were left three, and it was just the most terrible thing that happened. </sentence><sentence id="505">You cannot imagine. </sentence><sentence id="506">Everybody is really looking out for themselves because you want to stretch your foot out, your foot falls asleep. </sentence><sentence id="507">You try to put it on somebody else. </sentence><sentence id="508">The person doesn't like it. </sentence><sentence id="509">You know their foot is asleep too.

didn't get my shoes but you know they threw to us the shoes and all of a sudden people said "Give me, those are my shoes, give me, those are my shoes" and people started to exchange until you found your shoes. </sentence><sentence id="1055">But let's say somebody -- I had a pair of boots and it was summer, nobody wanted those boots but I wanted them and I got them back so I was lucky I had these boots. </sentence><sentence id="1056">So you had a dress, a pair of underpants and a pair of shoes. </sentence><sentence id="1057">Now the family is taken away. </sentence><sentence id="1058">Me, 16

saw my mother. </sentence><sentence id="1074">So I knew she was alive. </sentence><sentence id="1075">That's when I found out she was still alive. </sentence><sentence id="1076">But she was...like

know these people, too bad. </sentence><sentence id="1084">You had to recognize them, and be there at the right place. </sentence><sentence id="1085">Let's say, if you are in the 20th row in the middle, you had to find your row and stand there. </sentence><sentence id="1086">Many a time I sat half of the night on the window of the barrack, when they say roll call, to jump out and be outside because they running with whips and with guns and hit us so hard, we should go out quick. </sentence><sentence id="1087">You stood there for hours and hours. </sentence><sentence id="1088">Why you stood there, I don't know. </sentence><sentence id="1089">They counted and they counted and they counted. </sentence><sentence id="1090">They wanted to make sure nobody escaped. </sentence><sentence id="1091">You couldn't escape from concentration camp. </sentence><sentence id="1092">You know very well very few recorded -- the only way you could escape is maybe you were sent out for a labor or you had some connection somehow, but very few. </sentence><sentence id="1093">The only people that were missing were people that died in the barrack or somebody decided to commit suicide and jumped on the wires. </sentence><sentence id="1094">They counted and finally maybe 6:00 o'clock they said, line up, we will give you black coffee, it was some black drink -- and a piece of bread. </sentence><sentence id="1095">The piece of bread was very tiny, I don't know, believe me you could eat it now, it's like half a sandwich, you know, just the bread. </sentence><sentence id="1096">Then you were assigned something to do. </sentence><sentence id="1097">In my particular area in Stutthof they said today you go clean the bathroom, tomorrow let's say you sweep the street.

</sentence><sentence id="1100">One day we were taken out, about 50 women, and with about a dozen SS men with the guns outstretched and we had to walk out of the sight of the camp and there is an empty

</sentence><sentence id="1108">They become people, not shoes. </sentence><sentence id="1109">I tell you from my heart the next day when they didn't tell me to go to the shoes, I was so lucky, I was so happy to go to clean the latrines, I was happier not to have to go to that job. </sentence><sentence id="1110">Can you imagine after our people were dead we had to sort shoes, we had to sort clothing. </sentence><sentence id="1111">Many people had to drag bodies from one place to another all through those years, all through those years. </sentence><sentence id="1112">In the evening they gave us some kind of a vegetable peel soup and you had to be in the barrack. </sentence><sentence id="1113">When you were in the barrack you had an opportunity to talk to each other. </sentence><sentence id="1114">The Germans did not go into the barracks just like this. </sentence><sentence id="1115">The person in charge was a polish women. </sentence><sentence id="1116">In Stutthof mostly Polish people were in charge, they were the Kapos, nobody else. </sentence><sentence id="1117">They were prisoners or criminals or whatever, they were in charge of this section and if they came in, if they were in a good mood they didn't say nothing if you were chatting. </sentence><sentence id="1118">But otherwise you couldn't chat, you know, you had to be very careful, and that's when you found out from other people what was going on. </sentence><sentence id="1119">Let's say if I came back from that day from the shoe sorting, I could tell what happened. </sentence><sentence id="1120">Many times people came back that sorted clothing in the clothing and they found little notes that people said we came from this and this country, we were here, we don't know where we are being taken. </sentence><sentence id="1121">Many people from Stutthof were brought from Latvia, from Estonia. </sentence><sentence id="1122">Most of the baltic countries came to Stutthof. </sentence><sentence

but here I am talking already 1944, three years already. </sentence><sentence id="1131">By that point I was already skinny, 16 year old girl, looked horrible, I looked maybe like 40. </sentence><sentence id="1132">In Stutthof, when I was there by myself you know with many nice Jewish women but no family, nobody, I didn't have a cousin, no one there with me, a few women from my home town, a woman came over to me and said to me they don't really keep children in concentration camps. </sentence><sentence id="1133">Why did she say that? </sentence><sentence id="1134">Every day when we were given the food, if there was a little food left tin that big bucket that they carried the food to us, the Polish Capo used to say children under 16 can get double food but under 16 were not allowed to be there. </sentence><sentence id="1135">So everybody was afraid to march out. </sentence><sentence id="1136">You were hungry but I didn't say I want more food. </sentence><sentence id="1137">You didn't have a birth certificate, it's your word against theirs. </sentence><sentence id="1138">He used to come schlep me out, drag me out and another maybe dozen kids that were already 16, maybe some were, saying you can get more food, why don't you come out -- maybe some were not -- saying you can get more food, why don't you come out, you are under 16, and if I said I'm 16, he beat me up. </sentence><sentence id="1139">So this woman said to me, "it's bad, it's bad, you know, they won't keep you alive here" and I looked at her with my eyes open, you know I was so scared, and she said to me "Maidela, little girls, try to go out for labor, they do take people out for labor. </sentence><sentence id="1140">If you could get out for labor, maybe you would survive, little girl Meidela (ph), little girl," you know like this. </sentence><sentence id="1141">She didn't know my name, I never knew her name. </sentence><sentence id="1142">One night I saw women lining up in the corner of the camp, they were given a blanket and dish for food and with my smart -- you know, what do you know at 16 in a camp from the age of 13 to 16? -- </sentence><sentence id="1143">I said they are given a blanket and a dish for food, it must be for work. </sentence><sentence id="1144">You know how many Jewish people went to death with a blanket and a dish for food. </sentence><sentence id="1145">So I stood in this line. </sentence><sentence id="1146">The woman said stand on your tip toes to look taller, pinch your cheeks to look osier, and you know I succeeded to leave Stutthof. </sentence><sentence id="1147">That night we left, 5,000 women. </sentence><sentence id="1148">I This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="1149">It is not the primary

remember they took us over a little river -- I don't know the name of the river -- by boat. </sentence><sentence id="1151">Somebody said that many people were drowned in that river but I don't know, you know how people talk. </sentence><sentence id="1152">Maybe there is documentation on it. </sentence><sentence id="1153">I think it was the elbe maybe. </sentence><sentence id="1154">And they divided us a thousand in a camp, a thousand pass by, they divide it, thousand, they divide it. </sentence><sentence id="1155">So all the women from my home town were divided like 10 before me so I found myself in the labor camp just with 10 people from my home town. </sentence><sentence id="1156">Other wonderful people, Jewish women, nice, but not even a friend from my home town. </sentence><sentence id="1157">All of a sudden I found myself no family, no neighbors, no people that you know, not even a familiar face. </sentence><sentence id="1158">Now, the first camp that I was in was called Malken [Pol: Ma ki].* </sentence><sentence id="1159">The camp that I worked and many people worked as I did from that period that were taken from Stutthof; we were put into canvas tents, that was our house. </sentence><sentence id="1160">We slept on straw. </sentence><sentence id="1161">The job was to dig giant trenches, holes for Russian tanks to fall in. </sentence><sentence id="1162">We were so weak. </sentence><sentence id="1163">The food, again, so little. </sentence><sentence id="1164">In the morning, the same procedure like in the concentration camp: Up early, they counted you, they gave you the black coffee with a little bit of bread. </sentence><sentence id="1165">In the morning -- evening a little bit of soup. </sentence><sentence id="1166">Sometime they switched it off and they didn't give nothing in the morning, they just gave the black coffee and at night you got your ration of bread and the soup. </sentence><sentence id="1167">So imagine if you got in the evening your ration of bread and the soup, you think you are going to save your little bread for the next day. </sentence><sentence id="1168">I especially used to think I'm so hungry all day, just a little black coffee, I'm going to eat that soup, that water, and eat one bite of the bread, and the next bite I will tear off a little piece of my blanket and I wrapped it and I put it in the straw that I slept on. </sentence><sentence id="1169">In the morning my bread was gone. </sentence><sentence id="1170">And I cried, I cried. </sentence><sentence id="1171">A woman next to me said "Nessele, why are you crying, Nessele?" -- </sentence><sentence id="1172">She knew my name -- I said I had a little bit of bread, I put it in the straw underneath my head and a mouse must have come. </sentence><sentence id="1173">You there were  http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection 6 plenty of mice and rats. </sentence><sentence id="1174">She knew there were hungry people that ate the bread. </sentence><sentence id="1175">She said "Child, give me your little bread, I will put in my bosom and I will give it to you in the morning." </sentence><sentence id="1176">You know whenever we got the bread at night and I didn't eat it, I gave it to Mrs.Feivish (ph), may she rest in peace -- that was her name -- and as she handed that piece of bread to me in the morning, she saved my life maybe. </sentence><sentence id="1177">You know, I'm telling you these things today because people don't understand how human we stayed in this inhumane situation. </sentence><sentence id="1178">I want to bring out this little things that people don't understand, people cannot understand. </sentence><sentence id="1179">As much as we survivors talk, you know we tried to tell the fact, this one killed, this one did, but I want to bring this out Linda, you know it's very important you know. </sentence><sentence id="1180">So in this camp we dug those holes, we finished one area. </sentence><sentence id="1181">They kept on moving us, that's why we stayed in those canvas tents. </sentence><sentence id="1182">It was convenient for them. </sentence><sentence id="1183">They had barracks made out of veneer you know for food and also that were prefabricated that you could quickly unscrew and move on. </sentence><sentence id="1184">Like this we went into two camps, Malken and Derbeck." </sentence><sentence id="1185">In those camps, they did not have to kill us. </sentence><sentence id="1186">We started to die...die of starvation and diseases. </sentence><sentence id="1187">In the morning, we got up, our hair was frozen to the ground on that straw. </sentence><sentence id="1188">Many people said oh, they cut their hair in the camps, it was terrible. </sentence><sentence id="1189">In Stutthof, they didn't cut our hair. </sentence><sentence id="1190">It was more terrible, because we didn't have water to wash with. </sentence><sentence id="1191">And when you have hair on you, it gets infested with lice; and with lice brings diseases. </sentence><sentence id="1192">By the time came October, November of 1944, it was a mess--walking skeletons with wounds. </sentence><sentence id="1193">We looked horrible. </sentence><sentence id="1194">At one point, at that time, they brought certain kinds of barracks. </sentence><sentence id="1195">Not barracks. </sentence><sentence id="1196">It was like to hold horses--a round wooden thing that they put up for us to be in. </sentence><sentence id="1197">Not in the tents, because we were doing work so they felt that we are still useful. </sentence><sentence id="1198">So they gave us this wooden barracks; and wherever one horse had to stand was five women lying there on the straw--no bunks, not a change of clothes. </sentence><sentence id="1199">You know, Linda, I  http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection 7 think that about six months I had not taken off my clothes. </sentence><sentence id="1200">There was no reason to take it off. </sentence><sentence id="1201">There was no water to wash with, there was no change of clothing. </sentence><sentence id="1202">And then you were afraid to take it off, because maybe some person that doesn't have a dress is going to take it, or your blanket or whatever. </sentence><sentence id="1203">You know people in need, you have to understand that. </sentence><sentence id="1204">We stayed there until January 1945, in those camps...in those areas, Malken and Derbeck. </sentence><sentence id="1205">There was another place that we were moved, but I don't remember the name.deg It was three separate places. </sentence><sentence id="1206">Then one morning, we were woken up very early, maybe 3:00 o'clock at night, we were told to line up and take everything that we have in that little tent with us. </sentence><sentence id="1207">We were leaving the area. </sentence><sentence id="1208">We looked, we looked for trucks, there was nothing outside. </sentence><sentence id="1209">March, a march. </sentence><sentence id="1210">It was called the Death March. </sentence><sentence id="1211">You know, we marched day and night this way. </sentence><sentence id="1212">During the day we walked. </sentence><sentence id="1213">You had to stop one time, let's say you had to go the bathroom, you had to go at that time to the bathroom. </sentence><sentence id="1214">Now, if you wanted to go another time to the bathroom, too bad. </sentence><sentence id="1215">If you stopped to stay in the back, you were dead. </sentence><sentence id="1216">Whoever stayed behind was shot. </sentence><sentence id="1217">We heard all the time shots. </sentence><sentence id="1218">Also as we walked we saw many, many human beings face down with a bullet in the back in the snow and we saw that they were inmates like us because they were skinny, they wore prisoner garb, we could see it was Jewish people with their stars and with their numbers. </sentence><sentence id="1219">Now, you know, we went through it was the Danzig area--you know, exactly where Stutthof was, where we worked in that area--Poland, Germans, roads, villages, towns... We saw people, they say now they didn't see us. </sentence><sentence id="1220">You know, I put out...in the winter, I put out a little crumbs for the birds. </sentence><sentence id="1221">They didn't have to hand us food. </sentence><sentence id="1222">If they would just put a little crumbs or a potato peel on the street where we had to walk, we wouldn't have been so hungry. </sentence><sentence id="1223">They didn't do it. </sentence><sentence id="1224">They didn't do it, Linda. </sentence><sentence id="1225">I remember on that march -- me, I'm sharing it with you, I never share it, I will tell you that, just once I think I talked about it -- I  http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection 8 remember sleeping, they told us to rest a little bit, and in the snow there was manure of a horse or a cow all dried out and straw with it and undigested grain. </sentence><sentence id="1226">I remember taking that grain, washing it in the snow, taking out the kernel and eating it. </sentence><sentence id="1227">I tell you the truth, as I look back, I think I fulfilled a big commandment to save a human life. </sentence><sentence id="1228">And I say it again, I saved my life by doing...
