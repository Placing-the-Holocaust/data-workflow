<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="351">Q: What kind of groups were they? </sentence><sentence id="352">What did they do? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="355">A: Now this is very, very interesting uh question because basic is the beginning. </sentence><sentence id="356">The most important thing I guess, thinking now, we didn't, we didn't have any information about what was going on in the war because all the press was already the first of all, was uh interdict radio sets was taken from the Jewish people. </sentence><sentence id="357">All the Jewish people has to give_ beginning "40, "41, the radio sets. </sentence><sentence id="358">So was not a way to, to listen to the radio. </sentence><sentence id="359">The press was under the control, and they publish only what was interest, in the German interest was this way. </sentence><sentence id="360">And before the war and after the war starting to publish only war, German what you call communiques about the war. </sentence><sentence id="361">So one of the first things we sought was to find what was going on. </sentence><sentence id="362">So some, our friends have some connections, have some friends who are non- Jewish and start to, to have uh networks to find information what is going on through the people who had radios, have information based on their position, parents" position. </sentence><sentence id="363">And I remember even was two, three Jewish people who interested in the electronic like today and two of them decided to build from, from scratch, from nothing some small radio uh equipment in order to listen what is going on. </sentence><sentence id="364">So this one was the first action, and we start from time to time to have some uh, some news. </sentence><sentence id="365">They succeeded to uh get some information through some if I recall BBC from London and from probably from Russia they catch some, some news over there. </sentence><sentence id="366">But the interesting part with that uh the young people who, who put together this radio, during the day they dismantled the radio because if some police came in  https://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection house, they don't find the radio even and hiding the pieces and during the evening they put together. </sentence><sentence id="367">Was a very difficult operation. </sentence><sentence id="368">Basically, this is a fact, that was not uh parts put this way, and together parts was a big problem. </sentence><sentence id="369">So the first action was to get information and the, the second part was to uh disseminate this information. </sentence><sentence id="370">So we start to write the news in some small piece of paper and to give to other young people to, to read. </sentence><sentence id="371">So was a shade of transmission of the news. </sentence><sentence id="372">And I recall at one point, we start to find many ways to hide this small paper on which we, we wrote some, some news. </sentence><sentence id="373">So we start to take for example, some soaps and cut in half the soaps and make some, some holes, and put together and keep the uh hard papers, small papers, and using the paper and to give the soaps. </sentence><sentence id="374">Or other way to hide them and to transmit them as material some all kind of doors at one point Iremember. </sentence><sentence id="375">Some, some toys we used. </sentence><sentence id="376">So this is the first part of the action, was related to knowing what was going on and where we stand. </sentence><sentence id="377">Later on we decided to, to start to do more, more action, more uh specially action against if we could the German, and if not the German uh troops, against the German uh place where they manufacture war products. </sentence><sentence id="378">So in our town was a couple of factory. </sentence><sentence id="379">If I recall one was textile factory manufacturing textile to prepare to uh, for uh military uniforms say. </sentence><sentence id="380">Was a big factory prepare leather, paper and other kinds of industry. </sentence><sentence id="381">And all this industry at one point works like forced labour, a lot of Jewish young people. </sentence><sentence id="382">And sure non-Jewish people were there. </sentence><sentence id="383">But many, many workmen were sent to fight against the Russians, the front. </sentence><sentence id="384">So a lot of young Jewish and young, non- Jewish people, young people fifteen years old was brought to this factory to work. </sentence><sentence id="385">So in this place is start to have some connection and to start to do all kind of sabotage. </sentence><sentence id="386">Say, if I recall, to slow down the production for example. </sentence><sentence id="387">To start to uh, to break some machines over there. </sentence><sentence id="388">And was very, very, uh, at that time very audacious actions. </sentence><sentence id="389">Was not maybe very big, we don't blow bridges, but we start a movement to organize the young people to fight against the Germany and this movement start to extend to non-Jewish. </sentence><sentence id="390">Some non-Jewish young people refused to go in the Army to fight the war along the Germans. </sentence><sentence id="391">So uh all kind of action. </sentence><sentence id="392">At one point was a discussion to start to do something about the German, and many nights, uh many Jewish young people and non-Jewish young people succeeded to go some place close. </sentence><sentence id="393">For example where the Germans keep their trucks, and to open the tanks, the gas tank and to put say some sand inside. </sentence><sentence id="394">And we discuss at one point to start to bring some small pieces of wood planks with nails and to put it some place where you know that the Germans uh vehicle will go through in some places. </sentence><sentence id="395">But was interesting because uh, many people at that time was divided I can say, how to act. </sentence><sentence id="396">Some, now, maybe appear very easy you know when you talk as far as the part but at that time to go in the street was a big deal to do. </sentence><sentence id="397">Uh to meet some people over there was very difficult because of curfew after six o'clock no Jewish on the street. </sentence><sentence id="398">And the Jewish has to wear some special sign, the star of the Juda as they call it. </sentence><sentence id="399">But uh at one point, maybe, this is interesting as I..(PHRASES MISSING)...but uh at one point uh many people thought its maybe better nothing to do because no matter what you are doing we exposed to something. </sentence><sentence id="400">And was a good feeling that later, uh sooner or later, the German would be defeated and all American Army will come to liberate our part or maybe Russian will be come first over there. </sentence><sentence id="401">So anyways they will come, so why to uh sacrifice our lives. </sentence><sentence id="402">But was a strong feeling among many people that have to do something. </sentence><sentence id="403">You know how many people died towards the front, how many people died in the camps, so many people feel to do to fight against the Germans and oh, the  https://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection people, the young people, I talking about young people, maybe not only young people. </sentence><sentence id="404">They don't care at that point about their life because they want to sacrifice to do something. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="457">Q: OK. </sentence><sentence id="458">So you were part of this group. </sentence><sentence id="459">You were doing these things. </sentence><sentence id="460">Uh, what about your family during this time? </sentence><sentence id="461">How were you living? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="467">A: That's a good question because uh this question applied to, let's put it this way, to the Jewish population. </sentence><sentence id="468">What happens to the Jewish population? </sentence><sentence id="469">And I have to make a short or long paranthesis about this. </sentence><sentence id="470">The Jewish situation in Romania during the war was different than in Poland, in Hungary, in Czechoslovakia, in eastern uh western Europe even because of political situation, because the General Antonescu could become an ally to Hitler and he gave everything including a big army to fight along the German army. </sentence><sentence id="471">They kept, the fascist government in Romania, they kept some uh power in uh day by day administration of the territory, of the territory. </sentence><sentence id="472">And they was in charge to solve the Jewish problem over there. </sentence><sentence id="473">So they decided for many many reasons, don't to send the Jewish people to Auschwitz. </sentence><sentence id="474">To use them, to put them to work as a factory. </sentence><sentence id="475">Was more useful. </sentence><sentence id="476">They can because they took a lot of young people and not young people to put in the army to fight against the uh, along the Germans against the Russians. </sentence><sentence id="477">So a lot of factories, they don't have manpower, labor. </sentence><sentence id="478">So they want to use the Jewish people like a labor this work factory as they put a lot of people over there. </sentence><sentence id="479">Other Jewish people, let's say young people not only, was sent to build trenches, to build uh defense uh lines, at the front. </sentence><sentence id="480">So just speaking, most of the Jewish people were not sent to death camps. </sentence><sentence id="481">Was used to work. </sentence><sentence id="482">Some were sent in different camps in the territory which the German took from Russia, in the Ukraine, and maybe come back, maybe not. </sentence><sentence id="483">They start to arrest a lot of Jewish leaders and non-Jewish leaders and to put on uh, in prison. </sentence><sentence id="484">But was a small way to make some small, small amount of money. </sentence><sentence id="485">Because when they keep the people, the Jewish people, working in the factories, they give something. </sentence><sentence id="486">They pay like a very minimum, very minimum salary. </sentence><sentence id="487">I don't want to express how much was, but say enough to buy some piece of bread, was a bread twist or to buy some uh cornmeal or to buy other product which was if there was a market. </sentence><sentence id="488">And other interesting thing I guess, now talking with you it's in my mind, a lot of product came from the farmer who work with the land, and before the war the tradition was the farmer who has some land or farm, two, three, four, five miles from the cities, they come everyday in the city to market. </sentence><sentence id="489">Special market. </sentence><sentence id="490">Or they have their customers like to bring the milk, to bring the eggs, to bring whatever, the chicken. </sentence><sentence id="491">And I remember, say in our family, was a special farmer which come every day, before the war, every day they bring the milk in front of our door, some meat sometimes, fruits, vegetables, so was some relationship. </sentence><sentence id="492">When the war started this farmer, or some farmers, continued to come to the city to sell their products and many times they help the Jewish people. </sentence><sentence id="493">They say start to give some products. </sentence><sentence id="494">They don't have too much because some members of their families was taken in the army to go to the war, but uh they continue to, to work the land and they come with the less product to the market. </sentence><sentence id="495">But was some way to, to get something. </sentence><sentence id="496">And the Jewish people started to sell what ever they had to the people around. </sentence><sentence id="497">This only because big deal. </sentence><sentence id="498">They start to sell maybe their furniture, they some goods whatever. </sentence><sentence id="499">Maybe they have some gold. </sentence><sentence id="500">Maybe they have, whatever the Jewish people start to sell, to sell, to sell for nothing to, to buy the main product to uh, to survive. </sentence><sentence id="501">So was  https://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection some, some kind of connection to get some food over there. </sentence><sentence id="502">But the problem what important first to keep alive and good health because, if I recall, the public hospital closed to the Jewish patients say so the Jewish community start to organize some clinic and to use some Jewish doctors to give uh consultation over there. </sentence><sentence id="503">They start to, to get a way to get some medicine, but was more and more, become more uh uh seldom to get medicine. </sentence><sentence id="504">We can't get medicine, we can't get medical assistance to get an operation we need. </sentence><sentence id="505">So many people start even to die, to, to loose their health because of the conditions uh, medical conditions over there. </sentence><sentence id="506">And because they cannot feed the family, suppose the young people didn't have food. </sentence><sentence id="507">So the most important thing was to keep alive. </sentence><sentence id="508">Everybody everyday was the fight to keep, to keep alive. </sentence><sentence id="509">So was not, not very easy but was not enough to eat. </sentence><sentence id="510">But people survived. </sentence><sentence id="511">Was most important to, to have to drink, like water or you know, some, some food to, to, to eat over there. </sentence><sentence id="512">And maybe other thing I remember maybe could be a part of this survival, I don't know how right or wrong I am. </sentence><sentence id="513">The fascist government start to take the houses from the Jewish people. </sentence><sentence id="514">And this is, a Jewish family has a house is ten rooms whatever. </sentence><sentence id="515">Most of the time they took all the house, or nine rooms, and they let the Jewish owner to stay in one room over there. </sentence><sentence id="516">Five, six people in one room. </sentence><sentence id="517">And they give the rest of the non-Jewish people who occupy the room. </sentence><sentence id="518">Sometimes, being a small town, most of the houses, they have some garden around. </sentence><sentence id="519">So they start the Jewish people to, to uh to garden a little. </sentence><sentence id="520">To put some potatoes, to have I remember for some time, sometimes maybe some tomatoes to put over there. </sentence><sentence id="521">Some stuff to use, every possible to survive, to get some food over there. </sentence><sentence id="522">But the health is a problem and everybody was afraid every day somebody was, family would be taken to sent far away in special detachment, uh special uh formation to dig uh fortification and many people didn't come back. </sentence><sentence id="523">Was taken to say different part of the country to work in the uh forced labor in the factory. </sentence><sentence id="524">And many didn't come back. </sentence><sentence id="525">We don't know why. </sentence><sentence id="526">So uh the most important was to, to keep, to be alive and to be like your family to go through, through the war. </sentence><sentence id="527">And something else which probably could happened that I try to explain now is maybe some people are involved in and uh history research will go further. </sentence><sentence id="528">But we know in "42 starting, Germans start to, to be defeated on the Russian front and was a discussion about to open the second front by United States uh Army with uh Allies. </sentence><sentence id="529">So uh when uh the situation become worse and worse on the eastern front, Russian front, Zionists start to come back, and many wounded soldiers come back. </sentence><sentence id="530">They brought very bad feeling to their family. </sentence><sentence id="531">So non-Jewish family start to understand, and not before maybe they understood too that the war would be lost. </sentence><sentence id="532">So they suffered, the non-Jewish people suffered a lot, even if they are non-Jewish, they give their uh children to go to the war. </sentence><sentence id="533">They lost their children. </sentence><sentence id="534">Was tough for them even to, to get food over there. </sentence><sentence id="535">So many non-Jewish people start to, to, to help the Jewish people. </sentence><sentence id="536">Some neighbor would give sometimes say uh a bottle of milk to help, a loaf of bread, start to be some connection again because the people understood that on one hand the Jewish suffered, but they suffered too. </sentence><sentence id="537">It's not like to help the Jewish people, and maybe was, maybe, maybe was some opportunistic situation because they say this good, good relationship with the Jewish after the war. </sentence><sentence id="538">Who knows, you know. </sentence><sentence id="539">So uh the situation was tough, and many non- Jewish people took out many special fascist organization, took advantage, took all the Jewish business, all the Jewish factory, all the big Jewish house, or small Jewish houses, so the only hope of the Jewish people was to, to get out of the war and we know that there be  https://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection or due to the uh American Army or western army will come to liberate our territory or to the Russian army, start the offensive about the Germans over there. </sentence><sentence id="540">So every day, every minute start to follow the news, where is the front is moving. </sentence><sentence id="541">And I recall like now when was downtown, our town, was a big map of the Russian front showing how deep the German troops and others to penetrate in Russia. </sentence><sentence id="542">How they move from say uh eastern, uh western part of the Russia through Kiev to Caucasus to Moscow to Leningrad. </sentence><sentence id="543">And everyday in "41, the line of the front moving further and further. </sentence><sentence id="544">And we look at the map sometimes and we were very afraid. </sentence><sentence id="545">The further the German went, uh further our our hope was diminished, right. </sentence><sentence id="546">But after a while we knew the situation was changed. </sentence><sentence id="547">The Germans start to uh to be defeated. </sentence><sentence id="548">But the arrow was a sign on this map remains the same place. </sentence><sentence id="549">They didn't move to show how far they come back. </sentence><sentence id="550">So we start to, to find every way to get information, were we stand. </sentence><sentence id="551">Each day the front came closer, closer to our uh land, to this small city. </sentence><sentence id="552">So uh, the more we knew about the news, the uh Russian Army come closer to our border, the more we think that maybe we will escape. </sentence><sentence id="553">But we hope at the same time and everybody was, a lot of discussion, about the opening of the second front in Europe. </sentence><sentence id="554">And was a lot of discussion about American troops would come through the Greece at one point, to the, to open the second front. </sentence><sentence id="555">And to come to Greece, by the Romania to cut the German and probably the Russian to go toward west. </sentence><sentence id="556">But as you know, doesn't happen and the Russian came first. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="726">A: OK. </sentence><sentence id="727">So basically I was arrested in the spring of "44. </sentence><sentence id="728">And I was in our local police interrogated. </sentence><sentence id="729">And after a while in the same time after two or three weeks, they decided to evacuate the police headquarters because the front start to move in "40, in the spring of "44 very close. </sentence><sentence id="730">And Moldavia was the first part to come under the Russian army. </sentence><sentence id="731">So they start to evacuate. </sentence><sentence id="732">The government tell uh offices, authorities. </sentence><sentence id="733">So decided to send us another place to finish interrogation and to prepare the paper to be uh, to court. </sentence><sentence id="734">So we was sent to a city call Gala_i, on the Danube River. </sentence><sentence id="735">And over there starts some interrogations and start to prepare based on declarations made by uh the agent, the informant agent against us in the court. </sentence><sentence id="736">Because we fight against the Nazi, you can't fight against a dictatorship, Romanian dictatorship. </sentence><sentence id="737">But meantime, the war start to be closer and closer. </sentence><sentence id="738">And they, try to remember, with some a lot of planes, war planes from Russia start to fly over the city and maybe some American flights. </sentence><sentence id="739">So every day, every night was some Allied movement, what you call it, air (air raid), air raids was over there. </sentence><sentence id="740">So one day they decide it's not safe. </sentence><sentence id="741">So they decided to send us, this group of young, was not only young people because we met other people over there, to move from this prison to other prison more safe and prepare to go to the court. </sentence><sentence id="742">Was a city called Ploe_ti. </sentence><sentence id="743">Ploe_ti, was a very famous because of oil fields over there. </sentence><sentence id="744">And one night they took irons, they put chains on our legs, and chain our uh arms, and sent to other prison. </sentence><sentence id="745">But in fact was not kind of regular prison, was a monastery as was transformed in a prison like this. </sentence><sentence id="746">And we stay over there waiting for the trial. </sentence><sentence id="747">Was in uh uh "44. </sentence><sentence id="748">And in the spring of "44, toward May "44, start the Russian, recall the Russian front was uh broken, the Russian victories against the Germans. </sentence><sentence id="749">They come very close. </sentence><sentence id="750">They, they took uh Kiev. </sentence><sentence id="751">They took Ukraine. </sentence><sentence id="752">They come close to the Romanian border, to Bessarabia, on one hand. </sentence><sentence id="753">On the other hand, the American aircraft start to bomb the Ploe_ti air fields over there. </sentence><sentence id="754">And from our place we saw many times the American planes coming bombing Ploe_ti. </sentence><sentence id="755">We were very happy any time we saw the planes bombing Ploe_ti. </sentence><sentence id="756">We knew that the war had come to the end. </sentence><sentence id="757">We don't know how close we are to the end of the war. </sentence><sentence id="758">So uh one day, in the spring, wait first of all, in Gala_i even, we was kept in every, everybody in different cell alone. </sentence><sentence id="759">Was cement on the floor, nothing, was a piece of wood or something we slept over there. </sentence><sentence id="760">Was a, how you call it, is a piece of uh, an opening which you can't make our need, put it this way, and once or twice a

from uh Gala_i to Ploe_ti, was the train. </sentence><sentence id="766">We stand, we cannot sit because of our chains. </sentence><sentence id="767">We sit together, or stand together, will start to talk. </sentence><sentence id="768">Anyway, we become very sick when we come to Ploe_ti and Ploe_ti in comparison with Gala_i was a nice place because being a monastery we have the right like everybody there, to walk out in the garden over there. </sentence><sentence id="769">There was some place under surveillance but one hour per day or one hour every day. </sentence><sentence id="770">So was a big change for us. </sentence><sentence id="771">And, and this uh place, we could talk a little more free with other prisoners. </sentence><sentence id="772">Was not only political prisoners, how you call it, maybe they were criminals, maybe whatever they were, but they had some information about the war. </sentence><sentence id="773">And one day we find out that the Ploe_ti was bombed. </sentence><sentence id="774">We saw them very heavily that uh, uh front was again broken Moldavia as the Germans started to retreat. </sentence><sentence id="775">Uh through Carpathian mountains towards Translyvania in Germany. </sentence><sentence id="776">And then unexpected for us, one day, I saw the, we saw that the people over there who uh ran the prison start themselves to pack and to go. </sentence><sentence id="777">And they told us they would take us to our city back. </sentence><sentence id="778">So one day we were put together in a car and went to station, from station went to, by the train to our city, Bac_u. </sentence><sentence id="779">They could free us basically. </sentence><sentence id="780">Because the front is broken. </sentence><sentence id="781">Everybody takes care about themselves. </sentence><sentence id="782">We had some good luck. </sentence><sentence id="783">In other place, in other place, before the Russian came, I heard they killed the prisoners over there. </sentence><sentence id="784">On uh other places, they keep the prisoner to the last moment and the Russian troops liberated them. </sentence><sentence id="785">OK.

</sentence><sentence id="990">And I got working directions, instructions from you only. </sentence><sentence id="991">And on uh my side, after a while, if I can bring other young men into

</sentence><sentence id="995">More specially against the Germans and happened two of these uh colleagues in the school, in the school, later on worked on the same in the same factory. </sentence><sentence id="996">So when we went in this factory, textile factory, we start to discuss during break what, how to sabotage the work over there because they produce for the war. </sentence><sentence id="997">And how to maybe to talk to other friends in other factory. </sentence><sentence id="998">So first of all we start to slow down the work, and we start to talk to other people around. </sentence><sentence id="999">There are a lot of young people. </sentence><sentence id="1000">We was out to tell them about organization, about anything. </sentence><sentence

maintenance, repairs, and there is not enough repair parts. </sentence><sentence id="1007">So one of our objectives inside was to, to slow the production ...to our possibilities. </sentence><sentence id="1008">The second was like uh political action I guess. </sentence><sentence id="1009">You talk to the people to convince them that the uh fascist government is not good. </sentence><sentence id="1010">That we have to do something, that we have to fight for liberation from German occupation. </sentence><sentence id="1011">Was like uh political activity, to have more and more people to

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1288">A: My worst moment, put it this way, was, (PAUSE) I cannot say the worst moment, was maybe was many moments. </sentence><sentence id="1289">One was when being in police when was in our town, and the same time was other two, three people which were taken, and I was in a cell with a small window. </sentence><sentence id="1290">During the night I couldn't sleep. </sentence><sentence id="1291">But all of a sudden I, I heard some steps. </sentence><sentence id="1292">And I saw two policemen bringing somebody, some corridors, and after a while I realized that the prisoner was one of my colleagues over there. </sentence><sentence id="1293">And they brought him as kind of basement not far away from where I were, and start to beat him, talk to him over there. </sentence><sentence id="1294">And I heard his screams and I heard his cries and I watched you know what happened over there and I realized, for me was the worst moment because probably was almost dead over there. </sentence><sentence id="1295">But here, specially I knew like a comrade and like a nice person which I talked to many times and such a situation was horrifying. </sentence><sentence id="1296">And was horrifying to understand what happened to his mind and his feeling. </sentence><sentence id="1297">Was something which one is the worst moment. </sentence><sentence id="1298">And the second worst moment I guess was for me when we were transferred from one prison, from Gala_i, to Ploe_ti. </sentence><sentence id="1299">I told you before. </sentence><sentence id="1300">We was put in a kind of prison, in a monastery. </sentence><sentence id="1301">By this monastery was probably, I don't recall, six, seven kilometers, probably five miles, from Ploe_ti. </sentence><sentence id="1302">We were in chains, and the hands cuffed, so from Ploe_ti station to the monastery was not any communication. </sentence><sentence id="1303">We have to walk. </sentence><sentence id="1304">So during the walk, during the night, was night, to start to walk and the monastery was on a kind of hill. </sentence><sentence id="1305">We have to uh, road winding and climbing. </sentence><sentence id="1306">After ten minutes, fifteen minutes, almost nobody could no more walk because the chain on the legs makes them uh, wounds, wounds you because. </sentence><sentence id="1307">And they at one point start to bleed. </sentence><sentence id="1308">And they couldn't walk. </sentence><sentence id="1309">And almost I fall down. </sentence><sentence id="1310">And other people fall down. </sentence><sentence id="1311">At that moment, we stop for maybe a couple of seconds, and once the policemen start to come to us and say, go, don't, we have to, to get to the monastery. </sentence><sentence id="1312">You have to give you a way to catch back our train, so don't care about you. </sentence><sentence id="1313">So it was like the end of the world for us. </sentence><sentence id="1314">Finally, one of uh our colleague have an idea to take some handkerchiefs or our shirt, I don't remember, to make a knot to our uh chains and to tie it to our belts so the chain doesn't fall down on our ankles here. </sentence><sentence id="1315">So we try to do this for a while, but again start to fall down. </sentence><sentence id="1316">So the worst moment probably, we walked two hours say, close to two hours, but I thought was eternity. </sentence><sentence id="1317">And then a funny moment happened when we went to this uh monastery. </sentence><sentence id="1318">They have a big barrack. </sentence><sentence id="1319">Was not inside the monastery, was outside. </sentence><sentence id="1320">The kind of place where they kept

couldn't breathe, couldn't do anything. </sentence><sentence id="1331">But only very small space, space to lay down was this barrel. </sentence><sentence id="1332">So everybody jump to lay down and to put their head on the wall of the barrel. </sentence><sentence id="1333">I cannot tell you what feeling, when you feel happy, if you can say that, because we, we don't walk. </sentence><sentence id="1334">Was end of the . </sentence><sentence id="1335">On other end, where you were over there, maybe wasn't like you were coming over there because they us. </sentence><sentence id="1336">Was how

leader, and probably he killed somebody or something happened, I don't know. </sentence><sentence id="1504">So he have a bad sentence, and in order to avoid, he ran out of the town and later on come back and he was hiding with a neighbor who happened to be Jewish guy. </sentence><sentence id="1505">He's former roommate or colleague or something like that. </sentence><sentence id="1506">So this Traian who was Iron Guard security chief and has a death penalty on his head was hiding, by in a Jewish family. </sentence><sentence id="1507">After a while, one of the sons of the Jewish family was involved to some extent in this organization, anti-fascist movement and they told to one of connections that they know they hiding this guy over there to him. </sentence><sentence id="1508">So one day they decided let's use him somehow because he's not Jews uh, and let him try to go to send him to some camps in Russia with Jewish people, non-Jewish people, communists, not communists, to help them, to send some money, some, some uh packages, some products or some grocery or some clothes. </sentence><sentence id="1509">So he agreed to go again like a what you call underground to help the anti-fascist forces, put it this way. </sentence><sentence id="1510">So he went a couple of times to what those days was occupied by Germans to help, not to help, to uh transmit some money, to transmit some food, some clothes, something to the people that was in camp. </sentence><sentence id="1511">One night before uh probably we was arrested, he decided to go out from hiding, probably to go in uh special house to have some lady relationship, with some prostitutes or some bordello or something. </sentence><sentence id="1512">And he went over there and some policemen around recognize him, so they put him under surveillance and they follow him, and they follow where he went. </sentence><sentence id="1513">So the police, the fascist police start to survey the house and finally  https://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection 0 they decided to arrest some people of the house, including him. </sentence><sentence id="1514">So he went together with this group and our group when all was the same time to the police. </sentence><sentence id="1515">And he, he was again put under trial and put uh inquire and put on the investigation, not like Iron Guard, but like helping the anti-fascist movement. </sentence><sentence id="1516">But he was all the time afraid that he was put there because he was an Iron Guard, so after a while we start to talk and I start to talk to him, and he told very vague, not in detail, that he knows his past, he regret it, make a big mistake, and he want to pay somehow and want to help the movement. </sentence><sentence id="1517">And probably my feeling he was a little opportunistic. </sentence><sentence id="1518">He knew, he was smart guy. </sentence><sentence id="1519">He knew that the situation would change anyhow, so it's better to have good relationship with uh anti-fascist groups. </sentence><sentence id="1520">So after uh the German left and uh become independent uh country again if I can say, he was in charge for a while like security chief, security force in the same town Bac_u but now like presence of communists. </sentence><sentence id="1521">And happened he married a Jewish girl. </sentence><sentence id="1522">But finally after a while, put it this way, was a lot of uh discussion, a lot of uh problem, the relation with others, not only with him, Iron Guard people and uh fascist people who converted during the night to be democratic, to be communist and to help the communists. </sentence><sentence id="1523">So he was, we found this true, expelled from communist party and take out of his job and sent some place in our small town to work like in accounting. </sentence><sentence id="1524">But uh was pretty interesting story about him and uh how some people are liberate during the war and before the war, how some people change the color of their shirt. </sentence><sentence id="1525">Because I met in my life many, many kinds of people. </sentence><sentence id="1526">Some people have some convictions, something. </sentence><sentence id="1527">And the keep their conviction, right or wrong, to the end of their life. </sentence><sentence id="1528">Didn't want to change. </sentence><sentence id="1529">Other, according to the circumstances, feel more safe for them to, to change their convictions. </sentence><sentence id="1530">To say I'm sorry for yesterday, but now I'm changed. </sentence><sentence id="1531">I'm with you. </sentence><sentence id="1532">So this happened many times and even now days you see many places over the world the same, the same story. </sentence><sentence id="1533">But was interesting you know how they were alright, the people were alright.
