<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="104">Q: Were there, what changes, did any changes take place in 1933 when Hitler came to power in Germany? </sentence><sentence id="105">What began in the "30s to happen in Romania, if anything? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="108">A: I guess happened many things, like in the all world and uh I was very young, uh young boy at the time. </sentence><sentence id="109">But already I remember very well in my family, my father and I guess in that period was "33, "34, was the first time a radio in our house and we (were) not wery rich, I guess, like middle class, we didn't have a radio, so he bought a second-hand radio. </sentence><sentence id="110">And we start to listen to the radio. </sentence><sentence id="111">And we started at that time to hear more and more about Germany, about Hitler, about what's going on. </sentence><sentence id="112">So the people start to, to talk and I heard in our family, talking with some friends, talking about what happened in Germany. </sentence><sentence id="113">And people already become to be anxious about what the future will bring because we had some feelings, not to I say we, we kids, but Jewish people said something's starting to, to, to change. </sentence><sentence id="114">It's a quietness and it's a quiet life which was before over there. </sentence><sentence id="115">And if I remember again was a lot of articles in the press at the time about the events. </sentence><sentence id="116">And uh, was some kind of discussion now and people start to talk more, but was only talk at this time about Germany, about Hitler, about the situation in our town. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="126">Q: And when the war actually broke out, what happened? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="128">A: Now we come to the period of time when I guess I remember most about what happened and to my recollection I have more lively now, you know. </sentence><sentence id="129">And matter of fact, even before, before the war started, the war started in "41, if I remember June, I say 21, "41, the war started, the German started to cross the Soviet Union's border. </sentence><sentence id="130">But before "41 already the situation was very tense. </sentence><sentence id="131">Number one, in "39, "38, when Hitler start to act aggressively and to enter Austria in "38 and Czechoslovakia if I remember, we were more anxious and many people, many Jewish people, start to think to emigrate from Romania. </sentence><sentence id="132">And our lot of town is the young organization over there, and uh, always uh Zionist uh movement try to convince people to immigrate to Palestine even before the war. </sentence><sentence id="133">By the events that happening before the war, in "38, "39, the international events start to show to the people, specially to the Jewish people, to find a way to escape in case Hitler would come close to our borders. </sentence><sentence id="134">But between or besides the international conditions, uh domestic conditions change. </sentence><sentence id="135">Some fascist organizations like Iron Guard and other organizations start to become more, more aggressive. </sentence><sentence id="136">And they start to take action against the Jewish people. </sentence><sentence id="137">They start on the street to, to beat some Jewish people in "39 with some, some, some uh big uh, uh grow of this organization encouraged by Germans, by other groups. </sentence><sentence id="138">So in "30, "39 the situation start to be very tense for all the people. </sentence><sentence id="139">And I have to, to tell you no probably and  https://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection I'm sure that when the German went to Poland and occupied in September, I don't know, September Ist if I recall, beginning of September, we heard by the radio, but after two, three days already the Polish troop start to run from Poland and to come toward Moldavia to Romania. </sentence><sentence id="140">And one day, one morning, I remember like now, it was four in the morning, we heard a large noise, big noise on the, my street, and like a big column of tanks or heavy vehicles start to moving. </sentence><sentence id="141">Unusual noise for a small city. </sentence><sentence id="142">So everybody went out. </sentence><sentence id="143">It was four, five in the morning. </sentence><sentence id="144">And we saw some columns of trucks, loaded with uh Polish soldiers. </sentence><sentence id="145">Dirty, uh thirsty, very very uh tired, like escaped from, from the war. </sentence><sentence id="146">And the first thing they always asked for water, some food and was a very very depressed situation. </sentence><sentence id="147">It would depress anybody. </sentence><sentence id="148">And to know for yourself as the first time what the war means. </sentence><sentence id="149">We saw on our streets, and was in'39, and uh the Polish troops start to, to get out of the vehicle, ask for more food. </sentence><sentence id="150">They start to trade something, want it to be free, and there's long story what happens uh Polish troop. </sentence><sentence id="151">But began the first sign when we saw the war in our uh, in the middle of our house. </sentence><sentence id="152">So we understand that the situation aggravate and aggravate more and more. </sentence><sentence id="153">So even before the war started in "40 other international events and domestic events starting to, to, to uh, to occur over there and the Iron Guard and other fascist organizations become more powerful. </sentence><sentence id="154">And the political situation start to uh, to be very tense and as we know, in "40 and beginning on "41 was a big change. </sentence><sentence id="155">The king was take over from the throne, was uh expelled out, and uh General Antonescu the power and installed a  https://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection beginning or end or the fall of "40 or beginning of "41, the Jewish community sent or decided to organize own school for Jewish students. </sentence><sentence id="156">They promised to find the space, to find the teachers, and was a big problem. </sentence><sentence id="157">And I recall something about they decide to give the space and other space available was the Jewish community center and start to organize the first high school in the, in our town. </sentence><sentence id="158">And there a lot of professional people who never in their lives they were teachers. </sentence><sentence id="159">They offer their service to be teachers. </sentence><sentence id="160">They got engineers, we have architects, and maybe other professional people, lawyer I remember, who become teachers. </sentence><sentence id="161">So we start to have our, our schools. </sentence><sentence id="162">So we start an hour of school to discuss a lot about what has to be done and besides uh learning and teaching and the teachers, the students start to talk about to do something. </sentence><sentence id="163">So we start to organize some group, as a mixture of Zionist young people, non-Zionist people, and to have some friends who are non-Jewish in other school. </sentence><sentence id="164">And we start to talk to them as much as possible. </sentence><sentence id="165">It was very difficult to start to make connections. </sentence><sentence id="166">And was other political parties, democrat parties start to, to, to uh enter, to think about organize some. </sentence><sentence id="167">At that point we decide to organize some group over there to do something because we have some signal from abroad what start to happen to the Jewish people in uh Czechoslovakia and Poland. </sentence><sentence id="168">So we start to organize some group and to find a way to fight the German. </sentence><sentence id="169">Because now in the "41 the war started, the Jewish people more restricted in movements. </sentence><sentence id="170">They were confined to their home, specially to the Jewish young people, specially, and uh sent in uh the labor camp and mandatory factory to dig trenches for the war. </sentence><sentence id="171">Uh, they close the hospital, public hospital, to the Jewish uh patients, etc. </sentence><sentence id="172">etc. </sentence><sentence id="173">So was started to, to, talk and to think to do something, and we start to organize some groups. </sentence><sentence id="174">At one point between Jewish young people and non-Jewish young people over there. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="224">Q: What kind of groups were they? </sentence><sentence id="225">What did they do? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="228">A: Now this is very, very interesting uh question because basic is the beginning. </sentence><sentence id="229">The most important thing I guess, thinking now, we didn't, we didn't have any information about what was going on in the war because all the press was already the first of all, was uh interdict radio sets was taken from the Jewish people. </sentence><sentence id="230">All the Jewish people has to give_ beginning "40, "41, the radio sets. </sentence><sentence id="231">So was not a way to, to listen to the radio. </sentence><sentence id="232">The press was under the control, and they publish only what was interest, in the German interest was this way. </sentence><sentence id="233">And before the war and after the war starting to publish only war, German what you call communiques about the war. </sentence><sentence id="234">So one of the first things we sought was to find what was going on. </sentence><sentence id="235">So some, our friends have some connections, have some friends who are non- Jewish and start to, to have uh networks to find information what is going on through the people who had radios, have information based on their position, parents" position. </sentence><sentence id="236">And I remember even was two, three Jewish people who interested in the electronic like today and two of them decided to build from, from scratch, from nothing some small radio uh equipment in order to listen what is going on. </sentence><sentence id="237">So this one was the first action, and we start from time to time to have some uh, some news. </sentence><sentence id="238">They succeeded to uh get some information through some if I recall BBC from London and from probably from Russia they catch some, some news over there. </sentence><sentence id="239">But the interesting part with that uh the young people who, who put together this radio, during the day they dismantled the radio because if some police came in  https://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection house, they don't find the radio even and hiding the pieces and during the evening they put together. </sentence><sentence id="240">Was a very difficult operation. </sentence><sentence id="241">Basically, this is a fact, that was not uh parts put this way, and together parts was a big problem. </sentence><sentence id="242">So the first action was to get information and the, the second part was to uh disseminate this information. </sentence><sentence id="243">So we start to write the news in some small piece of paper and to give to other young people to, to read. </sentence><sentence id="244">So was a shade of transmission of the news. </sentence><sentence id="245">And I recall at one point, we start to find many ways to hide this small paper on which we, we wrote some, some news. </sentence><sentence id="246">So we start to take for example, some soaps and cut in half the soaps and make some, some holes, and put together and keep the uh hard papers, small papers, and using the paper and to give the soaps. </sentence><sentence id="247">Or other way to hide them and to transmit them as material some all kind of doors at one point Iremember. </sentence><sentence id="248">Some, some toys we used. </sentence><sentence id="249">So this is the first part of the action, was related to knowing what was going on and where we stand. </sentence><sentence id="250">Later on we decided to, to start to do more, more action, more uh specially action against if we could the German, and if not the German uh troops, against the German uh place where they manufacture war products. </sentence><sentence id="251">So in our town was a couple of factory. </sentence><sentence id="252">If I recall one was textile factory manufacturing textile to prepare to uh, for uh military uniforms say. </sentence><sentence id="253">Was a big factory prepare leather, paper and other kinds of industry. </sentence><sentence id="254">And all this industry at one point works like forced labour, a lot of Jewish young people. </sentence><sentence id="255">And sure non-Jewish people were there. </sentence><sentence id="256">But many, many workmen were sent to fight against the Russians, the front. </sentence><sentence id="257">So a lot of young Jewish and young, non- Jewish people, young people fifteen years old was brought to this factory to work. </sentence><sentence id="258">So in this place is start to have some connection and to start to do all kind of sabotage. </sentence><sentence id="259">Say, if I recall, to slow down the production for example. </sentence><sentence id="260">To start to uh, to break some machines over there. </sentence><sentence id="261">And was very, very, uh, at that time very audacious actions. </sentence><sentence id="262">Was not maybe very big, we don't blow bridges, but we start a movement to organize the young people to fight against the Germany and this movement start to extend to non-Jewish. </sentence><sentence id="263">Some non-Jewish young people refused to go in the Army to fight the war along the Germans. </sentence><sentence id="264">So uh all kind of action. </sentence><sentence id="265">At one point was a discussion to start to do something about the German, and many nights, uh many Jewish young people and non-Jewish young people succeeded to go some place close. </sentence><sentence id="266">For example where the Germans keep their trucks, and to open the tanks, the gas tank and to put say some sand inside. </sentence><sentence id="267">And we discuss at one point to start to bring some small pieces of wood planks with nails and to put it some place where you know that the Germans uh vehicle will go through in some places. </sentence><sentence id="268">But was interesting because uh, many people at that time was divided I can say, how to act. </sentence><sentence id="269">Some, now, maybe appear very easy you know when you talk as far as the part but at that time to go in the street was a big deal to do. </sentence><sentence id="270">Uh to meet some people over there was very difficult because of curfew after six o'clock no Jewish on the street. </sentence><sentence id="271">And the Jewish has to wear some special sign, the star of the Juda as they call it. </sentence><sentence id="272">But uh at one point, maybe, this is interesting as I..(PHRASES MISSING)...but uh at one point uh many people thought its maybe better nothing to do because no matter what you are doing we exposed to something. </sentence><sentence id="273">And was a good feeling that later, uh sooner or later, the German would be defeated and all American Army will come to liberate our part or maybe Russian will be come first over there. </sentence><sentence id="274">So anyways they will come, so why to uh sacrifice our lives. </sentence><sentence id="275">But was a strong feeling among many people that have to do something. </sentence><sentence id="276">You know how many people died towards the front, how many people died in the camps, so many people feel to do to fight against the Germans and oh, the  https://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection people, the young people, I talking about young people, maybe not only young people. </sentence><sentence id="277">They don't care at that point about their life because they want to sacrifice to do something. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="330">Q: OK. </sentence><sentence id="331">So you were part of this group. </sentence><sentence id="332">You were doing these things. </sentence><sentence id="333">Uh, what about your family during this time? </sentence><sentence id="334">How were you living? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="340">A: That's a good question because uh this question applied to, let's put it this way, to the Jewish population. </sentence><sentence id="341">What happens to the Jewish population? </sentence><sentence id="342">And I have to make a short or long paranthesis about this. </sentence><sentence id="343">The Jewish situation in Romania during the war was different than in Poland, in Hungary, in Czechoslovakia, in eastern uh western Europe even because of political situation, because the General Antonescu could become an ally to Hitler and he gave everything including a big army to fight along the German army. </sentence><sentence id="344">They kept, the fascist government in Romania, they kept some uh power in uh day by day administration of the territory, of the territory. </sentence><sentence id="345">And they was in charge to solve the Jewish problem over there. </sentence><sentence id="346">So they decided for many many reasons, don't to send the Jewish people to Auschwitz. </sentence><sentence id="347">To use them, to put them to work as a factory. </sentence><sentence id="348">Was more useful. </sentence><sentence id="349">They can because they took a lot of young people and not young people to put in the army to fight against the uh, along the Germans against the Russians. </sentence><sentence id="350">So a lot of factories, they don't have manpower, labor. </sentence><sentence id="351">So they want to use the Jewish people like a labor this work factory as they put a lot of people over there. </sentence><sentence id="352">Other Jewish people, let's say young people not only, was sent to build trenches, to build uh defense uh lines, at the front. </sentence><sentence id="353">So just speaking, most of the Jewish people were not sent to death camps. </sentence><sentence id="354">Was used to work. </sentence><sentence id="355">Some were sent in different camps in the territory which the German took from Russia, in the Ukraine, and maybe come back, maybe not. </sentence><sentence id="356">They start to arrest a lot of Jewish leaders and non-Jewish leaders and to put on uh, in prison. </sentence><sentence id="357">But was a small way to make some small, small amount of money. </sentence><sentence id="358">Because when they keep the people, the Jewish people, working in the factories, they give something. </sentence><sentence id="359">They pay like a very minimum, very minimum salary. </sentence><sentence id="360">I don't want to express how much was, but say enough to buy some piece of bread, was a bread twist or to buy some uh cornmeal or to buy other product which was if there was a market. </sentence><sentence id="361">And other interesting thing I guess, now talking with you it's in my mind, a lot of product came from the farmer who work with the land, and before the war the tradition was the farmer who has some land or farm, two, three, four, five miles from the cities, they come everyday in the city to market. </sentence><sentence id="362">Special market. </sentence><sentence id="363">Or they have their customers like to bring the milk, to bring the eggs, to bring whatever, the chicken. </sentence><sentence id="364">And I remember, say in our family, was a special farmer which come every day, before the war, every day they bring the milk in front of our door, some meat sometimes, fruits, vegetables, so was some relationship. </sentence><sentence id="365">When the war started this farmer, or some farmers, continued to come to the city to sell their products and many times they help the Jewish people. </sentence><sentence id="366">They say start to give some products. </sentence><sentence id="367">They don't have too much because some members of their families was taken in the army to go to the war, but uh they continue to, to work the land and they come with the less product to the market. </sentence><sentence id="368">But was some way to, to get something. </sentence><sentence id="369">And the Jewish people started to sell what ever they had to the people around. </sentence><sentence id="370">This only because big deal. </sentence><sentence id="371">They start to sell maybe their furniture, they some goods whatever. </sentence><sentence id="372">Maybe they have some gold. </sentence><sentence id="373">Maybe they have, whatever the Jewish people start to sell, to sell, to sell for nothing to, to buy the main product to uh, to survive. </sentence><sentence id="374">So was  https://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection some, some kind of connection to get some food over there. </sentence><sentence id="375">But the problem what important first to keep alive and good health because, if I recall, the public hospital closed to the Jewish patients say so the Jewish community start to organize some clinic and to use some Jewish doctors to give uh consultation over there. </sentence><sentence id="376">They start to, to get a way to get some medicine, but was more and more, become more uh uh seldom to get medicine. </sentence><sentence id="377">We can't get medicine, we can't get medical assistance to get an operation we need. </sentence><sentence id="378">So many people start even to die, to, to loose their health because of the conditions uh, medical conditions over there. </sentence><sentence id="379">And because they cannot feed the family, suppose the young people didn't have food. </sentence><sentence id="380">So the most important thing was to keep alive. </sentence><sentence id="381">Everybody everyday was the fight to keep, to keep alive. </sentence><sentence id="382">So was not, not very easy but was not enough to eat. </sentence><sentence id="383">But people survived. </sentence><sentence id="384">Was most important to, to have to drink, like water or you know, some, some food to, to, to eat over there. </sentence><sentence id="385">And maybe other thing I remember maybe could be a part of this survival, I don't know how right or wrong I am. </sentence><sentence id="386">The fascist government start to take the houses from the Jewish people. </sentence><sentence id="387">And this is, a Jewish family has a house is ten rooms whatever. </sentence><sentence id="388">Most of the time they took all the house, or nine rooms, and they let the Jewish owner to stay in one room over there. </sentence><sentence id="389">Five, six people in one room. </sentence><sentence id="390">And they give the rest of the non-Jewish people who occupy the room. </sentence><sentence id="391">Sometimes, being a small town, most of the houses, they have some garden around. </sentence><sentence id="392">So they start the Jewish people to, to uh to garden a little. </sentence><sentence id="393">To put some potatoes, to have I remember for some time, sometimes maybe some tomatoes to put over there. </sentence><sentence id="394">Some stuff to use, every possible to survive, to get some food over there. </sentence><sentence id="395">But the health is a problem and everybody was afraid every day somebody was, family would be taken to sent far away in special detachment, uh special uh formation to dig uh fortification and many people didn't come back. </sentence><sentence id="396">Was taken to say different part of the country to work in the uh forced labor in the factory. </sentence><sentence id="397">And many didn't come back. </sentence><sentence id="398">We don't know why. </sentence><sentence id="399">So uh the most important was to, to keep, to be alive and to be like your family to go through, through the war. </sentence><sentence id="400">And something else which probably could happened that I try to explain now is maybe some people are involved in and uh history research will go further. </sentence><sentence id="401">But we know in "42 starting, Germans start to, to be defeated on the Russian front and was a discussion about to open the second front by United States uh Army with uh Allies. </sentence><sentence id="402">So uh when uh the situation become worse and worse on the eastern front, Russian front, Zionists start to come back, and many wounded soldiers come back. </sentence><sentence id="403">They brought very bad feeling to their family. </sentence><sentence id="404">So non-Jewish family start to understand, and not before maybe they understood too that the war would be lost. </sentence><sentence id="405">So they suffered, the non-Jewish people suffered a lot, even if they are non-Jewish, they give their uh children to go to the war. </sentence><sentence id="406">They lost their children. </sentence><sentence id="407">Was tough for them even to, to get food over there. </sentence><sentence id="408">So many non-Jewish people start to, to, to help the Jewish people. </sentence><sentence id="409">Some neighbor would give

</sentence><sentence id="421">But the arrow was a sign on this map remains the same place. </sentence><sentence id="422">They didn't move to show how far they come back. </sentence><sentence

</sentence><sentence id="425">So uh, the more we knew about the news, the uh Russian Army come closer to our border, the more we think that maybe we will escape. </sentence><sentence id="426">But we hope at the same time and everybody was, a lot of discussion, about the opening of the second front in Europe. </sentence><sentence id="427">And was a lot of discussion about American troops would

 https://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection 9 because was a very interesting person, very strange. </sentence><sentence id="999">Was a mixture of good and bad. </sentence><sentence id="1000">But was uh like an interesting story, OK. </sentence><sentence id="1001">So being this guy, young man in 40's, I remember. </sentence><sentence id="1002">He was young guy in the same town I know. </sentence><sentence id="1003">I remember like now that his father was an invalid from the first war and saved some license invalids from the war, first war, to sell cigarettes, you know. </sentence><sentence id="1004">Tobacco shops to have, to give a way to make a living for the, who are veterans. </sentence><sentence id="1005">So I know about him. </sentence><sentence id="1006">I know him on the streets, maybe on the school. </sentence><sentence id="1007">So one day in "40 when the Iron Guard become very powerful, "40, I guess "40, maybe beginning of "41, I saw this guy Triane, his Iron Guard uniform on the street. </sentence><sentence id="1008">Green uniform, military uniform. </sentence><sentence id="1009">And he starts to yell and to beat some people who think they were Jewish. </sentence><sentence id="1010">And for a while, at the end of the "40, maybe beginning of "41, the Iron Guard was part of the government of the dictatorship of General Antonescu, was most extremist right say wing, fascist wing. </sentence><sentence id="1011">And some places they put their people in charge of the security forces. </sentence><sentence id="1012">The police we call them. </sentence><sentence id="1013">So this young man become the chief of security, of police in our town. </sentence><sentence id="1014">Iron Guard security. </sentence><sentence id="1015">OK. </sentence><sentence id="1016">After a while, when uh Iron Guard was defeated by General Antonescu. </sentence><sentence id="1017">It's a long story. </sentence><sentence id="1018">Many run out of the country and many disappear, there's a fight on the streets. </sentence><sentence id="1019">It's a long story, don't want it in details, but I didn't hear anything about same person called Traian. </sentence><sentence id="1020">When I was arrested, and moved from our town to Gala_i to prison, was by, moved by a uh truck, I saw the truck with other people was this guy Traian. </sentence><sentence id="1021">After say three years maybe. </sentence><sentence id="1022">And I was surprised what he's doing with the people who fought against the German, because a part of Iron Guard. </sentence><sentence id="1023">I didn't know, I couldn't ask him. </sentence><sentence id="1024">Was dark, we went to the prison. </sentence><sentence id="1025">After Gala_i, we was transferred to this monastery where was more free, so we start to talk between them. </sentence><sentence id="1026">Talk to him, to talk to other people. </sentence><sentence id="1027">And I asked one other uh colleague who was with me in organization, what's doing this guy here because he was an Iron Guard, and we fought against the Germans. </sentence><sentence id="1028">And let's tell you his story shortly. </sentence><sentence id="1029">And looks first of all, he was condemned to death by uh fascist organization being an Iron Guard leader, and probably he killed somebody or something happened, I don't know. </sentence><sentence id="1030">So he have a bad sentence, and in order to avoid, he ran out of the town and later on come back and he was hiding with a neighbor who happened to be Jewish guy. </sentence><sentence id="1031">He's former roommate or colleague or something like that. </sentence><sentence id="1032">So this Traian who was Iron Guard security chief and has a death penalty on his head was hiding, by in a Jewish family. </sentence><sentence id="1033">After a while, one of the sons of the Jewish family was involved to some extent in this organization, anti-fascist movement and they told to one of connections that they know they hiding this guy over there to him. </sentence><sentence id="1034">So one day they decided let's use him somehow because he's not Jews uh, and let him try to go to send him to some camps in Russia with Jewish people, non-Jewish people, communists, not communists, to help them, to send some money, some, some uh packages, some products or some grocery or some clothes. </sentence><sentence id="1035">So he agreed to go again like a what you call underground to help the anti-fascist forces, put it this way. </sentence><sentence id="1036">So he went a couple of times to what those days was occupied by Germans to help, not to help, to uh transmit some money, to transmit some food, some clothes, something to the people that was in camp. </sentence><sentence id="1037">One night before uh probably we was arrested, he decided to go out from hiding, probably to go in uh special house to have some lady relationship, with some prostitutes or some bordello or something. </sentence><sentence id="1038">And he went over there and some policemen around recognize him, so they put him under surveillance and they follow him, and they follow where he went. </sentence><sentence id="1039">So the police, the fascist police start to survey the house and finally  https://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection 0 they decided to arrest some people of the house, including him. </sentence><sentence id="1040">So he went together with this group and our group when all was the same time to the police. </sentence><sentence id="1041">And he, he was again put under trial and put uh inquire and put on the investigation, not like Iron Guard, but like helping the anti-fascist movement. </sentence><sentence id="1042">But he was all the time afraid that he was put there because he was an Iron Guard, so after a while we start to talk and I start to talk to him, and he told very vague, not in detail, that he knows his past, he regret it, make a big mistake, and he want to pay somehow and want to help the movement. </sentence><sentence id="1043">And probably my feeling he was a little opportunistic. </sentence><sentence id="1044">He knew, he was smart guy. </sentence><sentence id="1045">He knew that the situation would change anyhow, so it's better to have good relationship with uh anti-fascist groups. </sentence><sentence id="1046">So after uh the German left and uh become independent uh country again if I can say, he was in charge for a while like security chief, security force in the same town Bac_u but now like presence of communists. </sentence><sentence id="1047">And happened he married a Jewish girl. </sentence><sentence id="1048">But finally after a while, put it this way, was a lot of uh discussion, a lot of uh problem, the relation with others, not only with him, Iron Guard people and uh fascist people who converted during the night to be democratic, to be communist and to help the communists. </sentence><sentence id="1049">So he was, we found this true, expelled from communist party and take out of his job and sent some place in our small town to work like in accounting. </sentence><sentence id="1050">But uh was pretty interesting story about him and uh how some people are liberate during the war and before the war, how some people change the color of their shirt. </sentence><sentence id="1051">Because I met in my life many, many kinds of people. </sentence><sentence id="1052">Some people have some convictions, something. </sentence><sentence id="1053">And the keep their conviction, right or wrong, to the end of their life. </sentence><sentence id="1054">Didn't want to change. </sentence><sentence id="1055">Other, according to the circumstances, feel more safe for them to, to change their convictions. </sentence><sentence id="1056">To say I'm sorry for yesterday, but now I'm changed. </sentence><sentence id="1057">I'm with you. </sentence><sentence id="1058">So this happened many times and even now days you see many places over the world the same, the same story. </sentence><sentence id="1059">But was interesting you know how they were alright, the people were alright.
