They...they stayed in there. </sentence><sentence id="486">And...uh...I went to...uh...to join the British Army in Haifa, the British Joint Office. </sentence><sentence id="487">Uh...Once I filled all the papers, I was advised that because when they asked me for my papers, I gave them my Portuguese passport that I arrived legally. </sentence><sentence id="488">So I was advised by the...by the lieutenant in charge...he said, "I'm sorry, Sir. </sentence><sentence id="489">You can't join the British army. </sentence><sentence id="490">Portugal is a neutral country." </sentence><sentence id="491">So I said, "Okay." </sentence><sentence id="492">I left and I joined the...at the time was in Haifa talking to some other friends in there, I joined the PPRD, the Palestine Police Railroad Division. </sentence><sentence id="493">And this time my cousin also joined. </sentence><sentence id="494">He came back from the kibbutz also. </sentence><sentence id="495">He couldn't manage there. </sentence><sentence id="496">And...uh...so we both joined the PPRD. </sentence><sentence id="497">But I did not like the PPRD, the Palestine Police Railroad DIvision. </sentence><sentence id="498">What we did was simply night guards. </sentence><sentence id="499">We had to be with the rifle or the carbine by the railroad or be escort to the British...uh...payroll, etc. </sentence><sentence id="500">And it was not what I wanted. </sentence><sentence id="501">I wanted to go to war. </sentence><sentence id="502">That was my main thing. </sentence><sentence id="503">So I decided to...uh...go to Sarafan, which was the largest British joint group...army...uh...camp.

( </sentence><sentence id="523">clearing throat) And we saw duties in Antwerp. </sentence><sentence id="524">We had our main station in Antwerp in Belgium. </sentence><sentence id="525">And it was there that...uh...I really had some first impact with dispersed persons that...people that came from the camps. </sentence><sentence id="526">Not the refugees that were able...that were fortunate to run away and arrive in Lisbon somehow in a reason...reasonably healthy manner. </sentence><sentence id="527">I'm talking about a dispersed person that survived the camps. </sentence><sentence id="528">They came out. </sentence><sentence id="529">They were skin and bones. </sentence><sentence id="530">Okay? </sentence><sentence id="531">And...uh...as a member of the Jewish Brigade, our uniforms were part of the British...uh...uniforms. </sentence><sentence id="532">The only difference was that we had our patches and we had the Star of David in gold with...uh...two whites and...uh...uh...blue...uh...stripes and...uh...it was in Antwerp and we  used to do a lot of duty at...uh...train station that the group of dispersed persons came in. </sentence><sentence id="533">They came out of the train, and I don't know if they came from Germany or from where they came from, but...uh...it was several of us...MPs, military police....and when they saw the Star of David, there was one of the most __ things I ever experienced in my life. </sentence><sentence id="534">They came to you, and they kissed the Star of David. </sentence><sentence id="535">And they was saying in Yiddish, _.. They didn't believe that. </sentence><sentence id="536">And it was very, very touching. </sentence><sentence id="537">So I spent some time in...uh...in Antwerp, and...uh...then we went to Eindhoven in Holland to a...uh...R and R camp. </sentence><sentence id="538">We spent some time there. </sentence><sentence id="539">And...uh...of course, this is after the war. </sentence><sentence id="540">Uh...And...uh...the Jewish Brigade at the time was not doing much of anything officially. </sentence><sentence id="541">Unofficially, the Jewish Brigade group or part of it or portion of it were very, very...uh...diligently working in moving...uh...dispersed persons from one place to another place. </sentence><sentence id="542">It reminds, perhaps, of the story of...uh...the Jewish Brigade group was like a duck that...uh...you only see the smooth sailing on...on above the water, but below water they peddle like Hell so to speak. </sentence><sentence id="543">And that's what was happening. </sentence><sentence id="544">The...uh...the Jewish Brigade group...uh...I'm assuming in conjunction with the Haganah and...uh...the Aliyah Bet and I'm sure you know the meaning of Alijah Bet. </sentence><sentence id="545">Uh...There was the convention immigration and the unconvention immigration. </sentence><sentence id="546">And the unconvention immigration was what we call today or we called then Alijah Bet. </sentence><sentence id="547">Uh...so that it would be distinguished from the convention immigration. </sentence><sentence id="548">Because the British mandate, at the time, in Palestine did not wish...did not want to allow any more Jews to come to Palestine on a variety of grounds that they believed in. </sentence><sentence id="549">But...uh...but, of course, the Jewish agency believed in...in otherwise. </sentence><sentence id="550">And the Jewish agency, of course, had other ideas. </sentence><sentence id="551">And as a result, the Alijah Bet was created. </sentence><sentence id="552">So...uh...there were many a times that...uh...in our camp, for instance, there was a time that over night there was several...uh...several...uh...tents that overnight had been erected in our...in...inside the camp. </sentence><sentence id="553">So for anyone on the outside looking at...at the army camp, another half a dozen tents wouldn't mean much of anything. </sentence><sentence id="554">Uh...Certainly, we were advised at the time that, you know, leave them along so to speak. </sentence><sentence id="555">They are dispersed persons in these tents. </sentence><sentence id="556">The reason is, of course, that the British mandate at the time...the British government...uh...with the assistance of the...uh...their various intelligence units...with the assistance of the British Royal Air Force, the British Navy, they had a blockade of Palestine not to allow any Jews to enter. </sentence><sentence id="557">And...uh...the Jewish Agency had no choice, but to try to evade their...their investigations. </sentence><sentence id="558">Where are the Jews coming from? </sentence><sentence id="559">Where are they being loaded? </sentence><sentence id="560">On what ships, etc., </sentence><sentence id="561">etc.? </sentence><sentence id="562">What ports, etc., </sentence><sentence id="563">etc.? </sentence><sentence id="564">So...uh...that's when the Jewish Brigade was of much help by using the military vehicles in transporting the refugees from one town to another town or if it's from another country, from...if it's from...from Holland to Belgium or to Italy or...or France, etc. </sentence><sentence id="565">So this involvement actually was...uh...ultimately was found out somehow, and the British government, of course, dismissed the entire Jewish Brigade. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="710">Q: Were you involved in any of this? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="712">A: No. </sentence><sentence id="713">I...I was not directly involved. </sentence><sentence id="714">No. </sentence><sentence id="715">Not at all. </sentence><sentence id="716">No. </sentence><sentence id="717">I was only by...by virtue of being...of serving with the Corps of Military Police of the Jewish Brigade. </sentence><sentence id="718">I do know that...uh...there was...uh...every...every vehicle...army vehicle had a log. </sentence><sentence id="719">And in this log,  of course, you have to write the moment you leave your camp, where you going, who is for, dut dut dut da. </sentence><sentence id="720">So...uh...they used to..to write in their logs when they were moving refugees three letters in English. </sentence><sentence id="721">T-T-G. And actually the meaning...uh...is...uh... Hebrew, Arabic, and Yiddish, which means . </sentence><sentence id="722">Which means if...if you pardon me, up your rear end business. </sentence><sentence id="723">That's what it meant. </sentence><sentence id="724">The reason that they wrote TTG on their...on their...on these log sheets was when and if they would be stopped by some of the Allied...uh... policemen on the frontiers, etc...uh...when the read, if it's British police and they read TTG on it, that sounds...even though it's a Jewish Brigade convoy...20 convoys or 30 vehicles, etc...uh...they're not going in to see what's inside. </sentence><sentence id="725">Fortunately, for us, they wouldn't because if they would have lift the...the gate, so to speak, you'll see that there was women, children, refugees being moved around. </sentence><sentence id="726">From one port to another port, etc. </sentence><sentence id="727">So this part was very exciting. </sentence><sentence id="728">I knew it about it. </sentence><sentence id="729">I was not involved directly with this. </sentence><sentence id="730">Uh...I was indirectly involved because, for instance, after spending some time in Europe in the British Army in the Jewish Brigade group, you are entitled to a vacation home. </sentence><sentence id="731">So an Isaac Bitton, in fact, went home on vacation. </sentence><sentence id="732">But the real Isaac Bitton never left, simply because the...uh...again...the...the Jewish agency had trained younger men, refugees to be able...how to hold...uh...the _____ the way the British army does or way the Jewish Brigade does. </sentence><sentence id="733">How to eat, etc. </sentence><sentence id="734">etc. </sentence><sentence id="735">Uh...Some Hebrews words in the event they would be questioned, but otherwise they went home on vacation. </sentence><sentence id="736">They never came back. </sentence><sentence id="737">They stayed there. </sentence><sentence id="738">But Isaac never left, say Antwerp, either. </sentence><sentence id="739">And then suddenly Ike is back from vacation. </sentence><sentence id="740">You understand? </sentence><sentence id="741">And...and the other Isaac stayed in Israel. </sentence><sentence id="742">So in this manner, many refugees also arrived in Israel with..-uh...with false...uh...army...uh...army papers, army documents. </sentence><sentence id="743">So that's the only time that I was, if you wish, indirectly involved with the Alivah Bet. </sentence><sentence id="744">Uh...of course, the end of the Jewish Brigade came about 1946. </sentence><sentence id="745">We were dismissed. </sentence><sentence id="746">And we went back. </sentence><sentence id="747">And it was prior to living in Antwerp and that one evening L...uh...I took a...uh...an electrical train in the city and to my great surprise, there was Brigadeer Benjamin. </sentence><sentence id="748">Brigadeer Benjamin was a....was a British Jew who was commanding the Jewish Brigade group. </sentence><sentence id="749">And it appears that he had never been informed officially of the underground activities that the Jewish Brigade was doing at the time in Europe. </sentence><sentence id="750">And as a result he...uh...he was just totally demoralized if you wish, prior to the...to the...when we all left...the Jewish Brigade left Europe. </sentence><sentence id="751">And Benjamin would be just...1 saw him more than one occasion walking around in town. </sentence><sentence id="752">But I met him personally in the electrical train. </sentence><sentence id="753">I had to salute, of course. </sentence><sentence id="754">He was a Brigadeer General and...uh...but we didn't speak. </sentence><sentence id="755">He was a very, very reserved man at that time. </sentence><sentence id="756">So I do not know from there on...uh...I never heard that he went to visit Israel or even if he ever went to Israel, but he was very upset about the whole thing. </sentence><sentence id="757">Uh...But the meantime...the main...the main...the main point was to save and bring as many Jews to Israel as possible. </sentence><sentence id="758">And that was something that the Haganah did...uh...the Alijat Bet did very well. </sentence><sentence id="759">And...uh...so we were disbanded, discharged pretty much. </sentence><sentence id="760">We went to Egypt again, and from Egypt we were...we stayed in some camps for a short period of time and we went to...we were discharged in Sarafan also officially and...uh...received our civil...civilian garments and little bit pay, etc., </sentence><sentence id="761">and we were free men again, so to speak. </sentence><sentence id="762">Out of the...out of the Army. </sentence><sentence id="763">Out in the streets. </sentence><sentence id="764">And...uh...immediately, when I went back in Nahariyya, of course, we joined the...all of us joined the Haganah underground  because the word at the time was that...uh...things did not go that good for...in Palestine. </sentence><sentence id="765">The...uh...

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1026">A: In...in the meantime, actually, the Jewish Agency decided...uh...to honor the name of Yeeheim Vis. </sentence><sentence id="1027">His father was at the time, I believe, a high official in the Jewish Agency. </sentence><sentence id="1028">So...uh...in the Western Galilee, there was too much openness actually, especially coming in from the mountains...uh.. So they decided...the Jewish Agency decided to build two kibbultzes. </sentence><sentence id="1029">It was just shortly before the war started. </sentence><sentence id="1030">And one of them is named, today, of course, Yeehim. </sentence><sentence id="1031">I'm quite familiar with the area because Yeehim if you go back to...uh...to several years ago, used to be called in Arabic. </sentence><sentence id="1032">And there was an Arab...a very, sort of a stronghold. </sentence><sentence id="1033">But it was abandoned. </sentence><sentence id="1034">There was no one there actually. </sentence><sentence id="1035">And...uh...so the Sofnut decided to build a kibbutz at____ by honoring the name of Yeehim. </sentence><sentence id="1036">And...uh...this was done. </sentence><sentence id="1037">Next door was built another kibbutz and...uh...uh...uh...I believe was Gotton. </sentence><sentence id="1038">I cannot quite remember the name, but I  remember that I was there at the time. </sentence><sentence id="1039">And this kibbutz was built already under fire...under Arabic fire because...uh...you could...it was a very...it was a very excitable day because here were the Haganah putting up little sheds and so forth, girls making food, and here these guys were shooting down from...from the...from a spot called the Mountain of the...the Tree Mountain. </sentence><sentence id="1040">Because was in above the higher level. </sentence><sentence id="1041">And...uh...1 can't remember exactly all the names in Hebrew any more, but it's...was like a tree because there was a large tree there. </sentence><sentence id="1042">And...uh...that's basically how come that this kibbutz Yeeheim came about, to honor Yeeheim Vis, basically. </sentence><sentence id="1043">And we used to go...uh...prior to the war...uh...the Haganah used to train and we used to bring arms, ammunitions, and food to kibbutz Yeeheim . </sentence><sentence id="1044">We used to walk for 4 and a half hours from Nahariyya to Yeeheim because you go up to the mountains and you have to walk to , and you had to bypass small Arab villages and you had to do it...uh...all night long pretty much and you had to do it to such an extent so that you would not create too much noise. </sentence><sentence id="1045">If you had...uh...a squad, which is equivalent to a British army squad of 11 men and the officer, uh...we...uh...we used to have different squads going to different areas. </sentence><sentence id="1046">And...uh.... also to make a mock attacking, attacking Yeeheim_ because we expected there wwould be problems as...as... as the kibbutz would be...be put in there. </sentence><sentence id="1047">And there were many problems. </sentence><sentence id="1048">They were...they were attacked many times. </sentence><sentence id="1049">But...uh...obviously, the attacks could not come from the __ because there was no shape, or form that as you were climbing this...this...this high mountain, big so to speak...uh...you always made noise, no matter how careful you are. </sentence><sentence id="1050">You could hear it. </sentence><sentence id="1051">You could hear it way a way before you were...uh...inside. </sentence><sentence id="1052">They could hear the noise already. </sentence><sentence id="1053">So basically that's what happened in...the __. </sentence><sentence id="1054">And from there, of course...uh...we...uh...(clearing throat) ...uh...there was a convoy where I lost my...my very best friends. </sentence><sentence id="1055">I used to live at the time...shortly before that I used to live with a family by the name of Shinerman. </sentence><sentence id="1056">And...uh...there was two boys and a girl. </sentence><sentence id="1057">Moses, Alisa, and Salome Shinerman. </sentence><sentence id="1058">And...uh... There was a convoy at one time. </sentence><sentence id="1059">an armed convoy...that's when the conflicts already had started in 19...uh...beginning of 48...uh...that...uh... they took...it was a bus and several trucks, and a pickup truck. </sentence><sentence id="1060">The pickup truck had a...had a device like in V shape that had a wheel and this device would be lowered to the road and it would push any any stones that the Arabs used to block because they used to block the...the roads all the time. </sentence><sentence id="1061">It was very easy to do. </sentence><sentence id="1062">You throw in a few large rocks and no car can by. </sentence><sentence id="1063">Uh...Interesting enough, the road between Nahariyya and Nefriam...uh...about...for about 5 miles was a zig zag, very zigzaggy. </sentence><sentence id="1064">And...uh...the Arabs used to call it the road of backshis. </sentence><sentence id="1065">The...uh...backshis is an Arabic word for tipping. </sentence><sentence id="1066">And the reason being that...uh...way back before I even came to Palestine, the...uh...when the British mandate were building the road...that particular road... uh...which was quite parallel to the...the Lebanese border so to speak...uh...every Arab sheik that had orange or citrus groves or lemon groves...by paying the British backshis...the would make the road came to their gates, so they could come with the trucks and as a result the road went like this. </sentence><sentence id="1067">That...that's a fact. </sentence><sentence id="1068">And...uh...so as the _ came about, and I can tell you the precise date and the precise hour was March 23rd, 1948 at 20 til 3 in the afternoon. </sentence><sentence id="1069">Uh... There were brutally attacked by...by the arm of , the known...uh...Arab liberator of Palestine so to speak. </sentence><sentence id="1070">And he was very...very smart man, and he was able to illude the Israeli army...uh...at the time...uh...by running  away through a...his own __ road that he made to the Western Galilee. </sentence><sentence id="1071">But nevertheless ....uh...the attack on the convoy to ____ was quite successful simply because there was a serious of tragedies. </sentence><sentence id="1072">Uh...Number one, the officer commanding the...uh...the convoy was...by name of...uh...uh...Ben Aame if you heard about him. </sentence><sentence id="1073">And...uh...my best friend, Moses Shinerman was a lieutenant at the time in the unit. </sentence><sentence id="1074">This was my unit. </sentence><sentence id="1075">I was spared simply because my wife was giving birth to my daughter at that...a few hours before that. </sentence><sentence id="1076">And because she was quite ill with a..-with a bone...some type of...uh... deficiency, that the doctor at the time...we did not have a hospital at that time there..he said, "Isaac, you must stay here." </sentence><sentence id="1077">And in fact he even talked to our commanding officer, that I must stay there because they expected the worst from birth. </sentence><sentence id="1078">Fortunately enough, nothing happened. </sentence><sentence id="1079">But...uh...Alisa Shiner, which was like my sister, came to see the baby at...before she left even to the convoy. </sentence><sentence id="1080">And...uh...I said, "Gee, I wish I could go, but the doctor did not allow me to go." </sentence><sentence id="1081">I had to stay there. </sentence><sentence id="1082">So the convoy left...uh...uh...a few...1t was a few minutes after the left Nahariyya, they were all ambushed. </sentence><sentence id="1083">Because they...they ...they waited until the...the...uh...last truck had passed this zig zag and then they started to put some rocks and they put some rocks at the other end of the zig zag so that they first car unbeknown to them was able...was able to break the barricade. </sentence><sentence id="1084">The second car in line was the bus. </sentence><sentence id="1085">The bus had armor. </sentence><sentence id="1086">The Israeli, at the time, they put armor and they welded these heavy metal plates in the cabin so that the driver would not be hurt. </sentence><sentence id="1087">Unfortunately, as the driver of the bus was trying to turn around, they threw apparently some of a molotov cocktail. </sentence><sentence id="1088">And both of the tires were shot so the truck then became paralyzed in...in closing the road. </sentence><sentence id="1089">So all the other 6 or 7 other trucks...they were behind them...okay...we...we felt the same...the same thing. </sentence><sentence id="1090">They couldn't move. </sentence><sentence id="1091">And as a result the...uh...the people were given the word apparently to...uh...save yourself. </sentence><sentence id="1092">And... uh...very, very few were to...to survive this incident. </sentence><sentence id="1093">Uh...they were able to escape by hiding on the water that flows from the Western Galilee to Nahariyya to the ocean...to the Atlantic Ocean to the Mediterranean. </sentence><sentence id="1094">There was a little bit creek, and they were able to survive by hiding there because in the meantime it was beginning to be dark, you see. </sentence><sentence id="1095">Had the convoy had left earlier although it was 20 in the afternoon, 20 to 3...uh...March...uh...uh...it wasn't quite full summer yet. </sentence><sentence id="1096">And...uh...they survived by staying there in the dark, and maneuvering. </sentence><sentence id="1097">Some of them arrived in Nahariyya and they...what...the next thing what happened was the British mandate was...the army was and the police were still at the time in Palestine, they did not allow the Haganah to...whoever the forces that we wanted to go out and try to help, but they would not allow it. </sentence><sentence id="1098">Could not live Nahariyya. </sentence><sentence id="1099">And it was one of the greatest disasters that we suffered...uh...in...uh...in the Haifaam...the convoy to Haifaam. </sentence><sentence id="1100">Uh...We lost 40...49...1 believe 49 members. </sentence><sentence id="1101">But then there was an action that...uh..some...some said in Israel later on there was a...uh...an action from the Haganah to make up for the convoy to Haifaam. </sentence><sentence id="1102">And what happened was one of the Israeli telephone operators caught up or intercepted a message coming from the Lebanese border that there was a convoy coming in with...at the time if you remember the British...the British had the Arab Legion in Palestine as well. </sentence><sentence id="1103">And the Arab Legion had some stations in the Mount Cumberland Haifa, if you remember. </sentence><sentence id="1104">They had some...so the...the Israeli intelligence was able to find out...the Haganah...that there was a convoy coming in from Lebanon full of arms and ammunitions for the Arabs. </sentence><sentence id="1105">Let me tell you, that I saw  personally. </sentence><sentence id="1106">And I have never seen a thing like this in my life. </sentence><sentence id="1107">For several days, the entire all the houses along the main road Haifa Beirut were emptied. </sentence><sentence id="1108">Now, the Arabs, of course, didn't know that. </sentence><sentence id="1109">And there were several members of the Haganah and the PALMA waiting in hiding because they...they knew that the convoy was coming but they did know when exactly...the precise time. </sentence><sentence id="1110">And...uh...by sheer coincidence, I was not involved in...in any of those actions at the time, I just happened to come to ____ with a truck which I is I...] used to bring food and all kinds of things from Haifa to Nahariyya during this period. </sentence><sentence id="1111">And I just had arrived barely in Kavathim... was a big, big circle. </sentence><sentence id="1112">And all of a sudden, all Hell broke loose. </sentence><sentence id="1113">This convoy had come in with the arms at the other end on the north side of Kayat...uh... Kayathim...Kayat valley. </sentence><sentence id="1114">And...uh...of course, it appears that not just there was several...uh...private cars, automobiles, sedans, and there was some Araban Legion trucks. </sentence><sentence id="1115">And apparently each one of them had some sort of dynamite in it. </sentence><sentence id="1116">Not only did they have some dynamite in it, they also had some officers of the...uh...the Arab Legion in it. </sentence><sentence id="1117">So the result was, it was just...uh...very tragic for the...for the convoy, because...uh...no one came out of it alive. </sentence><sentence id="1118">Not a single person! </sentence><sentence id="1119">But what I saw and that I'll never forget in my life, for as long as I live. </sentence><sentence id="1120">The British police and the British army...of course, they immediately surrounded...closed the roads. </sentence><sentence id="1121">Okay? </sentence><sentence id="1122">And...uh...you could smell the fire. </sentence><sentence id="1123">You could smell bodies burning. </sentence><sentence id="1124">You could see the fires because we were right there. </sentence><sentence id="1125">Okay? </sentence><sentence id="1126">But I'll never forget in my life is when the British...when all this action disappeared...several Israelis were also actually hurt because one young man from the Haganah, he just went the head of that truck and he then became...he received the highest medal from the Israeli army because he was the one who really went to the middle of the road and just stopped that truck. </sentence><sentence id="1127">He just shot everybody...whatever the truck as the truck was coming to him, and he himself in turn was blown up, and his face...uh...I can't remember his name...they had all the plastic operations and a year, etc., </sentence><sentence id="1128">etc., </sentence><sentence id="1129">and he was for a longest time hospitalized. </sentence><sentence id="1130">But the point is...1 wanted to make, when I saw the British officers, British police with....uh...portable...uh...what do you call this...uh...when you put somebody...it's made of canvas, you know. </sentence></p></dialogue>
