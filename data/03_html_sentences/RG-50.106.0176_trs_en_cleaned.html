<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="167">A: We lived in the town and in fact my mother said that we even had a German officer who was one of the nice ones at that time, quartered in our house, because what they used to do is to put the officers into people's homes, very often. </sentence><sentence id="168">And she said he was quite sympathetic to the Jews, but was removed at some -- at some point. </sentence><sentence id="169">My father and my Uncle Ruvin, when -- when rumors started to come up that bad things -- that there was a threat -- rumors of threat were in the air, and my father and his -- and -- and my Uncle Ruvin actually started to moo -- to try to get into Russia and then maybe bring the families with them. </sentence><sentence id="170">But a lot of Jews were going east to Russia, even though they knew it was no picnic and they'd wind up in Siberia very often. </sentence><sentence id="171">But for some reason they couldn't get in and they were turned back and they came back into town and then eventually, when the Germans began to round up all able-bodied men and take them away for labor, and we never heard from them again. </sentence><sentence id="172">And -- and my mother variously said -- I still don't know and I still want to do some research in the newly opened ar-archives in Germany that he -- they were killed in Chelmno in the extermination camp, or whatever. </sentence><sentence id="173">But meanwhile we were left behind in the town and when -- one day -- and I don't remember, I wish my mother were around now to fill in the gaps, we -- she got wind that there was going to be some action against the Jews. </sentence><sentence id="174">So my mother alerted her brothers and sisters -- and sister and -- and my grandmother, and we left and ran away to the woods surrounding that town. </sentence><sentence id="175">And we remained -- that was the beginning of our period in the forests of the Ukraine, which lasted for a bit over two years, living -- if you've seen the movie "Defiance", living in holes in the ground or in huts made out of branches, but also moving around. </sentence><sentence id="176">People think it was a stationary, you s -- you settled down in one place, no, you didn't settle down in one place, you moved to -- from dangerous places to safer places. </sentence><sentence id="177">And you're constantly -- were on the lookout. </sentence><sentence id="178">So going through that kind of, you know, typical stuff, looking for food from surrounding villages or peasants. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="192">Q: Did your mother ever tell you who was in the group? </sentence><sentence id="193">Were there other children? </sentence><sentence id="194">Were you the only child? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="198">A: Well initially we -- when we left it was just our family unit. </sentence><sentence id="199">It was my mother's two brothers and their families, my aunt, who was a single woman. </sentence><sentence id="200">My Aunt Rachel was single, and my -- </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="201">Q: So you were not part of a partisan group or anything? </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="202">A: Not initially. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="204">Q: Not initially. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="206">A: But eventually what happened was we were in -- </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="207">Q: Let's talk about initially first. </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="208">A: Well initially -- the first night I can tell you my mother claims th -- because she -- they ran away, she said she didn't even have time to take wa -- it was already tow -- it's towards fall, I believe, getting close to winter and she didn't take any clothing for me. </sentence><sentence id="209">So come nighttime, you know, I was crying and you know, and she was ready to go back and she started to go back and she met a peasant along the way who said, where you going? </sentence><sentence id="210">And she said, we're going back to Nisregin, he said, the town's been burnt down. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="214">Q: Are we talking about fall of "41? </sentence><sentence id="215">Is that what you -- </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="216">A: Probably, is my hunch. </sentence><sentence id="217">But I -- you know, I -- I -- </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="218">Q: Yeah. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="220">A: I'm not keen on the dates. </sentence><sentence id="221">In any case, when we -- when we ran -- so she turned back and we stayed in the forests, you know, and we continued in our wanderings, so we'd meet up with other groups, and what happened was that people find each other. </sentence><sentence id="222">So there was other stragglers, other civilians, Jews, but in our peregrinations we also wound up meeting with partisan groups eventually, sometimes hostile and sometimes friendly. </sentence><sentence id="223">Sometimes -- we didn't have Jewish partisan groups like you -- you had sometimes further north in Lithuania, per se, but we met up with a number of different non-Jewish partisan groups. </sentence><sentence id="224">And they weren't all friendly. </sentence><sentence id="225">And -- but I do begin to remember -- you know, it's hard to distinguish sometimes what you've dreamed and what stories you've integrated from other people. </sentence><sentence id="226">I do begin to remember the lib -- the liberation, when the Russians came in and -- and -- and thereafter. </sentence><sentence id="227">I was very sick in the forest, and this I was told by my mother. </sentence><sentence id="228">I developed -- because I was an infant, I was what, less than two years old when the war -- and I developed diphtheria and I was close to death, I mean, I -- s - - you know, so my mother took me to a field hospital, miles away, where the Russians treated -- th-the partisans and the military had a field hospital and she wanted them to treat me and -- and the officer in charge says look at all the people, we have soldiers in there and I don't have time for -- for you. </sentence><sentence id="229">So she took me back and -- to our encampment and through some -- I forget what she told me, they -- in e -- in essence they gave me what would today be considered a vaporizer treatment and it seemed to work, some remedy that they found, and I survived. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="241">Q: Are there any other -- I hate to used the word anecdotes, but stories that your mother told you about that time, before you remembered. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="243">A: Y-Yeah, I mean, she would tell me about what it was like to go and search for food, for example, and how dangerous that was. </sentence><sentence id="244">And some of the people, because you would -- you would have to leave -- you were in the forest. </sentence><sentence id="245">The forest was both safety, but it was also deprivation. </sentence><sentence id="246">Safety in the sense that organized armies don't go into forests. </sentence><sentence id="247">Not out of fear, but you know, it's -- you -- you just don't. </sentence><sentence id="248">I mean, you don't bring in tanks and armor and what have you into forests. </sentence><sentence id="249">So you -- you -- so people can hide in a forest. </sentence><sentence id="250">On the other hand, you're deprived of food and y-you know, we weren't hunters, you know what I mean, it's not like -- yeah, I mean people ate -- you know, they ate berries or they ate mushrooms of they f -- whatever they found. </sentence><sentence id="251">But they would also go out, leave the forest and go to some peasants that they knew or some farmer, because the woods were still in the area and we wa -- we had not yet wandered far enough into it, so you were able to leave and go and get some food. </sentence><sentence id="252">But of course that presupposed that the -- th-the peasant you were going to was not going to sell you out and was not going to inform the Germans that you were there. </sentence><sentence id="253">So it was fraught with danger and of course some of the people that they knew, other Jews, were killed on these missions. </sentence><sentence id="254">So she would tell me about these things. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="268">Q: How would you describe your mother? </sentence><sentence id="269">She sounds like a very strong woman to have gone through this, and kept you alive. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="272">A: She was -- I do [indecipherable] describe her, an-and the way I have described her is she was great in a crisis, but she was not so great in dealing with normal day to day life. </sentence><sentence id="273">And I really mean that. </sentence><sentence id="274">And there are certain people who, when they face a crisis can galvanize and mobilize all their -- you know, their -- their resources, psychological, physical etcetera and move into gear. </sentence><sentence id="275">And there are others who are paralyzed by it. </sentence><sentence id="276">And she was able to do that. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="282">Q: Well, here she was a young woman in her 20's -- </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="283">A: She was a young -- </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="284">Q: -- with a baby. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="286">A: That's right, a young woman with a baby. </sentence><sentence id="287">And it's something that -- it wasn't until I was much older that I was able to appreciate what it took. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="290">Q: All right, now let's move up to your [indecipherable] </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="291">A: Yeah. </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="292">Q: -- and what -- what you said your first memory in [indecipherable] before -- </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="293">A: My first memory was actually being liberated. </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="294">Q: Well, describe that, what your memory -- </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="295">A: Oh, there's another anecdote, you asked for anecdotal information. </sentence><sentence id="296">I actually had my first    </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="299"> taste of alcohol when I was a child in the forest, because one of the groups, the -- this again my mother told me, not that I remember it, one of the partisan groups we met up with -- and -- and the relation with the partisan group, even if they were unfriendly, they were like protectors, you know, so you wanted -- civilians wanted to be near partisans. </sentence><sentence id="300">On the other hand, you were also -- sometimes feared them. </sentence><sentence id="301">This group was not well disposed to Jews apparently, but they took a liking to me because I was a cute -- according to my mother, a cute child. </sentence><sentence id="302">So they took me -- they would take me away. </sentence><sentence id="303">They would ad -- literally take me away from her and take me to their camp, a military camp and there taught me how to drink booze. </sentence><sentence id="304">So -- but my own memory that I can, you know, say this, I remember this, was actually riding out of the forest on an ox drawn cart heaped with whatever belongings people had. </sentence><sentence id="305">So when you see those films of refugees, you know, and in that's -- you know, I remember sitting on top of that cart and being afraid I'd fall down. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="313">Q: Did you have any idea, being a toddler at the time, what was happening? </sentence><sentence id="314">Was it something good, was it something scary? </sentence><sentence id="315">You know, do you remember being scared or do you remember being excited? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="319">A: No, probably scared. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="321">Q: Yeah, because you were in the car -- </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="322">A: I -- I would say that the -- the -- at that time, you know, there were, a little bit later -- because the war was still going on. </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="323">Q: Mm-hm. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="325">A: And we were, in our part of western Ukraine, because don't forget, the -- the geography is -- I mean, not -- </sentence></p><p><sentence id="326"> [interruption] Excuse me, does anybody want tea or anything? </sentence><sentence id="327">No? </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="328">A: Anyway, when we were liberated, this was only the beginning of the westward march in a sense, not -- not quite the beginning, but it -- I would say the -- the war still had a long ways to go. </sentence><sentence id="329">But our area was clear, but it doesn't mean the war stopped, we still experienced air -- air raids, for example, constantly the Germans would come over and bomb, and I remember those. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="332">Q: What were they like? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="334">A: So we -- we were -- </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="335">Q: Can you describe -- </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="336">A: When we were liberated -- yeah, I can -- I -- I can describe it. </sentence><sentence id="337">I remember running with my mother into -- we think of air raid shelters as being something under a building and you know, room, and you sit there and -- you know. </sentence><sentence id="338">Poor lighting maybe, but you -- you know, you're comfortable inside some place. </sentence><sentence id="339">The air raid shelters very often that the Russians or Ukrainians had were simply ditches dug around the perimeter of the town or sometimes in the town, but sometimes on the outskirts of the town, because they knew they would bomb in the town. </sentence><sentence id="340">So they would dig a ditch -- ditches on the outskirts of the town and when the bomb -- when the sky was lit up by these lights, the planes would come over and the search lights would go up, you know, to look for the planes and stuff, you would be running, the civilians would be running to the outskirts of town to these ditches and would, you know, jump in them and you'd sit there, you know, hoping they wouldn't have a stray bomb hit you on the head, and seeing these planes, you got, you know, all the stuff going on around you. </sentence><sentence id="341">So I do remember that. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1157">Q: Right. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1159">A: The Americans were heroes, but the Americans were also sometimes seen as not being tough enough on the Germans, an -- oddly. </sentence><sentence id="1160">So the stuff, if you read history now, that -- you know, th- the Russians did some terrible, brutal things when they went west and we all -- we know that. </sentence><sentence id="1161">I just got finished reading a book not long ago about the -- you know, the battle of -- of Berlin. </sentence><sentence id="1162">And so they did some awful things. </sentence><sentence id="1163">But don't forget, if you're a victim of Nazism, you want revenge. </sentence><sentence id="1164">So war means some terrible things are done on all sides, so you mean as a child I certainly was aware of Hitler as the -- you know, the ultimate evil to beset the Jewish people, but I was also aware, from what my mother told me about, that he was only the latest and greatest if you will, in a long line of people as -- as the Hagadah says, in every generation somebody rises against us to destroy us. </sentence><sentence id="1165">So I was aware of that. </sentence><sentence id="1166">I was also -- there was something else that -- that maybe my -- when you don't know who your father is or was, you can grow up with -- you hear stories. </sentence><sentence id="1167">And my mother helped in some ways to give me this mythic vision of my father. </sentence><sentence id="1168">What kind of man he was or would have been, I have no idea. </sentence><sentence id="1169">I can speculate about it because I knew some -- you know. </sentence><sentence id="1170">And -- and -- and -- and -- and on my father's side, I mean sadly, of the family there was almost nobody left that I could even say, well he would have been like this, or like this guy, or somebody else. </sentence><sentence id="1171">My father's side there were only two relatives left that I met. </sentence><sentence id="1172">One in the United States, the one who actually brought us over, who was his -- his -- my father's uncle, my great uncle and his sister in Brazil. </sentence><sentence id="1173">I never even knew what my father looked like until my aunt -- great aunt in Brazil sent us a photo. </sentence><sentence id="1174">So yeah, I mean, you grow up with a child's perception of all these -- these things, but -- but I think was also fairly grounded in reality. </sentence></p></dialogue>
