<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="42">Q: Did you know of being Jewish? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="44">A: Yes, I knew I was Jewish. </sentence><sentence id="45">But uh my family was a family of non-practicing Jews. </sentence><sentence id="46">We were never very religious and therefore I was not brought in brought up in that way. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="50">Q: What do you recall of the Germans coming to your town, and how did that change your life? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="52">A: Well, actually I didn't actually see the German soldiers come into the town. </sentence><sentence id="53">The way our life changed was that uh in late August of 1944, when there was a time of Slovak national uprising, my father was notified somehow by his friends that the situation is becoming more dangerous for Jewish people, and he was uh advised to leave the city and leave the school. </sentence><sentence id="54">Uh there was a small agricultural uh farm associated with the college where my father used to teach, and he was able to steal a horse and a cart, and he put the whole family on this with very few belongings and we went to one of his former acquaintances who was a farmer and who used to come to my father for advice and they somehow became friendly and my father considered this to be a safe place to hide, at least in the beginning. </sentence><sentence id="55">And this farmer, I don't recall his name, but this farmer had he had again some other friends, farmers further in the country, and that's where we were directed. </sentence><sentence id="56">I don't really recall how we got there but this was in a small village called Klenowitz. </sentence><sentence id="57">The farmers in the in the village of Klenowitz used to operate in such a way that their family homes were in the village but their their farms, their fields, their animals, were further in the mountains, and they had a second home there where they used to stay during the summer when they had to work in the fields. </sentence><sentence id="58">Now we, the family of five now - my grandparents from my father's side and the three of us - went to one of these farmers with the family of Pavel Vancik and his brother Andrei Vancik. </sentence><sentence id="59">My father, my mother and myself, we stayed with the family of Pavel and my grandparents stayed on another hill with the family of Andrei Vancik. </sentence><sentence id="60">We spent most of the time from September until, from September 1944 until uh April 1945 with these families, and we only in...only occasionally had to leave when it was more dangerous, it would be more dangerous for us to stay with the family. </sentence><sentence id="61">During those times we had to leave, we were helped by the family, Vancik family who took us further to the mountains where they knew some lumberjacks who had their huts there, and uh it was considered more more safe and uh more difficult to access by the Germans. </sentence><sentence id="62">I remember one occasion when we stayed in this hut which was situated very close to a nearby road that a column of German cars, army cars loaded with German soldiers and pulling some other military equipment came close to this to this hut and uh they were attacked by a group of three partisans. </sentence><sentence id="63">There was a short exchange of bullets and uh it ended up by killing these three uh partisans. </sentence><sentence id="64">I remember that uh when this all ended we we went to see these these dead bodies and the adults who were in our group actually buried these bodies very close by. </sentence><sentence id="65">Also, uh when this shooting ended, the Germans decided not to go any further into the mountains and uh they were ready to leave, but the road was very narrow and they had to turn this uh equipment and also the cars - there was one cannon which had to be turned, and uh during this process there were few minutes that the cannon pointed actually at the hut where we all stayed. </sentence><sentence id="66">There were family, families, maybe three or four families, where there were also adults and children, and out of desperation I believe, the adults asked all the kids to line up in front of this small hut. </sentence><sentence id="67">Probably they wanted to make it pretty obvious that there are children there and wanted somehow to prevent the Germans somehow from from attacking us. </sentence><sentence id="68">Well, this probably worked because the Germans didn't actually shoot at us. </sentence><sentence id="69">They turned and then they left. </sentence><sentence id="70">But it was very dramatic. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="91">Q: What are your recollections of your life in hiding? </sentence><sentence id="92">What was what was the house like? </sentence><sentence id="93">How did you eat? </sentence><sentence id="94">What what was your daily life like? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="99">A: Well, this family, Andrei Vancik family and Pavel Vancik family, they the adults were about of the same age as my parents and they had kids. </sentence><sentence id="100">Uh I remember that there were some boys and some girls, but we were about the same age, so we spent our days in a in a very common way as probably any other families would would spend. </sentence><sentence id="101">Occasionally my father had to leave because there was some news uh coming from the village that Germans were about to go to the mountains to look for partisans, and at that time it would be dangerous for any man to be found because they would be uh either sent to labor camps or if they were they would be found that they are Jewish then obviously they would be either shot on the spot or would be send to concentration camps. </sentence><sentence id="102">In this way actually uh my cousin's father was shot in in front of his mother's and his own eyes because they were hiding somewhere and were caught by by Germans and he as a man found being Jewish was shot on the spot, and uh my cousin and my his mother was sent to Theresienstadt to the concentration camp, so you know in order for this not to happen to us, my father always left somewhere when we were notified that the Germans were coming. </sentence><sentence id="103">I remember one one occasion like this when I remember there was a heavy snow before, night night before, and uh he left to hide himself in the snow in the in the forest and when he came back several hours later, he was almost completely frozen. </sentence><sentence id="104">We had to somehow tub his uh body and uh try to somehow revive him. </sentence><sentence id="105">He must have had very a very strong constitution because I don't remember his getting sick or anything but I know that it was it was terrible. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="114">Q: Did you have contact with other villagers? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="116">A: Well, yes. </sentence><sentence id="117">As a matter of fact uh it was a large family, these Vancik people people. </sentence><sentence id="118">We came into direct contact also with some other members of the family but I don't recall our going down to the village actually. </sentence><sentence id="119">We stayed most of most of the time in these mountains, so there was not much much contact with other people but some members of his family, of family, Vancik family occasionally showed up and we spent some time with them, but well there was not much social life. </sentence><sentence id="120">I can tell you that. ( </sentence><sentence id="121">Pause) </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="128">Q: What else do you recall about hiding? ( </sentence><sentence id="129">Pause) Do you remember any particular person especially who influenced you during that time? ( </sentence><sentence id="130">Pause) </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="134">A: I don't seem don't seem to recall anything. ( </sentence><sentence id="135">Pause) </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="144">A: You mean after the war? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="146">Q: Yes, after after, right. </sentence><sentence id="147">What was the liberation like? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="150">A: We were liberated in uh in 1945 uh in the Spring by the Russian Army; and I remember that uh with this army of Russians also a lot of Romanian troops came. </sentence><sentence id="151">They were probably supporting the Russians after...after the Romanian government uh turned against the Russians, uh against the Germans because it was pretty obvious that obvious and also convenient because uh it was obvious that the Germans are going to loose the war. </sentence><sentence id="152">After, right after the liberation, my father got a job with the new minin...newly formed Ministry of Agriculture and we left Klenowitz to KoSice. </sentence><sentence id="153">The first Czechoslovak government was set up there. </sentence><sentence id="154">And from Ko'ice, as the government moved to the city of Bratislava, we moved to Bratislava. </sentence><sentence id="155">And that's where I actually got all my education, and I lived there until 1981. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="163">Q: What was your life like in Bratislava as a Jew after the war? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="165">A: Uh, well, I...as I mentioned before, I have not been brought up in a religious way. </sentence><sentence id="166">We were non-practicing. </sentence><sentence id="167">Uh my father was an idealist and a naive person in a way, because he believed that assimilation will help him avoid anti-Semitism. </sentence><sentence id="168">And it may have worked to a certain point. </sentence><sentence id="169">Uh I remember that some of his older documents are still carrying his original name, Kohn, and some early documents like his uh wedding papers already carry his name, Kovac. </sentence><sentence id="170">Uh we have never belonged to any congregation, simply because we didn't want to be conspicuous. </sentence><sentence id="171">And I actually don't seem to recall anybody of the family going to a synagogue, ever - except maybe when some friends had a wedding there or that was probably the only time. </sentence><sentence id="172">When I remember I went to the one and only uh working synagogue in Bratislava. </sentence><sentence id="173">The other synagogue which was in Bratislava, a very old beautiful building, was never operating as far as I remember. </sentence><sentence id="174">It was used as a as a store room for something and later it was also torn down when there was a construction of the new bridge in the city of Bratislava. </sentence><sentence id="175">Somehow that seemed to be the best place to build a new bridge so that the synagogue could be torn down. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="187">Q: How did you go on with your education at this point? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="189">A: Well, I attended my my basic education I attended in public schools and uh later I was admitted to the university, the technical university in Bratislava and I don't seem to recall suffering much from anti-Semitism until after I was out of school. </sentence><sentence id="190">It could be because of the overall atmosphere was not such that it was uh good for those who would want to express their anti-Semitism to really do so. </sentence><sentence id="191">All simply because I didn't advertise for myself as being Jewish. </sentence><sentence id="192">But somehow it works in such a way that even though I don't know how, everybody finds out about you. </sentence><sentence id="193">And whenever it's convenient, they let you know that you are different. </sentence><sentence id="194">This happened to me during my later years when I was already employed. </sentence><sentence id="195">If there was things which I was not allowed to do or were forbidden for me to do, then the explanation was uh indirectly made in such a way that I am different than everybody else. </sentence><sentence id="196">They didn't really call me names, but it was pretty obvious what the reason was that I couldn't do this or that. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="205">Q: What was your field? </sentence><sentence id="206">What did you study and how did you proceed in your career? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="209">A: I finished...I got a degree, a Master's Degree, in Chemistry from technical university in Bratislava. </sentence><sentence id="210">After finishing my education there, I 1 went to to serve in the army for one year, and after that I entered the graduate school of Slovak Academy of Sciences to work on my thesis, on my Ph.D. thesis. </sentence><sentence id="211">After that I got a job with Slovak Academy of Sciences and from there also I was able to come to the United States for fifteen months as a post-doctoral fellow to work for the Department of Biochemistry at Purdue University in Lafayette, Indiana. </sentence><sentence id="212">I spent uh fifteen months there, and uh ironically I went back to Czechoslovakia in December 1968. </sentence><sentence id="213">That is after the August occupation by the Russians. </sentence><sentence id="214">Uh of course uh coming back was a big disappointment for me then. </sentence><sentence id="215">What the country looked like and how the life changed and everything, and it took me thirteen years to eventually get an exit visa to visit some relatives in Austria and that was when I made my decision to eventually immigrate to the United States. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="224">Q: When did you get married, and uh was Judaism a factor in your marriage? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="226">A: Absolutely not. </sentence><sentence id="227">Uh I got married in 1962. </sentence><sentence id="228">The...the marriage ceremony was a was a civil ceremony, neither ...neither Jewish or Catholic or anything. </sentence><sentence id="229">And uh actually we have brought up our son in a very similar, non-religious way. </sentence><sentence id="230">He knows who he is, what his heritage is, but uh we have never emphasized the religion very much. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="236">Q: When and how did you come to the United States? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="238">A: We came in 1981, in September. </sentence><sentence id="239">We didn't really jump the fence, but in a way we escaped anyway. </sentence><sentence id="240">Uh we got permission to visit my wife's sisters who happened to live in Vienna, Austria. </sentence><sentence id="241">And uh we simply packed whatever we could and left everything else behind. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="246">Q: And then from Vienna you came here? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="248">A: From Vienna, we were we immediately as we arrived in Vienna, we first uh tried to, I tried to get a job either in Austria or in Switzerland. </sentence><sentence id="249">This didn't work out because 1981 was a very bad year economically both in the United States and in Europe, and since I was in this country before, that was my next choice. </sentence><sentence id="250">I have a distant cousin in California, and uh with his sponsorship it was rather easy uh to get here within a relatively short time. </sentence><sentence id="251">We first went to HIAS in Vienna, and with their help we were able to take care of the formalities in a rather uneventful way. </sentence><sentence id="252">It took us only six weeks and we had our visas and were flown to the United States. </sentence><sentence id="253">I remember that with my with my cousin's friend uh help it took me only two weeks to get a job. </sentence><sentence id="254">It was not the best job, but it was a job and I could start working again as a chemist. </sentence><sentence id="255">I had a job with a small chemical company in Torrence, California. </sentence><sentence id="256">It was a very good experience for me, and this is how I first encountered private industry in this country. </sentence><sentence id="257">But uh | always wanted to work in research because this is how I was trained. </sentence><sentence id="258">And uh luckily I managed to obtain this position at the National Institutes of Health; first as a visiting scientist, and later I was tenured. </sentence><sentence id="259">We became citizens of the United States in 1986. </sentence><sentence id="260">We applied five years to the day when we landed in this country, and it took about three or four months to get a citizenship then. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="274">Q: Is there anything else you would like to tell us about your experiences during the Nazi era? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="276">A: Well, to make these things a little bit easier to understand why...why uh it happened only in 1944 that we had to leave our homes, probably it would be good to mention that, in a way, we owe our survival until "44... It's...it's an irony, but we owe it to the Munich Pact. </sentence><sentence id="277">Because during that time - I mean, this was the...this was the way for the Slovaks to get their autonomy. </sentence><sentence id="278">When Czechoslovak Republic was first cut into pieces, then the eastern part of the country became an independent Slovak state; and this is what the Slovaks always wanted. </sentence><sentence id="279">They always felt oppressed by either Hungarians or the Austrians. </sentence><sentence id="280">And throughout several hundred years, they have never been independent. </sentence><sentence id="281">And uh they accepted, actually, this tragedy--the Munich Pact-- because this gave them the the opportunity to become independent. </sentence><sentence id="282">Hitler actually used Slovak state as a showcase. </sentence><sentence id="283">He showed the rest of the world that a country which is actually under their command can be prosperous. </sentence><sentence id="284">And many educated people of Jewish origin were able to survive, because they were sort of indispensable. </sentence><sentence id="285">So they were exempt from, for example, wearing their David Stars-- which was normally an obligation for everybody who was Jewish. </sentence><sentence id="286">I was able to attend public kindergarten. </sentence><sentence id="287">My father was able to keep his job until 1944--September. </sentence><sentence id="288">Until after the Slovak National Uprising, when the things became more dangerous. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="303">Q: And you had mentioned something about Jews fighting in the Slovak...the Slovak Army, even. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="305">A: Well, this was another privilege sort of which the citizens of Slovakia of Jewish origin were granted, to serve in Slovak Army against the Russians. </sentence><sentence id="306">Actually my uncle, my father's brother, younger brother, died on the Russian front as a member of Slovak Army. </sentence><sentence id="307">This is how the Germans wanted to show the rest of the world that they are treating everybody equal in that country. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="311">Q: Thank you very much for the interesting story. </sentence></p></dialogue>
