<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="23">Q: The date is Sunday March 29, 1992. </sentence><sentence id="24">We're speaking with Dr. Liane Reif-Lehrer about her parents. </sentence><sentence id="25">What can you tell us, let's start with your mother, is that all right? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="29">A: Okay. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="31">Q: Can you tell us her name, her date of birth, her place of birth, anything you know about her childhood, anything at all? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="33">A: Okay. </sentence><sentence id="34">My mother's name was Klara Gottfried Reif. </sentence><sentence id="35">G-o-t-t-f-r-i-e-d,. </sentence><sentence id="36">She was born in a small town in Poland, not far from Lemberg which is now called Lvov. </sentence><sentence id="37">She was apparently somewhat of a rambunctious young lady. </sentence><sentence id="38">She often said that she -- I guess she didn't get along with her father as well as with her mother. </sentence><sentence id="39">She liked to run around and travel and do a lot of things. </sentence><sentence id="40">She spoke several languages because when she was a child, the borders kept changing and so at one point, where she was born, was part o Austria. </sentence><sentence id="41">I think both she and my father were actually Austrian citizens because when they were born, Poland was a part of Austria, then the Russians came in. </sentence><sentence id="42">She spoke Polish, Russian, German; I think she spoke some Czechoslovakian and she might have been conversant with a couple of other languages. </sentence><sentence id="43">She always said she spoke five or seven languages, I never remember whether it's five or seven. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="55">Q: Do you know what they spoke at home? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="57">A: I think at home, they probably spoke a combination of Polish and Yiddish. </sentence><sentence id="58">Yeah, I think that was correct. </sentence><sentence id="59">My mother did a lot of traveling around. </sentence><sentence id="60">She used to go to Lemberg to have clothes made and so on. </sentence><sentence id="61">I think she went off to school at some point also. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="67">Q: Do you know what kind of school? </sentence><sentence id="68">Was it a Jewish school or a private school or a technical school? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="71">A: I don't know. </sentence><sentence id="72">No, it was definitely not a technical school and I don't really know. </sentence><sentence id="73">Ihave a feeling it might have been more like a finishing school or just some kind of general school. </sentence><sentence id="74">She definitely finished gymnasium but did not go to college but she was pretty clever. </sentence><sentence id="75">She was very, very good with numbers and she did a lot of reading. </sentence><sentence id="76">Anyway at some -- I think she was very interested when she was young in fashion and that kind of thing. </sentence><sentence id="77">At some point she went off to Vienna either for a vacation or to have clothes made, I don't know. </sentence><sentence id="78">Somehow and I don't know how, but she met my father. </sentence><sentence id="79">Ultimately they got engaged and then they got married, I think in 1925. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="89">Q: They got married in Vienna? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="91">A: They got married in Vienna, well, I'm not sure about that. </sentence><sentence id="92">I'm not sure about that, they might have gone back to Poland to get married. </sentence><sentence id="93">But anyway, they lived in Vienna after they got married. </sentence><sentence id="94">Then in 1927, my brother was born. </sentence><sentence id="95">Now my mother tells me about her life in Vienna. </sentence><sentence id="96">She said in the beginning it was kind of hard. </sentence><sentence id="97">My father had been trained as a physician and then he went back and retrained as a dentist and he opened his practice. </sentence><sentence id="98">Now one of the things my mother always told me is that we lived in Este , that's the first district in Vienna. </sentence><sentence id="99">I guess that was not such a nice -- or the nicest part of Vienna. </sentence><sentence id="100">Excuse me, the Este is where she would have liked to live She said that the reason they lived there was because my father's office was in our house and that's where he saw patients. </sentence><sentence id="101">It was for reasons of the business that we lived there. </sentence><sentence id="102">We lived actually, I guess, right overlooking the Danube. </sentence><sentence id="103">So in the early years, she said things were difficult and she helped my father. </sentence><sentence id="104">She would do things like answer the phone and maybe help prep patients and various other things. </sentence><sentence id="105">I guess my father did pretty well fairly quickly and so things kind of perked up. </sentence><sentence id="106">I think things were quite comfortable. </sentence><sentence id="107">We had -- I know there were about six people who used to come and go in terms of "servants." </sentence><sentence id="108">There was a cook who did our meals. </sentence><sentence id="109">My brother and I each had a governess when we were kids. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="129">Q: Each? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="131"> A Yeah, we are very far apart so it wasn't concurrent. </sentence><sentence id="132">There were one or two women who came in to do laundry. </sentence><sentence id="133">You know in those days everything was a big deal. </sentence><sentence id="134">I mean coming in to do the laundry was taking the sheets and boiling them up with soap and Clorox and so on and so forth. </sentence><sentence id="135">It was kind of a big thing and then even --. </sentence><sentence id="136">We did actually have a vacuum cleaner and I personally remember that these two cleaning women used to come and they would roll up the rugs and take them up to the roof with these bamboo, oddly shaped paddles and beat the hell out of the rugs. </sentence><sentence id="137">There were these servants around and at that point I think my mother sort of became a lady of leisure. </sentence><sentence id="138">Again I don't know which of these  http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection stories are true or apocryphal but her role was to put on a white glove after the servants came and go around to make sure that they had cleaned well. </sentence><sentence id="139">I think she went and I think they did a fair amount of socializing. </sentence><sentence id="140">I think they went to the opera and they would go dancing and go to the theater. </sentence><sentence id="141">I know they went -- apparently once a week they went to play cards with this relative who actually -- the daughter lives in New York now. </sentence><sentence id="142">They must have done a lot of things like that. </sentence><sentence id="143">I think my father was a fairly serious person and my mother was probably a more -- I don't know, a more frivolous person. </sentence><sentence id="144">Actually my brother apparently didn't do very well with my mother because he was a very serious kid and he really liked my father. </sentence><sentence id="145">But he thought my mother wasted her time even when he was very little. </sentence><sentence id="146">Then --. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="165">Q: Can we back up just a little? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="167"> A Yeah go ahead. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="169">Q: Do you know about her life in Poland before she moved to Vienna? </sentence><sentence id="170">Do you know about, for example, the Jewish aspect of their life? </sentence><sentence id="171">Were they religious, were they orthodox? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="175">A: I think her parents were orthodox. </sentence><sentence id="176">I don't know that my mother really -- I mean my mother always did all the very traditional kinds of things but I'm not sure she really believed in any of that. </sentence><sentence id="177">I don't know, she certainly had some sorts of superstitions involved in Jewish religion but I have a funny feeling that she probably went along with the things. </sentence><sentence id="178">I don't think she and my father had -- we didn't have a kosher house and we --. </sentence><sentence id="179">I think they did go to services on the high holidays and things like that. </sentence><sentence id="180">I'd be curious to know whether we -- I'm sure we ate matzo on Passover but the real question is did we also eat bread? </sentence><sentence id="181">I don't know what the answer is. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="189">Q: Was it ham on matzo? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="191">A: Right, right. </sentence><sentence id="192">Well, I'm sure we ate ham. </sentence><sentence id="193">I'm absolutely sure we ate ham. </sentence><sentence id="194">We probably didn't eat bread at Passover but it was not -- I don't think it was terribly compulsive. </sentence><sentence id="195">I think it was fairly casual. </sentence><sentence id="196">I have a feeling that her father was probably not very casual and I don't know about her mother. </sentence><sentence id="197">I have a feeling that the mother was a more worldly woman and the father may have been a more sort of retiring religious kind of person. </sentence><sentence id="198">I think that my mother always felt that she was considered the black sheep. </sentence><sentence id="199">Not by her mother, but by her father, that her father didn't like her as well as he liked the other two kids. </sentence><sentence id="200">I think she thought that was because she was sort of rebellious and didn't do the things that the other kids did. </sentence><sentence id="201">Definitely, my mother's brother and sister sound like more traditional kids. </sentence><sentence id="202">They got married and they had kids and they stayed, I think, in the same town, or nearby. </sentence><sentence id="203">Here was this young chick going off to Vienna and marrying strange people. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="217">Q: Did she ever find out the exact fate of her family? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="219">A: Yeah, well, in 1946, when I would have been 12 and I remember this very dramatically. </sentence><sentence id="220">There was a blue letter that came from somebody, one of her relatives. </sentence><sentence id="221">I think it might have been this guy called, Moshe Weinhaub who went to live in Israel and whose son is in Israel and is a physician, I think. </sentence><sentence id="222">Of course, I lost contact after my mother died. </sentence><sentence id="223">I think the letter was from this guy Moshe Weinhaub. </sentence><sentence id="224">It told in very great detail what happened to all the relatives. </sentence><sentence id="225">Well, they all perished in one form or another. </sentence><sentence id="226">Now my mother's sister, that was the most dramatic thing. </sentence><sentence id="227">Apparently they forced her to watch while they threw her kids into an oven and then they shot her. </sentence><sentence id="228">That was really a horror story. </sentence><sentence id="229">I think my mother's brother and maybe the parents -- I remember him describing that a lot of people in the camp had typhoid. </sentence><sentence id="230">They purposely tried to contract typhoid and they did so they died of the typhoid. </sentence><sentence id="231">They purposely did that because they didn't want to die in what they knew was awaiting them. </sentence><sentence id="232">There were just descriptions of what happened to everybody that he knew about. </sentence><sentence id="233">I don't know whatever happened to that letter. </sentence><sentence id="234">As a matter of fact, it's really weird. </sentence><sentence id="235">This is my mother's -- those two pieces of furniture are my mother's. </sentence><sentence id="236">Since my mother died. </sentence><sentence id="237">I have not been able to find the key to this. </sentence><sentence id="238">Every once in a while, I try to get it open because I keep thinking that maybe there are some letters and things in there. </sentence><sentence id="239">I know I could probably get a locksmith to open it but I probably have mixed feelings. </sentence><sentence id="240">Part of me wants to know what's behind those little doors and part of me probably doesn't. </sentence><sentence id="241">But anyway, my mother -- I think my mother was a very, very different person after the war from what she was before. </sentence><sentence id="242">Although I can't really judge that, that's kind of a guess. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="267">Q: I made you jump. </sentence><sentence id="268">Now why don't we come back to the time that she had given birth to your brother, I guess? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="271">A: Right, 1927, April 24, 1927. </sentence><sentence id="272">My brother was apparently a very serious little boy even at age two. </sentence><sentence id="273">My mother always told stories about how when she would go for a walk with him, instead of wanting to sort of play and so on, he would want to have her read the street signs. </sentence><sentence id="274">What does that say, how do you spell that, what are the letters? </sentence><sentence id="275">And so on. </sentence><sentence id="276">That's her perception. </sentence><sentence id="277">My brother -- I have a picture of my brother sitting all dressed up with a little Lord Fauntleroy tie in a sandbox with his rear end up -- sort of off the sand so he wouldn't get himself dirty. </sentence><sentence id="278">My brother sort of tells, with some resentment, that he wasn't allowed to be a little boy because they dressed him up and he always felt he couldn't get dirty. </sentence><sentence id="279">I think there were a lot of interesting dynamics there. </sentence><sentence id="280">Then at age three, they started him on violin lessons. </sentence><sentence id="281">Somehow it didn't work out so they stopped at the advice of the teacher, I guess. </sentence><sentence id="282">Then he started again at the age five. </sentence><sentence id="283">Then it really took hold very well and he really did play the violin. </sentence><sentence id="284">If you ask him, he'll say, well you know, I'm not -- I can't really play very well. </sentence><sentence id="285">But he really plays. </sentence><sentence id="286">I mean for an amateur, he plays extremely well. </sentence><sentence id="287">Then when my father died -- well first my father got very depressed because, well, because things were obviously looking very bad in Europe. </sentence><sentence id="288">I really should back up. </sentence><sentence id="289">Starting in 1933. </sentence><sentence id="290">I think things  http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection started being politically very hairy. </sentence><sentence id="291">People had just come out of a Depression. </sentence><sentence id="292">As an aside, all my life, I was always really bothered that I might have been an accident because I'm seven and a half years younger than my brother. </sentence><sentence id="293">Subliminally that always bothered me and I never had the guts to ask anybody which in retrospect seems silly. </sentence><sentence id="294">But actually I was over forty once when I asked my brother, was I an accident? </sentence><sentence id="295">My brother said, no, absolutely not. </sentence><sentence id="296">Why did they wait so long? </sentence><sentence id="297">Because of the Depression. </sentence><sentence id="298">I was born in 1934, in November and so things were --. </sentence><sentence id="299">Now as I think back on it, it was a really dumb time to have a kid because things were not looking good. </sentence><sentence id="300">Did I send you the article I wrote for Boston Magazine? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="333">Q: You sent me one about your cousin? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="335">A: I didn't send you one from Boston Magazine? </sentence><sentence id="336">I should give that to you because that's sort of about this subject. </sentence><sentence id="337">Anyway, so then I was born, and then things started getting bad. </sentence><sentence id="338">They got worse and worse. </sentence><sentence id="339">My father and mother started talking about the possibility of going to America. </sentence><sentence id="340">Apparently my father just felt - - in 1934 my father was already forty years old, right? </sentence><sentence id="341">So his feeling was, how can I go to America? </sentence><sentence id="342">I don't know the language; I would have to retrain. </sentence><sentence id="343">We would get there and we would have nothing so it just didn't seem like a reasonable thing to do. </sentence><sentence id="344">But then in August of 1938, I think it was, my father, like everybody else, had to close because Jews were not allowed to work any more. </sentence><sentence id="345">My father got really, really, very, very depressed. </sentence><sentence id="346">My brother, I think my brother really still has and had all the time, a really tremendous resentment about my mother not handling that right. </sentence><sentence id="347">I've asked him about that and he says well, she used to say well you know you got to come out of this. </sentence><sentence id="348">You can't walk around like this. </sentence><sentence id="349">She would kind of go off then and do whatever needed to be done. </sentence><sentence id="350">I said to my brother, well what did you do? </sentence><sentence id="351">He said, well I remember standing in a dark room holding his hand, just quietly. </sentence><sentence id="352">Now that I'm at my present age and our kids are 22 and 24, I realize that it was just a very difficult situation for my mother. </sentence><sentence id="353">How, if somebody else is just very depressed all the time and you really don't know how to get the person out of it, I think after a while maybe it's kind of a survival thing. </sentence><sentence id="354">That you've got to just keep doing what are your daily things because otherwise you're going to go insane also. </sentence><sentence id="355">I don't know what was going on there but it was a really bad scenario, really very unpleasant things were happening to Jews. </sentence><sentence id="356">I'm sure that my father must have been extremely frightened. </sentence><sentence id="357">There's a woman who actually went to medical and then dental school with my father. </sentence><sentence id="358">We were always friendly with that family. </sentence><sentence id="359">For example, that woman was forced to go out and scrub the streets and things like that. </sentence><sentence id="360">All sorts of demeaning things happening and I think it must have been just a terrible, terrible time psychologically. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="387">Q: Until the time that he was forced to stop working, he worked regularly? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="389"> A Yes, I think he did work regularly. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="391">Q: Even if maybe he was beginning to be depressed or whatever? </sentence><sentence id="392">He didn't --? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="395">A: No, I don't think so. </sentence><sentence id="396">I think he got very depressed after he had to close his practice. </sentence><sentence id="397">Now I don't know that for sure, I just know that from things that I've gathered. </sentence><sentence id="398">Anyway, my mother, I think, tried to keep going about her business. </sentence><sentence id="399">Somewhere in this time span, they did decide that they would have to leave. </sentence><sentence id="400">So they went and applied for visas and passports and so on. </sentence><sentence id="401">On the morning of September 30, 1938, my father and mother actually left the house together to go pick up those passports. </sentence><sentence id="402">They picked up the passports and at about noontime, they parted to do separate chores. </sentence><sentence id="403">They were supposed to meet, I think, at the home of this cousin where they used to play cards. </sentence><sentence id="404">Apparently my father never got there. </sentence><sentence id="405">I guess at about 2:30 in the afternoon, I seem to remember somebody telling me, there was a phone call. </sentence><sentence id="406">My father had been found at the bottom of a staircase. </sentence><sentence id="407">I'm not sure whether he was already dead or whether he died either on the way to the hospital or right after he got to the hospital. </sentence><sentence id="408">But the death certificate says he died of multiple fractures including a fractured skull and lots of fractured ribs. </sentence><sentence id="409">All my life, I grew up thinking that he had thrown himself off the top floor, the fourth floor of this -- down the stairwell. </sentence><sentence id="410">There was a lot of trauma around that. </sentence><sentence id="411">My mother did not want -- so the general consensus was that he had committed suicide. </sentence><sentence id="412">My mother did not want anybody to know that and I don't understand. </sentence><sentence id="413">You know, it's funny, children don't ask the right questions all the time. </sentence><sentence id="414">I just took that on gospel and I never, ever said anything until quite recently about that. </sentence><sentence id="415">I never told it; I mean practically no one did I tell this to. </sentence><sentence id="416">When I was discussing with my brother recently, he said, well, I've never kept this a secret. </sentence><sentence id="417">Then a few years ago, when I started really thinking about this; I started thinking, well, now how do we know he committed suicide? </sentence><sentence id="418">People say you're just trying to protect yourself from this sort of thing. </sentence><sentence id="419">First of all, I don't have anything against this, I just don't. </sentence><sentence id="420">It wouldn't -- in general it wouldn't bother me now. </sentence><sentence id="421">I keep asking myself, does it bother me if he did commit suicide. </sentence><sentence id="422">I suppose in one way it doesn't bother me and in another way I think well this was sort of a shirking of your responsibility. </sentence><sentence id="423">You know you had two kids and this was not the appropriate thing to do, to leave your wife alone with these two kids. </sentence><sentence id="424">My brother's idea is that my father probably did commit suicide and that one of the reasons that he did it, aside from being depressed and aside from -- I mean people were committing suicide right and left -- was that he probably figured that a woman with two children would have a much better chance of escaping if there was no husband around. </sentence><sentence id="425">At that time, mostly it was the men who were being really harassed, initially. </sentence><sentence id="426">I don't know but now as a scientist, I sort of stop and I think, well there was nobody there to see this. </sentence><sentence id="427">All sorts of horrible things were happening to Jews, how do we know what really happened? </sentence><sentence id="428">Could he have been pushed? </sentence><sentence id="429">I think the chances are 90% that he probably did commit suicide. </sentence><sentence id="430">The other thing is that I keep thinking why would somebody with a medical profession who has access to much neater, cleaner ways of committing suicide throw himself off a stairwell. </sentence><sentence id="431">That's another reason why I think that maybe he didn't do it himself. </sentence><sentence id="432">On the other hand, I suppose that when people commit suicide they're not necessarily being totally rational. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="471">Q: Right, the way some people plan it out. </sentence><sentence id="472">This sounds like it perhaps hadn't been contemplated f or long, this specific act if it was? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="475">A: I don't know but somebody recently pointed out to me that Primo Levi who was also a scientist and also had more sophisticated means of committing suicide apparently also jumped off something or other. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="477">Q: Yes, he did. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="479">A: But anyway, the answer is I don't know what happened. </sentence><sentence id="480">When this happened, my mother was just totally devastated, just --. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="483">Q: Before we -- I hate to break your train of thought? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="485">A: No, go ahead. </sentence><sentence id="486">I don't mind. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="489">Q: Do you remember anything about her personality before this time? </sentence><sentence id="490">When you were very, very young? </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="727">A: The thing that I remember is that my mother -- my remembrance of my mother was that she was, to a large extent for years and years, in a state of -- I don't know what to call it -- in a state of somebody who's just been through a catastrophe which she had been. </sentence><sentence id="728">It's just that most people seem to recover more rapidly and she just did not recover. </sentence><sentence id="729">She recovered effectively in that she always seemed to do the right thing to get to the next step but emotionally she never recovered. </sentence><sentence id="730">So my recollection of my mother through most of these years is that she was often a very sad person, it was like a lot of sighing and just this unhappy demeanor on her face, for years. </sentence><sentence id="731">She also, in later years, some of that lifted and she could be a real fun person sometimes. </sentence><sentence id="732">It was almost weird and I couldn't even begin to go through this until very recently. </sentence><sentence id="733">But now I have a feeling that if somebody had somehow just let her or encouraged her, she could have been a really vibrant dazzling lady. </sentence><sentence id="734">Occasionally she would dance with me, not very often but occasionally. </sentence><sentence id="735">She was very good in later years like after | met Sam and we got married and everything. </sentence><sentence id="736">She was always game for anything, fly on a jet; yeah, I'll fly ona jet. </sentence><sentence id="737">She didn't have any of these hang-ups like other parents of my contemporaries. </sentence><sentence id="738">You know, they wouldn't ride an escalator. </sentence><sentence id="739">She came, even when she was sixty, she climbed with us in Yosemite but there was always this real sadness. </sentence><sentence id="740">I remember once when she was already starting to get Alzheimer's disease, she said this to me very often but this particular time I remember it very dramatically. </sentence><sentence id="741">She said, I've only had thirteen good years in my whole life and those were the first thirteen years with my father is what she was referring to. </sentence><sentence id="742">We were not very nice children to her. </sentence><sentence id="743">We were extremely hard on her for many reasons. </sentence><sentence id="744">First of all, my brother thought she was frivolous, I probably thought she was a little frivolous also although she was very sad and serious. </sentence><sentence id="745">She always seemed to be concerned about things that -- I don't know how we got to be so lofty thinking but she always seemed to be concerned with things that we felt   were not terribly important. </sentence><sentence id="746">One would say that there was friction because we just totally lorded it over her. </sentence><sentence id="747">It was really, as I think back on it now, was a very strange situation. </sentence></p></dialogue>
