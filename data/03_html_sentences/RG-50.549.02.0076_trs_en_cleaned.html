<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="15">A: The earliest that I remember of my childhood was the -- the rituals of the family that revolved around Jewish holidays. </sentence><sentence id="16">The peak holiday was, of course, always Pesach, Passover, and it was big fuss, the dishes had to be changed. </sentence><sentence id="17">And lots of cooking took place. </sentence><sentence id="18">I always ran errands for my mother, helping her out. </sentence><sentence id="19">And I remember, perhaps as early as at the age of four or five, I learned how to pull the   http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0076 ; dough to make a streudel-thin dough. </sentence><sentence id="20">These are all trivial examples of what I remember. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="28">Q: Tell me more about those family traditions and rituals, o-other observances, birthdays, religious holidays. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="30">A: The Jewish community in Trencin consisted of about 2,000 souls out of a population of about 19,000, so it was a very large Jewish community. </sentence><sentence id="31">The Jewish community was centered around the school, which was a parochial school, and the synagogue. </sentence><sentence id="32">The -- the -- so far as I can remember, my grandfather always took me to prayers on Saturday morning. </sentence><sentence id="33">There was regulated holidays that had to be kept, and my mother maintained originally, during the 30's, before the trouble started, she maintained a kosher home. </sentence><sentence id="34">It was a -- a Jewish religious procedure that didn't make much sense to me. </sentence><sentence id="35">What particularly didn't make sense to me is that all the praying was done in ancient Hebrew, and I didn't understand a word of it. </sentence><sentence id="36">They never tried to teach us what all of this mumbo-jumbo meant. </sentence><sentence id="37">As a matter of fact, my father, although he was one of the leading lights of the community, was known to be highly critical of the local rabbi for never speaking Slovak, or even German that people could understand. </sentence><sentence id="38">So there was this peculiar dichotomy, on the one hand of a very formal, ritualized religious experience and a gradual rebellion against the -- which was largely engendered by the time I was about seven, by my association with the local Zionist organization, co -- Hashomer Hatzair, which was a leftist   http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0076 : organization, who was, at least mildly speaking, anti-religious, socialist, communalist, and totally rejecting the existence in the -- in the -- in the -- in the -- in the Slovak environment and totally focused on everybody getting out and moving to Palestine, and to live in a kibbutz in a communal Utopian environment. </sentence><sentence id="39">And as time went on, this influence became stronger and stronger, because that was a community that made lots of sense. </sentence><sentence id="40">The songs were very good. </sentence><sentence id="41">The -- the s-singing in the synagogue was always wailing. </sentence><sentence id="42">The -- the -- the singing in the Hashomer Hatzair was very zippy. </sentence><sentence id="43">Subsequently I found out that much of the communist singing was actually stolen from the Zionists, and -- but the songs were very strong. </sentence><sentence id="44">I always said, years later, that the communists and the leftists always had the best songs and the ugliest girls. </sentence><sentence id="45">But the songs were great, and the entertainment was great, and there was a great deal of hiking, and -- and sort of rebellion organization - - r-rebellions -- rebellious thinking against the environment that was closing in on us, already starting in deg36. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="63">Q: Now, you were only seven when you joined this organization, so obviously it was with your full family blessing. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="65">A: Well, I wouldn't say so. </sentence><sentence id="66">My grandfather, the religious grandfather highly disapproved of it, but my sister, Ella already was part of this religious and -- anti- religious attitude, and she had joined Hashomer Hatzair before me, so she sort of dragged me in. </sentence><sentence id="67">And also, one of the teachers in the Jewish school was a -- a rebel. </sentence><sentence id="68"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0076 deg He turned out to be, subsequently, the editor of the Pravda newspaper, and of course, they shot him afterwards in the anti -- anti-Communist purges. </sentence><sentence id="69">But -- so there was a very lively environment going on, a tremendous amount of change, and a great deal of debates about the future and ideas. </sentence><sentence id="70">So I was exposed to ideas like that very early in my childhood. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="78">Q: Hm. </sentence><sentence id="79">How much older than you was Ella? </sentence><sentence id="80">What -- when would she have been born? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="84">A: My sister Ella was born in 1925, so she was four -- almost four and a half o -- years older than me, and I've been always very, very close to her. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="86">Q: And what is her full name? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="88">A: Her full name is Ella Fabian. </sentence><sentence id="89">And she married a -- a -- just about the only eligible Jewish boy who was left in Trencin after the Holocaust. </sentence><sentence id="90">He survived being put behind a false brick wall, and two bricks were removed from time to time to feed him and take the soil out. </sentence><sentence id="91">And he never regained his health, but she married him anyway, and they have two beautiful children. </sentence><sentence id="92">They are both medical doctors and I visit them quite often. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="108">Q: No. </sentence><sentence id="109">I would love to know. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="112">A: Oh, Grandmother Emma was really something very special. </sentence><sentence id="113">She was married to my maternal grandfather, Alexander Weiner, who was a master cabinetmaker. </sentence><sentence id="114">It was apparently a deep love because during the first World War, when he went to war, and no, he didn't write for a couple of years, everybody thought that he died, and she got very, very sick. </sentence><sentence id="115">At any rate, meanwhile she made a living by having a very small store selling embroidery. </sentence><sentence id="116">And this was embroidery patterns. </sentence><sentence id="117">So when the little girls had to come in to start working on their trousseau, they had to come to Emma's little shop and she imprinted on their pieces of linen, patterns. </sentence><sentence id="118">And in those days, my mother tells me, the girls had to start working on their trousseau at the age of five. </sentence><sentence id="119">I mean -- I mean, if you didn't get married by the time you were 19, you were really just not marriageable, or wa -- there was something wrong with you. </sentence><sentence id="120">At any rate, the girls started working on a trousseau, and because the girls had to come in and do very complex embroidery, my grandmother could tell how intelligent the girl was, and how industrious she was, which was two criteria, basically, for recommending somebody. </sentence><sentence id="121">So my maternal grandmother, Emma, apparently was known very widely in the whole community as absolutely reliable I.Q. testing that -   ontectnetonancedjusetneey for tarher biormatoerabouttfisestecion USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0076 y - that never made a mistake. </sentence><sentence id="122">And so she made a living, b-both as a marriage broker, as well as a -- as a seller of embroidery. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="134">Q: So this would be done quite formally. </sentence><sentence id="135">People would pay for her advice? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="138">A: Oh yes, oh yes. </sentence><sentence id="139">Marriage brokers were paid, and of course the other thing was that my grandfather Weiner made -- was known for making chests which were inlain -- inlaid -- h-he did very fine cabinetry. </sentence><sentence id="140">This was inlaid wood veneer. </sentence><sentence id="141">And so, usually somebody who was a little wealthier, at the age of six or seven, they were starting to get on the queue with my grandfather Alexander, to start making a chest. </sentence><sentence id="142">Well, Grandfather Weiner liked to drink, and so the delivery on these chests was always uncertain. </sentence><sentence id="143">But he was a fun guy. </sentence><sentence id="144">He was always singing, he -- he -- he was really -- Grandfather Weiner took m-more c-care of me than anybody else in the family, because he had the time. </sentence><sentence id="145">And I was then apprenticed to him at the age of 11, and he taught me how to do inlaid veneer. </sentence><sentence id="146">So I worked for him for awhile. </sentence><sentence id="147">So it was a very colorful kind of an experience. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="158">Q: And very loving. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="160">A: Well, yes and no. </sentence><sentence id="161">My father was a very tense person. </sentence><sentence id="162">And -- and there was always a question -- course, I was -- I was a -- a child that caused trouble. </sentence><sentence id="163">I-I was known as the troublemaker. </sentence><sentence id="164">I-I had a reputation as being a particularly rebellious child. </sentence><sentence id="165">And years later some people tell me about kind of the pranks that I used to pull, and my father was a very stern task maker, and I just had to tow the line and   http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0076 5 very often I didn't. </sentence><sentence id="166">But the rebellion was there to begin with. </sentence><sentence id="167">My mother was a very loving woman, but she was really the brains behind the business, we ran a big business, my father had a big business. </sentence><sentence id="168">She was the cashier. </sentence><sentence id="169">She was the peacemaker am-among the employees. </sentence><sentence id="170">She was very charitable. </sentence><sentence id="171">She was actually the head of the WIZO, which was the women's Zionist organization, in Trencin. </sentence><sentence id="172">Everybody loved her, a-although there were some women who wore a grudge against her because she stole the best man in town. </sentence><sentence id="173">And i -- years later, a woman who survived told me that she could have been my mother. </sentence><sentence id="174">She was a -- she had her eye on -- on my father, except for that conniving matchmaker, your grandmother. </sentence><sentence id="175">So that's -- that's -- these are the kinds of stories that one -- I remember. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="193">Q: What would be the kind of things that you would get up -- up to, and where did that rebelliousness come from, I wonder, in your case? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="195">A: Where does the rebelliousness come from, I don't know. </sentence><sentence id="196">I was not considered to be a bright child. </sentence><sentence id="197">I was not considered to be one of the leading scholars. </sentence><sentence id="198">I mean, there were kids who were -- had better grades than I did. </sentence><sentence id="199">I was always looking at things. </sentence><sentence id="200">I-I must say that one of the memories that I have was that in the third grade - - so I must have been eight years old, maybe less, I became very interested in condoms, which was a no-no thing in those days. </sentence><sentence id="201">I mean, that was totally out of -- out of bound for everybody. </sentence><sentence id="202">And I did not know exactly what it was, but I was told this is really hush-hush. </sentence><sentence id="203">Well, what happened is that through some arrangements, I   ontectnetonancedjusetneey for tarher biormatoerabouttfisestecion USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0076 .got hold of a pack and brought them to school. </sentence><sentence id="204">Now, that was considered to be -- I was badly beaten up. </sentence><sentence id="205">You know -- in those days, you know, the kids got physical punishment. </sentence><sentence id="206">I had to stretch my hands, and I got caned over my hands. </sentence><sentence id="207">Now why I did it, I don't know, but it should have sort of -- you know, I got a kick out of it. </sentence><sentence id="208">Particularly the -- the teacher, who was caning me, was an idiot. </sentence><sentence id="209">And he didn't hear well, he didn't speak well, didn't see well. </sentence><sentence id="210">He was in his last year before retirement, and I think I just had to get at him one way or another. </sentence><sentence id="211">So -- so, discipline was always a problem with -- with me, including some really bad st-stunts that I pulled on girls, but it's -- it's history. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="230">Q: We'll get to that. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="232">A: Yeah. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="234">Q: Now, tell me the full names of your maternal grandparents and then I'd like to ask about your other grandparents. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="248">Q: Well, the paternal grandfather, Filip was a sick man, he had angina. </sentence><sentence id="249">He was a very withdrawn kind of a person, never talked too much. </sentence><sentence id="250">He was no fun. </sentence><sentence id="251">The -- the - - he married a woman from a family that -- that had lots of aunts. </sentence><sentence id="252">Oh, it was a huge, huge family. </sentence><sentence id="253">And my paternal grandfather's wife Anna was very small and she always liked to give me food that I didn't get at home. </sentence><sentence id="254">So her specialty was baked potatoes with lots of onions, garlic and when you render goose fat, the skin -- sh-she mixed that in. </sentence><sentence id="255">And so for years I ate on that and of course when I came home I didn't have an appetite, for which I was always punished, of course. </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="256">Q: By the way, of your maternal grandfather, does any of his furniture survive, do you know? </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="270">Q: Yeah, because you've -- you -- you've learned from those experiences. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="282">Q: We'll come back to that later in the interview, but because you've mentioned it, I will ask now about your decision to leave your home in 1948, when you, more than many others, had a reason to stay. </sentence><sentence id="283">You had a heritage and things you could pick up </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="284">A: Property, yeah. </sentence><sentence id="285">We had a heri -- heritage property. </sentence><sentence id="286">I could have inhe -- I -- presumably I was inheriting lots of land, houses. </sentence><sentence id="287">My decision to walk was much earlier than when people were forced out by the communists. </sentence><sentence id="288">I -- although many of the Jews who came back, they were spending their time reclaiming properties and going to court, and going through recovery and reclamation and restitution and all of this thing, I wanted no part of it. </sentence><sentence id="289">I didn't -- never touched it in my years there. </sentence><sentence id="290">I basically felt that the -- the country was poisoned. </sentence><sentence id="291">The people that I saw on the streets when I walked, were -- were the people who were killing and stealing and robbing and -- and -- and committing crimes, including the people who gradually   http://collections.ushmm.org </sentence></p></dialogue>

evidence available to me, although there were exceptions, particularly in the conquered lands, where in Russia, in -- where there was no legality at all, it was -- th-that was just plunder and mur-murder and what have you. </sentence><sentence id="2939">But I'm talking about western Europe, so-called civilized western Europe, which includes our good friends the French, and -- and -- and the Belgians, and the Germans and particularly the Austrian and the Slovaks, and the Hungarians and the Romanian, etcetera, etcetera, all did that in a very methodical, prescribed, legitimate method, which means that they could argue that they were proceeding through the sovereign rights of the state to take measures   http://collections.ushmm.org </sentence></p><p><sentence id="2940"> Contact

</sentence><sentence id="2941">By the way, that argument has been made. </sentence><sentence id="2942">Now, with that structure, and then harnessing the power of the state, they were then able to execute a crime in a very well structured method, which took advantage of all the best managerial know-how, such as being taught in schools today, of management. </sentence><sentence id="2943">In fact, people get MBAs in subjects which are closely related to that, except they apply to cattle and apply to krispies, and hamburgers and what have you. </sentence><sentence id="2944">Now, the evidence for this thing really is in what's called a transaction cost. </sentence><sentence id="2945">The transaction costs for executing this crime were very low, because this was largely self funding. </sentence><sentence id="2946">For instance, the Slovak paid the Germans, as you know, 10 marks for every body for resettlement and reeducation fees. </sentence><sentence id="2947">The confiscations were self funding. </sentence><sentence id="2948">Eichmann actually produced a profit and loss statement, because through the confiscation and so forth, they were able to get a large amount of gold into the coffers of their Reich system, although sooner or later the corruption crept in, but nevertheless, it was run as a business. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="2949">The business was based on the fact that a very small number of people at corporate headquarters, with some enforcement, could take care of problems which involved the marshalling and destruction of millions of people. </sentence><sentence id="2950">And one of the key elements in that process was the utilization of the Jewish organizations in co-opting the Jewish organizations into the liquidation process. </sentence><sentence id="2951">The deportation lists from my town, Trencin, that I used to trace the authenticity of who was a victim or not, were   http://collections.ushmm.org

there were some hooligans who did some stupid things, you know, like beat up people and so forth. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="2954">But most of it was done in a fairly organized fashion. </sentence><sentence id="2955">So now comes the Holocaust Museum, and you have a list of Holocaust survivors. </sentence><sentence id="2956">And then you have a list of Holocaust survivor donors. </sentence><sentence id="2957">And then you have interviews with these donors who are being awarded this or that, and being treated to this or that dinner. </sentence><sentence id="2958">And then you have the Los Angeles chapter, and then you have the New York chapter, etcetera, etcetera. </sentence><sentence id="2959">Well, these people get up and make a speech and they say how they suffered in Auschwitz, and in what have you. </sentence><sentence id="2960">Now it turns out that none of them ever give away when they went to Auschwitz. </sentence><sentence id="2961">None of them.
