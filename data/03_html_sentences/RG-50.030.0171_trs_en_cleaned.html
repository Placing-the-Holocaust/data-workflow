id="688">About four o'clock in the morning we got that through and there was a square bar, I should say one inch by one inch thick. </sentence><sentence id="689">And good enough there was not so tight together, so we cut the second one on the bottom. </sentence><sentence id="690">There was only one cross bar in the middle, so we figured out when we cut it on the bottom, so we grab it and bend it up

id="1519">How come they pick him up for the SS because usually when they pick up a man for the SS they got to be tall...you got to be perfect, see. </sentence><sentence id="1520">But somehow (laughter) they pick him up. </sentence><sentence id="1521">He was a little guy, red hair. </sentence><sentence id="1522">Anyway, he make that picture and I remember that day and that picture was made as I can remember as I come to Flossenburg on August 3rd, and fourteen days they keep us there. </sentence><sentence id="1523">It must be around August 18, 19 or maybe 20th that picture was made. </sentence><sentence id="1524">How this picture survived, how they get it, how they put it there, I don't know. </sentence><sentence id="1525">But I'm there see, and then on a in a quarry they put me in a special gang, so-called Kette Kommando. </sentence><sentence id="1526">Kette Kommando was was a gang...I can't remember...was four of us, six of us, few gangs like that...our job was going in a quarry way deep with a dynamite that granite night before, and those big blocks granite...we put the chain around and the big crane was on top of it. </sentence><sentence id="1527">He pick up those big blocks and bring on a level and then those blocks, they was cut again for the smaller pieces. </sentence><sentence id="1528">So I was there for few weeks and that was very dangerous. </sentence><sentence id="1529">Some time the whole block slipped, you know. </sentence><sentence id="1530">We didn't put the chain right, you know, somehow, and there were so many accidents there. </sentence><sentence id="1531">That was that was very danger(ous). </sentence><sentence id="1532">Now why I say this picture was made in a first day in a quarry. </sentence><sentence id="1533">Because on that picture I got the shoes with the wooden sole and after a while I was assigned for those Kette Kommando...put the chains on...what was so much climbing, they give me leather shoes very next day, and that's why I I remember that that was the first day in a in a quarry. </sentence><sentence id="1534">OK. </sentence><sentence id="1535">So after a few weeks they...for some reason one morning they put me on a barrack...they take me off from this kommando. </sentence><sentence id="1536">We call it kommando...you know, the gang. </sentence><sentence id="1537">And they put me on on cell number 12 to learn how to work out and make pieces out of the granite, so my first teacher there was another prisoner, old prisoner, a Czechoslovak. </sentence><sentence id="1538">I remember his name. </sentence><sentence id="1539">Very nice man. </sentence><sentence id="1540">Franco Cerevani_ and he teach me how there do this granite. </sentence><sentence id="1541">What we was doing we was making

out of granite. </sentence><sentence id="1546">Matter of fact the Politische Abteilung building there, later on we put there. </sentence><sentence id="1547">Pol. </sentence><sentence id="1548">Abt. </sentence><sentence id="1549">means the all political bureaus was there, the whole concentration camp commandant, wheels...they had offices there, and matter of fact I got my probably...I can't remember exactly...four or five stones underneath the roof and they're in a shape like used to call them cocquils...special made. </sentence><sentence id="1550">They stick outon the _ roof and they're in a shape like half-rounded, you know, and two years ago I was there and I show my wife, my daughter and my son, look...I don't know which one but I know this is four or five of them, those stones, I make it, see. </sentence><sentence id="1551">And also we was making stones for the bridges. </sentence><sentence id="1552">That time they build up the autostrada (ph)...the big way you call it...and by each bridge on the side, those walls, they was using those big blocks. </sentence><sentence id="1553">We...there there was a name Soldaten Steine. </sentence><sentence id="1554">Yeah. </sentence><sentence id="1555">That's the name was, and that's what the work was. </sentence><sentence id="1556">First few  weeks that was terrible, you know. </sentence><sentence id="1557">I thought

German) and mash (ph) hammer number one, number two, you know. </sentence><sentence id="1560">You smooth it up with the with the mash hammer. </sentence><sentence id="1561">So you start with number one what is rough, see, and you pound and pound and you got the brush, you know, and you brush that dust. </sentence><sentence id="1562">There was no fan, nothing. </sentence><sentence id="1563">In the evening after twelve hours when we're finished, we was full white, you know, like a bakers. </sentence><sentence id="1564">Remind me in a bakery, you know, I wasn't that much white that time. </sentence><sentence id="1565">And then...now if you make that stone, each stone had it own term, you know...how long takes it to make. </sentence><sentence id="1566">If you make that stone on on time, you have extra bonus. </sentence><sentence id="1567">We say in a week, one mark, two mark bonus, so you can buy something in the canteen. </sentence><sentence id="1568">They had a canteen in a concentration camp, so after after a few weeks I pick up because friend of mine told me, look Julie, if you want to survive, you got to show them something what you can do and don't go down.

half a liter, what you call a liter, black coffee, ersatz coffee so- called, made out of a bark, burnt bark. </sentence><sentence id="1606">Then when you was working in a quarry, around nine o'clock they give you two slices of bread with margarine, as a heavy worker. </sentence><sentence id="1607">Yeah. </sentence><sentence id="1608">At noon, as you see on this picture what I got, we had soup.
