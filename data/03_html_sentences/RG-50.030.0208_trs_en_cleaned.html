<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="312">Q: Can we go back to...when you were in Birkenau only 3 days days, you said, and then you went to Silesia. </sentence><sentence id="313">Then what happened? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="316">A: Yes. </sentence><sentence id="317">Yes. </sentence><sentence id="318">In Silesia, they took us to a camp. </sentence><sentence id="319">It's called Wolfsberg." </sentence><sentence id="320">When we arrived, we found 20 Jewish inmates from Poland. </sentence><sentence id="321">They became...one became an lageraltester, and a couple of them became kapos, you know. </sentence><sentence id="322">And to tell you the truth, they were very rough on us. </sentence><sentence id="323">Why? </sentence><sentence id="324">Because they were Polish Jews and they yelled at us. </sentence><sentence id="325">You know, we suffering already 4 years while they were staying from and eating the good stuff and all these things. </sentence><sentence id="326">And they put together not regular barracks but in a real emergency, it was like heavy cardboard, round...round like shacks, you know. </sentence><sentence id="327">And we were sleeping in...on wood, one near the other, about 25 in a shack like this. </sentence><sentence id="328">And many came....October or November... don't know exactly the month, and we say that they're starting to build regular barracks from Subcamp of Gross Rosen, located in Lower Silesia at Friedland. </sentence><sentence id="329">wood. </sentence><sentence id="330">We know that we have to be prepared to stay there winter time. </sentence><sentence id="331">We worked...I worked night shift in tunnels. </sentence><sentence id="332">We...we made tunnels because there were big mountains and the mountains consisted inside of stones. </sentence><sentence id="333">And we made tunnels over there because that's where they were hiding machineries. </sentence><sentence id="334">Matter of fact, that tunnel what we were building, they told us openly that they're bringing...there was a big machinery factory in Budapest, and they bring machineries from there. </sentence><sentence id="335">Plus they wanted the German soldiers...they knew that the Russians are coming. </sentence><sentence id="336">I mean 1944, they knew that the war is lost for them. </sentence><sentence id="337">But they wanted to kill as many Jews as possible in a hurry. </sentence><sentence id="338">And they wanted to hide over there in the tunnels and when the Russians come to use all kind of heavy artillery to shoot from that...from the tunnels. </sentence><sentence id="339">Matter of fact, my job...you see, I was still not 16 years old. </sentence><sentence id="340">So they had pity on me, the kapos, and I was...I was riding the locomotives because they were little wagons what carried the stone from the tunnel out. </sentence><sentence id="341">And I was driving the locomotive. </sentence><sentence id="342">It was simples ones, you know, so you didn't have to learn how to...and we carried the stones. </sentence><sentence id="343">We dumped it and went back for more stones. </sentence><sentence id="344">And one day I went back to the camp in the morning and I found out the bad news. </sentence><sentence id="345">My brother got hurt. </sentence><sentence id="346">Because he wanted to put together two wagons. </sentence><sentence id="347">Not with the train what I was driving. </sentence><sentence id="348">Somebody else was driving it. </sentence><sentence id="349">And he didn't realize it, and the two trains...one was fill up with stones catched...the two bumpers catched his leg. </sentence><sentence id="350">And that was bad news and I tell you why. </sentence><sentence id="351">Because any little thing happened to a person like got very bad injury on the hand or on the leg, they didn't play too much. </sentence><sentence id="352">They amputate. </sentence><sentence id="353">And the next day I came back to the camp from work and that was the news what they told me that your brother's leg. </sentence><sentence id="354">I don't remember. </sentence><sentence id="355">I think it was right leg was amputated. </sentence><sentence id="356">But still he was in hospital. </sentence><sentence id="357">So I went to visit him every day. </sentence><sentence id="358">He never told me. </sentence><sentence id="359">That's something I never    gonna forget. </sentence><sentence id="360">He never told me what happened to him. </sentence><sentence id="361">He never showed me that his leg was amputated. </sentence><sentence id="362">He never told me. </sentence><sentence id="363">I knew. </sentence><sentence id="364">I didn't talk about it and he didn't talk about it. </sentence><sentence id="365">And that went on for a...4 weeks. </sentence><sentence id="366">But then the Russian came every day closer and closer to the camp. </sentence><sentence id="367">And the camp had to be liquidated and they took away all the people from the hospital. </sentence><sentence id="368">Came wagons, trucks, horse and carriages, and all the people in the hospital was taken away...uh...and it was like a district in that neighborhood which has a crematoria, because by us in the camp was no crematorium. </sentence><sentence id="369">And they took them away, all of them from the hospital and they got killed in the crematorium. </sentence><sentence id="370">And after they left...a couple of days later, we started to march to march from the camp. </sentence><sentence id="371">The camp has to be empty. </sentence><sentence id="372">Matter of fact, sometimes we even heard with our ears the noise from the fighting...the Russians and the Germans, you know. </sentence><sentence id="373">Bombs or heavy artillery or something. </sentence><sentence id="374">We heard it. </sentence><sentence id="375">And they...we marched a full day, and we came again to a farm with a big barn and...uh...that barn could take normally...I'm talking about standing, never mind sitting or lying down, standing I would say about 2,000 people. </sentence><sentence id="376">The other thousand because we have three thousand. </sentence><sentence id="377">The other thousand was pushed in with a bayonet. </sentence><sentence id="378">You know, put in to the stomach and pushed in. </sentence><sentence id="379">The noise, the crying what went on all night, this was unbearable because... uh...anybody couldn't have no strength to stand fell down. </sentence><sentence id="380">People stepped on it. </sentence><sentence id="381">They opened the barn door 8 o'clock in the morning. </sentence><sentence id="382">That time we realized what kind of night it was because they were carrying out from the barns dead people...stepped on the body and dead. </sentence><sentence id="383">Anybody couldn't...didn't have no strength to stand, they were just dead and taken away. </sentence><sentence id="384">We marched another day and we came to a strain...train station. </sentence><sentence id="385">Their policy, the German policy, was, and that was general not particular but general policy of theirs was all the inmates...concentration    camp inmates, summer time was carried in...in closed wagons, in winter time open wagons. </sentence><sentence id="386">By that time it was winter and snow was coming down and we traveled for 3 days. </sentence><sentence id="387">We were sitting, laying, the snow was coming on us. </sentence><sentence id="388">No food. </sentence><sentence id="389">Uh...we were passing by a big hill. </sentence><sentence id="390">The train was below the hill, and somehow...I don't know...a couple of people, civilians, knew...I don't know how...but some trains...some wagons, they threw in pieces of bread, but that was not enough for three thousand people. </sentence><sentence id="391">I mean. </sentence><sentence id="392">And matter of fact, we arrived to a train station Mauthausen; but we didn't know what Mauthausen is, because... Let's put it this way. </sentence><sentence id="393">There are two kind of concentration camps. </sentence><sentence id="394">There are concentration camps where people worked and they gave...they gave them food. </sentence><sentence id="395">You worked your 12 hours. </sentence><sentence id="396">You go home to the camp, and they let you to rest; you know, nobody bothered you. </sentence><sentence id="397">And food...it was not enough, definitely; but at least it was enough to sustain you. </sentence><sentence id="398">But Mauthausen, Ebensee," and Majdanek and these concentration camps was just put up for killings. </sentence><sentence id="399">You know, the crematoriums on the spot. </sentence><sentence id="400">So we didn't know what Mauthausen is, but all these places-- Ebensee, Gunskirchen"... All these...you see, that's the neighborhood where the Russians and the Americans got together because they're pushing from two sides, and that's the area where they got together. </sentence><sentence id="401">And every time from one side...other side, they always emptied camps and they were bringing them to Mauthausen, to Ebensee. </sentence><sentence id="402">Mauthausen was a very, very big camp...concentration camp, but they couldn't kill so fast the people...as many people came...arrived. </sentence><sentence id="403">So we're staying in Mauthausen. </sentence><sentence id="404">The train...train station, SS with big dogs &gt; Subcamp of Mauthausen.4 Subcamp of Mauthausen. </sentence><sentence id="405">watching on us...they...we shouldn't jump down, you know, because it's still open train. </sentence><sentence id="406">And we stayed there for about 2 hours and and we traveled further and we arrived to Ebensee. </sentence><sentence id="407">After a 3 day traveling with an open...an open train and snow felling on us, naturally, we stayed...it's called an appell. </sentence><sentence id="408">You know, we stayed in the line over there in the...on the...they take...they took us in a barrack. </sentence><sentence id="409">And I'll never gonna forget... Naturally, we had no strength, so a lot of people sit down on the snow. </sentence><sentence id="410">And next to me was a man who laid down...and there was lot of dead people at that time among us...and one SS and two inmates was going around like a you call in English, a cart, you know, with...a cart to put on the dead people and take them to the crematorium. </sentence><sentence id="411">And when they came to pick up the man laying next to me, the two inmates said to the SS, "He's still alive." </sentence><sentence id="412">The SS made a with the hand..."Forget about it. </sentence><sentence id="413">Take him." " </sentence><sentence id="414">Forget about. </sentence><sentence id="415">Take him." </sentence><sentence id="416">Uh...He's alive, but forget about this. </sentence><sentence id="417">He's finished. </sentence><sentence id="418">And then they took us inside the barrack, but we so many people we couldn't lay on our back. </sentence><sentence id="419">We had to lay sideways. </sentence><sentence id="420">They gave an order we should have to lay sideways because there's not enough room to lay on our back. </sentence><sentence id="421">And we are laying there... remember, but then they took us to other barracks and over there we went also to work in tunnels. </sentence><sentence id="422">Also Ebensee is surrounded big, big mountains. </sentence><sentence id="423">The city is like in a valley. </sentence><sentence id="424">All around mountains, and we worked over there. </sentence><sentence id="425">I had no privilege already, like running the trains. </sentence><sentence id="426">I had to work with shovels to throw stones. </sentence><sentence id="427">One evening another guy and myself we went out to the tunnel. </sentence><sentence id="428">It was dark. </sentence><sentence id="429">And I say...we're gonna take in a little fresh air, and take a rest for 5 minutes and gonna go back. </sentence><sentence id="430">An SS catched us. </sentence><sentence id="431">And he says, "What you doing here? </sentence><sentence id="432">Why aren't you working? </sentence><sentence id="433">And why're you talking to each other." </sentence><sentence id="434">I says, "Well, with that little bread what we got, I lent him half of it and I want he should give it back to me." </sentence><sentence id="435">And they took us in...in a    SS barrack where they were headquartering, you know, watching the people. </sentence><sentence id="436">Actually, they were not in the town. </sentence><sentence id="437">They were outside. </sentence><sentence id="438">They had there barracks. </sentence><sentence id="439">And first they took in the other guy. </sentence><sentence id="440">And I heard yelling and the yelling stopped. </sentence><sentence id="441">And they took me in. </sentence><sentence id="442">And I was prepared, you know, because I heard the other guy. </sentence><sentence id="443">The SS somehow he...he got pity on me because I was not 16 years old. </sentence><sentence id="444">He says, "Listen. </sentence><sentence id="445">We're gonna give you 10 lashes, if you gonna keep quiet. </sentence><sentence id="446">But if you're gonna yell, you're gonna get 20." </sentence><sentence id="447">I don't know where I took the strength, but I didn't yell and I got 10 and they send me back to a tunnel to work. </sentence><sentence id="448">About 2 weeks before the liberation! </sentence><sentence id="449">You see, they...the way they operated so that nobody could figure out what they have in mind. </sentence><sentence id="450">What happened...two weeks before the liberation, three SS came into our barrack and they said everybody has to stay in the line. </sentence><sentence id="451">And we knew right away that those people who still able to work, they're gonna take them to work. </sentence><sentence id="452">And those who are not able to work, they're gonna take them to the gas chamber or the crematorium and kill them. </sentence><sentence id="453">I'll never forget when it came mine...next, I begged them. </sentence><sentence id="454">I showed it that I'm still able to work....they should take me. </sentence><sentence id="455">I begged them like a kid could beg somebody. </sentence><sentence id="456">And they did not take me. </sentence><sentence id="457">So I was prepared that I'm going to get killed. </sentence><sentence id="458">But after we found out, it was just a opposite way. </sentence><sentence id="459">Because they knew the American are coming, and those who they think will die anyway, why...why bother to kill them. </sentence><sentence id="460">They're going to die anyway. </sentence><sentence id="461">Those who figured they could last more than two weeks, they took them...took them out, and they killed them. </sentence><sentence id="462">That's how I survived. </sentence><sentence id="463">When I got liberated...it was a Sunday, 2 o'clock, and that time...not that time, a couple of days later, the Americans, you know, they started to take care of us. </sentence><sentence id="464">And they weigh us. </sentence><sentence id="465">I weighed 70 pound. </sentence><sentence id="466">70 pound! </sentence><sentence id="467">But it looks like God wanted I should stay alive. </sentence><sentence id="468">What happened is Sunday afternoon they put up a big kitchen in the    open...the Americans. </sentence><sentence id="469">And all we had to do is stand in the line, and they didn't care how many times you are standing in the line. </sentence><sentence id="470">You finished eating, if you want to stand in line again, you get again hot soup. </sentence><sentence id="471">So by...one day I had a little strength and I went in to the city. </sentence><sentence id="472">It was...uh...1 don't know exactly...you had go over a bridge...1 would say about a mile...a mile and a half. </sentence><sentence id="473">And I didn't do nothing. </sentence><sentence id="474">A lot of people...they went in with friend, robbed, uh...the German families, you know, what they found. </sentence><sentence id="475">Me, I was a kid. </sentence><sentence id="476">I didn't need nothing. </sentence><sentence id="477">What do I need? </sentence><sentence id="478">So what I did is I went from one house to another eating. </sentence><sentence id="479">Whatever they gave me, I was eating. </sentence><sentence id="480">And about 10 o'clock I went back to the camp. </sentence><sentence id="481">And I was lucky. </sentence><sentence id="482">I was lucky. </sentence><sentence id="483">Why? </sentence><sentence id="484">Because I lay down. </sentence><sentence id="485">I lay down and while I was laying...excuse for the expression, I vomited the whole thing out. </sentence><sentence id="486">If that would have staying in, that would finish me. </sentence><sentence id="487">So that's in general what I went through in the concentration camp. </sentence><sentence id="488">Naturally, there's stories I can tell you. </sentence><sentence id="489">And matter of fact, you ask me the story, but I can tell you...uh...you know, we have a book which it says if all the oceans would be ink and all the forests would be pencils, wouldn't be enough to tell the whole story. </sentence><sentence id="490">But that's the general. </sentence><sentence id="491">Then I stayed in that camp about 4 weeks until a couple of us, we got liberated...uh...three people from our town. </sentence><sentence id="492">We decided we're going home. </sentence><sentence id="493">We don't know what we're gonna find, whom we're gonna find. </sentence><sentence id="494">But we're going...we decided we're going home to Hungary. </sentence><sentence id="495">There was no train. </sentence><sentence id="496">There was no transportation. </sentence><sentence id="497">We...when I say we...is a friend of mine...it just happened he died last year...and myself. </sentence><sentence id="498">We knew the train is going that direction toward the border, and we sit...within two wagons, there's a round thing which locks together, you know, between the two trains, and we are sitting... He was sitting one one side, and I was sitting on other side. </sentence><sentence id="499">We traveled 24 hours like that. </sentence><sentence id="500">During the night, our job was every half minute to    watch on each other we shouldn't fall asleep because if we fell asleep, we fell down, and that's a goodbye. </sentence><sentence id="501">We came after a whole night traveling like this...we came to a station. </sentence><sentence id="502">I don't know which station. </sentence><sentence id="503">I don't remember. </sentence><sentence id="504">I don't remember it was still Germany or it was already Austria or Hungary....1 don't remember. </sentence><sentence id="505">I remember one thing. </sentence><sentence id="506">When it got...the light came on, it was day...daylight and the train was staying in the station, and I said to my friend, "I'm going to wash my face a little bit so freshen up a little bit." </sentence><sentence id="507">And I didn't know there was another train, full of SS, by the Russians taking...they took them to Russia. </sentence><sentence id="508">And Russians, they were so violent. </sentence><sentence id="509">They didn't care SS, inmates going home, you know...they so...people in that...in the station...middle of washing and a Russian soldier came over. </sentence><sentence id="510">He grabbed by the neck, and he showed me I should go in the wagon. </sentence><sentence id="511">When I saw the wagon with the SS, it...my eyes blackened...what is this? </sentence><sentence id="512">I am just coming from the concentration camp. </sentence><sentence id="513">And I start crying and matter of fact, I showed him that piece of paper what I got when I got liberated by Americans. </sentence><sentence id="514">And usually the Russian soldiers, you know, if they would see a paper like this they don't...they don't care. </sentence><sentence id="515">Somehow the Russian soldier, he didn't know how to read it; and he gave it to one of the SS in the wagon, and he somehow explained to the Russian soldier that I'm just coming home from the concentration camp. </sentence><sentence id="516">And he said, "Go." </sentence><sentence id="517">It didn't took...it wouldn't take not too much that I would wind up in Siberia with...uh...with SS, you know, together with...with those people who killed us. </sentence><sentence id="518">Because the Russians...matter of fact, a lot of Hungarian Jews after the liberation, they took them to Siberia...Siberia. </sentence><sentence id="519">Because if they wanted 100 people, they didn't care who the 100 people is, as long as 100 people go. </sentence><sentence id="520">So after traveling...uh...nice couple of days, we arrived to Budapest. </sentence><sentence id="521">And by that time...you see...uh...Budapest was liberated in January of 1945. </sentence><sentence id="522">Because you see, the    Russians coming from Hungary, they're going to Austria and then to Germany. </sentence><sentence id="523">So it took to May and the war...the second world war ended May 8. </sentence><sentence id="524">I got liberated 2 days before the end of the war. </sentence><sentence id="525">Like I mentioned before that's...that's where the area where they got together, the Russians and Americans. </sentence><sentence id="526">And when I arrived to Budapest, naturally, the first thing we did, my friend and myself, we found out there any Jews alive. </sentence><sentence id="527">Or something. </sentence><sentence id="528">Anything. </sentence><sentence id="529">So they telled...they told us, "Yes, they's a...by the Jewish synagogue there an organization where they're getting money from the United Jewish Appeal. </sentence><sentence id="530">And everybody who goes there and say they are just coming from Germany gets a couple of penge...--like a dollar, you know. </sentence><sentence id="531">And we can continue our destiny wherever we wanta go (cough) go and...uh...we did continue and...uh..and I arrived in the town where I was born. </sentence><sentence id="532">I found my brother in the station. </sentence><sentence id="533">He wanted to travel somewhere. </sentence><sentence id="534">With the same train as I arrived, he wanted to take the same training going further...the same direction where the train was going. </sentence><sentence id="535">When he saw me, naturally, he didn't take the train anymore. </sentence><sentence id="536">You know, the happiness was unbelievable that I'm alive. </sentence><sentence id="537">And later on, 5 months, but... got home the end of June. </sentence><sentence id="538">The communism in Hungary got stronger and stronger by the day. </sentence><sentence id="539">And by November of 1945, they called in my brother, questioning him. </sentence><sentence id="540">From what he see, living, he's not working. </sentence><sentence id="541">Where is he taking the money to live on? </sentence><sentence id="542">And the anti-Semitism was very bad. </sentence><sentence id="543">All we heard from the Gentiles...from neighbors where we lived together all our lives, they said to us, "How could it be...how could it be so bad? </sentence><sentence id="544">You came back more people than they took you. </sentence><sentence id="545">We came back from 35 families...we were together 105 people got deported, and we came back I think 6. </sentence><sentence id="546">And they had the nerve to say, "How could it be so bad if you came...came back more people than they took you?" </sentence><sentence id="547">So I saw there's no future, and I went up to Budapest and over    there they organized transport to go back to Germany. </sentence><sentence id="548">I didn't know that time what's in Germany, but I know here's no good. </sentence><sentence id="549">Here's no good so I have to leave. </sentence><sentence id="550">I didn't...besides my brother I didn't find...our house was bombed from the Germans. </sentence><sentence id="551">My parents never came...didn't come back and my brother. </sentence><sentence id="552">So I went to Germany. </sentence><sentence id="553">I stayed there 2 years. </sentence><sentence id="554">But my life was...on the road to Germany, we stopped in Austria...in Vienna, and I wrote a letter to my brother. </sentence><sentence id="555">I said, "Look, they're helping us. </sentence><sentence id="556">Get up. </sentence><sentence id="557">Come. </sentence><sentence id="558">I don't know what's the future, but there's no future there. </sentence><sentence id="559">Come." </sentence><sentence id="560">Matter of fact..uh..6 months later, he joined me in Germany. </sentence><sentence id="561">I forget to mention to you...it's very...also a very tricky thing what they did to Germans. </sentence><sentence id="562">When we arrived to Birkenau, they had...uh...sand...a pile...a big pile of sand. </sentence><sentence id="563">And we were...they gave us cap...round cap. </sentence><sentence id="564">In the cap, we had to take the sand, the whole pile of sand, carry...uh...like a quarter of a mile. </sentence><sentence id="565">Filled...everybody had to fill in the cap, empty it, and come back, empty it again...I mean fill it up again and carry it, and we had to make it fast because slow is no good. </sentence><sentence id="566">Fast...we had to make it fast. </sentence><sentence id="567">And next day in Birkenau, they gave us post cards. </sentence><sentence id="568">And we were so naive, so...we didn't know what's what, they gave us as many post cards we wanted to write to our parents, to our brothers, to our sisters. </sentence><sentence id="569">Our parents are dead already, but they give us...they gave us post cards to write. </sentence><sentence id="570">How...this how tricky they were, you know, just to fool people. </sentence><sentence id="571">You never know what they were up to. </sentence><sentence id="572">And I stayed 2 years in the DP camp and it was...maybe I didn't know how to approach, but it was very hard to get a visa to come to the United States because there were too many applicants. </sentence><sentence id="573">Not only Jews, Gentiles....there was other camps with Gentiles also. </sentence><sentence id="574">They said they're also refugees. </sentence><sentence id="575">Polish, Russians, Hungarians. </sentence><sentence id="576">So after staying for 2 years, I...somebody told us there is a way somehow. </sentence><sentence id="577">The way is to go west to France, and from there we can take...we can apply for a    student visa, going, studying. </sentence><sentence id="578">So I stayed 2 years in Paris. </sentence><sentence id="579">Matter of fact, one of the Rabbis in a small town gave me a paper that he's asking the American Embassy to let me go to the United States to study for a year and he's giving me a position as a assistant Rabbi in the town. </sentence><sentence id="580">And I got the student visa. </sentence><sentence id="581">Naturally, I never went back. </sentence><sentence id="582">Well, I got the visa for 1 year and after a year I didn't go back. </sentence><sentence id="583">I'm not supposed to work, but...in the United States because I'm a student and I loved to work. </sentence><sentence id="584">So what shall I do? </sentence><sentence id="585">I have to eat. </sentence><sentence id="586">I have to pay where I stayed for the lady. </sentence><sentence id="587">So I took up a false first name. </sentence><sentence id="588">And I took out a Social Security Card. </sentence><sentence id="589">And I went to work. </sentence><sentence id="590">5 minutes. </sentence><sentence id="591">Alright. </sentence><sentence id="592">Can you give us 5 minutes?

" </sentence><sentence id="909">Yes, Mr. Schwartz, I'm gonna work in behalf of you. </sentence><sentence id="910">But we have to go through a hearing on Ellis Island." </sentence><sentence id="911">I went through a hearing 4 hours. </sentence><sentence id="912">The 4 hours consisted from 10:00 to 12:00 and from 2:00 to 4:00. </sentence><sentence id="913">They questioned me very hard. </sentence><sentence id="914">Mine answer was, "Listen, I can't help myself. </sentence><sentence id="915">I have no where to go. </sentence><sentence id="916">I have no where to go." </sentence><sentence id="917">You see, that time there was not...not even an Israel. </sentence><sentence id="918">Israel was established 1948. </sentence><sentence id="919">I says, "You can...you can't throw me out because I have no where to go." </sentence><sentence id="920">And I was still young. </sentence><sentence id="921">And so they told me that I have to go to any three embassies, representing three countries, and make application they should take me. </sentence><sentence id="922">And I...1 did made application, and...So we had to go back to the second hearing, and I told them nobody wants me. </sentence><sentence id="923">And I cannot go back to Hungary; because if I go back to Hungary, I facing the second concentration camp. </sentence><sentence id="924">They questioned me all kind of questions..uh ... if....

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="984">Q: That was very well done. </sentence><sentence id="985">Can you tell me about the last few weeks in Ebensee? </sentence><sentence id="986">What was it like? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="990">A: There's no word for it...to describe it. </sentence><sentence id="991">The cruelty and what we went through, because their function...when I'm talking about their function...the SS function, was the more people to kill because every day thousands and thousands of other inmates arriving to Ebensee because that was the area where the Russians and American meet each other. </sentence><sentence id="992">You see, we were liberated May 6. </sentence><sentence id="993">Two days later the war was over. </sentence><sentence id="994">So it...that's where they met, the Russians and the Americans. </sentence><sentence id="995">So their function was to kill as many people...as many people they brought in from all other concentration camps. </sentence><sentence id="996">But with all their technic...with all geniuses what they put in how to kill more Jews, they couldn't kill as fast as they were coming in. </sentence><sentence id="997">And there was no food whatsoever. </sentence><sentence id="998">Even the SS were going hungry. </sentence><sentence id="999">Even they were getting very little food. </sentence><sentence id="1000">And naturally the human nature, those people who are still have a little strength to walk and we still went to work, and because we knew those people who are gonna say I have no strength to go to work gonna get killed. </sentence><sentence id="1001">Without food. </sentence><sentence id="1002">We got in the morning a little...won't call it coffee...a little black colored water. </sentence><sentence id="1003">And people were so desperate, they were chewing coal, sucked coal, eating grass. </sentence><sentence id="1004">And I have to say it that they lost all humanity whatever you call it, and those people who died during the night and few of them they still had on their lower part some meat...some meat, when we got up in the morning, we saw those people dead. </sentence><sentence id="1005">But the way they were carrying them, we saw that pieces of the body were missing. </sentence><sentence id="1006">And during the morning or after work, they made somehow a little fire, and they put it on like they say in the United States, they barbecued and they ate it. </sentence><sentence id="1007">| am very fortunate to say I never touched it. </sentence><sentence id="1008">But there was a lot of them eating it. </sentence><sentence id="1009">And it was...it was terrible. </sentence><sentence id="1010">We got liberated May 6 in 1945 which came out a Sunday. </sentence><sentence id="1011">Saturday, they hanged 12 people in middle of the camp on the gallows, and all those people who stayed who can still walk had to go march in front of them to see how they were hanging from the gallow. </sentence><sentence id="1012">Another thing...very interesting thing happened. </sentence><sentence id="1013">Looked likes there was some...couple...not some, but a couple Germans who still couldn't take it what's going on. </sentence><sentence id="1014">What happened is we got liberated Sunday. </sentence><sentence id="1015">Friday evening before we went to bed, there was a message from the Mayor of Ebensee. </sentence><sentence id="1016">And the message was that we gonna go tomorrow morning...that means Saturday morning...from appell...appell it's called, you know, where you have to stand in the line. </sentence><sentence id="1017">And the SS gonna tell us that the Russians are very close and in order to get saved, we shouldn't get hurt, we all should go in the tunnel. </sentence><sentence id="1018">And the tunnel was prepared...the gate, you know, after you go in to bomb the gate and we all gonna die there. </sentence><sentence id="1019">So the Mayor sent a message that he don't know if it's gonna help or not, but when we gonna stand in appell Saturday morning and we gonna hear that speech, we should all start yelling with one voice, "We don't care if we gonna go....if we gonna get killed, we're not gonna go nowhere. </sentence><sentence id="1020">We're staying here." </sentence><sentence id="1021">And it looks like they have got the strength...they didn't have the strength or the willingness to force us anymore because they know it's | day or 2 days left and we didn't go. </sentence><sentence id="1022">And that was fortunate who had still...uh...had to stand, stayed alive. </sentence><sentence id="1023">But it was prepared to lull, and that was the easiest way to kill us, to go in the tunnel and...uh...bomb    the...uh...gate, you know, so all the stones would fell down from the mountains, and we couldn't get out. </sentence><sentence id="1024">That's all. </sentence><sentence id="1025">And they...maybe they would never find us. </sentence><sentence id="1026">That we are there. </sentence><sentence id="1027">I don't know how many thousands people buried alive. </sentence><sentence id="1028">But somehow the Mayor from Ebensee sent us a message Friday evening that we shouldn't go. </sentence><sentence id="1029">So that's the story of my life. </sentence></p></dialogue>
