<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="521">A: He went on business, you know, to -- no, my father went on business. </sentence><sentence id="522">But my father was a worrier, and that will explain what happened to him later. </sentence><sentence id="523">And he, I think, foresaw that things were going to happen, and so he went to, to England on business. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="527">Q: Okay. </sentence><sentence id="528">So he was the one who instigated you coming across to London to meet him? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="531">A: Right. </sentence><sentence id="532">Right. </sentence><sentence id="533">Oh, absolutely. </sentence><sentence id="534">I mean, we wouldn't have gone otherwise. </sentence><sentence id="535">He -- he had gone. </sentence><sentence id="536">And I can't tell you how long he was there, but I can tell you that when he - - we came there, he was only 39.He was in the hospital with a heart attack. </sentence><sentence id="537">So the pressures and the strains, you know, of the family -- and between my father and my mother, they were able to get us over there. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="545">Q: Did you need special permission from the British to stay there? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="547">A: No. </sentence><sentence id="548">That's such an interesting thing because the British -- actually, there were many refugees that came to England. </sentence><sentence id="549">Most countries, including America, including, you know, so many countries, even in South America and Australia, you know, nobody really wanted the Jews to come. </sentence><sentence id="550">But my father was there on business, and it's not just -- we then made friends with a lot of other people. </sentence><sentence id="551">In fact, I'm still a close friend of somebody who came from Moravska Ostrave that were close friends of my parents. </sentence><sentence id="552">The name was Winer, (ph) and she's now married. </sentence><sentence id="553">Her name is Honey Arnold. </sentence><sentence id="554">She's still alive and she's in England. </sentence><sentence id="555">And we're still in touch and close. </sentence><sentence id="556">We visit there and they visited here. </sentence><sentence id="557">And they came to London. </sentence><sentence id="558">And there were probably oh -- not dozens -- there were many, many people that came to England. </sentence><sentence id="559">And that is amazing. </sentence><sentence id="560">I don't know, because I know the British have not always been wonderful, they were very difficult. </sentence><sentence id="561">We were in London at the time of Israel being established, and certainly the British were pretty bad about letting Jews into Israel. </sentence><sentence id="562">So we were just very lucky. </sentence><sentence id="563">We did have an -- my mother had an aunt there, her sis -- her mother's sister lived in England for many years. </sentence><sentence id="564">And so we actually lived with her for a little while until we got established in England. </sentence><sentence id="565">But that was not an easy time either, because it was wartime and the Blitz and everything else. </sentence><sentence id="566">But, you know, these are things that, as I got older, you know, I remembered more things about what happened and our evacuation and the bombings and going into the underground shelters. </sentence><sentence id="567">And so it was a difficult time, but as children, you sort of adapt to what it is. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="590">Q: We'll talk about -- more about the Blitz in a minute. </sentence><sentence id="591">Can you first tell us -- did you have other family members that stayed behind in Moravska? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="594">A: Yes. </sentence><sentence id="595">Well, actually, in Szinov. </sentence><sentence id="596">My two grandparents, my father's -- my father was an only child, and the only family we had were his parents. </sentence><sentence id="597">And we used to visit -- oh, that was something I forgot to mention. </sentence><sentence id="598">As a child, we used to go out to Szinov and they had a big garden with fruit. </sentence><sentence id="599">And we used to go and pick berries. </sentence><sentence id="600">So we had a -- really had a very nice childhood in the beginning. </sentence><sentence id="601">Well, it was pretty short. </sentence><sentence id="602">But they stayed there and, unfortunately -- well, maybe fortunately for him, my grandfather also passed away. </sentence><sentence id="603">But my grandmother, Ella, her name was Ella Brenner, his name was David Ginsberg, she did not survive and was killed by the Nazis. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="614">Q: Was she deported to a concentration camp or -- </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="615">A: Yes. </sentence><sentence id="616">But, actually, not from Czechoslovakia. </sentence><sentence id="617">Because of my mother's big -- my mother had a very big family as opposed to my father. </sentence><sentence id="618">She actually went to Krakow, and from there she was deported. </sentence><sentence id="619">And I don't know exactly where or when, but she was killed, as was my mother's mother. </sentence><sentence id="620">They were both killed by the Nazis, as were a couple of my mother's siblings and some children, so... </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="621">Q: If you -- we do some research here at the museum, so if you're interested in finding out more information, we might be able to look that up for you. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="625">Q: Okay. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="627">A: Her name was Ella Brenner -- well, Ginsberg. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="629">Q: Okay. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="631">A: And my other grandmother was Erlich, Eva Erlich, maiden name of Corow. ( </sentence><sentence id="632">ph) </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="633">Q: And I think after the recording, maybe if you can email me the information, and I'll pass it on to the researchers here. </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="634">A: Well, that would be very, very good. </sentence><sentence id="635">Yeah. </sentence><sentence id="636">My cousin, by the way, Zvi Barlev who ended up, besides writing the book, being with the Israeli Diplomatic Corp.He was -- after all he'd gone through, he was first secretary in London. </sentence><sentence id="637">Actually, it was in Buckingham Palace with the </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="638">Q:ueen. </sentence><sentence id="639">He was also first secretary in Sweden and lived in Stockholm for a while. </sentence><sentence id="640">He did a lot of research. </sentence><sentence id="641">And we, actually, you know, have a -- he put together a family tree. </sentence><sentence id="642">Not so much of my father's side like Ella Ginsberg, but of the Ehrlich side, which was my mother's maiden name. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="649">Q: Did you spend a lot of time with him growing up, or was he a different age? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="651">A; He was older. </sentence><sentence id="652">He was, you know, </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="653">Q:uite -- well, several years older, and not that much. </sentence><sentence id="654">Because he lived in Krakow, he visited us and we visited there. </sentence><sentence id="655">But it, you know -- a visit would be a short visit. </sentence><sentence id="656">But I've been very close to him. </sentence><sentence id="657">We've been to Israel now 26 or 27 times. </sentence><sentence id="658">And so, you know, we've been in touch. </sentence><sentence id="659">And they've been here. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="667">Q: Okay. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="669">A: Because he -- as I said, you probably can find the book at, you know, at the museum. </sentence><sentence id="670">So that -- but there are a lot of books that have been written, but, of course, this one was published -- I guess it was a self-publish thing by Vantage. </sentence><sentence id="671">And it did have a forward, actually, I think, by Elie Weisel even. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="675">Q: Okay. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="677">A: It was translated from the Hebrew, not only into English, but into Swedish and Norwegian. </sentence><sentence id="678">And so the book was in a few different places. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="681">Q: When you first came to London, did you live in an apartment there? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="683">A: No, we went to live with my great aunt. </sentence><sentence id="684">It was my grandmother's sister. </sentence><sentence id="685">We lived with her. </sentence><sentence id="686">She had a house at Six and Andrews Grove in Stamford Hills. </sentence><sentence id="687">And we lived with her because my father was in the hospital, as I said, with a heart attack. </sentence><sentence id="688">But once he recovered, then we moved into an apartment at Two Stamford Hill Mansion. </sentence><sentence id="689">And that's where we lived until -- I mean, we lived there the whole time, but I was -- we were evacuated part of the time. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="697">Q: Where did you go when you were evacuated? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="699">A: A village, which is now a bigger town, called Kennington, outside of Oxford. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="701">Q: Okay. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="703">A: Kennington -- </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="704">Q: Was that just you and your brother? </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="705">A: And my mother. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="707">Q: Okay. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="709">A: And my father used to come on the weekends. </sentence><sentence id="710">He would be working in the city. </sentence><sentence id="711">He was still working, he had his business. </sentence><sentence id="712">But terrible, terrible strains. </sentence><sentence id="713">Terrible strains, you know, trying to keep the family as safe as possible. </sentence><sentence id="714">In fact -- and I mentioned this to Ashley, but I will tell you, I guess, it was in 1940 things looked so bad in England. </sentence><sentence id="715">And we thought that -- the Germans had invaded everywhere -- that it looked like they might be coming into England, too. </sentence><sentence id="716">So my father, being the worrier that he was, said we're going -- we had an uncle in America. </sentence><sentence id="717">He said we're going to send the children to America. </sentence><sentence id="718">And we stood in line and applied for all the papers that you need for that and got everything and were scheduled to take a ship and go to -- actually, I think it was Canada, but then America. </sentence><sentence id="719">It left from Liverpool. </sentence><sentence id="720">And that ship was sunk, and, I think, 70 some odd children died on that and other people. </sentence><sentence id="721">But at the last minute, my father decided we're stick -- keep the family together. </sentence><sentence id="722">So even though we had all the papers to go, we didn't go. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="738">Q: So it would have just been your mother and you and your brother on the ship and he would have stayed in London? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="740">A: Actually, I think it would have just been the children, just my brother and I. You know, like -- it was like the Kindertransport, but it was a little different. </sentence><sentence id="741">You know, it was something that they were trying to arrange to get kids out of England when it looked very dangerous. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="744">Q: Okay. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="746">A: And I don't know about my mother at that point, but I do know that we had all the papers we needed. </sentence><sentence id="747">And then the discussion with the family and my father said, no, we're going to stay together. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="750">Q: Do you remember anything else about that, what he explained to you about first going on the ship? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="752">A: Right. </sentence><sentence id="753">He said, you know, I -- that the family needs to stay together, but we'll try and stay safe. </sentence><sentence id="754">And we did in those days of the Blitz. </sentence><sentence id="755">It's an amazing thing, Heather, but the kids used to like to go down into the Underground because they'd run around with all their friends. </sentence><sentence id="756">You know, children are amazing, I mean, how they adapt to different things. </sentence><sentence id="757">And we would go into the shelters, you know, when the sirens would go off. </sentence><sentence id="758">And then we'd be with other kids and other friends. </sentence><sentence id="759">And that -- they sort of learn to adapt to the situation. </sentence><sentence id="760">And it was interesting because a lot of schools closed. </sentence><sentence id="761">But there was one school that stayed open, and it happened to be a convent, a Catholic school. </sentence><sentence id="762">And, of course, I was Jewish, as were a number of my friends, and the convent allowed us to come. </sentence><sentence id="763">And not only allowed us to come to the school, but we had asked if when they had their catechism and everything else, could we have a Jewish teacher come in and they allowed us to do it. </sentence><sentence id="764">So for part of the time -- and I ended up with a very -- even though I was evacuated and in Kennington in a one- room schoolhouse with my brother, who was four years older than I was, and then coming back to London and going to the convent, by the time I came to America -- we're getting ahead of ourselves -- but I started high school. </sentence><sentence id="765">And because of the years of education I had, they put me in as a freshman. </sentence><sentence id="766">But after I was there for six months, I became an upper junior because of all the subjects we'd already had, even during the wartime. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="783">Q: Okay. </sentence><sentence id="784">And we'll talk more about that in a minute. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="787">A: I know. </sentence><sentence id="788">I'm sorry. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="791">Q: That's okay. </sentence><sentence id="792">Can you talk more about -- did you understand what was going on in London at the time? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="795">A: Yes. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="797">Q: What did you understand about that? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="799">A: We understood that the Germans were bombing and were hoping to come into England. </sentence><sentence id="800">And we really felt, maybe because where we came from -- the British may not have felt this way, maybe they felt a little stronger, you know, that no one is going to come in here. </sentence><sentence id="801">But after seeing what had happened in Europe, there were times that we really thought that the Germans would come in and invade Britain or London. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="805">Q: And did you understand why they wanted to come in? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="807">A: understood that Hitler wanted to rule the world and get rid of the Jews, one of the things that he wanted, one of the main things that he wanted. </sentence><sentence id="808">And the amazing thing is that somewhere or other they said that somewhere in his background there was some Jewish blood. </sentence><sentence id="809">And, you know, sometimes those -- you can get Jews sometimes that are so self -- not that he was Jewish, I'm not trying to say that. </sentence><sentence id="810">But they can be self-hating and worse than anyone else against the Jews. </sentence><sentence id="811">We did understand that, as Jews, we were very vulnerable. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="817">Q: And did you experience any anti-Semitism in London? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="819">A: Well, I know there was anti-Semitism. </sentence><sentence id="820">But when I think about my experience at the convent and the friends that I made and that -- one of the gals that was in my class actually became the mother superior, and I visited her on one of our many visits to London. </sentence><sentence id="821">I really had very positive feelings about, you know, how other people treated us. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="825">Q: How did you know that there was anti-Semitism if you didn't experience it yourself? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="827">A: Well, I imagine -- I knew what happened. </sentence><sentence id="828">Well, I didn't know at that time about things like the concentration camps. </sentence><sentence id="829">But I knew that -- that's a good </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="830">Q:uestion. </sentence><sentence id="831">I don't know. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="834">Q: Uh-huh. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="836">A: I don't know. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="838">Q: Okay. </sentence><sentence id="839">Maybe it was -- </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="840">A: But there definitely was anti-Semitism in London. </sentence><sentence id="841">I mean, I've read many things. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="844">You know, people resented the Jews coming in and taking jobs away and things like that. </sentence><sentence id="845">So I know that it definitely existed. </sentence><sentence id="846">But we happened to live in a very Jewish area. </sentence><sentence id="847">It's even more Jewish now than when we lived there, Stamford Hill. </sentence><sentence id="848">And so our friends with Jewish -- now, there was a Catholic school there, but we belonged to a synagogue and attended services and really participated in Jewish life there, again, celebrated the holidays. </sentence><sentence id="849">Friday nights my father would bring home people for dinner without even talking to my mother. </sentence><sentence id="850">So we'd always have guests at Friday night dinners. </sentence><sentence id="851">And things were rationed, but somehow we managed. </sentence><sentence id="852">In fact, I remember my parents never eating an egg because they wanted to give -- we got two eggs or something -- giving the eggs to, you know, to my brother and me. </sentence><sentence id="853">They figured we needed them more than they did. </sentence><sentence id="854">So we had, really, you know -- they were difficult times. </sentence><sentence id="855">And we certainly didn't have the same kind of life that we had in Czechoslovakia. </sentence><sentence id="856">My mother was not working. </sentence><sentence id="857">But, you know, she had to clean the house and clean the floors. </sentence><sentence id="858">And I'd help her, you know. </sentence><sentence id="859">So it was a different, different life, but still -- </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="860">Q: Was your father working? </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="861">A: Yes, my father was working. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="863">Q: And as a fur merchant or -- </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="864">A: Yeah, still in the fur business, yes. </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="865">Q: Do you remember anything else about that? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="867">A: He had a partner, I remember, Arpud, (ph) and must have done okay because, you know, we had food as much as we could, you know, with rationing. </sentence><sentence id="868">We had a kosher home. </sentence><sentence id="869">We were always -- </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="870">Q: So you managed to keep a kosher home? </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="871">A: Yes. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="873">Q: Uh-huh. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="875">A: Yes. </sentence><sentence id="876">Interestingly enough, and at least in London. </sentence><sentence id="877">And in Kennington, I have no idea because they had never seen a Jew before. </sentence><sentence id="878">And when we came there, they actually wanted to know if we had horns. </sentence><sentence id="879">And, again, my mother, ended up charming them. </sentence><sentence id="880">She'd invite them over and she'd bake strudel and stuff. </sentence><sentence id="881">And there we were billeted or lived with an Anglican minister in his house, you know, when we were evacuated, my mother, my brother, and I. And when my father came, he would stay there, too, and -- </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="882">Q: Was it just him or did he have a family? </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="883">A: No, he was single. </sentence><sentence id="884">His name was Reverend Williamson. </sentence><sentence id="885">And he particularly, I must say, liked me. </sentence><sentence id="886">That might sound difficult today. </sentence><sentence id="887">But as long as we lived in England, he would never forget my birthday. </sentence><sentence id="888">And he was very kind to us, too. </sentence><sentence id="889">So, you know, it's interesting, you know, with all the anti-Semitism going along, the people that we dealt with were very kind. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="897">Q: Did you meet a lot of other people in Kennington as well? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="899">A: Oh, yes, I did. </sentence><sentence id="900">We lived next to a girl who became one of my best friends there by the name of Marge Hoggnet. ( </sentence><sentence id="901">ph) I've lost touch with her. </sentence><sentence id="902">She eventually moved to America. </sentence><sentence id="903">But I -- I tried to locate her. </sentence><sentence id="904">Not Jewish, they were farmers. </sentence><sentence id="905">And they had chickens and they actually had sheep. </sentence><sentence id="906">And I actually helped with -- I didn't really help, but I was there and they let me do some sheering of sheep. </sentence><sentence id="907">And so it was, again, a different -- very nice people. </sentence><sentence id="908">And they -- a lot of it had to do with the way that my mother behaved and, I guess, the way we behaved. </sentence><sentence id="909">And we -- there was only a one- room schoolhouse, you know, where all the kids went to school together. </sentence><sentence id="910">As I said, I went to school with my brother, but -- who was four and a half years older than I was. </sentence><sentence id="911">But we had a schoolhouse. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="925">Q: Were you in the same class? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="927">A: Yes, it was just one room. </sentence><sentence id="928">Oh, yes, just one class. </sentence><sentence id="929">It was just one class. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="933">Q: So you went to school in Kennington and then a different school when you were in London? </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2179">Q: Actually, no, I'm a permanent staff member. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="2181">A Oh, okay. </sentence><sentence id="2182">Okay. </sentence><sentence id="2183">So -- but, you know, as you get more involved, whether it's with education or with jobs, you know, you don't have as much time for grandparents and families. </sentence><sentence id="2184">So whenever we have a chance -- we're actually heading to Israel in October for the 100th anniversary for Hadassah. </sentence><sentence id="2185">All of us are -- my mother and my daughter and my daughter-in-law, my granddaughter and | are all life members. </sentence><sentence id="2186">And right after that, it turns out that it's grandparents day at my twins" high school and they just started high school. </sentence><sentence id="2187">And so we're going right from Israel up to Santa Cruz so we can be there for that. </sentence><sentence id="2188">And we're also going up for Sukkot -- unfortunately, it's not as easy to get together for holidays. </sentence><sentence id="2189">All our children belong to synagogues, which makes me very happy that they're involved. </sentence><sentence id="2190">And what will happen with the next generation, I don't know. </sentence><sentence id="2191">But we took everyone to Israel a couple of years ago. </sentence><sentence id="2192">Actually, it was five years ago in 2007. </sentence><sentence id="2193">There were 14 of us that went. </sentence><sentence id="2194">So we feel it's very important, you know, for our family to know, know Israel and to know the history of the Jews and to be proud of who they are. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2209">Q: Have you also been back to Czechoslovakia? </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2240">Q: Thave not, no. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2242">A: Well, it's an absolutely, beautiful, beautiful city. </sentence><sentence id="2243">And a lot of Americans have gone there to work, young people, too. </sentence><sentence id="2244">So we have -- I have -- both my husband and I have been back. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2248">Q: I know you said you've also been back to London a lot, does that include Kennington? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2250">A:Yes, we did go back to Kennington and it really has changed. </sentence><sentence id="2251">I did find the house that we lived in and -- but it's become much more metropolitan. </sentence><sentence id="2252">You know, more of a little town or city compared to the country village that I remember. </sentence><sentence id="2253">It was really a real village. </sentence><sentence id="2254">You know, the people next door to us, you know, had sheep and chickens and Marge, their daughter, was my best friend. </sentence><sentence id="2255">And, you know, we used to play together all the time. </sentence><sentence id="2256">So I'm sorry that I lost contact with her. </sentence><sentence id="2257">One thing I try to do, I still have that -- you know, several friends that I went to school with at the convent that have visited me here and that I visited in London. </sentence><sentence id="2258">So we -- you know, we've kept -- we're still in touch. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2268">Q: Okay. </sentence><sentence id="2269">Is there anything else that you want to touch on about anything that we've covered that you think is really important that you want to add that I haven't asked you about? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2272">A: No. </sentence><sentence id="2273">I think, not only have you asked me things, that I probably, you know, said more about things than you wanted to know. </sentence><sentence id="2274">Actually, there was one little thing that I did mention to Ashley before, and that is a story of another cousin of my mother's who left Vienna and tried to go to Switzerland after Germany had already invaded. </sentence><sentence id="2275">And when she got to the border with Switzerland, she needed to go to the bathroom her name was Celia Summerville -- well, no, it was Celia Mohrer. </sentence><sentence id="2276">She later married and her name became Celia Summerville and she was an artist. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2282">Q: Can you spell her name for us? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2284">A: Celia, C-E-L-I-A, and Mohrer was what she was at the time that she left Vienna. </sentence></p><p><sentence id="2285">She was a very young woman. </sentence><sentence id="2286">M-O-H-R-E-R. And her parents were actually in </sentence></p><p><sentence id="2287"> London. </sentence><sentence id="2288">And my mother helped -- they were older and my mother helped take care of them because they were like an aunt and uncle of hers. </sentence><sentence id="2289">But when Celia left Vienna at the border, she needed to go to the bathroom and she got off the train. </sentence><sentence id="2290">And the Nazis got on the train and cleared off all the Jews. </sentence><sentence id="2291">And then she got back on the train and went into Switzerland. </sentence><sentence id="2292">And from there she came to live with us for a while in London, then she moved into her own place. </sentence><sentence id="2293">But she then moved to America and married a Summerville and they lived right near Harvard on Cambridge Street in Cambridge, Massachusetts. </sentence><sentence id="2294">And they had only one son, and he's -- he's a Ph. </sentence><sentence id="2295">D in epidemiology. </sentence><sentence id="2296">And she -- he was working in New Mexico, she moved there, we went to visit her, and then, you know, she passed away and he moved up to Alaska. </sentence><sentence id="2297">And this summer, he called me and said he was getting married, and could we come up to this little town of Palmer outside of Alaska so we went up there. </sentence><sentence id="2298">So just wanted to mention that to show you how family is so important, that my husband and I dropped everything that we had planned and decided to go back up there and we did. </sentence><sentence id="2299">And we went to the wedding and it was -- he was thrilled and his new wife was thrilled. </sentence><sentence id="2300">And we're very happy for him because now he has a whole family rather than being all alone. </sentence><sentence id="2301">And one other thing I do want to mention, you know, I told you about our really tremendous loss. </sentence><sentence id="2302">It was with me all the time, my oldest son. </sentence><sentence id="2303">His son just got out of the IDF in Israel. </sentence><sentence id="2304">He was in the Israeli army. </sentence><sentence id="2305">And that's another reason we're going to Israel in October. </sentence><sentence id="2306">Not only for the Hadassah's 100th anniversary, but also to see him and the rest of the family. </sentence><sentence id="2307">So that's something you didn't ask about maybe you wanted to know, but -- </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2308">Q: No, we like details. </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2309">A:But I just thought, you know, this -- the story of -- she was called Cilly, Celia. </sentence><sentence id="2310">It sounds -- C-I-L-L-Y. And she was wonderful young lady and I got to know her very well in London. </sentence><sentence id="2311">We have some of her paintings, which were exhibited at the Fogg Museum in Harvard. </sentence><sentence id="2312">And, so, you know, it's just important to stay close to family. </sentence><sentence id="2313">I hope you have a good family and -- </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2314">Q: Yes. </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2315">A:-- realize how important they are. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2321">Q: Did she realize what was going on and -- </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2322">A: No. </sentence><sentence id="2323">She got back on the train and didn't realize until she realized that all the people that were traveling with her or near her were gone. </sentence><sentence id="2324">You know, and then from Switzerland she came to England and she stayed with us for a little while. </sentence><sentence id="2325">And then </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="2330">   she, you know, moved into her own apartment, and, you know, did different things, but -- </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2331">Q: Did she know what happened to the Jews that were taken off the train? </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2332">A:No. </sentence><sentence id="2333">No. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2336">Q: Okay. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2338">A:No. </sentence><sentence id="2339">I don't think there'd be any way, you know, of knowing. </sentence><sentence id="2340">But -- and I can't even really tell you what exactly what year it was, because we were already in London when she came. </sentence><sentence id="2341">And she came through Switzerland. </sentence><sentence id="2342">But, you know, this was another one of these stories, sort of like the one about the ship we were supposed to be on that -- you know, it's just by chance that we're here. </sentence><sentence id="2343">And that's why it's so important to do the best that you can with your life as long as you can. </sentence><sentence id="2344">Which sometimes isn't as long as you want, but, you try. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2352">Q: Yes. </sentence><sentence id="2353">Okay. </sentence><sentence id="2354">I'm going to stop the recording now. </sentence></p></dialogue>
