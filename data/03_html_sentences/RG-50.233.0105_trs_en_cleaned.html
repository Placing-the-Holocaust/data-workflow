<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="5">Q: And he wasn't your pet mouse? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="7">A: No. </sentence><sentence id="8">I don't know where the mouse came from. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="11">Q: Did you have any pets? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="13">A: No, I didn't, no. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="15">Q: Hobbies? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="17">A: No, not really. </sentence><sentence id="18">By the time I, you know, 1933 was not very far away, I was four years old, and the little kids in the street very quickly stopped playing with us and would rather beat us up, so there was very little time for hobbies. </sentence><sentence id="19">It was more a question of protection. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="23">Q: Did any of the kids ever beat you up? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="25">A: Oh yeah, quite frequently and I learned to run as fast as my little legs could carry me. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="27">Q: You mentioned that there were very few Jews in this town and I imagine half of them were relatives. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="29">A: Not really. </sentence><sentence id="30">I think we, my brother and I, and another girl were the only children that I can remember. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="33">Q: And you had at least one uncle. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="35">A: Yes, but he didn't live in that same town. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="37">Q: No? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="39">A: Yeah. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="41">Q: Okay. </sentence><sentence id="42">Did you ever get to go to school? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="45">A: Yes. </sentence><sentence id="46">I started school when I was six, which I guess means 1935, and went to school for about two years, till --- or perhaps it was three, I'm not sure. </sentence><sentence id="47">No, it was two years. </sentence><sentence id="48">Till they prohibited Jewish kids from going to the public schools. </sentence><sentence id="49">And I was then enrolled in a Jewish operated school in Heidelberg. </sentence><sentence id="50">And every morning | had to get up about six and take a train all by myself to go to Heidelberg and in the evening I returned home. </sentence><sentence id="51">I did this for one or two years, well until the Kristallnacht, and then I think that school closed. </sentence><sentence id="52">One or two years, yeah. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="61">Q: How was it like going to school as one of the few Jewish kids? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="63">A: I don't have very much memory of the school, except that there was a lot of persecution. </sentence><sentence id="64">I was asked to leave the room when they talked about Nazi indoctrination, which of course made us little Jewish boys stick out like a sore thumb. </sentence><sentence id="65">And of course, whenever the kids could catch me This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="66">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="67"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection they would either push me into the --- some --- the embankment that fell up from the road, or beat me up otherwise --- anything they could do. </sentence><sentence id="68">Recently, I returned to Germany. </sentence><sentence id="69">This is an aside. </sentence><sentence id="70">And the seminary student, who is 28 years old wrote a thesis on the life of the Jewish community in this town. </sentence><sentence id="71">And he found a lot of details about the history of the community, and myself and my family, and so on. </sentence><sentence id="72">Things that I didn't know, I had forgotten. </sentence><sentence id="73">And, in fact, he found my school records. </sentence><sentence id="74">And I had forgotten all my grades, but I can tell you they were terrible. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="89">Q: You were a terrible student? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="91">A: Well, it's not surprising. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="93">Q: Or, how did the teachers treat you? </sentence><sentence id="94">That was my next question, anyway. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="97">A: How what? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="99">Q: How did the teachers treat you? </sentence><sentence id="100">Sometimes people had terrible grades but they were good students. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="103">A: Well, I really don't remember. </sentence><sentence id="104">I think all the teachers were Nazis, ultimately. </sentence><sentence id="105">Otherwise I don't think they could teach. </sentence><sentence id="106">And I think as long as he had to put up with me he did, and when I was prohibited from attending, I guess --- I really don't know. </sentence><sentence id="107">But I was surprised to find my grades after about 50 years, you know. </sentence><sentence id="108">Wasn't particularly paramount on my mind. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="115">Q: No. </sentence><sentence id="116">Even then. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="119">A: I have the piece of paper, if you want to look at it. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="121">Q: That piece, his thesis, oh, the book, the research. </sentence><sentence id="122">That would be interesting. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="125">A: It's quite amazing. </sentence><sentence id="126">It's quite an experience to meet these Germans. </sentence><sentence id="127">In fact, it's something I'd like to talk to you about later. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="131">Q: The rest of the town, were they, uh, was it more of a Protestant town or a Catholic town? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="133">A: I don't know what the percentages was, but I have the impression it was maybe 80/20 Protestant, but I can't tell you. </sentence><sentence id="134">There was one church each, of course. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="137">Q: Did you have any, | hesitate to say friends, but any non-Jewish acquaintances? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="139">A: Yeah. </sentence><sentence id="140">I don't remember really playing with any particular kids. </sentence><sentence id="141">When you ask that question, the image comes to mind of the first funeral I went to. </sentence><sentence id="142">One of the non-Jewish kids died of something and the whole class, I was still in the public school, went to the funeral. </sentence><sentence id="143">The first time I've ever been in the cemetery. </sentence><sentence id="144">And I vividly remember the open grave and the casket in it and every kid was supposed to go by and drop a flower on top of this casket. </sentence><sentence id="145">And I was so scared, I just couldn't do it. </sentence><sentence id="146">That's all Iremember. </sentence><sentence id="147">Now whether this kid was a particular friend of mine, I don't know. </sentence><sentence id="148">I don't have any vivid memory of ever really playing, or really having a good time to tell you the truth. </sentence><sentence id="149">I, or perhaps I and my brother, but my brother was so much younger, were always too busy fleeing from being attacked. </sentence><sentence id="150">I remember the streets were This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="151">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="152"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection full of pretty large rocks. </sentence><sentence id="153">These were not paved roads, they were dirt roads with rock over them. </sentence><sentence id="154">And I always had bloody knees because I always kept stumbling and falling as the kids would pursue me or they would throw rocks. </sentence><sentence id="155">They were very handy little missiles, you know, pick them off the floor and start throwing. </sentence><sentence id="156">So my memories were not particularly happy ones in that town. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="177">Q: These were kids that were roughly your age? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="179">A: Yeah, of course. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="181">Q: You didn't have teenagers for example going after you? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="183">A: No, they didn't bother with me. </sentence><sentence id="184">Not that I remember. </sentence><sentence id="185">I think that some of the older people in town, in the time of higher excitement, particularly after, maybe Hitler made a speech, and we would venture out in the street, in those days they still had horses and wagons, you know. </sentence><sentence id="186">I remember vividly one particular man who lived close by coming down that street on a wagon and taking his, what do you call this thing that you hit horses with? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="191">Q: The whip. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="193">A: Yeah. </sentence><sentence id="194">Take the whip and try to catch me walking in the street. </sentence><sentence id="195">You know, with the whip. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="199">Q: Crack the whip. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="201">A: Cracking --- </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="203">Q: Cracking the whip in your direction? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="205">A: No, not in my direction. </sentence><sentence id="206">He hit me. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="209">Q: He got you? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="211">A: Yeah. </sentence><sentence id="212">But I think in general that, kind of, was the exception. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="215">Q: It must have been lonely not having many kids your age that you could play with? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="217">A: I guess so. </sentence><sentence id="218">I really don't have any strong memories of that. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="221">Q: How were you informed that you could no longer go to this public school? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="223">A: I don't remember. </sentence><sentence id="224">| think just that one day, I think, my parents told me I was going to Heidelberg to continue school. </sentence><sentence id="225">And they would buy me a ticket, a monthly commuter ticket, just like the Long Island Railroad. </sentence><sentence id="226">And every morning, I would end up on that train with a school bag on my back and a big thermos bottle in the school bag with the books, that was my lunch. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="231">Q: Did you know any Nazis? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="233">A: Well I think the village was full of them. </sentence><sentence id="234">And based on what this fellow wrote in his thesis, This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="235">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="236"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection more recently, apparently, he tried to interview some of them even as late as last year. </sentence><sentence id="237">They threatened him with mayhem if he kept up the research. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="244">Q: There are Nazis still in hold? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="246">A: Of course we observed many of the, we saw many of the Nazi festivals, and so on, going on. </sentence><sentence id="247">But, you know, the Nazis were, as usual, disciplined, and they would only take over the action when it was sanctioned like, Kristallnacht, and so on and so forth. </sentence><sentence id="248">Otherwise, because, presumably, my father --- not presumably, but my father was a soldier in World War I. He had somewhat higher stature, if you like, in hierarchy of how they were treating the Jews and some others. </sentence><sentence id="249">Of course in the final analysis it didn't do him any good. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="254">Q: And your father was in the German army in World War I? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="256">A: Yeah, he was in the German army for four years. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="258">Q: A decorated veteran? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="260">A: Yeah, he had a cross of this, a cross of that, which I remember he dramatically threw at the Gestapo agent when they eventually deported us. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="262">Q: In 1940? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="264">A: In 1940. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="266">Q: "This may come as a surprise to you but you were a privileged child because your father was a war veteran --- </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="268">A: Is that really ---? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="270">Q: -- Apparently you were able to go to public school longer than the other kids. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="272">A: Was that so? </sentence><sentence id="273">I had no idea. </sentence><sentence id="274">I see. </sentence><sentence id="275">A little distinction. </sentence><sentence id="276">Yeah, they did make a little distinction. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="282">Q: Yes, two or three years. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="284">A: Yes and I remember when the --- after the Kristallnacht, he was arrested and he was sent to Dachau like most of the males, if not all of them. </sentence><sentence id="285">He was privileged. </sentence><sentence id="286">He was let out four weeks afterwards and some other people had to wait a little bit longer. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="290">Q: So he was able to return home after this first trip? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="292">A: Yeah, well I think most of them returned home. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="294">Q: Yeah, what was his crime? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="296">A: His crime? </sentence><sentence id="297">I guess being a Jew. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="300">Q: Being a Jew, that was it, right? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="302"> This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="303">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="304"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection </sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="305">A: Of course. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="307">Q: He hadn't done a thing. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="309">A: Well all the males were arrested, after the Kristallnacht so the reason, I don't know what they are, logical, or if they needed any. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="311">Q: You remember Kristallnacht fairly well? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="313">A: Yeah, but before we talk about it, I'd like to tell you one incident which was --- and I don't remember what year it was. </sentence><sentence id="314">We lived in this little town called Humfenheim, essentially an agricultural town. </sentence><sentence id="315">In those days some farmers still lived upstairs and the cows lived downstairs. </sentence><sentence id="316">I mean that's how close they were. </sentence><sentence id="317">And, the regional town called Sinsheim is about four kilometers from there. </sentence><sentence id="318">And for some reason or another, my brother and I were walking to Sinsheim I don't remember why, and one of the pleasures along that road was that the road was lined on both sides with apple trees. </sentence><sentence id="319">It must have been the time when the apples were just about ripened, but they weren't ripe yet. </sentence><sentence id="320">And to this day I love green apples. </sentence><sentence id="321">We ate a lot of green apples as we walked along that national road, a two-lane road. </sentence><sentence id="322">And we'd take a bite out of the apple and we would throw the rest of the apple at whatever car was speeding by. </sentence><sentence id="323">We would miss most of them but this particular car, we hit right smack on the door and the whole apple splattered. </sentence><sentence id="324">The car came to a grinding halt, backed up, and it turns out that the apple had hit the SS sign of this particular car which was on the road. </sentence><sentence id="325">And the SS guy comes out of the car. " </sentence><sentence id="326">Who threw the apple?" </sentence><sentence id="327">And we both denied it, and of course he knew we were lying. </sentence><sentence id="328">He took our name and didn't say anything more. </sentence><sentence id="329">That night we came home and our father says, "I had a call... I was visited by the police. </sentence><sentence id="330">What did you guys do? </sentence><sentence id="331">You were throwing apples." " </sentence><sentence id="332">We weren't throwing apples." </sentence><sentence id="333">And he hit us across the face, I can still... </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="355">Q: You lied to your father? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="357">A: I lied to my father. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="359">Q: He believed the SS over you? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="361">A: Well, I was so scared. </sentence><sentence id="362">I remember that very vividly. </sentence><sentence id="363">So when you say did I encounter any Nazis, well that was a very close encounter. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="367">Q: That's a very close encounter. </sentence><sentence id="368">SS. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="371">A: I would guess it was 1938. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="373">Q: After you had stopped going to public school? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="375">A: Probably, yeah, probably. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="377">Q: And you didn't know it was an SS car? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="379">A: No, no, we would throw apples at any car. </sentence><sentence id="380">This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="381">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="382"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="387">Q: You hit the jackpot. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="389">A: Yeah. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="391">Q: Did your father have any non-Jewish customers, I would think? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="393">A: I presume he did, as long as it was all right to buy from a Jewish shop. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="395">Q: Do you recall how his business fared after the Nazis came to power? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="397">A: Well, I think it quickly went to pot, but I don't really remember the details, really, I had very little to do with the store. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="399">Q: So you wouldn't know whether there was boycotts? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="401">A: No. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="403">Q: Shunning and so on? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="405">A: No, I really don't know. </sentence><sentence id="406">I think it probably followed the typical German history of this time. </sentence><sentence id="407">These villages were surprisingly proactive. </sentence><sentence id="408">And based on what this fellow, recently has told me, it's still true. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="413">Q: In general, the Nazis were much more popular and stronger in the small towns. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="415">A: Oh is that so, I see, I didn't realize that. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="417">Q: The smaller the more likely... </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="419">A: Oh. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="421">Q: Big cities tended to be Red. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="423">A: Yeah, well because everybody knew everybody and of course the Jews stuck out like a sore thumb I suppose. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="425">Q: Even though there weren't very many Jews. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="427">A: No, but at least you knew who they were, and of course... An interesting incident that this guy told me. </sentence><sentence id="428">There's a bakery there in this village, today, and would you believe that every Friday they bake and sell challah? </sentence><sentence id="429">And he told me that they do this because I guess the Christian population loved the challah, even though it was Jewish bread, right. </sentence><sentence id="430">And today, they have forgotten what the history, he told me, they forgotten the history of why is this bread baked the way it is. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="435">Q: And when. </sentence><sentence id="436">And when. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="439">A: Yeah. </sentence><sentence id="440">This generation at least, has forgotten. </sentence><sentence id="441">It is amazing. </sentence><sentence id="442">This is a verbatim transcript of spoken word. </sentence><sentence id="443">It is not the primary source, and it has not been checked for spelling or accuracy. </sentence><sentence id="444"> http://collections.ushmm.org Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about this collection </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="451">Q: And yet they do it on Friday. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="453">A: Oh yes, yeah, for the weekend, in other words. </sentence><sentence id="454">That's amazing I thought...here is archeology in action while I'm still alive. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="457">Q: Do any other incidents leap to your mind? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="459">A: From that time? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="461">Q: Yes. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="463">A: Well, one memory is the...all of these villages had communal gardens... and if you didn't, most people didn't have a lot of land on their own, they lived in these villages, you could get a little plot from the community, raise your own vegetables and of course, you take that home. </sentence><sentence id="464">And I remember my mother working in this communal garden, you know. </sentence><sentence id="465">And we, as kids, would go to the local river which flows right by, which when I look at it now is about three feet wide, at that time it looked terrifying, and take water out and put it in the garden. </sentence><sentence id="466">I'm still afraid of water because we used to swim in this water, or try to, and the other kids would like to drown us. </sentence><sentence id="467">And I'm still terrified of the water. </sentence><sentence id="468">In fact, I'm a very poor swimmer, I think as a result of that. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="475">Q: You live on Long Island? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="477"> A? </sentence><sentence id="478">Yeah. </sentence><sentence id="479">Incidents, and Iam a sailor too. </sentence><sentence id="480">I...One winter, we, I had some sort like a snow- suit on, very warmly dressed, it was very cold there. </sentence><sentence id="481">And in the kitchen we had a cooking stove which was fired, I think, by coal or wood, probably coal. </sentence><sentence id="482">And a big pot of soup was bubbling away. </sentence><sentence id="483">Someone accidently turned that soup over and it landed on my leg. </sentence><sentence id="484">I got a tremendous burn over here. </sentence><sentence id="485">This was the time when Jews couldn't receive medical attention from non-Jewish doctors and there was no Jewish doctor in this town. </sentence><sentence id="486">And I almost died because they...Eventually the doctor that delivered me in 1929 who came from another little town, this Sisnheim I was talking about, snuck into the house at night and provided some limited amount of medical attention.. I remember that particular incident. </sentence><sentence id="487">Of course I'm carrying that scar around </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="500">Q: Was he a Jewish doctor? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="502">A: No, he was not. </sentence><sentence id="503">He was a Christian doctor. </sentence><sentence id="504">I don't remember his name but he was a nice guy. </sentence><sentence id="505">I remember a time, you probably know the year, when they insisted that all of the Jewish boys and girls get a Jewish identity card. </sentence><sentence id="506">When is that "38? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="512">Q: 38. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1864">A: Isee. </sentence><sentence id="1865">I see. </sentence><sentence id="1866">So what we saw more of was the (?) </sentence><sentence id="1867">taking revenge on the local French, particularly, I remember rather vividly the women who had so-called fraternized with the French, getting their hair shorn, that was more prominent. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1872">Q: Those were the quite fortunate ones. </sentence></p></dialogue>
