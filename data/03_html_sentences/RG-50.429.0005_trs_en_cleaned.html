<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="237">Q: As a family did you talk about this, did you try to make sense of it? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="239">A: I don't remember that really. </sentence><sentence id="240">I think we were just into ourselves more or less, you know everybody was worrying on their own but I don't think it was discussed all that much until I finally decided that this was no life, you know so, in from the spring of 1933 then finally in the, in the fall, I said I have to get out of here, I can't live like this. </sentence><sentence id="241">And I, I decided to go to England then and my parents agreed to it that I would go to England because it was a life of just vegetating. </sentence><sentence id="242">And talking about the same thing over, what is going to happen to us. </sentence><sentence id="243">Talking the same thing over and over again and not to come to any result. </sentence><sentence id="244">I mean nobody would know, knew what, what was going to happen. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="357">Q: ...to backtrack...alternative outlets... </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="359">A: We made our own alternative outlets. </sentence><sentence id="360">We tried of course I was being in the torn in the direction of sports, as I said before, we played music and we tried to entertain ourselves as well as we could. </sentence><sentence id="361">But sports for me of course was the, the thing I wanted the most. </sentence><sentence id="362">So a farmer let us have an old potato field and we tried to make it smooth, you know it's very rough, you know big clumps on there and we tried to, to smooth it out and we started our own Jewish hand ball team on there, hand ball is a game like soccer except that you don't kick the ball. </sentence><sentence id="363">You dribble it like a basketball and you pass it you know throwing it and it's a great game. </sentence><sentence id="364">And I coached all the fellows on the team and I was the only girl on the team and I shot the only goal in the first time when we lost 7 to 1. </sentence><sentence id="365">And we also tried to straighten out, next to the Jewish school there was a, a yard and we tried to straighten that out to do calisthenics on it. </sentence><sentence id="366">Because the soccer field was a, the handball field was a little bit out of the way so we tried to straighten that out but we had to fight the teachers" chickens and they used that same place for their activities and it was not very appetizing so we gave up on that pretty fast. ( </sentence><sentence id="367">Technical adjustment) </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="377">Q: Were there Jewish sporting clubs? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="379">A: There were Jewish sporting clubs. </sentence><sentence id="380">Maccabee they called it, but it was a Zionistic outfit and it was like the National League and the American League in baseball. </sentence><sentence id="381">They didn't get along with, with the other Jewish athletes so they, they called them the RFJ was people who fought in the first world war, they, they were the veterans they started this club for athletics and they were able in some towns to rent or even buy I don't know stadiums where Jews could, could practice on but the facilities were pretty poor, pretty terrible but as I said we tried to do as much as we could to entertain ourselves and there was no, no coach capable of, you know anybody who was a little bit more of advanced like I was to tell me what, how to do it and what to do and it was just a very, very bad time. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="385">Q: Jewish clubs, were they already in operation or were they formed in reaction? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="387">A: I think they were mostly formed after the, as I said the Maccabee, they were formed before already but the uh, veterans of foreign wars I think they called themselves, that, that came afterwards. </sentence><sentence id="388">You know in all the towns almost especially in the bigger towns, they, they start a movement so Jews would have a place to go to and and, and do sports. </sentence><sentence id="389">9    10 </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="393">Q: What kind of facilities were they? </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="399">Q: So this made it difficult for the Jewish athletes to really improve or be competitive? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="401">A: Oh yes. </sentence><sentence id="402">Oh yes. </sentence><sentence id="403">I mean it was, it was very bad to, to really achieve something spectacular because it was just, it's it was a poor condition and no coaching. </sentence><sentence id="404">That was, that was, that was bad too. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="415">A: OK. </sentence><sentence id="416">The day I won the British Championship was a fabulous day for me because I felt such pride in myself that I was able to do that because the Germans had told me I'm inferior, I'm no good, you know. </sentence><sentence id="417">And all of a sudden here I am the British champion, champion. </sentence><sentence id="418">And I was hoping that somehow word would go back to Germany so they would find out that I did this. </sentence><sentence id="419">And my father had come over to watch me, I thought. </sentence><sentence id="420">I thought he, that was the reason for his trip, trip to watch me compete but on the way back from the stadium, we found out differently. </sentence><sentence id="421">My, he didn't tell me right away. </sentence><sentence id="422">He waited until we got back to his hotel. </sentence><sentence id="423">But on the way back there, there were newspapers being hawked in the street and everything seemed like to be big excitement. </sentence><sentence id="424">We asked the taxi driver what's going on. </sentence><sentence id="425">And he said has something to do with the Nazis killing each other off. </sentence><sentence id="426">So we stopped the taxi and we got out, got the newspaper and it told the story about Hitler having killed off his best friend, plus about a thousand of his Nazi people because they, they complained about something and he wanted to show you. </sentence><sentence id="427">You just didn't do that. </sentence><sentence id="428">You did as you were told and when we thought that this might have been the beginning of the end for Hitler we couldn't have been more wrong because Hitler by killing off these people let everybody know if you want to stay alive, don't be a hero. </sentence><sentence id="429">So we got to the hotel (clears throat) excuse me. </sentence><sentence id="430">And there my father finally told me that I had to go back to Germany and the reason he could not write to me or tell me on the telephone was because there was this strict censorship of everything coming into Germany or going out of Germany. </sentence><sentence id="431">And he couldn't have dared to tell me that unless I came back the family was being threatened you know. </sentence><sentence id="432">Tell her to come back or else. </sentence><sentence id="433">So of course I decided immediately to go home, especially in view of what happened to Hitler's pals. </sentence><sentence id="434">If he can kill of his own people, what is he going to, to 10    11 a Jew who says no. </sentence><sentence id="435">And I went back, I think within a week I was back in Germany which was very, very hard to accept. </sentence><sentence id="436">I was supposed to be a member of the German Olympic team and that was something I couldn't understand and didn't understand for a very long time. </sentence><sentence id="437">I think I didn't understand it until I came over here and saw all the newspaper articles that had been written about my involvement with this time. </sentence><sentence id="438">The only reason I was supposed to be on that Olympic team was because the Americans, and the English and the French and a lot of the other nations threatened not to come to the 1936 Olympics due to the discrimination of the Jews. </sentence><sentence id="439">And Hitler wanted to make this the best Olympics ever. </sentence><sentence id="440">He used it as a propaganda vehicle, and he wanted of course the United States and all the big nations to be there. </sentence><sentence id="441">And this was the, the ruse that they used. </sentence><sentence id="442">I was the pigeon to help him get the 1936 Olympics settled and in Berlin. </sentence><sentence id="443">They were already making, building and change, you know making a stadium and everything but they were really afraid that the, that it would not be a good Olympics for them because the big nations weren't going to show up and that would take away from the, from the, from the games of course. </sentence><sentence id="444">So that's how I got on the German Olympic team and it was tough. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="591">A: When I got back to Germany I was hoping I would at least have a place where I could train. </sentence><sentence id="592">But the fact that I was a member of the German Olympic team did not allow me to use any of the stadiums. </sentence><sentence id="593">I was still a Jew and was not allowed to use any of this. </sentence><sentence id="594">So I had to use the poor facilities of the Jewish clubs and compete there for them. </sentence><sentence id="595">And that was, was absolutely terrible because first of all there was no competition whatsoever. </sentence><sentence id="596">If you don't have any competition it's, you have to only fight yourself and that's much harder than somebody you know if there's stiff competition you try to outdo each other. </sentence><sentence id="597">But when there's no competition it's very hard so I always had to fight myself and it was really very, very tough. </sentence><sentence id="598">And then of course all those stupid questions I have to answer. </sentence><sentence id="599">You know everybody asked me are you going to be in the Olympics. </sentence><sentence id="600">You know what are you going to do. </sentence><sentence id="601">I was a nervous wreck I think and day and night, things were on my mind. </sentence><sentence id="602">It was really horrible. </sentence><sentence id="603">And my parents and I we didn't discuss it because I knew they were worried about it and they knew I was worried about it so we didn't talk about it. </sentence><sentence id="604">Because we, we didn't want to hurt each other's feelings I suppose so it, it was very, very hard. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="619">Q: How does one train for the Olympics if you're not on the same playing field... </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="621">A: I was ordered three times, four times in those two years to go to an Olympic training course and that's the only solid training I had for the Olympics and as I said before, I think I said it before that I was a natural athlete and if I hadn't been a, a natural athlete I don't think I would have achieved what I did because there just wasn't any, any opportunity for me, for me to, to get better or to advance or to know what I was doing, it just happened naturally. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="623">Q: ...1f there had been good Jewish athletes...they wouldn't have had an opportunity to progress and be competitive with the German athletes. </sentence><sentence id="624">Is that true? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="627">A: There were very few Jewish athletes who really were capable to compete on a national level. </sentence><sentence id="628">I mean there were, the best Jewish athletes let's say, but they weren't the best German athletes. </sentence><sentence id="629">And they really, really couldn't compare, they were very, very few and there were some for instance in the Olympics, there was a fencer Helena Myer, she was half Jewish, they let her compete, I guess half Jewish was only half as offensive as being all Jewish. </sentence><sentence id="630">And there were some half Jewish athletes that competed--one in, in ice hockey so he, he melted into the, you know into the team so he wouldn't stick out like I would have stuck out. </sentence><sentence id="631">But I don't think there were any Jewish athletes really that were capable of be, competing on, on a national level. </sentence><sentence id="632">13    14 </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="639">Q: ...the backing to get better. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="641">A: No, the, the Germans did another number. </sentence><sentence id="642">They you know every time there were some newspaper articles written that they're not holding up their end of our, that they finally signed a commitment that they would not discriminate against Jewish athletes. </sentence><sentence id="643">They, they wrote it down and but there were all these newspaper articles that they were not living up to their commitment, that they wouldn't let me compete in the German national championship. </sentence><sentence id="644">And they said well she was not entitled to compete in that because she was not a member of the German track and field association. </sentence><sentence id="645">And why wasn't I member, because I was Jewish. </sentence><sentence id="646">And so you know it was like a dog chasing it's tail. </sentence><sentence id="647">And so it, they had, they had all kinds of, of, of ways to talk themselves out of it. </sentence><sentence id="648">They for instance, in 1935 for instance they got a little scared again so they called all the best Jewish athletes for a training course, an Olympic training course. </sentence><sentence id="649">| said in an article once, I think Snow White and the seven dwarfs would have done just as well as those athletes because they weren't any good. </sentence><sentence id="650">I happened to meet my husband there, that was the best part about this training course, really. </sentence><sentence id="651">But they really weren't good enough but it was just a sham by, by the Germans to show well we, we're trying to find new talent for the Olympics in the Jewish community but it, that was all baloney. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="663">Q: Did you learn anything there... </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="665">A: Well there was a very good coach there and but I think what he told me I knew already, you know by then this is 1935 already and the Olympics were the following year and I did very well all along and in the training courses I always outdid the, my the other you know in, in not the Jewish one but in the other one. </sentence><sentence id="666">I always did better than, than the other, than the German girls and whenever I competed which only happened three times I think in the, in the 2 years, I always beat them. </sentence><sentence id="667">Even though I only once did I have good competition, girls that were also going into the Olympics. </sentence><sentence id="668">The other times I think I jumped about 15 inches higher than the next best and you know there was no, I had no competition in that respect and in the Jewish competitions also. </sentence><sentence id="669">But the, the Germans always kept an eye out. </sentence><sentence id="670">Whenever I was competing someplace, there was always somebody watching out, for the, for the Nazis to make sure if I did poorly, they would have kicked me off the team immediately I'm sure. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="677">Q: ...equanimity from the officials and from the coaches. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="679">A: The coaches treated me very well, I mean they saw and listen not everybody was a, was a Nazi you know. </sentence><sentence id="680">And that they treated me very well and they liked me it seems but the officials whenever I had to compete at the, at, they were, they were hostile, I think they were hostile towards me. </sentence><sentence id="681">At one time I saw this fellow who was a member of my former club. </sentence><sentence id="682">I knew him as well as I know myself. </sentence><sentence id="683">He looked through me like I didn't exist. </sentence><sentence id="684">He didn't say hello. </sentence><sentence id="685">He didn't, you know I 14    15 was just not, non -- existent. </sentence><sentence id="686">And at that competition they tried, I mean the officials are supposed to be neutral. </sentence><sentence id="687">They tried to teach the other girls how to you know, how they could beat me. </sentence><sentence id="688">They didn't do that, of course, they couldn't because they weren't good enough. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="700">Q: That must have been hurtful. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="702">A: Yes, but it, it made me better because I was so full of rage, the madder I got, the better I jumped and the Germans didn't know that of course, otherwise they might have treated me a little better. </sentence><sentence id="703">But I was so, so absolutely enraged about everything, you know, the whole, the whole thing these whole two years that I, the madder I got, the better I did. </sentence><sentence id="704">And that was, that was wonderful. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="708">Q: So rage was your motivator. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="722">Q: ...was there a qualifying process? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="724">A: Well for instance the um German track and field championships, they were supposed to be one of the events that would show who was going to be taken into consideration for the Olympics but they wouldn't let me compete because it's, I was not a member of the German track and field association so I couldn't compete, but they, they, they at one time I, I had to compete in Munich which was the scariest thing because Munich was the hot bed of, of Nazism. </sentence><sentence id="725">That was where Hitler lived there and I was scared stiff to go there and I didn't do that well and it was noted, duly noted by the Nazis that I only jumped a, a meter 53 instead of better but I beat still, beat the competition by about 15 inches. </sentence><sentence id="726">But I didn't do as well because I think I was mentally a wreck at the time. </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="730">Q: Were there other qualifying matches? </sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="732">A: The gentile com, the gentile girls who were supposed to go into the Olympics they had their own meets which I was not, not admitted and I think the whole deal was just if I did fairly well they would not throw me out because they were still afraid that the boycott would happen so I think no matter what I did, I was pretty safe at that point, even the, you know in Munich when I did not do too well, they couldn't, they couldn't afford to throw me out at that point because they were still afraid the Americans wouldn't show up. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="747">A: When I came back from England I went to Stuttgart a couple of times during the month, because there the Jewish club had a stadium and they had invited me to come and use that stadium so I happened to learn about a school, a not a Jewish school it was a gentile owned school that for physical education, it was a private school, not a university. </sentence><sentence id="748">And I thought I'll, Pll apply and see if they take me, fine. </sentence><sentence id="749">If they don't take me fine too and they did take me because they might have got, they, they had to get permission from the government that they could accept a Jew and I suppose that it was all in view of my being an Olympic candidate and had they not let me go into that school, it might have come out into the other countries and there might have been more, more problems for, for, for the Olympics for Germany. </sentence><sentence id="750">So they accepted me and it, I had a good time there, we were all very friendly, the girls were all very friendly there and it was a big town and I could go in the afternoon after they were finished practicing we would go into this cafe and make pigs out of ourselves, eating whipped cream cake and everything and we had a terrific time there. </sentence><sentence id="751">And we were very friendly and it was nice. </sentence><sentence id="752">The only thing they would, they would prevent me, they, the curriculum had in it German gymnastics and they wouldn't let me take part in the German gymnastics, now why I don't know. </sentence><sentence id="753">Because the Jew and the German gymnastics that was too, too much of a paradox I don't know. </sentence><sentence id="754">But the other girls, we just laughed about it. </sentence><sentence id="755">We thought it was funny and by then I was so used to being excluded that it wasn't such a big deal. </sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1250">A: Any boycott that would have happened would have influenced only the Olympic games that it would not have been the huge success that Hitler expected from it but Hitler and Nazis they would have gone on no matter what, even if only one other country would have shown up to, to participate in the Olympics. </sentence><sentence id="1251">I don't think it had anything to do with what he wanted to accomplish. </sentence><sentence id="1252">He wanted to conquer the world and he, he, he would have gone forward no matter what. </sentence><sentence id="1253">And I don't think that the Olympics in that respect had anything to do with it. </sentence></p></dialogue>
